to meet the bonding requirements of a b iii and e,new phoenix posted eight bonds issued by great american and one bond issued by washington international to cover the seven entries.each of the five great american bonds relevant to this appeal was for and was signed by james davis,an agent of great american.davis signed the bonds,and the government accepted them,even though at least one copy of the form that great american filed with customs for davis customs form,dated may,filed pursuant to g indicated a limit of million on davis authority.on november,several months after new phoenix obtained its last bond from davis and made the associated entry,great american filed a new form revoking davis power of attorney.

discussion 
the government seeks postjudgment interest as well as both statutory and equitable prejudgment interest in its appeal from the denial of its motion to amend the judgment.we review the trial court denial of the government motion to amend for any abuse of discretion.hohenberg.united states.
with respect to postjudgment interest,a provides that such i nterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court.although section does not directly apply to judgments rendered by the court of international trade,see c,that court has awarded postjudgment interest at the rate set out in section,based on the declaration of that the court of international trade shall possess all the powers in law and equity of,or as conferred by statute upon,a district court of the united states.see united states robinson,d.int l trade united states.ford motor,united states golden gate petroleum,united states new form,am.permac,united states,d.int l trade united states hitachi,d.int l trade united states monza automobili.int l trade.and other circuits have held that postjudgment interest under section is mandatory and may not be denied for failure to raise the issue until judgment.see,travelers prop.cas.ins.of am.union ins.of pittsburgh,cir vazquez filippetti cooperativa de seguros multiples de puerto rico,cir.
in its briefing in this court,great american did not argue that section incorporation of powers excluded or moderated section shall command to district courts nor did it seek to distinguish the ground for denial of postjudgment interest here from the grounds held inadequate in section cases like those just cited.indeed,great american made no argument at all contesting the government entitlement to post judgment interest here,if the underlying liability is affirmed.it did not contest postjudgment interest at oral argument either.in these circumstances,and because we affirm on liability,we remand for the trial court to amend the judgment to include postjudgment interest.
with respect to prejudgment interest,our conclusion is different.we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court conclusion that the government forfeited its right to prejudgment interest by failing to present a developed and supported case for that relief before judgment,in its case for the compensation it was due on the merits,presented here through a motion for summary judgment.
unlike postjudgment interest,which is collateral to the judgment itself,prejudgment interest traditionally has been considered part of the compensation due plaintiff and raises matters encompassed within the merits of the underlying action,such as at least for equitable prejudgment interest the degree of personal wrongdoing on the part of the defendant,the availability of alternative investment opportunities to the plaintiff,whether the plaintiff delayed in bringing or prosecuting the action,and other fundamental considerations of fairness.osterneck ernst whinney.as the seventh circuit held in another setting,because prejudgment interest is an element of the judgment itself,it generally must be sought before judgment,with the support and development needed for other elements of the requested judgment.uphoff elegant bath,cir quotation marks omitted.the logic of that general requirement applies regardless of whether the source of the prejudgment interest claim is section or a background equitable principle.
practical considerations reinforce application of that requirement here.the equitable considerations that affect equitable prejudgment interest raise obvious issues for development through evidence and argument.an award under section,at least under current law,raises issues requiring development as well.in united states federal insurance,we described section interest as mandatory in holding simply that,where this court had reversed a court of international trade rejection of a government suit for payment of certain import duties by the importer or the surety,this court failure to mention section in its mandate did not bar the court of international trade from ordering such interest on remand.but that decision leaves open a number of questions that called for substantial attention in this case.
federal insurance had no occasion to consider what range of equitable considerations might affect the application of section where it applies.and federal insurance did not involve antidumping duties at all.in fact,this court has never considered whether section applies to antidumping or countervailing duties.the government has informed us that only recently did it even begin to invoke section in cases involving antidumping or,apparently,countervailing duties a seemingly major change in the government asserted position on the scope and relationship of old laws in at least one other context,based on widely applicable doctrines about the relationship between specific statutory schemes and more general statutory language,the court of international trade has relied on the detailed statutory regime for antidumping and countervailing duties to distinguish them from general duties covered under other provisions of title,saying it seems that antidumping and countervailing duties were never intended to be regular or general duties.dynacraft indus,united states,d.int l trade id.at.in several respects,then,the government invocation of section here presented anything but a ministerial matter it raised significant issues that the trial court could properly view as calling for development before judgment.
in seeking to apply section here,the government contends that,unlike equitable prejudgment interest,interest under section is not compensatory,but rather is a statutory exaction in the nature of a penalty and,for that reason,applies in addition to equitable prejudgment interest.on the question of failure to preserve the point,that characterization,whatever its merits,does not help the government,which identifies no precedent or principle suggesting that a penalty characterization would license waiting until after judgment to develop the claim under section let alone as a part of claim for interest.penalties are commonly part of the merits relief sought,not something collateral to a judgment.see,uphoff,at request for penalty under state law had to be raised before judgment.moreover,the characterization of section as a penalty hardly makes it a ministerial matter and not just because the correctness of the characterization is a substantial issue.the characterization leaves,rather than disposes of,questions about whether section applies to antidumping duties at all and whether,if so,equitable considerations are relevant to its application,as is common under other,variously worded authorizations to apply penalties thus,it remains the case that the novelty of the government theory,which presents significant issues warranting substantial legal and possibly factual development,makes it appropriate to require prejudgment development.uphoff,at rule e may not be used to raise novel legal theories that a party had the ability to address in the first instance.
the trial court could reasonably find that the government did not sufficiently develop,or therefore preserve,a claim for prejudgment interest.in its filings,the government did no more than end its brief with a prayer for the relief requested in the complaint and attach a proposed order that included interest calculated under section.it is well established that arguments that are not appropriately developed in a party briefing may be deemed waived.see,smithkline beecham apotex corp,collecting cases united states charles,cir inadequately briefed issues are deemed abandoned.that principle makes particular sense where the claim at issue raises substantial issues.that is the case here,because the government request for prejudgment interest raises significant questions about,for example,the equitable considerations attending equitable interest section interest,the novelty of application of section to antidumping duties,and the soundness of the theory that both types of interest should be awarded.
it may be we need not say that the government could have preserved its claim by making a short affirmative presentation in its initial brief requesting summary judgment doing so would have given great american clear notice of its obligation to present its legal and evidentiary responses to the government novel claim,and the government then would have presented its full answers in reply.but the government did not do even that.we know of no general rule that,as a matter of law,excuses a movant from presenting a claim in its merits discussion,just because an opening presentation could be short.here it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the argument for prejudgment interest should have been,but was not,actually developed before judgment.
a rule e motion can not be used to raise arguments which could,and should,have been made before the judgment issued.simon united states,cir.thus,the court acted within its discretion in concluding that the government arguments in support of prejudgment interest,briefed for the first time in its motion to amend,came too late.see first state bank of monticello ohio cas.ins,cir.preservation principles are important to a litigation system,particularly,perhaps,for regular litigants like the government.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in invoking those principles here to deny prejudgment interest.
in its,great american argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment enforcing the bonds.great american argues that the government failure to notify great american of the suspension of liquidation of the entries at issue bars its recovery on two separate grounds.it also argues that the bonds are unenforceable because they exceed davis million authority.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.int l trading united states.
great american raises two defenses based on the government failure to notify it that liquidation of the entries at issue had been suspended.first,it contends that the failure to notify it as required by c invalidated the suspension as a matter of law,that liquidation therefore occurred and the government claim accrued by may,and that the government suit,brought more than six years after that date,is accordingly under the statute of limitations,a.second,great american argues that the lack of notice impaired its suretyship by altering its risk of loss and that it is therefore discharged from its obligation under the bond.we consider each argument in turn.
when liquidation of an entry has been suspended,c requires that notice of the suspension be provided to the importer of record and to any authorized agent and surety of such importer of record emphases added.section c therefore imposes a duty on customs to notify the surety if liquidation is suspended.wolff shoe,at.it is undisputed on appeal that customs erred by not notifying great american it did notify new phoenix and washington international that liquidation of the entries at issue had been suspended.
although section c does not set out any specific remedy for its violation,the absence of a specified remedy does not itself mean that the notice requirement is merely advisory or that failure to provide the required notice is without consequence,as the government contends.the supreme court has indicated that,in at least some circumstances,it presume s the availability of all appropriate remedies unless congress has expressly indicated otherwise.franklin gwinnett cnty.pub.we need not explore the remedial issue broadly,though,because the only issue presented here is whether the trial court properly rejected on summary judgment the particular remedy great american seeks invalidation of the suspension,with certain alleged consequences for the bonds enforceability.
we have held that a n agency violation of a statutory procedural requirement does not necessarily invalidate the agency action,especially where congress has not expressed any consequences for such a procedural violation.diaz dep t of air force.the supreme court has said we would be most reluctant to conclude that every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement voids subsequent agency action,especially when important public rights are at stake.brock pierce.no more should customs procedural error,in failing to provide a statutorily required notification,necessarily invalidate a suspension of liquidation that,like the suspension here,occurred automatically by operation of law.
rather,in accordance with the administrative procedure act,which governs the trial court review as well as our own,we must take due account of the rule of prejudicial error in reviewing customs failure to notify great american that liquidation had been suspended.because section establishes a rule,shinseki sanders,the suspension in this case could be invalidated only if great american showed that the agency procedural error caused it substantial prejudice,intercargo ins.united states,pam united states.this approach,required by the apa,is hardly idiosyncratic in other areas of law,a showing of prejudice is often required when a party seeks discharge from a substantive obligation based on another procedural error 
in this case,the trial court correctly concluded that great american did not present sufficient evidence of prejudice to create a triable issue of fact regarding prejudice from the government procedural error.great american argues that the government failure to send it a separate notice of suspension injured it because,had it gotten such a notice,it could have sought reinsurance,ceased doing business with the importer to limit its future risk,or attempted to minimize its loss on these bonds by participating in the administrative review of the duties at issue and arguing for a lower rate for the entries covered by the bonds.but the trial court correctly recognized that certain of the identified possible actions are irrelevant to the bonds at issue here,because altering future business policies could not limit the risk great american had already incurred under the bonds in question.great am,d at.in any event,and decisively,each of great american generalized suggestions of potential action is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on the record here,which included great american admissions that it had received other suspension notices and simply forwarded them to the agents without taking any additional action,and that it has never participated in an administrative review.
while those admissions would not themselves automatically preclude great american from showing that it would have acted in this case,it was incumbent upon great american to come forward with evidence that in this case unlike prior cases notification would likely have led it to take action,with some relevant probability of averting the alleged harm.sanders,at conclusion as to harmless error must rest on the facts and circumstances of the particular case id.at t he burden of showing that an error is harmful normally falls upon the party attacking the agency determination.great american did not do so.it claimed generally that it could have minimized its risk by participating in the rate review which it has never done before,but it did not identify any evidence or arguments that were missing from the administrative record or show how they could have altered the outcome of the review.great am,d at although counsel for great american suggested at oral argument before this court that this case was different because the amount in controversy was much greater than in any prior case,oral argument,great american did not present that argument in the trial court with supporting facts.its opposition suggested only that the government should have considered whether great american had ever received suspension notices for entries with dollar amounts as large as the amounts at issue in this case.great am.opp.to pl.mot.summ.at,united states great am.ins.of,case cv.int l trade,ecf.that suggestion about what the government might consider is no substitute,on summary judgment,for presentation of evidence here,evidence of other actual bonds and how their amounts compare to those of the present bonds.thus,great american did not present the trial court with any supported reason that notice would likely have spurred it,in a departure from its historical practice,to take action in this case.
the trial court conclusion is reinforced by the fact that great american was not without any notice of the suspension in this case.great american recognizes that suspension of liquidation began when commerce made its preliminary determination of dumping,see d,before the bonds at issue here were even issued,and it acknowledged in discovery that each of the bonds in question includes on its face a code indicating that the covered entries were subject to an antidumping duty order.in addition,notice of the initial and continued suspension of liquidation of entries covered by the order was repeatedly published in the federal register,years before the publication of the final results of the administrative review.freshwater crawfish tail meat from the people republic of china.at.at,amended by.final determination.at new shipper review e suspension based on new shipper review.at initiation of admin.review.in general,publication in the federal register is legally sufficient to provide notice to interested parties.see,filing of a document with the office of federal register is sufficient to give notice of the contents of the document to a person subject to or affected by it fed.crop ins.merrill,congress has provided that the appearance of rules and regulations in the federal register gives legal notice of their contents.jones united states,cir publication in the federal register constitutes legally sufficient notice.thus,although section c requires an additional notice to the surety,great american can not claim that it received no notice.
in short,the record is devoid of sufficient evidence that omitting the additional notice required by section c robbed great american of the opportunity to take actions it otherwise would have been likely to take in this case.because great american did not present evidence that created a triable issue of fact regarding prejudice,we affirm the trial court conclusion that the suspension of liquidation was valid.as is undisputed,it follows that the government cause of action accrued when customs liquidated the relevant entries starting in late july and the government suit was not.
great american also argues that customs,by failing to provide notice pursuant to section c,impaired great american suretyship,fundamentally altered its risk of loss,with the result that it is discharged from liability under the bonds.for reasons similar to those just discussed,we affirm the trial court conclusion that great american did not present sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact on its defense of impairment of suretyship.
offered no reason to do otherwise,we rely on the restatement third of suretyship guaranty in considering this defense.section provides 
if the obligee acts to increase the secondary obligor risk of loss by increasing its potential cost of performance or decreasing its potential ability to cause the principal obligor to bear the cost of performance,the secondary obligor is discharged as described in subsections and,and the secondary obligor has a claim against the obligee as described in subsection.an act that increases the secondary obligor risk of loss by increasing its potential cost of performance or decreasing its potential ability to cause the principal obligor to bear the cost of performance is an impairment of suretyship status.
under that standard,in order for great american to be discharged from its bond obligations,the government must have fundamentally altered the risks imposed on great american,as detailed in section,or impaired great american recourse against new phoenix,as detailed in section.because there is no claim that the government impaired great american recourse against new phoenix,great american defense depends on whether the government failure of notice fundamentally altered its risk.for the reasons discussed above with respect to lack of prejudice,we conclude that the trial court properly determined that great american failed to show that the record created a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment.
in order to be discharged from its obligations under the bond,great american would have to show that the lack of section c notice materially modified the contract to which it originally agreed by substantially increasing its risk.see,lumbermens mut.cas.united states,united states king,cir material modification is one that significantly augments the surety risk.but because,as just discussed,great american did not allege facts sufficient to show that either its own conduct or the ultimate outcome would have been different had it received the required notice,there is no evidence that its risk was increased by the government error let alone substantially increased.see king,at surety not discharged where it failed to demonstrate that liability was attributable to the incremental risk associated with the change in conditions,as opposed to the original risk associated with posting bond.accordingly,we affirm the trial court conclusion that the facts supporting great american defense,even when viewed in the light most favorable to great american,are insufficient to preclude summary judgment in favor of the government.
great american challenges the summary judgment in favor of the government on one additional ground.it argues that the bonds in question are unenforceable because each bond was for an amount that exceeded the issuing agent alleged million authority by.great american advanced this argument in the trial court as an affirmative defense to the government recovery,both in response to the government motion for summary judgment and in its own for summary judgment.great am.mot.summ.at,great am,case cv.int l trade,ecf great am.opp.to pl.mot.summ.at 
great american relies for this contention almost exclusively on a customs regulation.for context,we note first a regulation that great american does not invoke a provides that treasury department circular contains a list of corporations authorized to act as sureties on bonds and that,in the absence of certain measures to limit risk,no bond shall be for a greater amount than the respective limit stated in the circular.that provision,which addresses the surety corporation own stated limitation on its bonds,is not applicable here,because great american does not claim that the bonds at issue exceeded the amount stated in its circular filing.
rather,the provision invoked by great american is one concerning a surety corporation grant of a power of attorney to an agent acting on its behalf in posting bonds.section g provides that corporate sureties may execute powers of attorney to act in their behalf by filing customs form.g.it requires that the form include a d ollar amount of authorization,id.g vii,and forbids changes to that authorization unless the surety submits one form revoking the existing power of attorney and a second form containing a new grant of authority,id.g.unlike section a,however,section g does not state that no bond shall exceed an agent authority as stated on form.
the government records conflict with great american as to the authorization amount on file with customs for davis,the agent who signed the bonds in question.the government records listed davis as having authority up to the surety own limit as published in the annual circular at the time davis authority was revoked.great american,on the other hand,produced a partial copy of a form listing davis authority as million,which it contends was filed with customs in.given the dispute,the trial court assumed for purposes of summary judgment that great american filed a form with customs limiting davis authority to million.great am,d at.even on that assumption,however,the court concluded that the government was entitled to a summary judgment,on the record here,that great american actions provided apparent authority that bound it to amounts in excess of million,and that the bonds were therefore valid and enforceable.id.at.
as defined in restatement third of agency,
a pparent authority is the power held by an agent or other actor to affect a principal legal relations with third parties when a third party reasonably believes the actor has authority to act on behalf of the principal and that belief is traceable to the principal manifestations.
the principal manifestations need not be conveyed through words or actions.rather,s ilence may constitute a manifestation when,in light of all the circumstances,a reasonable person would express dissent to the inference that other persons will draw from silence.failure then to express dissent will be taken as a manifestation of affirmance.id.cmt.b.the trial court here considered the issue of apparent authority from the perspectives of both new phoenix and the government,and it determined that each reasonably believed that davis had authority to issue the bonds.great am,d at.great american does not challenge the finding with respect to new phoenix,but it argues that,given the provisions of section g,the government could not reasonably believe that davis million authority could be increased by any means other than the filing of a new form.
great american position rests on an unwarranted view of the regulation effect on apparent authority.the central premise of apparent authority is that legally effective authority can in fact go beyond an expressly stated grant of actual authority.whether the government should have known that davis previously stated actual authority was limited to million is not dispositive.although,as a general matter,a n agent does not act with apparent authority when a third party has reason t
