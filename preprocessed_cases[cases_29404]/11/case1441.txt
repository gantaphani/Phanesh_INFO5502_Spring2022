penalty kick management pkm brought this lawsuit against the company,seeking legal and equitable relief under theories of conversion,misappropriation of a trade secret,breach of contract,breach of a confidential relationship and duty of good faith,unjust enrichment,and quantum meruit.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of as to all claims,and pkm appeals.we affirm.
in early,pkm chief executive officer,peter glancy,conceived of a beverage label marketing and production process known as magic windows.magic windows consisted of the following a scrambled message on the inside of a beverage container label which could be decoded and read only after the beverage container was emptied.the message would be read through a colored filter printed on a label on the opposite side of the container,directly across from the coded message.
on november,glancy and charles carter of pkm met with representatives of to demonstrate magic windows.glancy orally advised the representatives that the information concerning magic windows was confidential,and the representatives regarded it as such.glancy also advised the representatives that pkm was pursuing global patent protection on magic windows and thus would be in a position to provide the exclusive rights to the magic windows marketing tool.
a few months after the meeting,in february of,the parties executed a agreement in which each agreed not to disclose to any third party any confidential information shared during discussions regarding magic windows.however,the agreement went on to provide 
t here is no obligation to maintain in confidence any information that 
i at the time of disclosure is available to the public 
ii after disclosure,becomes available to the public by publication or otherwise 
iii is in or its subsidiaries or affiliates possession,at the time of disclosure 
iv is rightfully received from a third party or 
vi can establish was subsequently developed independently by or its subsidiaries or affiliates independently of any disclosure hereunder.
after the execution of the agreement,pkm and representatives met again to discuss the possibility of licensing magic windows for its exclusive use.following several months of discussions,on july,drafted a development and license agreement in which,among other things,proposed to pay pkm million and a per label royalty for a global license giving the exclusive right to use magic windows 
concomitant with sending its proposed license agreement,however,undertook an intellectual property review of pkm patent applications to determine,inter alia,whether pkm could actually provide with exclusivity over the concept embodied in magic windows.in the course of that review,unearthed a copy of the virtual image patent application published in may of,and sent a copy of the application to glancy on october.the virtual image patent application revealed that the two main concepts of magic a colored filter to decode a disguised message and placing the filter on the side of a bottle label opposite the coded message,already existed in prior in view of the virtual image patent application,concluded that the magic windows concept was in the public domain,and that pkm could not provide the patent exclusivity was seeking.accordingly,a month later,on november,informed pkm that it would not pursue an exclusivity agreement w ith them,and terminated all negotiations.
pkm presentation was not the first or only time that had discussed window labels and decoder filters.two other instances are particularly important in this case first,in november of the same month pkm first met with,asked brighthouse,an ideation company,to create a promotion for the upcoming nfl season.one of the ideas presented by brighthouse in december of was the creation of a bottle label with a scrambled message on the back inside of the label and a red decoder filter printed on the front side of the label.brighthouse believed the concept would work,and proved its point with a graphic illustration and a bottle.subsequently tested the brighthouse concept with focus groups in order to gauge consumer reaction to a decoder bottle.
second,in september of while was still negotiating with pkm,met with steve everett,a salesman with itw,the regular printer for labels used on products in argentina,to discuss a windows label promotion in argentina.at this meeting,representatives discussed the concept of the window label in general terms,showed everett a of a bottle with a label,and asked if itw was capable of manufacturing such a label.the label included a message that was printed off an or printer and was taped to the back side of the bottle red litho paper was on the front side of the bottle.itw informed it could produce the label and set out to do so.
itw graphic arts manager,jeffrey albaugh,was assigned the task.he was not given any instruction on how to create the sample label.albaugh independently determined the type of printing press,inks,color sequences,and production processes needed.he alone did the following constructed the scrambled text on the label planned the print formula selected the film to use as a substrate for the label chose the color to use on the filter figured how to block the scrambled message from being read from the outside picked the weight and tone of the ink established the printing setup and decided whether to print on the surface or reverse print the label.albaugh made these decisions based on his experience as a printer.he viewed the task as simple,everyday printing that did not require anything new in technology.after approximately three weeks,albaugh completed the bottle label.subsequently used the label in an argentinian marketing promotion.
in february of,pkm learned of the argentinian promotion.after viewing one of the bottles,pkm was alarmed by what it perceived to be the striking similarity between its magic windows label and the bottle label developed by itw.glancy called to determine whether had used the information pkm had shared to help create the itw label.when denied any wrongdoing,pkm filed this suit.
the complaint in this case is framed in six counts.count i alleged that converted pkm magic label technology for its own use count ii alleged that misappropriated trade secrets when it divulged the disclosed information to itw,who in turn,used that information to develop its label count iii alleged that breached the agreement when it disclosed confidential information to itw count iv alleged that breached its confidential relationship and duty of good faith imposed by count v alleged that was unjustly enriched by utilizing pkm design of,and production process for,the magic windows technology finally,count vi alleged that failed to compensate pkm for the services and property provided to.
answered the complaint,denying liability on all counts.in short,stated that the information revealed by pkm regarding magic windows was not a trade secret,was not disclosed to itw or any other third party,and was not used by.additionally,had complied with the agreement,and did not owe any money to pkm because it did not provide with any valuable services or property.rather,the magic windows concept was rightfully received by during the brighthouse presentation,and any other allegedly misappropriated elements of magic windows were independently developed by itw using printing techniques.
as part of its defense,served an interrogatory on pkm asking pkm to identify every element of the magic windows technology that pkm contended was misappropriated by.plaintiff responded,in pertinent part,
pkm contends that coke misappropriated a promotional concept referred to as magic windows,clear view windows,and rear view windows that requires purchasers of containers in the case of coke,a beverage container to empty the contents of the container to receive a message or to determine whether they have won a prize which was incorporated in a commercially feasible beverage label printed on a gravure or comparable press with standard inks onto,flexible plastic packaging material using a label production process and color sequences whereby up to eight colors can be utilized to print onto film,as a substrate,or,which leaves the plastic film facing forward and toward the viewer to create a beverage label with a,two or three colored encrypted image or message on the inside or reverse side of the label that is visually incoherent which appears approximately opposite or approximately from a colored window filter which is used as a viewing mechanism to decode the image or message in a visually coherent form.
from this response,had an expert create a chart of the allegedly misappropriated elements 
pkm expert generally agreed with the chart.additionally,the district court adopted the chart in a november,order in which the court limited pkm trade secret claim to the elements listed in the chart.pkm did not object to the court adoption of the chart.
several months later,after extensive discovery and many depositions,the court,in a march,order,granted motion for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint.as for the misappropriation of trade secrets claim,the court found as a matter of law that although magic windows was a trade secret,had not misappropriated either the concept or the actual printing process of magic windows.the court also held that had not breached the agreement,finding as a matter of law that the magic windows concept was rightfully received from brighthouse,and that itw independently developed the labels from simple,everyday printing techniques.finally,the court held that the remaining,breach of confidential relationship and duty of good faith,unjust enrichment,and quantum superseded by georgia trade secret law.as a result of the court rulings,judgment was entered for and the case was closed.
pkm appeals each of the district court rulings,contending that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether misappropriated confidential information regarding magic windows and breached the agreement,and the district court improperly applied georgia trade secret law regarding both misappropriation and supersession.for these reasons,pkm maintains the district court judgment should be reversed.
since the heart of this case involves the claim for the misappropriation of trade secrets,we begin our analysis of the district court rulings on that issue 
under the georgia trade secrets act gtsa,et,a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets requires a plaintiff to prove that it had a trade secret and the opposing party misappropriated the trade secret.capital asset research finnegan,cir quoting camp creek hospitality inns,sheraton franchise,cir.whether information constitutes a trade secret is a question of fact.camp creek,at citing wilson barton ludwig.
the act defines trade secret as 
information,without regard to form,including,but not limited to,technical or nontechnical data,a formula,a pattern,a compilation,a program,a device,a method,a technique,a drawing,a process,financial data,financial plans,product plans,or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers which is not commonly known by or available to the public and which information 
a derives economic value,actual or potential,from not being generally known to,and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by,other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and 
b is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.
the fact that some or all of the components of the trade secret are does not preclude protection for a secret combination,compilation,or integration of the individual elements.essex group,southwire,quoting restatement third of unfair competition f.hence,even if all of the information is publicly available,a unique combination of that information,which adds value to the information,also may qualify as a trade secret.finnegan,at citing essex group,at.
the district court found that although many elements of pkm magic windows were included in the virtual image patent application,including the concept of using a coded message on the reverse side of a label requiring that the bottle be emptied so that the coded message can be decoded through a transparent window,many aspects of magic windows were unique.for instance,pkm label was and utilized ink,while the decoding label detailed in the virtual image application was embossed and did not bear ink.additionally,pkm was able to provide complete image security before the bottle was at least partially emptied,whereas the virtual image application indicated that previous colored filter decoding methods only provided limited image security.finally,nothing in the virtual image patent application dealt with the production elements used to produce pkm magic windows labels.with these unique aspects in mind,the district court ruled that pkm had in magic windows accomplished an effective,successful and valuable integration of the public domain elements,essex group,at,and therefore,possessed a trade secret.
our review of the record supports the findings of the district court.each of the required statutory elements is satisfied.first,as indicated above,certain aspects of magic windows were not commonly known by or available to the public.in particular,the production process was unique to pkm and unknown to its competitors.see salsbury,merieux,cir.second,it is clear that pkm information possessed actual or potential economic value after all,both and pepsi international were negotiating with pkm for a potential licensing agreement at the time of the purported misappropriation.third,glancy oral insistence on confidentiality at the initial november,meeting and in its meetings with pepsi international,as well as the written agreement with,were certainly reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of magic windows.we find no legal error in the district court judgment that pkm magic windows constituted a trade secret under georgia law.
before proceeding,however,we highlight the fact that most of pkm concept elements were covered by the prior art outlined in the virtual image patent application,and therefore are not protectable as trade secrets.
having agreed with the district court that information regarding magic windows constitutes a trade secret,we must next determine whether misappropriated pkm trade secrets when it had itw develop a label a defendant misappropriates a trade secret when,among other things,it discloses or uses a trade secret of another,without express or implied consent,knowing that at the time of disclosure or use the trade secret was acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.b see kuehn selton.in this case,the surrounding circumstances,namely the agreement,clearly gave rise to a duty on the part of to maintain the secrecy of any magic windows trade secrets.in fact,does not dispute that it had a duty to maintain the secrecy of pkm shared trade secrets.the issue of misappropriation,therefore,hinges on whether actually disclosed or used pkm trade secrets when it employed itw to develop a allegation vigorously denies.
when the supreme court of georgia recently addressed trade secrets under the gtsa,it relied heavily upon the restatement third of unfair competition quoting and adopting two paragraphs from the restatement to determine the meaning of trade secret.see essex group,at.we therefore think it prudent to consult the restatement for guidance to determine what constitutes disclosure and use under the act.section provides the answer 
there are no technical limitations on the nature of the conduct that constitutes use of a trade secret as a general matter,any exploitation of the trade secret that is likely to result in injury to the trade secret owner or enrichment to the defendant is a use thus,marketing goods that embody the trade secret,employing the trade secret in manufacturing or production,and relying on the trade secret to assist or accelerate research or development all constitute use.
the unauthorized use need not extend to every aspect or feature of the trade secret use of any substantial portion of the secret is sufficient to subject the actor to liability.similarly,the actor need not use the trade secret in its original form.thus,an actor is liable for using the trade secret with independently created improvements or modifications if the result is substantially derived from the trade secret however,if the contribution made by the trade secret is so slight that the actor product or process can be said to derive from other sources of information or from independent creation,the trade secret has not been used for purposes of imposing liability under the rules 
the owner of a trade secret may be injured by unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret as well as by unauthorized use any conduct by the actor that enables another to learn the trade secret is disclosure of the secret.
restatement third of unfair competition cmt.c emphasis added.
to summarize,under the restatement,a defendant is liable for the misappropriation of a trade secret only if the plaintiff can show that the defendant disclosed information that enabled a third party to learn the trade secret or used a substantial portion of the plaintiff trade secret to create an improvement or modification that is substantially derived from the plaintiff trade secret.on the other hand,if the defendant independently created the allegedly misappropriated item with only slight contribution from the plaintiff trade secret,then the defendant is not liable for misappropriation.these standards suggest that for to be liable for misappropriating magic windows,pkm must prove either that disclosed information that enabled itw to learn pkm trade secret or that itw label was substantially derived from pkm magic window label and not the result of independent creation we think that pkm has failed to prove either.
pkm has presented no direct evidence that disclosed pkm trade secrets to itw.several representatives testified that no pkm trade secrets were revealed to itw.moreover,employees from itw,steve everett and jeffrey albaugh,both testified that itw alone determined how to develop its bottle label and that they did not utilize any information from or pkm in the production process.
faced with a lack of direct evidence that disclosed pkm trade secrets,pkm resorts to relying on various forms of circumstantial evidence to prove actually disclosed its trade secrets to itw.first,pkm highlights the fact that can not produce as evidence the label it provided to itw,and argues inability to do so warrants a negative inference of misappropriation.we find no support in the law for such a proposition.in this circuit an adverse inference is drawn from a party failure to preserve evidence only when the absence of that evidence is predicated on bad faith.bashir amtrak,cir.there is no indication of bad faith in this case,so we decline to draw an adverse inference for the lost label.
second,pkm points out that the same employees who received pkm disclosures approached itw to produce the argentine label.it again suggests this fact warrants an inference of misappropriation.for the same reason,we decline to draw such an inference.additionally,we note that it was the job of these representatives to develop product and marketing promotions.this inevitably requires meeting with more than one entity.
finally,pkm argues that notes written by steve everett,testimony by jeffrey albaugh,and a voice mail message left by a representative who had met with both pkm and itw all prove that provided itw with pkm disclosed label and other trade secret information.we disagree.the testimony of everett,albaugh,and the coke representative indicate that the label provided to itw had red litho paper and was not of professional quality as was pkm.additionally,that same testimony,especially albaugh,reveals that did not disclose any information to itw that belonged to pkm.the limited instructions given by to itw involved matters unrelated to elements that pkm claim as trade secrets.
in sum,we find that pkm has failed to provide evidence that actually disclosed its trade secrets to itw.
we must next determine whether pkm has provided evidence that itw actually used any magic windows trade secrets.to show unauthorized use,pkm must prove that the label developed by itw was substantially derived from the magic windows label and not the product of independent development.our inquiry requires us to compare and contrast the various elements of the two labels.for sake of analytical convenience we will discuss the magic windows elements along the two categories proposed by expert concept and production.
we begin with the five identified production processes,which the parties refer to as printing press,inks,film material,color sequencing,and reverse printing 
printing press 
magic windows is printed on a gravure or comparable press.the evidence indicates that the itw labels were created on flexographic presses.
magic windows is made with standard inks.the evidence provides that albaugh,with the help of sun chemical,decided which inks to use and chose proprietary inks.
film material 
magic windows is printed on a,flexible plastic packaging material.the evidence shows that albaugh alone decided which film to use as a substrate for the label and that he chose a film that was not laminated.
color sequencing 
magic windows uses a label production process and color sequences whereby up to eight colors can be utilized.the evidence indicates that albaugh alone decided the label production process,including determining the numbers of colors to use and the color sequences.he chose both a different number of colors from magic windows seven instead of eight and used a different sequence than that used in magic windows.
reverse printing 
magic windows is printed on a film,as a substrate,or,which leaves the plastic film facing forward and toward the viewer.the evidence provides that albaugh was responsible for determining whether to print on the surface or to reverse print on the label,and that he used forward printing.
the above comparisons show that none of the five production elements in itw label match those for magic windows.moreover,the evidence also indicates that itw employee albaugh alone decided the various production processes.accordingly,the conclusion is inevitable that the production processes of the itw label were not derived,much less substantially derived,from pkm magic windows label.
having determined that did not use pkm production elements,we next consider whether used pkm magic windows concepts.a cursory analysis of the two labels indicates that the two labels share nearly identical concepts.on the surface it thus appears that and itw may have used pkm concepts.contends,however,that all of the concept elements listed in pkm trade secret were presented to by brighthouse in late,and as the lawful owner of the concepts presented by brighthouse,independently developed all of the concepts revealed by pkm trade secret.moreover,most of pkm concepts were already part of the public domain,as revealed by the virtual image patent application.argues,therefore,that any concept used to assist itw with the making of labels belonged to or was legitimately used by,and that no pkm trade secret concept elements were used to make the itw label.to assess argument,we compare the pkm concept elements with the concepts presented by brighthouse.
as mentioned above,brighthouse presented the idea of a bottle label with a scrambled message on the back side of the label and a red decoder the red zone printed on the front of the label.brighthouse chief operating officer,roger milks described the concept as follows 
t he concept being that the bottle the liquid is consumed and the level drops in the bottle,you could look through the red zone and you would see something on the opposite side of the bottle on the inside of the label,the purpose of that red device being to decode the message.
if you were viewing it through the red filter,all you would see is a blurred,illegible message.if you look at it through the red,the prize is in the red would decode the message and you would either be an instant winner or not.
the color graphic shown to by brighthouse at the presentation stated purchasers of bottle would look through the red zone circle to reveal instant win prizes.the red zone is a clear plastic circle that allows consumer to look through the
