the regulations promulgated by the department of health and human services dhhs to implement the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,provide for an individual broad access to his own health records.under hipaa,an individual has the right to obtain copies of his medical records for a reasonable,fee,while third parties who seek the same records may be charged at a higher rate.see c.in this case,kirk webb law firm of mann webb records on his behalf from his treating hospital.that hospital in turn passed the request on to smart document systems smart,which charged mann cook at the higher rate.because mann cook bills their clients for the cost of obtaining medical records,webb and mann cook collectively,plaintiffs sued smart for unfair competition under california business and professions code section section,asserting that the lower,fee should apply.
in a matter of first impression for the federal courts,we must determine whether the term individual in the dhhs regulations implementing hipaa encompassed mann cook when it acted as webb agent,thereby qualifying the law firm to obtain medical records at the lower rate.although nothing in the regulations prevents a law firm from drafting or mailing the request for records on behalf of its clients,or from directing that the records be sent to its office,we hold nonetheless that the hipaa regulations require the reduced rate only when the individual himself requests the records thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs case for failure to state a claim for relief.
before turning to the merits of plaintiffs claims,we also consider sua sponte whether the district court had jurisdiction over this case.because hipaa provides for no private right of action,plaintiffs originally filed this case in the california superior court,invoking a california unfair competition statute to seek redress of the alleged hipaa violations.defendant removed the case to federal court.although under certain circumstances concerns about federal question jurisdiction will preclude federal courts from hearing a case where there is no federal private right of action,we conclude that the district court correctly assumed diversity jurisdiction here.
webb and mann cook filed a class action in california superior court.according to the allegations in their complaint,which we presume to be true when reviewing a district court dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,holcombe hosmer,cir,the following facts formed the basis of the lawsuit 
smart is the world largest health document processor.it contracts with numerous health care providers and facilities for the exclusive right to copy and provide patients records.when a provider contracts with smart,patients have no other means to obtain copies of their medical records except through smart smart does not notify the patient that it will be accessing and viewing the patient health care records in advance,nor does it obtain the patient consent to do so.upon receiving a request,smart then accesses and copies the patient health care records through an agent who maintains copying equipment on the health care provider premises,sends the health care records to the patient or representative,and sends a bill for the copies of the health care records to the patient or his agent.
in exchange for this exclusive right,smart provides free copies and other benefits and services of value to health care providers.smart makes a profit in spite of the hipaa provision allowing patients to obtain their records at a fee in part by charg ing more for providing copies of health care records to patients who request their records through their agents,such as their personal injury lawyers,than to patients who are not represented by attorneys.
plaintiffs encountered smart when webb hired mann cook to represent him in his civil rights claim for excessive force and,in furtherance of that litigation,mann cook ordered copies of webb medical records.for that service,smart charged mann cook cents per page,in addition to more than in various additional fees,including a base fee,a basic fee,and a retrieval fee.mann cook have a contingent fee arrangement with webb,so it advanced the cost of the health care records for its client to smart,and charged him with repayment of the advance to be paid at the time of the resolution of the case.because webb is thus ultimately responsible for smart charges,the plaintiffs alleged that smart violated the hipaa fee limitations by charging his agent,mann than a reasonable,fee.
hipaa itself provides no private right of action.accordingly,plaintiffs brought suit in state court invoking a california unfair competition law that makes violations of other state and federal laws independently actionable.see cal.bus.west.smart removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship in class actions,see d,and filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,see.b.it argued that plaintiffs had not stated a claim under section because they had not adequately alleged a violation of any law.specifically,smart argued that plaintiffs allegations did not constitute a hipaa violation because the hipaa fee limitations apply only to individual patients who request records on their own behalf,and not to attorneys who act as agents of their clients.the district court granted smart motion.plaintiffs timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo dismissals under rule b,taking all allegations in the complaint as true.holcombe,at.
discussiona.jurisdiction over the section claim 
this case presents an unusual situation.generally,when we consider state law claims asserted in federal court after a removal,we apply state substantive law,pursuant to erie railroad tompkins.see,kohlrautz oilmen participation,cir conestoga servs.executive risk,cir.here,by contrast,the focus of our attention is directed at the proper interpretation of the regulations implementing a federal.this seems particularly incongruous because hipaa itself does not provide for a private right of action,see,under hipaa,individuals do not have a right to court action,so the federal courts would seldom have occasion to undertake such an analysis.
in fact,however,it is california law that directs,in this class action diversity case,that we examine federal law.plaintiffs california cause of action,section,is a broad statute designed to remedy violations of other laws,both state and federal.see people ex rel.bill lockyer fremont life ins,th,d,v irtually any state,federal,or local law can serve as the predicate for a section claim emphasis added.section establishes and creates a private right of action to remedy three varieties of unfair competition the unlawful,the unfair,and the fraudulent.id.internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs claim is based on the allegedly unlawful and unfair conduct of smart in violating hipaa.charging higher fees to lawyers thus must violate a,the hipaa order for plaintiffs to state a claim for relief under section unlawful prong 
similarly,if we determine that the agency responsible for implementing hipaa intended to permit smart conduct,it can not be unfair under section.the california supreme court has held that if the allegedly unfair conduct is that which the legislature has permitted or considered and concluded no action should lie,courts may not that determination and use the general unfair competition law to assault that safe harbor.commc ns,los angeles cellular,cal th,d.to withstand a motion to dismiss under rule b and state a claim under section,therefore,plaintiffs must demonstrate that,in charging mann cook a higher fee,smart violated the hipaa regulations 
in some cases,federal jurisdictional requirements may preclude federal courts from entertaining a state law claim based on a violation of a federal statute a complaint alleging a violation of a federal statute as an element of a state cause of action,when congress has determined that there should be no private,federal cause of action for the violation,does not state a claim arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.merrell dow pharm.thompson,d quoting see also utley varian,cir.therefore,where there is no federal private right of action,federal courts may not entertain a claim that depends on the presence of federal question jurisdiction under.
this jurisdictional concern is not present here.had smart removed this case to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction under,the lack of a private right of action to enforce hipaa may have foreclosed plaintiffs section claim.however,smart invoked diversity jurisdiction pursuant to d to justify the removal.see lockyer dynegy,cir holding that removal was appropriate,and that the merrell dow utley rule did not apply where jurisdiction was not predicated solely on ethridge harbor house restaurant,cir noting that the merrell rule does not apply to cases removed on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.having satisfied ourselves that we have jurisdiction,therefore,in accordance with california substantive law,we must analyze the federal regulations that will decide whether plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief.
hipaa statutory and regulatory framework 
hipaa aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health information system through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information.hipaa,stat.codified at notes.as the fourth circuit has noted,congress intended through this legislation to recogniz e the importance of protecting the privacy of health information in the midst of the rapid evolution of health information systems.med.ass thompson,cir.hipaa,therefore,emphasizes privacy,efficiency,and modernization.the statute itself,however,does not specify either how to protect privacy or to transmit health records efficiently and effectively.instead,it authorizes the secretary of health and human services to adopt standards that will enable health information to be exchanged electronically,consistent with the goals of improving the operation of the health care system and reducing administrative costs,and that will ensure the integrity and confidentiality of individuals health information and protect against unauthorized uses or disclosures of the information.see.some of the regulations containing those standards are the focus of our inquiry.see.
in implementing this congressional directive,dhhs has determined that,except in limited circumstances,an individual has a right of access to inspect and obtain a copy of protected health information about the individual in a designated record set,for as long as the protected health information is maintained in the designated record set.a emphasis added.upon an individual request to inspect or obtain his records,
the covered entity may impose a reasonable,fee,provided that the fee includes only the cost of 
i copying,including the cost of supplies for and labor of copying,the protected health information requested by the individual 
ii postage,when the individual has requested the copy,or the summary or explanation,be mailed and 
iii preparing an explanation or summary of the protected health information,if agreed to by the individual as required by the regulation.
id.c emphasis added.the question raised by this case is whether designated agents,such as personal attorneys,can count as the individual in order to obtain the reasonable,fee.
as a general interpretive principle,the plain meaning of a regulation governs.safe air for everyone envtl.prot.agency,cir internal quotation marks omitted.dhhs defined individual as the person who is the subject of the protected health information.on their face then,the regulations restrict the fee limitations to requests made by the individual and concretely define individual in a way that excludes others acting on that individual behalf.plain meaning thus favors smart.
the canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius,which creates a presumption that when a statute designates certain persons,things,or manners of operation,all omissions should be understood as exclusions,silvers sony pictures entm t,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted,further supports smart argument.dhhs has provided for one situation in which other persons may be treat ed as the individual when a personal representative is authorized to make decisions for an individual 
as specified in this paragraph,a covered entity must,except in limited circumstances,treat a personal representative as the individual for purposes of this subchapter if under applicable law a person has authority to act on behalf of an individual who is an adult or an emancipated minor in making decisions related to health care,a covered entity must treat such person as a personal representative under this subchapter,with respect to protected health information relevant to personal representation.
g.application of this canon suggests that because dhhs explicitly defined individual to encompass personal representatives,it was fully capable of writing in an even broader definition of the term.that it did not underscores the conclusion that individual should be afforded its plain meaning,and that we should therefore reject mann cook claim to the lower rate.
notwithstanding that plain meaning,plaintiffs urge us to read the term individual to include authorized attorneys because such an interpretation would be more consistent with the purpose of hipaa.plain meaning is not the end of the inquiry.the plain language of a regulation will not control if clearly expressed administrative intent is to the contrary or if such plain meaning would lead to absurd results.safe air,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.we invoke this exception to the plain meaning canon,however,only when some indication of the regulatory intent that overcomes plain language is referenced in the published notices that accompanied the rulemaking process.id.at.without this safeguard,interested parties would not have the requisite meaningful opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.id.
we are not persuaded that regulatory intent overcomes plain meaning in this case.plaintiffs have not directed us to any part of the original notice of proposed rulemaking proposed rules the commentary accompanying the final rules final commentary or the subsequent published clarifications accompanying the publication of other rules subsequent clarification that suggests that individual means anything other than the person who is the subject of the protected health information,and,when applicable,that person personal representative.
on the contrary,a review of relevant regulatory history makes clear that dhhs did not intend for private attorneys to receive the reduced fees.most notably,in the proposed rules,dhhs explicitly considered adopting a broader definition of individual that would have included legal representatives,but in the final rule ultimately decided against it.as explained in the final commentary,dhhs had previously 
proposed that the term individual include,with respect to the signing of authorizations and other rights such as access,copying,and correction,the following types of legal representatives with respect to adults and emancipated minors,legal representatives such as guardians or persons with a power of attorney,to the extent to which applicable law permits such legal representatives to exercise the person rights in such contexts.
however,i n the final rule,dhhs eliminate d from the definition of individual the provisions designating a legal representative as the individual.id.the agency chose i nstead to include in the final rule a separate standard for personal representatives.id.further,in,in response to a public comment asking whether the fee limitations applied to payers,attorneys,or entities that have the individual authorization,dhhs subsequent clarification explained that the rule limits only the fees that may be charged to individuals or to their personal representatives.emphasis added.the final commentary and subsequent clarification extinguish any doubt that the personal representative category constitutes the only class of persons that may be treated as the indivi
