we must decide,under a colorado unfair competition statute,whether a grocery store may sell gasoline below cost if such sales are conditioned on the purchase of enough groceries above cost that the entire series of transactions comes in at a profit.we hold that it may,and therefore reverse a jury judgment in favor of the competitors who challenged this practice.
defendant dillon companies,a kansas corporation and subsidiary of the kroger,operates two of the four grocery stores in the city of montrose,colorado,under the name city market.one is in downtown montrose the other,two miles down townsend avenue on the south end of town.at those locations it also operates retail gasoline filling stations.plaintiffs are competitors in the retail gasoline business.parish oil is a gasoline jobber,or wholesaler,and also operates retail filling stations in montrose under the phillips food plaza and travel shoppe names.ray moore tire petroleum service ray moore operated a filling station downtown until closing shop in november.
on december,city market kicked off a new promotion,the grocery discount program,allegedly intended as a pilot for a plan to boost grocery sales.under the program,a customer who purchased a qualifying amount of goods at a city market grocery store using his store loyalty card would receive a discount on gasoline on his next visit to a city market filling station,redeemable by swiping his loyalty card at the pump.the terms of the deal changed with time.from december,to march,a purchase of in groceries earned the customer cents per gallon off the posted price of gasoline,and a purchase of or more earned cents off.the qualifying amount of groceries had to be purchased in a single transaction,and the gasoline discount was available only at the filling station at city market south store.from march to november,a purchase of or more in groceries earned cents per gallon off gasoline.separate grocery purchases over any period could be accumulated to reach the qualifying amount,and the discount could be redeemed at either city market location.from november,to february,a purchase of or more in groceries in a single transaction netted the customer a whopping cents per gallon off the price of gasoline.since march,any customer with a city market loyalty card has received cents per gallon off at the pump without the need to buy groceries,and those customers who buy or more of city market groceries over a calendar month have received a discount of cents per gallon.in every incarnation of the program,the discount could be used only once it applied to every grade of gasoline,expired if not redeemed within two weeks,and required that the same loyalty card be used in the grocery store and at the pump.
on the ledgers,city market kept its groceries and filling stations accounts separate,so at the end of each accounting period the gasoline end of the business would bill the grocery end for the total value of the discounts it had honored.it is stipulated that the grocery discount program operated at a total profit that is,t he margin of profit on qualifying grocery sales,when viewed in the aggregate,fully covered the cost of the aggregate discounts offered under these programs at city market montrose,colorado stores.app.but because city market kept only aggregate figures,it is unknown how many individual customers,if any,received more in discounts at the pump than city market had earned on their qualifying purchases of groceries.
city market competitors cried foul.over this period of time parish oil and ray moore had been losing substantial amounts of business,both in volume and in profit.the amounts and causes of their losses are in contention,but when the matter came to trial a jury calculated parish oil losses due to city market discount program at and ray moore at.on january,plaintiffs sued city market in federal district court under colorado unfair practices act upa.the upa,was enacted in to safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and encourage competition by prohibiting unfair and discriminatory practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented.id.the act has subsequently been amended by the legislature,but at the times relevant to this case it contained two prohibitions on selling items below cost a general prohibition against sales or gifts where the seller has a purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition,id.a,and a specialized prohibition,added in,applicable only to motor fuel sales and omitting the intent requirement 
it is unlawful for any person,partnership,firm,corporation,joint stock company,or other association engaged in business within this state to engage in a pattern of selling,offering for sale,or advertising for sale motor fuel for less than the cost thereof to such vendor,when such pattern has the effect of injuring one or more competitors or destroying competition.
id.b,repealed by act of april.legis.serv.ch,west effective april.a sale is permissible if it is part of an endeavor made in good faith to meet the legal prices of a competitor.id.d,amended by act of april,supra.a violation is a misdemeanor,id.b,and the upa creates a private right for any person or company injured thereby to maintain an action for treble damages and to enjoin the defendant from a continuance of the violations,id.
this case was brought under section b,the special provision.the complaint accused city market of carrying on a pattern of illegal sales of gasoline below cost,in that city market posted prices were often below both city market cost and the prices of its competitors,and actual selling prices under the grocery discount program were even lower.for instance,according to the complaint,city market posted price for regular unleaded gasoline was below its cost on out of the days between december,and december.this pattern,it was charged,had a dramatic adverse impact on city market competitors,reducing gross margins on gasoline sales at parish oil phillips station by almost percent,and forcing ray moore out of the general gasoline retail business it had been in for years.app.the complaint sought both treble damages and preliminary and permanent injunctions to bar city market from further selling.
the district court denied the preliminary injunction.after discovery,city market moved for summary judgment.it asserted that its grocery discount program fell into an exception for combined sales.that provision,section of the upa,which is at the heart of this appeal,provided at the times relevant to this case 
for the purpose of preventing evasion of the provisions of this article in all sales involving more than one item or commodity and in all sales involving the giving of any concession of any kind,whether it be coupons or otherwise,the vendors or distributors selling price shall not be below the cost of all articles,products,commodities,and concessions included in such transactions.
amended by act of april,supra.
according to city market,this provision allows a vendor to bundle products,so that one item may be sold below cost if its sale is tied in an appropriate way with another item or items such that the total price is above the combined costs.under this interpretation,a city market gasoline sale would be bundled with the related qualifying grocery sales,if any,to determine whether the transaction as a whole generated a profit or a loss.because,city market argued,it was stipulated that the grocery discount program operated at a net profit,there could be no pattern of gasoline sales,and plaintiffs must lose.
the district court disagreed.although it admitted that,read literally,section supported city market view,it found the statute internally and irreconcilably inconsistent because allowing bundled sales would permit an around the underlying purposes of the upa in contravention of the provision stated purpose of preventing evasion of the.the court held instead that section must be read to require consideration of prices and costs,and thus to forbid a sales scheme like the grocery discount program.it therefore denied summary judgment for city market.
the case proceeded to a trial,held on october,whereupon the jury found city market liable for injuries to both parish oil and ray moore.it fixed parish oil damages at and ray moore at.in response to a special interrogatory,the jury assigned responsibility for each plaintiff losses in the amounts of percent to defendant city market,and percent each to nonparties safeway and bradley petroleum,which also operated filling stations in montrose.the district court,discounting damages for nonparty liability and then trebling the award in accordance with section,entered a final judgment against city market in the amount of for parish oil and for ray moore.it also permanently enjoined city market from selling motor fuel below cost,irrespective of reimbursements from any grocery discount program,except as permitted under the upa to meet a competitor price.
city market timely brought this appeal.we exercise jurisdiction under,review de novo the district court interpretation of the upa,reverse,and remand.
on appeal,city market again urges the interpretation of.that the district court rejected that it permits bundling of sales with sales.because the meaning of the statute is a matter of law,our review is de novo.cooper cent.sw,cir.as we are sitting in diversity and construing a colorado statute,we must give it the meaning it would have in the colorado courts.erie tompkins.mem l hosp.of laramie county healthcare realty trust,cir.to accomplish this objective,th is court must begin with the plain language of the statute.if the statute is unambiguous and does not conflict with other statutory provisions,we need look no further.if,however,the language of the statute is ambiguous,or in conflict with other provisions,we then look to legislative history,prior law,the consequences of a given construction,and the goal of the statutory scheme,to ascertain the correct meaning of the statute.people luther,internal citations omitted.
we therefore turn first to the plain language of the statute.the operative language states i n all sales involving more than one item or commodity and in all sales involving the giving of any concession of any kind,whether it be coupons or otherwise,the vendors or distributors selling price shall not be below the cost of all articles,products,commodities,and concessions included in such transactions.we agree with the district court that,read literally,the statute suggest s the very interpretation defendant urges here that a transaction will be considered legal so long as the price charged accounts for or exceeds the cost of all items included in the transaction.app.unlike the district court,however,we conclude that the literal meaning of the statute must be given effect.
the general prohibition of section a bars sales below cost if the seller has the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition,and the more specific prohibition of section b,since repealed,bars sellers of motor fuel from engaging in a pattern of sales with the is not injuring competitors or destroying competition.a,b.section,entitled selling below cost,addresses sales involving more than one item.it provides that when sales of more than one item are bundled,whether in a single transaction or in the form of coupons or other concessions,compliance with the statute is determined by comparing the selling price to the cost of all items included in such transaction.thus,to use the familiar example of a outlet value meal if the restaurant sells a hamburger and french fries for,throwing in a milk shake for free,the transaction is lawful if the cost of all of the included goods is not greater than the price.if cost to the restaurant of the hamburger is,the french fries,and the shake,the transaction would be lawful.similarly,if a record store gives purchasers of more than worth of music a coupon good for a discount on future purchases,the question is whether the sum of the costs of all goods purchased exceeds the total price charged for them.
as we read the statute,when all the items are obtained in a single transaction,it is regarded as a sale involving more than one item or commodity,and when a discount is given for a later purchase,it is regarded as a concession.either way,however,compliance with the statute is determined by comparing the cost of all the items involved in the transaction with the sales price for all of the items.
under this plain reading of the statute,the district court erred in denying city market motion for judgment as a matter of law.the parties stipulated that t he margin of profit on qualifying grocery sales,when viewed in the aggregate,fully covered the cost of the aggregate discounts offered under these programs at city market montrose,colorado stores.app.in other words,in the aggregate,the combined cost of groceries and gasoline did not exceed the combined selling price of these items it was an error for the district court to allow the jury to base its judgment on the price of the gasoline alone.because the gasoline sales were bundled with the grocery sales,the statute required a comparison of the costs and prices of the transactions taken together,not separately.to compare the cost and price of gasoline in isolation from the grocery sales would be like saying the value meal in our example is unlawful because the milk shake is being given away for less than its cost.
it does not matter,under section,whether we view the city market program as a discount on the purchase of groceries,payable in the form of a lower price on gasoline,or as a discount on the purchase of gasoline received as a result of the purchase of groceries.the statute does not indulge in economically meaningless formalism.either way,the statute asks us to compare the combined price of all items involved in the transaction to the combined cost of those items.because it is not contested that the aggregate margin on qualifying grocery sales exceeded the aggregate discount on gasoline,city market was not in violation of the statute.
our interpretation is consistent with the only colorado case interpreting section,mastercar,amoco oil.mastercar arose from a challenge to the defendants practice of offering a free car wash with the purchase of ten gallons of gasoline.suit was brought under section of the upa,the general prohibition on giveaways and sales plaintiff argued that the gift of the car wash was an illegal means of competition defendants countered that it was a legal concession pursuant to,wherein the sales price charged for the gasoline constitutes the consideration for both the car wash and the gasoline.mastercar,at.siding with the defendants,the court concluded that the car wash was not a gift at all.rather,when consideration is paid for one product that is sold in conjunction with another product described to be free or otherwise offered at no cost to the consumer,the transaction constitutes a combined sale,and thus,the product is not a gift pursuant to,id.at.
in further support of its holding,the court explained the impact of section in conjunction with the other parts of the upa which define cost 
the effect of these provisions is that,in any transaction in which a product or article is offered in conjunction with the purchase of another product at no cost,or at less than cost,the consideration paid by the purchaser must be sufficient to cover the costs,as defined under,of both products or articles.by mandating that a combined sale transaction may only be offered at a price above cost,under,the general assembly prevents the evil it sought to avoid under that portion of that declares it unlawful to give a product to a consumer for the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition.if a product must be sold at or above cost,injury to competitors is averted and the purposes of are satisfied.
the present case is similar.here,as in mastercar,a customer who purchases a certain quantity of one commodity gasoline in mastercar,groceries here is given a concession on a subsequent purchase of a different commodity a car wash in mastercar,gasoline here.the holding of mastercar applies with equal force to this case in any transaction in which a product or article is offered in conjunction with the purchase of another product at no cost,or at less than cost,the consideration paid by the purchaser must be sufficient to cover the costs,as defined under,of both products or articles.id.
the plaintiffs,relying on the district court,offer three grounds for distinguishing mastercar.first,they note that the mastercar court was not called on to construe section,making its interpretation dictum.appellees br.we do not agree.the defendant in mastercar relied on section,and the colorado court relied in part on that section in determining that the offering of the car wash fell outside section prohibitions.but even assuming mastercar interpretation is technically dictum and thus not binding,we find it persuasive.second,the plaintiffs note that the question in mastercar was whether the car wash was a gift rather than a sale.we regard this as a distinction without a difference.there is no reason to think mastercar would have come out differently if the car wash had been for half price instead of for free.finally,they note that the mastercar court ignored the introductory clause of section.id.but the question in this case as discussed below is whether the introductory clause of section requires us to interpret the statute in a fashion at odds with its language the fact that the mastercar court did not do so is reason for us to take the same course,not a reason for us to distinguish the decision 
finally,we would be hesitant to adopt the plaintiffs reading of section because it would appear to prohibit a number of ordinary commercial practices which we do not think the legislature intended to stamp out by such vague words.consider a cellular service provider.it sells phones for,above cost,but if a customer will sign a service contract he may have the phone for a dollar.the plaintiffs reading would likely prohibit this common practice,especially if the entire purchase price for the telephone and the service plan is not paid up front and together,because the price of the phone itself would have to be considered separately from the price of the cellular service.indeed,the plaintiffs reading would apparently render unlawful in the state of colorado a promotional gimmick so common that it features in an episode from seinfeld 
jerry atomic sub why are you eating there 
elaine i got a card,and they stamp it every time i buy a sub.twentyfour stamps,and i become a submarine captain 
jerry what does that mean 
elaine embarrassed free sub.
seinfeld the strike nbc television broadcast.if the first sandwiches are sold for apiece at a cost to the maker of,the customer who follows through and redeems the offer will have spent to buy worth of sandwiches.but the last one is sold below cost in fact,it is free,making it illegal under the plaintiffs version of the upa.we do not believe the colorado legislature would have acted so cavalierly as to ban such,to make them more clearly expressing an intent to do so.
we therefore interpret section,as it existed prior to amendment in april,to mean that where the ability to make a purchase at a concession price is expressly contingent on the purchase of other goods,the concession goods are sold below cost only if the total price paid by the customer for the goods involved in such linked transactions is below the total cost of such goods.
neither the plaintiffs nor the district court offer a plausible alternative reading of the language of the operative provision of section.as discussed below,the district court explicitly abandoned any literal reading of the statute in favor of an interpretation based on the court perceived legislative purpose.in their appellate briefs,the plaintiffs deny that the operative clause of section has a plain or literal meaning that supports the defendant position,appellees br,but they do not suggest any plausible alternative.as best we can understand their position,plaintiffs argue that because the city market program involves a concession rather than a combined purchase,the correct approach is not to compare the combined price of the purchased items to the combined cost of the purchased items but to examine one side of the related transactions in isolation 
the only transaction involving the giving of any concession is the transaction in which a qualified customer purchases motor fuels at a discount.under that provision,because the concession is not applied to the price of any of the qualifying grocery items,which purchases are made in separate transactions,the only relevant transaction is the one in which the customer purchases discounted motor fuel.
the only items included in the relevant transaction are the motor fuels and the concession.the cost of the motor fuels,therefore,is combined with the cost of the concession,and compared to the price of the motor fuel to determine whether it is being sold below cost.if city market sells gasoline at a price lower than the combined cost of the motor fuel and the discount,the product is being sold below cost.
this seems to us a distorted interpretation of the statute.it is simply not true to say that the only transaction involving the giving of any concession is the transaction in which a qualified customer purchases motor fuels at a discount.the,entitlement to a discount on given in connection with the purchase of groceries.when we add the cost of the groceries to the cost of the concession,the discount on gasoline,and compare this to the price paid for the groceries,it is undisputed that city market makes a profit on the entire transaction.in this respect,the situation is precisely analogous to mastercar,where the concession a free car wash was given in connection with the purchase of gasoline.
the plaintiffs want to pretend that the only relevant transaction is the one in which the customer purchases discounted motor fuel,but this directly contradicts the language of section,which requires that when coupons or other concessions are involved,the vendors or distributors selling price shall not be below the cost of all articles,products,commodities,and concessions included in such transactions.when customers purchase groceries,they receive not only groceries but a concession on the price of gasoline according to the statute,the cost of all of these articles must be considered in combination.to look only at the transaction where the coupon or concession is cashed in would effectively outlaw the practice of giving coupons or other bonuses to customers on one purchase,to be used in connection with the transaction in mastercar.that is not what the statute says.
the district court departed from the literal meaning of section because it regarded that meaning as internally and irreconcilably inconsistent with the purpose of the section,as stated in its introductory clause for the purpose of preventing evasion of the provisions of this article app.according to the district court,the literal meaning of section would permit an around the underlying purposes of the upa to prevent the practice of loss leader selling.id.at.selling is the practice of selling selected goods,like a thanksgiving turkey,at a loss in order to lure customers into the store.given that conclusion,the court reasoned,a literal meaning of the statute must give way to a consideration of legislative purpose.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that the only rational interpretation must be one in which the cost of each item and the cost of the concomitant concession is considered separately to determine whether that individual price is below cost.id.at.under that reading,the discounted price of gasoline under the city market program must be considered separately from the margin of profit on qualifying grocery sales.
even when it is true that an absolutely literal reading of a statutory provision is irreconcilably at war with the clear congressional purpose,united states,d quoted in app,this entitles a court only to consider a less literal construction.id.it does not permit the court to adopt the exact opposite of the statute operative language.the district court did not suggest any way the statute operative language could be read to express a prohibition on the bundling of sales
