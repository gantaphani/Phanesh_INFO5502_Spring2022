defendants appellants patricia caruso,director of the michigan department of corrections mdoc,linda matuszak,the record office supervisor at saginaw correctional facility,and jan trombley,the warden at saginaw correctional facility collectively,defendants,appeal the district court denial of their motion to reconsider its order enjoining them from enforcing subsection hh rule of mdoc policy directive mdoc pd prisoner mail,which pro se plaintiff appellee walter jones claims infringes on his first amendment and due process rights.mdoc pd,which became effective on march,sets forth mdoc guidelines for prisoners mail rights.the directive includes a list of prohibited materials prisoners shall not be allowed to receive as they are considered to be a threat to the order and security of an institution or to the rehabilitation of prisoners.mdoc pd n.
this case relates to rule of the policy directive,which specifically regulates prisoners possession of materials.defendants argue that the district court injunction should be dissolved because the district court mistakenly found materials to be legal mail subject to heightened first amendment protections the district court erred in finding that rule is not rationally related to the legitimate penological objective of maintaining order and discipline in mdoc prisons the district court erred in finding that rule exception did not alleviate first amendment concerns the district court issuance of the injunction interfered with the judgment of prison officials and the district court erroneously applied the standard for the issuance of preliminary injunctions.jones counters that this court can not consider arguments that defendants have raised for the first time on appeal defendants have regulated their ucc ban through other mdoc directives,obviating the need to dissolve the injunction and the district court properly determined that the facts met the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction.although the district court abused its discretion in applying the incorrect level of scrutiny to analyze rule,for the following reasons,we affirm the district court preliminary injunction on its merits and remand the case to the district court for further consideration not inconsistent with this opinion.
background 
factual.development of rule 
since,there has been a nationwide increase in the number of filings by prison inmates of unsubstantiated liens and uniform commercial code ucc financing statements against state or federal officials involved with their incarceration.see,united states gordon,no,wl,at,finding that prisoners filed facially absurd liens and ucc financing statements designed to harass and intimidate government officials in the performance of their duties united states orrego,cv sj,wl,at june,granting government motion for summary judgment where prisoner purported to copyright his name,after which he filed fraudulent liens against various government officials for using his name without permission or payment ray williams,no.cv hu,wl,at,granting government motion for summary judgment where prisoner submitted ucc filings against government officials,seeking payment for unauthorized use of his copyrighted name united states martin,d,finding null and void prisoner fraudulent ucc financing statements naming himself as the secured party for a debt purportedly owed to him by various government officials united states brum,no.civ,wl,at.july,granting government motion for summary judgment where prisoner filed fraudulent liens and ucc financing statements against the judge and prosecutor involved in his criminal conviction cooperwood mcdonald,cv,wl,at.june,dismissing prisoner civil rights action under the prison litigation reform act where prisoner filed a fraudulent lien for infringement of his copyrighted name united states stouder,wl,at,declaring null and void prisoner fraudulent ucc financing statements against government officials in the amount of.
on march,in response to increased activity by michigan prisoners engaging in these types of fraudulent schemes,mdoc director,defendant caruso,used her authority to establish policy through a director office memorandum dom and enacted dom,fraudulent activities involving the uniform commercial code.see jones.dep t of,cv dt,wl,at,on january,dom was superseded by dom,which also restricted prisoners use of ucc publications in an effort to confront increased activity by prisoners engaging in various schemes involving the ucc.joint appendix ja.also,on march,prison officials approved housing unit rule rule,a policy,which,like dom and dom,declared that mdoc would consider materials to be contraband subject to seizure because prisoners could use those materials to facilitate criminal activity.
on june,dom was superseded by mdoc pd hh rule,prohibiting certain types of incoming mail.rule stated 
prohibited incoming mail 
hh.prisoners are prohibited from receiving mail that is a threat to the security,good order,or discipline of the facility,may facilitate or encourage criminal activity,or may interfere with the rehabilitation of the prisoner.the following pose such risks within a correctional facility under all circumstances and therefore shall be rejected.
mail regarding actions that can be taken under the uniform commercial code ucc.this does not include legal materials which set forth the statute or provide a scholarly legal analysis of the ucc.
ja.rule prohibited prisoners from receiving and possessing certain materials but was interpreted by the mdoc officials as making exceptions for publications held in the prison law library,such as the michigan compiled laws annotated or scholarly analyses of the relevant statutes.see jones,wl,at.mdoc officials also interpreted rule as preventing prisoners from using funds from their personal institutional accounts to purchase prohibited ucc materials and required mdoc staff to reject such items that a prisoner received through the mail and to confiscate such items that a prisoner already possessed.id.
on january,mdoc amended mdoc pd hh,such that subsection hh now states in renumbered rule 
mail regarding actions that can be taken under the uniform commercial code ucc which could be used to harass or threaten another individual,including the filing of a lien against the individual.this does not include legal materials which set forth the statute or provide a scholarly legal analysis of the ucc.
ja emphasis added.mdoc also sought legislation that would make inmates ucc abuses punishable as criminal offenses,and,in,it became a felony in michigan to knowingly and intentionally file a false or fraudulent financing statement with the secretary of state under the ucc.see.comp.laws 
enforcement of rule against jones 
jones is currently serving a life sentence in the custody of mdoc.after mdoc enacted dom,jones notified prison officials that he possessed books,pamphlets,forms,and other literary materials that referenced usage of the ucc regulations but were not associated with criminal or fraudulent activity.on february,jones attempted to send a letter to the michigan secretary of state seeking forms related to michigan copyright and trademark registration laws.on february,jones metered envelope was returned to him without the letter.jones then filed grievances based on defendants enforcement of dom and their alleged failure to provide him with reasons for confiscating his correspondence.after exhausting the applicable mdoc grievance procedures,jones filed the instant suit.
procedural history 
jones filed his complaint on july,alleging under,that dom suppresses communication and is facially overbroad in violation of the first amendment.because dom was superseded by rule,the magistrate and district judges construed jones claims as arising from rule.haines kerner,d granting liberal construction to pro se filings franklin rose,cir the allegations of a pro se petition,though vague and conclusory,are entitled to a liberal construction.
jones sought the following relief a declaratory judgment stating that dom and rule were unconstitutional under the first and fourteenth amendments to the constitution an injunction to prevent mdoc enforcement of both dom and rule an injunction requiring defendants to notify jones when they confiscate or reject his outgoing mail compensatory damages of and punitive damages of.defendants moved for summary judgment.in support of their motion for summary judgment,defendants attached evidence showing that michigan prisoners were filing fraudulent liens.specifically,defendants exhibit c to their motion for summary judgment consists of eighteen pages of documents including correspondence from the michigan secretary of state office copies of common law copyright trade self executing agreement in event of use purporting to allow a prisoner to claim a trademark interest in his own name newspaper advertisements purporting to assert a copyright interest in a prisoner name a complaint against an mdoc employee for violation of a prisoner contractual rights,and an assertion of a debt of against an mdoc employee for alleged abuses of a prisoner copyrighted name.
on july,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r,which recommended that the district court grant defendants motion for summary judgment as to defendants caruso,trombley,and matuszak in their individual capacities based on qualified immunity.however,the magistrate judge recommended the denial of defendants motion to dismiss jones request for injunctive relief against them in their official capacities and that the district court issue a temporary restraining order enjoining mdoc enforcement of rule.the magistrate judge concluded that jones had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim that rule violated his first amendment rights and was also unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.
defendants objected to the r r,contending that jones claims were mooted by mdoc january,enactment of rule.on july,the magistrate judge issued an amended r r determining that rule acceptably modified rule,making an injunction unnecessary.jones then objected to the amended r 
on september,the district court adopted the magistrate judge r r but rejected his amended r r.the court explained that although defendants had established that rule reflected the legitimate government interest of preventing prisoners abusive ucc filings,the rule was impermissibly vague because it denied inmates access to the full range of ucc publications without providing them alternative means to exercise the right to access ucc publications for lawful purposes 
the added language of rule limits ucc materials,which could be used to harass or threaten another individual,including the filing of a lien against the individual.although this policy does not appear to be related to the security of the prisons,the policy may be addressing the prison other legitimate penological objectives harassment and felony activities,as argued by defendants.the added language allows confiscation of ucc materials relating to a lien to be placed on another individual,which is a vague term.although defendants in their summary judgment motion submitted examples of two other prisoners who may have placed or attempted to place liens against two individuals who appear to be employed with the state of michigan,there is no affirmative evidence or statement by the two individuals identified that these liens were in fact improper or illegal or that the prisoners were successful in filing the liens.defendants also do not cite any authority or statute federal or state that shows the filing of a lien against another individual is prohibited or is a felony as argued by defendants.the added language is vague as to the individual the policy attempts to protect and does not limit the filing of a lien which may be legitimate or legal.
ja.the district court then enjoined defendants enforcement of rule,pending resolution of the parties dispute.
defendants subsequently moved for rehearing or reconsideration based on an alleged palpable defect in the district court decision.defendants argued that rule is narrowly tailored to prevent mdoc prisoners from committing fraudulent acts against individuals and that it did not unconstitutionally infringe on prisoners abilities to obtain lawful liens or to possess forms,pamphlets,and other items that could facilitate the commission of fraudulent prisoner activity.on april,defendants filed a supplemental brief in support of their motion,citing two recent michigan federal district court decisions involving similar issues mitchell caruso,wl,at,finding moot plaintiffs claim that dom violated prisoners first amendment rights where the rule was superseded by rule,and plaintiffs had not brought claims under rule itself and hardin michigan department of corrections,cv,wl,at,concluding that the fact that mdoc did not permit plaintiff prisoner to possess materials sent to him by an ambassador of the washitaw nation of moors did not violate his first amendment right to freely practice his religion because mdoc confiscation of materials was reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.
on september,the district court denied defendants motion for reconsideration.the court found that though defendants had cited specific instances of ucc fraud committed by mdoc prisoners against michigan employees,defendants fail ed to adequately address the c ourt concern regarding rule overinclusiveness and d id not address underinclusiveness at all.ja.the court explained 
defendants acknowledge rule overinclusiveness,but suggest that the mdoc has a process,already in place,that is capable of sifting out legitimate prisoner mail.defendants assert that,if a prisoner believes that his mail has been inappropriately confiscated,there is a process by which he may request a hearing to determine the appropriateness of the confiscation.the court is not convinced that such a remedy,which is the same relief available to a prisoner for any type of rejected or confiscated material,is for prisoners seeking relief from rule.courts must ensure that prisoners are afforded greater first amendment protection for their legal mail than with other items.moreover,there is a heightened first amendment concern when prison officials place restrictions on legal mail.defendants proposed remedy does not meet this heightened test.
ja internal citations omitted emphasis added.defendants now appeal the district court decision and ask this court to dissolve the injunction.

defendants motion for reconsideration involves the district court issuance of jones request for injunctive relief,and this court reviews a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.united states any all radio station transmission,cir.generally,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to a preliminary injunction.see overstreet lexington fayette urban county gov t,cir a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be granted only if the movant carries his or her burden of proving that the circumstances clearly demand it.see also leary daeschner,cir t he proof required for the plaintiff to obtain a preliminary injunction is much more stringent than the proof required to survive a summary judgment motion.in addressing a motion for a preliminary injunction,a court should consider the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the merits whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm without the injunction the probability that granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others and whether the public interest will be advanced by issuing the injunction.see six clinics holding,ii cafcomp,cir.these factors are not prerequisites,but are factors that are to be balanced against each other.overstreet,at.
notwithstanding this balancing approach,w hen a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the basis of a potential violation of the first amendment,the likelihood of success on the merits often will be the determinative factor.connection distrib.reno,cir.in short,because the questions of harm to the parties and the public interest can not be addressed properly in the first amendment context without first determining if there is a constitutional violation,the crucial inquiry often is whether the regulation at issue is likely to be found constitutional.id.citing congregation lubavitch city of cincinnati,cir because harm could be suffered by either party,and the public interest lay in the correct application of first amendment principles,the court decision turned on the likelihood of success on the merits.see also wv ass of club owners fraternal,musgrave,cir noting that a plaintiff claimed harm is inseparably linked to the likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiff first amendment claim.
b.this court may consider defendants arguments on appeal 
as a threshold matter,we must address jones assertion that this court should not consider the following arguments raised by defendants for the first time on appeal ucc materials are not legal mail warranting heightened scrutiny rule is rationally related to a legitimate penological purpose and does not infringe on prisoners first amendment rights the district court erred in its analysis of rule exception and the district court failed to accord the prison officials the required deference in evaluating rule.jones asserts that a decision on the merits would be improper where he had no opportunity to present opposing arguments or evidence.
although this court adheres to the general rule that i ssues not presented to the district court but raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before the court,see,marys foundry,employers ins.of wausau,cir,we have stated that it may be appropriate to consider a new issue on appeal if it is presented with sufficient clarity and completeness for us to resolve the issue.mcfarland henderson,cir quoting wyckoff,standard fire ins,cir and pinney dock transp.penn cent,cir.further,we have most commonly exercised our discretion to reach issues not raised below when the issue is one of law,and further development of the record is unnecessary.bryant dollar,cir quoting mcfarland,at.because the aforementioned challenges present questions of law that require no further development of the record,we exercise our discretion to consider the merits of defendants arguments.
c.the district court erred by applying the incorrect standard of review to rule 
the district court found that rule unconstitutionally limits inmates right to send and receive legal mail and reviewed the rule under a heightened standard,rather than under the standard typically applied to challenged prison regulations.for the reasons that follow,we find that the district court applied the wrong standard of review to its analysis of rule.
the supreme court has identified four factors generally relevant to determining the reasonableness of a challenged prison regulation the turner factors 
there must be a valid,rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it 
there must be alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates 
we must consider the impact that accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates and on the allocation of prison resources generally and 
there must not be alternatives available that fully accommodate the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests.
turner safley,d.failure to satisfy the first factor,renders the regulation unconstitutional without regard to the remaining three factors.id.if the first factor is satisfied,the remaining factors are considered and balanced together as guidelines by which the court can assess whether the challenged actions are reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.id.
the supreme court has made it clear that prison inmates retain all first amendment rights not incompatible with their status as prisoners,or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.pell procunier,d.the court has recognized that receiving mail from an outside source,an interest in communication shared by prisoners and their correspondents,is such a first amendment right.procunier martinez,d holding that a prison decision to censor or withhold delivery of a particular letter incoming or outgoing must be accompanied by minimum procedural safeguards.accordingly,the court has held unconstitutional the censorship of prisoner mail when prison officials censor simply by indulging their personal prejudices and opinions,while purporting to apply constitutional standards.brooks seiter,cir quoting procunier,at,and noting that the decision in that case squarely rested on an analysis of the nature of personal correspondence.
this court has held that a review of regulations governing legal mail is subject to a heightened standard.see sallier brooks,cir finding that legal mail is entitled to a heightened level of protection to avoid impinging on a prisoner legal rights,the privilege,and the right to access the courts accord kensu haigh,cir the right of a prisoner to receive materials of a legal nature,which have impact upon or import with respect to that prisoner legal rights matters,is a basic right recognized and afforded protection by the courts see also jenkins huntley,cir finding that prison officials risk violating an inmate constitutional rights if they open an incoming letter marked as legal mail outside of his presence davis goord,cir in balancing the competing interests implicated in restrictions on prison mail,courts have consistently afforded greater protection to legal mail than to mail.policies regarding outgoing legal mail receive heightened scrutiny under which a prison inspection policy must further an important or substantial government interest unrelated to the suppression of expression and must not limit first amendment freedoms greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved.bell bey williams,cir quoting procunier,at.
nonetheless,not all outgoing mail is legal mail,and we have held that the question of what constitutes legal mail is a question of law.sallier,at.the michigan administrative code defines legal mail as correspondence with courts,attorneys,public officials,the office of the legislative corrections ombudsman,the department of correction central office staff,and staff of the institution in which the prisoner is incarcerated.see.admin.code.we have clarified that while mail to a prisoner attorney or a court relating to his or her legal claims constitutes legal mail,correspondence with the american bar association aba,county clerks,or registrars of deeds does not because it generally d oes not contain confidential,personal or privileged material.sallier,at jensen klecker,cir concluding that a letter from the national prison project bearing an attorney name and stamped lawyer client mail do not open except in presence of prisoner came within the definition of protected legal mail.
here,the district court erred by applying heightened review when the uccrelated materials at issue are not legal mail.the confiscated letter jones attempted to mail to the michigan secretary of state office,requesting information about copyrighting and trademark registration in michigan,resembles the correspondence with the county clerk that we previously determined was not legal mail in sallier.at.the fact that jones letter was addressed to the secretary of state,a public official,does not change our analysis.although,as we have noted,the michigan administrative code provides that mail to public officials warrants additional protections,the suggests that this does not encompass general communications with public officials that do not implicate the right to petition for grievances and the right of access to the courts.see,jenkins.at finding that inmate correspondence with officials from the illinois attorney registration and disciplinary commission was not legal mail witherow paff,cir holding that prison regulation requiring that mail sent from inmates to certain public officials be visually inspected does not violate inmates first amendment rights lee tahash,cir concluding that inmate did not have right to send communications to any public officials throughout the united states making requests for general information and numerous federal and state statutory sections,chapters,codes,procedural rules,and court decisions taylor sterrett,cir l etters addressed to courts,public officials,or an attorney when the prisoner challenges the legality of either his criminal conviction or the conditions of his incarceration are sui generis in both logic and case law.emphasis added.
the documents set forth in defendants exhibit c in support of their motion for summary judgment do not constitute legal mail either.see supra at because those documents all relate to the administrative process of perfecting a security interest and enforcing that interest through the secretary of state office,and they do not implicate jones constitutional right of access to the courts,they are not entitled to greater first amendment protections.sallier,at.
finally,it bears mention that both the third circuit and a michigan federal district court have recently concluded that the challenged types of materials are not legal mail.see monroe beard,cir upholding pennsylvania prison regulation providing for the confiscation of materials,publications,and information on copyrighting names because plaintiffs still had available to them a wide range of legal materials and publications that do not pertain to the filing of fraudulent liens,and edmonds sobina,cir upholding pennsylvania prison regulation providing for the confiscation of materials,publications,and information on copyrighting names and finding that regulation did not impinge on prisoners rights to possess publications and legal materials in general umbarger caruso,cv,wl,at.july,determining that plaintiff ucc materials were not legal mail where they were not clearly marked as mail from an attorney or law firm,a legitimate organization,a paralegal working on behalf of an attorney,law firm,or legal service organization,the department of attorney general,a prosecuting attorney office,a court or a clerk of the court.
for all these reasons,the district court application of the heightened scrutiny applicable to outgoing legal mail was in error.defendants argue that our inquiry should end here and that we should vacate the injunction and remand the issue to the district court for analysis under the proper standard.we disagree.
defendants are correct that g enerally,a panel entertaining a preliminary injunction appeal decides only whether the district court abused its discretion in ruling on the request for relief and does not go into the merits any further than necessary to determine whether the moving party established a likelihood of success.rogers corbett,cir see also wright miller,fed.prac.proc.civ d west in general,when the appellate court determines that the trial court order denying injunctive relief was erroneous,it will reverse and remand the case for further proceedings below.able united states,cir rather than applying the likelihood of success standard ourselves,however,we believe that the wiser course is to allow the district court to make the determination in the first instance.however,a,which governs appeals of interlocutory orders granting or denying injunctions,provides courts of appeal with jurisdiction to reach the merits,at least where there are no relevant factual disputes and the matters to be decided are closely related to the interlocutory order being appealed.see,thornburgh am.coll.of obstetricians gynecologists,d noting that appellate review on the merits of the issuance of an injunction is proper if a district court ruling rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law,and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance doe sundquist,cir finding that reaching the merits was in the interest of judicial economy,since the legal issues have been briefed and the factual record does not need expansion burk augusta richmond county,cir on interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction,the court determined that the appeal presented pure questions of law and struck down the county permitting requirement for public demonstrations on first amendment grounds am.civil liberties union mukasey,cir noting that i f a preliminary injunction appeal presents a question of law and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance,the panel may decide the merits of the claim quoting pitt news pappert,cir.thus,because the record in this case contains the facts necessary to decide whether jones claim warrants an injunction of the enforcement of rule,we will review the merits of jones preliminary injunction motion.
analysis of jones preliminary injunction motion 
as noted supra,a court decision on whether to grant a motion for preliminary injunction involves a balancing of the following factors the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the merits whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted the probability that granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others and whether the injunction advances the public interest.see six clinics holding,at see also overstreet,at.
likelihood of success on the merits 
application of the turner factors 
to determine the likelihood that jones will succeed on the merits of his claim that rule violates his first amendment right to communication,see brooks,at,we must apply the turner factors.see turner,at.holding that w hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.see also supra part setting forth the turner factors.importantly,the turner standard is not a least restrictive alternative test requiring prison officials to set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant constitutional complaint.see flagner wilkinson,cir.issues involving the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in the judgment of prison officials are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security in most circumstances should be accorded deference.id.at citing bell wolfish,d.
with respect to the first factor whether there is a valid,rational connection between the regulation and a legitimate government interest jones concedes that rule furthers the legitimate government interest of preventing prisoners from committing fraud under the ucc.see lewis caruso,cv,wl,at,the abusive practice of prisoners filing baseless liens ucc financing statements for the purpose of harassment and credit impairment of the alleged debtor almost always a state or federal official involved with securing the prisoner incarceration is well documented.citing numerous cases of prisoners fraudulent use of the ucc to harass government employees johns.dep t of,cv,wl,at,p rison officials have a penological interest in preventing inmates from possessing materials that may promote criminal activity.
as to the second factor whether rule leaves michigan inmates other opportunities to access materials defendants argue that by limiting the allowable works to scholarly and statutory materials,defendants exclude all manuals on fraudulent liens and other ucc abuses,as well as forms generated for ucc abusive filings,but allow in legitimate publications that address the ucc in general.defs.br.moreover,defendants contend that,should a prisoner materials be confiscated or rejected,rule allows him to request a hearing on the issue,and the appeal from that hearing involves the same mdoc grievance procedure an inmate would use to contest the rejection or confiscation of any other mail.jones counters that,rule prevents access to legitimate ucc publications that can be understood by unsophisticated prisoners,as opposed to treatises and statutes that are beyond their level of comprehension.for the reasons that follow,we are inclined to side with defendants on this issue.
other michigan federal district courts have found that mdoc pd affords prisoners reasonable alternatives for prohibited material such that it does not infringe on their first amendment rights.see strickland caruso,wl,at,the resources of the mdoc are limited and the court must accord deference to the solutions implemented by prison officials to combat the very serious problem of fraud perpetrated by prisoners.hudson.dep t of,cv,wl,at,finding that mdoc prisoners had adequate alternatives because they could read a wide variety of other political,economic,philosophical and legal materials,and that because they are prohibited from engaging in business or commerce while incarcerated,they had no need to possess ucc material hardin,wl,at finding that policy preventing prisoners from possessing books,pamphlets,forms or other material regarding actions that can be taken under the ucc,while still permitting them to possess publications from the law library setting forth the statute or providing a scholarly legal analysis of the ucc,was not unconstitutional lewis,wl,at.we find the analysis in lewis caruso to be particularly instructive.there,the district court found that rule satisfied the second turner factor,reasoning 
the mdoc mail policy represents a rational means by which to achieve the legitimate goal of preventing prisoners from engaging in fraudulent and illegal behavior.while the policy directive prevents prisoners from possessing books,pamphlets,forms or other material regarding actions that can be taken under the ucc,prisoners were still permitted to possess publications in the law library,such as michigan compiled laws annotated,that set forth the statute or provide a scholarly legal analysis of the ucc.the court concludes,therefore,that there exists a valid,rational connection between the policies at issue and a legitimate government interest.
jones argument that the effectiveness of an administrative hearing to determine whether mdoc officials used rule in violation of a prisoner first amendment rights is undermined by the rule inherent vagueness is not.unlike the cases on which jones relies,in which courts invalidated ordinances because the bounds of official discretion were defined so imprecisely as to invite action in violation of the first amendment,see,leonardson city of east lansing,cir,here,rule is not so vague that it would allow mdoc officials unbridled discretion to impermissibly ban materials.in leonardson,this court struck down an ordinance that allowed the town mayor to establish a police line to prevent a political demonstration if it was necessary to prevent,suppress,or contain any event that may become a public disturbance.id.at.we determined that the ordinance lacked a meaningful and explicit standard setting forth the circumstances under which the mayor could establish a police line to suppress events.id.we noted that the broad language would allow the mayor to suppress events that enjoy first amendment protection based merely on his belief that a public disturbance would occur,explaining 
the mayor order need not be conditioned upon the existence of an imminent threat of property destruction or violence or upon any other meaningful and explicit standard.accordingly,the ordinance impermissibly delegates discretionary authority to the chief of police and mayor to inhibit the exercise of first amendment freedoms by enforcing the o rdinance in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.
at citing kolender lawson,d.
here,rule is not so vague that mdoc officials conducting an administrative hearing would be able to exclude materials for impermissible reasons.see thompson campbell,cir upholding regulation where it permitted a broad range of publications to be sent,received,and read,allowing prisoners alternative means to exercise their rights to receive and read publications see also carlton fassbender,cir table upholding mdoc procedure against constitutional challenge by a prisoner alleging that the procedure violated his rights to due process and to access the courts.moreover,whereas leonardson involved the evaluation of a city ordinance,we must include in our analysis,the fact that this case involves the evaluation of a prison regulation.jones campbell,cir c ourts should be particularly conscious of the measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials in gauging the validity of a regulation.
under the third turner factor,we must consider the impact accommodation will have on guards and other inmates,and on the allocation of prison resources generally.washington harper,d.defendants argue that the injunction would drain prison resources and distract prison staff from their responsibilities by requiring them to attend to inmates fraudulent liens.defendants rely on the affidavit of richard stapleton,an administrator in mdoc office of legal affairs,which provides that inmates engaging in ucc abuse may intimidate staff from performing necessary functions or distract public officials from their duties.the affidavit also sets forth detailed descriptions of examples of situations where mdoc prisoners filed fraudulent ucc documents to harass prison staff prior to rule enactment.
however,defendants arguments are undermined by the fact that reasonable alternatives to rule exist at what appears to be a minimal cost to mdoc.as our analysis of the fourth turner factor stresses,effective rules have been developed that allow prisoners to receive a broad range of materials while still limiting fraudulent filings.thus,an injunction of rule would have little practical effect on defendants.under the fourth turner factor,the prisoner bears the burden of challenging a regulation by showing that there are obvious and easy alternatives to the regulation in question,noting 
the existence of obvious,easy alternatives may be evidence that the regulation is not reasonable,but is an exaggerated response to prison concerns.this is not a least restrictive alternatives test but if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests,a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.
turner,at.citing estate of shabazz,d.defendants argue that the district court erred by failing to defer to mdoc prison officials efforts to counteract the serious problem of prisoner fraud.but jones urges us to adopt the district court finding that revising rule to more narrowly define the limits of prisoners access to legitimate materials would not impose a meaningful burden on guards and other inmates and that there are readily available alternatives.
specifically,jones asserts that pd d rule and pd hh rule,which mdoc enacted to prevent inmates from receiving through the mail or otherwise possessing materials that would foster the fraudulent misconduct but allow prisoners access to a wider range of legitimate materials,are sufficient substitutes for rule.rule prohibits mail that is a threat to the security,good order or discipline of the facility,may facilitate or encourage criminal activity or may interfere with the rehabilitation of the prisoner including m ail for the purpose of operating a business enterprise from within the facility.ja.rule prohibits mail advocating or promoting the violation of a statute or federal laws.ja.it is undisputed that defendants have used rules and to confiscate prisoners mail.in fact,in november,mdoc officials confiscated various ucc documents from jones himself after the prison librarian notified them that she believed jones planned to use the documents to file a fraudulent lien.the district court denied jones motion for contempt in which he argued that mdoc should be sanctioned for using rules and to deliberately avoid the effect of the court injunction,noting,mdoc does not need to rely on rule to confiscate materials.although the mdoc has specifically been enjoined from enforcing rule by the court the mdoc is not similarly enjoined from forbidding inmates from possessing materials which might promote criminal activity.ja.the district court ruling strongly suggests that rules and are effective alternatives to rule.
jones also refers the court to an october,email sent from stapleton to all mdoc wardens,entitled notice of preliminary materials,that specifically directs the wardens that the injunction prevented them from confiscating prisoner mail under rule,but reminds them that they could still prohibit prisoners from receiving potentially problematic materials through other means.the email states,in relevant part 
effective immediately,ucc material shall not be rejected under paragraph hh,of pd.
in addition,since the same criteria is used to determine whether ucc material found in a prisoner possession is contraband or not,ucc material found in a prisoner possession shall not be confiscated for this purpose.ucc material that is evidence of a major misconduct charge is still appropriately confiscated and processed in accordance with pd prisoner discipline for example insolence based on staff harassment by filing fraudulent liens.
prisoners are also still prohibited from receiving mail,or having written material in their possession,that poses a threat to the security,good order,or discipline of the facility,may facilitate or encourage criminal activity,or may interfere with the rehabilitation of the prisoner.ucc material that can no longer be rejected under rule,and is not evidence of a misconduct,may still otherwise violate policy based on the nature of the specific material received.therefore,if any ucc material is received in the mail or found in a prisoner possession which would have been rejected or confiscated under rule,norma killough,of corrections facilities administration,is to be contacted as soon as possible for direction on how to proceed 
ex.accordingly,through this email,mdoc concedes that wardens can and should continue to confiscate materials without resorting to rule.
finally,jones has attached a november,letter he wrote to defendant caruso,suggesting the following alternative wording of rule

ex.though we are not suggesting that defendants should adopt jones preferred wording,the fact that the record includes no evidence that defendants responded to jones letter indicates that they have not seriously considered ways to rewrite the rule that would put an end to this dispute.
we are aware that t he resources of the mdoc are limited and the court must accord deference to the solutions implemented by prison officials to combat the very serious problem of fraud perpetrated by prisoners.marr caruso,cv,wl,at,finding that prison policies used to reject prisoner mail relating to fraudulent ucc filings satisfied the turner factors.however,mdoc implementation of other permissible methods used to confiscate prisoners materials,including those of jones himself,is clear evidence that defendants have alternative means of affecting rule intended purpose preventing prisoners fraudulent ucc filings.moreover,should mdoc face any internal problems resulting from targeting prisoners materials through other means,the record suggests that they would be de minimis,at.prison officials need not show that no reasonable method exists by which prisoners rights can be accommodated without creating bona fide prison problems.the october internal email states that any prison official who encounters potentially problematic material,should immediately notify the prison administrators.it is unlikely that this alternative will impose more than a de minimis cost on defendants.mauro arpaio,cir finding that proposed exceptions to prison ban on certain sexually explicit materials an inmate reading room for sexually explicit materials and psychological testing to determine which inmates are fit for receipt of such materials imposed more than a de minimis cost on valid penological interests and were therefore inadequate alternatives to the prison policy.further,defendants do not account for the fact that michigan passed a law making the filing of fraudulent ucc financing statements with the secretary of state a felony.see supra at explaining the background of.comp.laws.this provides yet another tool mdoc can use to prevent the abuses that rule was designed to address.in short,the record demonstrates that defendants can and do regulate michigan prisoners materials without the use of rule,so the third and fourth turner factors favor jones.
on balance,the turner factors appear to favor jones,and we are not convinced that rule is necessary to further defendants undoubtedly legitimate interest in preventing prisoners from filing fraudulent ucc liens.thus,we find that jones is likely to succeed on the merits of his first amendment claim.
we also must consider jones likelihood of success on the merits of his vagueness claim.in his complaint,jones asserted that dom was facially unconstitutionally overbroad,ja,regulating legitimate materials as well as those related to unlawful or fraudulent activities.in a footnote in the r r,the magistrate judge explained that although he believed that the regulation was overbroad,jones was better off challenging rule under a analysis.ja.the magistrate judge reasoned 
although jones has framed his attack on the directive on the basis of overbreadth and i agree that it is overbroad this alone is insufficient to find a constitutional violation.overbreadth has little or no role in civil litigation dealing with prisons internal operations.some quality is essential if a prison is to have any guidelines it is impossible to foresee all literature that may pose a threat to safety and security.borzych frank,cir internal citations omitted.however,the policy directive lends itself to a analysis.the doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.bailey carter,wl,at cir kolender lawson,d internal citations omitted.however,an individual raising a facial attack must demonstrate that the regulation is impermissibly vague in all of its its application to his case.walker mccaughtry,wl,at cir vill.of hoffman estates flipside hoffman estates,d.
ja.the district court adopted the magistrate judge conclusion that rule was impermissibly vague,explaining 
the only material rule clearly permits is access to scholarly ucc publications treatises written for use and study by lawyers and law students.does it include treatises written by a business professor at the university of pennsylvania does it include all government publications composed for layman use alternatively,if it were interpreted to include government publications,would publications written by organizations for pro se litigants be forbidden 
although the district court adopted the magistrate judge conclusion that rule was unconstitutionally vague,it appears to have issued the injunction on the basis of jones first amendment right to send legal mail,simply noting the vagueness issue as an afterthought.nonetheless,the fact that jones has argued the issue as a separate basis on which this court could uphold the injunction makes it appropriate to consider in our evaluation of jones likelihood of success on the merits.
a law or regulation can be deemed unconstitutionally vague if men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application connally constr.although the vagueness doctrine was originally used to invalidate on due process grounds penal statutes that failed to define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited,kolender lawson,d,courts have frequently applied it in the first amendment context.see,kreimer bureau of police for the town of morristown,cir noting that a vagueness challenge can nullify an ambiguous law that chills protected first amendment activities.however,it is that a party whose conduct is legitimately regulated by a statute or regulation lacks standing to challenge it on the basis that it is unconstitutional as applied to others.see,parker levy,d concluding that where appellee knew that his public statements violated the regulations in question,he had no standing to challenge them as unconstitutionally vague united states hill,cir finding that defendant had no standing to argue that gambling statutes were void for vagueness where he had fair notice that his conduct was prohibited by those statutes wright miller,fed.prac.proc.juris d west regularly,a party whose conduct is legitimately regulated by a statute asserts that it should be stricken down because it is unconstitutional as applied to others.such invitations to consider situations not directly before the court ordinarily are rejected.
jones knew that his materials violated mdoc policy directive.in fact,his complaint expressly states that following the enactment of dom,which was soon superseded by rules and,plaintiff additionally made defendant trombley aware that he was a certified paralegal,and that he possessed books,pamphlets and other materials that directly covered subject matter related to the use of ucc which was now deemed prohibited by the dom.ja emphasis added.given that jones clearly understood that rule prohibited the materials he possessed,he has no standing to raise a vagueness claim on behalf of other mdoc prisoners,and the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider the claim,precluding the possibility that jones could succeed on its merits.
irreparable injury 
while the likelihood of success prong is the most important to our analysis and often determinative in first amendment cases,see connection,at,we proceed to consider the other three prongs of the preliminary injunction analysis as they relate to jones claims.
rule implicates jones first amendment rights,and the supreme court has long held that t he loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.see elrod burns,d see also g v lounge.liquor control comm n,cir v iolations of f irst a mendment rights constitute per se irreparable injury.newsom norris,cir e ven minimal infringements upon first amendment values constitutes irreparable injury sufficient to justify injunctive relief.accordingly,this factor clearly favors jones.
balancing of the harms 
next,we must balance the harm that mdoc prisoners would face from the enforcement of rule against that which defendants would face if we uphold the injunction.the district court adopted the magistrate judge conclusion that the possible harm to prisoners caused by rule enforcement pending resolution of the case outweighed any potential harm to defendants from the temporary enjoinment of the rule.the magistrate judge reasoned that because defendant caruso could issue a superceding director office memorandum at her discretion,defendants could immediately replace the rule with a narrower but effective directive which addresses the issue at hand.ja.in fact,as noted by the magistrate judge in his amended r r,defendants did quickly replace rule with the amended rule,although that rule was also deemed impermissible by the district court.
defendants argue that the potential injury to jones from lifting the injunction while the case proceeds is minimal,and that the district court failed to consider defendants duty to protect the public interest.however,we believe that the balancing of the harms favors jones.we have previously noted that 
t he purpose of the balance of harms test is to underscore the flexibility which traditionally has characterized the law of equity.it permits the district court,in its discretion,to grant a preliminary injunction even where the plaintiff fails to show a strong or substantial probability of ultimate success on the merits of his claim,but where he at least shows serious questions going to the merits and irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs any potential harm to the defendant if the injunction is issued.
friendship materials.brick,cir.as the magistrate judge explained,a decision enjoining the enforcement of rule and,later,rule was a temporary solution while defendants amended the rule to conform to the court opinion.moreover,any claim of harm by defendants is made less compelling by the fact that defendants are currently combating prisoners fraudulent use of materials with other regulations,rules and,for instance.see supra part.
public interest 
lastly,we must consider whether the public interest favors the issuance of the preliminary injunction.the magistrate judge considered the issue within his analysis of balancing of the harms.as noted supra,the district court adopted the magistrate judge conclusion that the public interest in preventing prisoners abusive filings would not be harmed by the preliminary injunction because the defendants could quickly modify rule later,rule to prevent such filings ucc without infringing on their constitutional rights.we agree that this final factor favors jones,but for different reasons.
we have explained that it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party constitutional rights.connection,at.however,we have also found that in first amendment cases,the determination of where public interest lies is dependent on a determination of the likelihood of success on the merits of the first amendment challenge,because if the regulation in question is likely to be deemed constitutional,the public interest will not be harmed by its enforcement.we have previously explained that because the public as a whole has a significant interest in ensuring equal protection of the laws and protection of first amendment liberties the public interest would be advanced by issuance of a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of those portions of challenged statutes that are of questionable constitutionality.dayton area visually impaired persons,fisher,cir.given that rule may infringe on prisoners first amendment rights,the injunction is in the public interest.
conclusion 
although the district court incorrectly applied a heightened level of review to rule,a balancing of the relevant factors clearly demonstrates that the court issuance of the preliminary injunction was proper.we recognize defendants concern over the rampant problem of prisoners filing of fraudulent liens,and we do not question that in most cases,we defer to prison administrators professional judgment in regard to instituting and enforcing prison policies.overton bazzetta,d reversing ruling invalidating an mdoc policy restricting prisoner visitation rights and emphasizing the need to defer to prison professionals see also beard banks,d policy of pennsylvania department of corrections restricting access to newspapers,magazines,and photographs by certain inmates was justified by the need to provide particularly difficult prisoners with increased incentives for better prison behavior bruce ylst,cir noting that federal courts must remember that the duty to protect inmates constitutional rights does not confer the power to manage prisons or the capacity to prison administrators,for which we are.nonetheless,here,such deference is not warranted.
defendants have not provided us with any reasons why they can not adequately regulate prisoners ownership and use of materials through alternative regulations,rules and.comp.laws,and other prison regulations.moreover,defendants declined to file a reply brief in which they would have had the opportunity to contest jones arguments regarding their use of these alternative means of regulation.had defendants given us some indication that the cost of regulating ucc materia
