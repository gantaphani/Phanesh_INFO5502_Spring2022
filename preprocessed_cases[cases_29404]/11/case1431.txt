we hereby vacate our prior opinion in this case,filed on march,and substitute this opinion in its place.
in this case,an appeal of conviction and sentence of certain federal mail fraud offenses relating to the distribution of pharmaceuticals,we consider the proper loss calculation under when a defendant who possesses a restricted right to distribute a product fraudulently diverts that product to buyers.we find that the appropriate focus of the loss calculation is the marginal value of the unrestricted right to distribute over the restricted right,and we find that a reasonable estimate of this value is the profit obtained by the defendant from sales.in addition,we consider the argument that,in a conspiracy of two people,only one person sentence may be enhanced for playing a leadership role in the offense.rejecting this assertion,we find that each participant can be sentenced as a leader,assuming that both exercise authority and control over a distinct portion of the criminal activity.on these and related issues,we affirm.
background 
david neal yeager worked as the vice president of sales and marketing for respiratory distributors,distributors,a small company located in foley,alabama,whose business it was to distribute prescription drugs at wholesale prices to pharmacies or other outlets.richard powell,the owner of distributors,also owned respiratory druggist,druggist,a pharmacy that sold prescription drugs directly to home health patients.
misrepresenting himself as a vice president for druggist,yeager contacted boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals,bipi in march to negotiate a contract for druggist to sell atrovent,a prescription drug for the treatment of respiratory conditions created and manufactured by bipi,to druggist home health patients.yeager negotiated the contract without the immediate knowledge of powell.under the terms of the contract,bipi would supply atrovent at per box.bipi offered druggist this low price on atrovent based on the understanding that it would only be resold to druggist home health patients,and not to other pharmacies or wholesalers.
to ensure that druggist sold only to its home health patients,bipi required druggist to submit both an initial utilization report and supplemental reports every month thereafter,which would list detailed information about all patients receiving atrovent through druggist.based on these utilization reports,bipi would determine the proper amount of atrovent to ship.under the contract,bipi could immediately terminate its relationship with druggist if these reports were not filed or if any atrovent was diverted to health patients.
powell contends he was unaware until september that any of his companies had a contract with bipi for the distribution of atrovent.throughout this time period and despite the restricted distribution contemplated under the contract with bipi,yeager repeatedly diverted large shipments of atrovent to unauthorized buyers.these shipments were sent to the unauthorized buyers by interstate commercial carrier.during the relevant period,the gross profit to powell corporations from these sales was.bipi itself marketed atrovent to wholesale distribution companies,like distributors,at a price generally higher than the druggist contract price.the crux of the fraudulent conduct in this case was that yeager obtained atrovent at the low price offered under the druggist contract and then diverted the product to distributors.distributors then atrovent at a market advantage,effectively undercutting bipi own distribution scheme.
both the initial utilization report and the monthly utilization reports required under the contract were not submitted.by january,bipi was concerned about the reporting failures and suspected that diversion of atrovent was occurring.in march,a representative of bipi contacted powell to discuss bipi concerns and to insist on the prompt and proper disclosure of patient information.following this contact,yeager and powell agreed to continue the extremely profitable deception of bipi by submitting false and fraudulent utilization reports containing the type of information that bipi had requested.yeager prepared and submitted the reports to bipi.both yeager and powell instructed employees of distributors and druggist in conduct designed to conceal their example,by answering the shared telephone line as rdi to draw attention away from the distributors operation.
in june,unsatisfied with the reports,bipi requested an audit of the facilities in foley,alabama.yeager and powell were both present for and participants in the audit.the documents obtained by bipi representatives during the audit were continuations of the shell game in the words of a bipi representative,the documents were worthless.at.powell ordered employees to set up rows of empty boxes in the warehouse,with boxes of atrovent only on top,to give the appearance that their inventory of atrovent was much larger than in reality to create the impression that atrovent was not being diverted to other purchasers.powell testified at trial that,had he and yeager turned over the true inventory records,their scheme would have been revealed.yeager planned the bipi visit and ensured that employees followed the instructions designed to deceive the visitors.
after the audit,yeager continue to remit utilization reports that did not contain accurate and complete information for the patients to whom druggist was supposedly distributing atrovent.bipi learned in december that the fbi was conducting a criminal investigation related to the atrovent sales,and bipi terminated its relationship with the following month.
both yeager and powell were indicted for their use of the mail system to further their fraudulent scheme.yeager refused to cooperate with federal authorities and put the government to its proof.powell pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement,under which he is currently serving approximately one year in prison.he cooperated with federal authorities in the investigation and testified against yeager during a trial in august.a unanimous jury found yeager guilty on seven counts of mail fraud,in violation of,based on seven shipments of atrovent diverted by yeager from august to august to unauthorized customers through the mail,and of conspiracy to commit mail fraud,also in violation of.the district court sentenced yeager to months in prison,followed by three years of supervised release,and ordered that yeager be jointly and severally liable with his powell for the payment of in restitution to bipi.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of evidence for mail fraud conviction 
yeager argues that the evidence presented at trial can not sustain his fraud conviction because the government failed to prove that bipi reasonably relied on his misrepresentations.he argues that the misrepresentations made could have been easily confirmed false if bipi had felt the need to investigate their veracity,and that bipi failure to do so precludes his conviction under the mail fraud statute.according to yeager,bipi wanted to flood the market and make as much profit as possible from atrovent,because that drug was soon losing its patent protection.thus,bipi did not care whether was adhering to the terms of the distribution contract by selling only to home health patients and could not have reasonably relied on any false information provided by yeager as to the customer list.the government argues that reasonable reliance is not required to be proved for conviction.
we review de novo the legal question of whether sufficient evidence exists in the record to support a guilty verdict.united states tinoco,cir,cert.denied,d.when conducting the review of the record,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and resolve all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the jury verdict.id.quoting united states to,cir.the verdict will be upheld unless no reasonable jury could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
under,a person who,having devised a scheme to defraud,mails any matter through the postal service or any commercial interstate carrier for the purpose of furthering or accomplishing that scheme,commits a federal offense punishable by fine and up to five years of imprisonment.the federal mail fraud statute prohibits the use of the mail to further scheme s to defraud.the use of the mail to further these schemes is a distinct evil punishable whether or not the scheme results in completed fraud.because the statute prohibits the scheme to defraud,the government is not required to prove all of the elements of completed fraud to sustain a conviction.neder united states,d.
the supreme court in neder identified materiality as a necessary element,and said in dicta that t he elements of justifiable reliance and damages,for example,plainly have no place in the federal fraud statutes.at.at.we have stated previously that proof of actual reliance by the victim and proof of damages are not required,united states brown,cir citing pelletier zweifel,cir,but we have never clearly stated that proof that the victim reasonably relied on the misrepresentation is unnecessary.in fact,our decision in brown can be read to hold the opposite that a scheme to defraud has not been proved where a reasonable juror would have to conclude that the representation is about something which the victim should,and could,easily they wished to do readily available external sources.at.
the argument that proof of reasonable reliance is unnecessary has a logical appeal if it is true,as we have held,that the government is not required to prove the actual reliance of the victim on the defendant misrepresentations,then it does not make sense to require the government to prove that the reliance was reasonable.on the other hand,the elements of reasonable reliance and materiality analytically overlap both concern the expected effectiveness of the misrepresentations,and it is difficult to describe precisely which element is fulfilled by different forms of proof and argument.
as yeager presents the reasonable reliance element,it requires proof that the particular victim in this case,armed with his or her own knowledge and experience with the situation,did not and could not easily disprove the misrepresentations through access to held or ready information.reasonable reliance,thus,is in this construct a subjective requirement that turns on the particularized response of the actual victim.the supreme court in neder quoted the restatement second of torts to define a material matter fundamentally with an objective one that a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction at question.at.at.the problem,as in most attempts to apply an objective test,is in determining how many of the victim peculiar characteristics to impute to the hypothetical reasonable man.the more characteristics we impute,and we seem to impute quite a few characteristics here in the eleventh circuit,the closer the materiality element approaches the supposedly distinct element of reasonable reliance.
while it might be possible to extricate distinct analytical principles from both elements and,then,determine the exact extent of necessary proof for federal fraud cases in general,it is not necessary to do so in this specific case.first,yeager defense at trial is better cast as a challenge to bipi actual reliance on the misrepresentations.yeager defense challenges the idea that bipi ever relied on the false customer to yeager,bipi never cared about the customer lists because it was motivated solely by the idea of profits before atrovent patent expired.this argument does not challenge whether bipi,having accepted the misrepresentations,did so reasonably.it questions whether bipi ever accepted the misrepresentations in the first place,that is,whether bipi actually relied on the misrepresentations.we have clearly held,however,that actual reliance has no place in a prosecution for federal mail fraud.pelletier,at.
second,assuming that yeager concept of reasonable reliance is a necessary element of federal mail fraud,and assuming that his defense at trial qualifies as a challenge to reasonable reliance,sufficient evidence of reasonable reliance was entered at trial.bipi efforts to monitor the distribution of atrovent under its contract with druggist served as a predicate for reasonable reliance on the misrepresentations made by yeager in the course of the scheme to defraud.audits and requests for corrected and complete information by bipi were deflected by active deception by yeager.the type of information misrepresented,including the lists of patients to whom druggist was supplying atrovent,was not easily obtainable by bipi from another source.we find bipi efforts to be reasonable,repeated attempts to verify the accuracy of yeager and druggist representations,and the common law definition of fraud does not require them to undertake rigorous investigation to pierce the facade presented by the defendant.see,restatement second of torts.
jury instructions 
yeager also argues that the district court erred by failing to give to the jury his preferred instruction on the requirement of reasonable reliance.we review a district court refusal to give a particular jury instruction for abuse of discretion.united states cornillie,cir per curiam.the failure of a district court to give an appropriate instruction is reversible error where the requested instruction was correct was not substantially covered by the charge actually given and dealt with some point in the trial so important that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant ability to conduct his defense.united states chastain,cir,cert.denied sub nom.morris united states,d.
yeager requested instruction provided,in relevant part,that 
a scheme to defraud has not been proved where reasonable jurors would have to conclude that the representation is about something which the alleged victim,boehringer,should,and could,easily it wished to do readily available sources including information it should,and could,easily have obtained from the defendant in a timely fashion as specifically set forth in the executed agreement.
the district court rejected yeager proposed instruction,explaining that the topic was substantially and correctly covered by its preferred charge,drawn from the eleventh circuit pattern jury instructions.
first,procedurally,though yeager did object after the district court refused his proposed instruction,the grounds for objection were only that the district court mistakenly believed that the instruction was an incorrect statement of the law,at i think it an accurate statement of the law,and that yeager preferred the language he used in the instruction,id.i like,judge,the way brown wrote it.the district court,however,also refused the instruction on the basis that its subject matter was duplicative of the other instructions given i think the do know that it really heightens the standard,but i do think it necessary to give it.id.the argument surrounding yeager proposed instruction focused on the perceived need to tell the jury that the person or the victim has to be the victim is to be viewed as a person of ordinary prudence and a reasonable person.id.at.the district court pointed to the standard materiality instruction,which stated that a material fact is a fact that would be important to a reasonable person in deciding whether to engage or not engage in a particular transaction,in declaring yeager supplementary instruction unnecessary.id.at.yeager did not object or respond to this ground for refusal,and his failure to do so should remove this issue from the realm of those validly heard on appeal.see united states,cir to preserve an issue for appeal,a general objection or an objection on other grounds will not suffice.united states dennis,cir to preserve an issue at trial for later consideration by an appellate court,one must raise an objection that is sufficient to apprise the trial court and the opposing party of the particular grounds upon which appellate relief will later be sought.
in addition and as discussed supra,yeager defense seeks to create reasonable doubt as to bipi actual reliance on the misrepresentations.his argument essentially is that bipi did not ac
