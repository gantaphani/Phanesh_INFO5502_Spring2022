in june,the san diego county board of supervisors adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance to govern the operation of adult entertainment businesses within its jurisdiction,which covers the unincorporated portions of the county.the ordinance restricts the hours in which such businesses can operate,requires the removal of doors on peep show booths,and mandates that the businesses disperse to industrial areas of the county.the county purported rationale for the ordinance was to combat negative secondary,disorderly conduct,blight,noise,traffic,property value depreciation,and unsanitary concentrate in and around adult businesses.
the two adult entertainment establishments presently operating in the unincorporated portions of san diego county filed suit.in this appeal,the operators of one of the establishments,déjà vu,appeal the district court decision to uphold the ordinance dispersal requirements.they also appeal the district court dismissal of their state law claim under california government code,which requires zoning laws to conform to the municipality general plan,and the district court decision to sever a provision of the ordinance setting forth the amount of time in which the county had to approve an operating permit for adult establishments.
we hold that the district court manner of severance was in error and reverse on that ground.we affirm in all other respects 
background 
in june,citing to concerns about the surrounding neighborhood,the san diego county board of supervisors adopted a comprehensive set of regulations and licensing procedures governing adult entertainment establishments within its jurisdiction.the ordinances took effect the following month.
magnolia,llc,using property leased from tollis,operates an adult bookstore in the bostonia neighborhood of the county under the name déjà vu.these businesses hereinafter,déjà vu initiated federal and state constitutional challenges against the new ordinances,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
the district court granted summary judgment to the county,upholding the ordinance requirement that adult establishments locate only in industrial zones see fantasyland video,county of san diego,d.the court also dismissed déjà vu state law claim under california government code,regarding conformance to the county general plan.id.at.finally,the district court held that the county permitting regime for adult establishments was unconstitutional because it granted the licensing body an unreasonably long period of time to consider a permit request.id.at.the court opted to sever the offending time limits from the ordinance.id.at.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over déjà vu constitutional claims under,a,and over its state claim under a.we have jurisdiction under.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment and,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party,determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact for trial.see gammoh city of la habra,cir.
iv.discussion 
industrial zone restriction 
the constitutionality of the challenged provision is governed by the framework announced in city of renton playtime theatres,d.as recounted by center for fair public policy maricopa county,cir,this familiar inquiry proceeds in three distinct steps first,the ordinance can not be a complete ban on the protected expression.id.at.second,the ordinance must be or,if with respect to sexual and pornographic speech,its predominate concern must be the secondary effects of such speech in the community.id.at.third,the regulation must pass intermediate scrutiny.it must serve a substantial government interest,be narrowly tailored to serve that interest,and allow for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.id.at.
déjà vu raises two arguments on appeal both relating to the third step.it first contends that a concurrence by justice kennedy in city of los angeles alameda books,d,radically altered the traditional renton framework by imposing an additional burden on the county to show how speech would fare under the new ordinance alternatively,déjà vu argues that the ordinance is unconstitutional under the traditional renton framework because all the potential relocation sites are located within the county industrial zones.we address each in turn.
justice kennedy alameda books concurrence 
to justify a zoning ordinance that restricts sexual and pornographic speech,justice kennedy wrote that a city must advance some basis to show that its regulation has the purpose and effect of suppressing secondary effects,while leaving the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact.at.by adding the last clause,justice kennedy said he was expressing an interest in how speech will fare after the ordinance is enacted.id.at.the city must have some basis to think that its ordinance will suppress secondary effects,but not also the speech associated with those effects.id.at.
in alameda books,the disputed ordinance prohibited multiple adult businesses from operating under the same roof.under justice kennedy construct,the city of los angeles must have had some basis to assume three propositions that this ordinance will cause two businesses to split rather than one to close,that the quantity of speech will be substantially undiminished,and that total secondary effects will be significantly reduced.at.
the first proposition mirrors the alternative avenues of communication requirement under intermediate scrutiny,which requires that the displaced business be given a reasonable opportunity to open and operate.see renton,at.the third proposition restates the requisite substantial governmental interest for regulating adult establishments based on their secondary effects.see id.at.
but what of the second proposition justice kennedy reference to whether the quantity of speech will be left substantially undiminished is shorthand for asking whether the ordinance will impose a significant or material inconvenience on the consumer of the speech.at the time of enactment,the city must have some reasonable basis to believe that interested patrons would,for the most part,be undeterred by the geographic dispersal of the adult establishments.see alameda books,at.i t does not suffice to say that inconvenience will reduce demand and fewer patrons will lead to fewer secondary effects.
justice kennedy then noted that the evidentiary burden to establish these propositions was minimal.see id.at.he found that the city of los angeles had met its initial burden.it had relied on one study and common experience to find a correlation between adult establishments and crime,and could reasonably infer that geographic dispersal of the adult establishments would not necessarily decrease the quantity or accessibility of the speech.id.at.the burden then shifted to the plaintiffs to disprove the city assumptions.id.at.
we reach the same conclusion here.the county legislative record cites to a number of and reports from other jurisdictions,relevant judicial decisions,and public assert a connection between the adult establishments and negative secondary effects.a municipality may rely on these types of sources.see ctr.for fair pub.policy,at.the county could then reasonably infer that isolating of adult businesses to industrial zones would have the purpose and effect of reducing crime,disorderly conduct,and property depreciation,as such zones are located away from residential areas and have little other commercial appeal at night.déjà vu attempt to cast doubt on the county conclusions fails as a matter of law because its expert,daniel linz,a professor in the department of communication law and society program at the university of california santa barbara,did not rebut the county evidence with regard to noise and traffic.the evidence presented by linz addressed only late night crime and property values.the county considered these factors,but its purported rationale for isolating adult businesses to industrial zones also included combating increased noise and traffic.déjà vu failure to address these considerations is fatal under the second step of the renton intermediate scrutiny analysis.see alameda books,at.with regard to noise and traffic,déjà vu failed as a matter of law to cast direct doubt on the county rationale by demonstrating that the county evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes its factual findings.id.
we reject déjà vu contention that alameda books imposed a heightened evidentiary burden on the county to show how speech would fare under the ordinance.so long as there are a sufficient number of suitable relocation sites,the county could reasonably assume that,given the draw of pornographic and sexually explicit speech,willing patrons would not be measurably discouraged by the inconvenience of having to travel to an industrial zone.see alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in judgment see also world wide video,at noting that justice kennedy how speech will fare language c onceptually dovetails with the requirement that an ordinance must leave open adequate alternative avenues of communication.under this scenario,the quantity and accessibility of the speech would not be substantially diminished.
alternative channels of communication under renton 
to satisfy its burden under renton,the county must propose a sufficient number of potential relocation sites to allow déjà vu a reasonable opportunity to operate its business.at.for a site to qualify,it must be considered part of an actual business real estate market for commercial enterprises generally.lim city of long beach,cir.if in an industrial or manufacturing zone,the site must be reasonably accessible to the general public,have a proper,and be suitable for some generic commercial enterprise.topanga press,city of los angeles,cir.finally,the list must account for other relevant zoning restrictions,such as separation requirements,that might affect a site availability.isbell city of san diego,cir.
if the county list is reasonable,the burden shifts to déjà vu to demonstrate that the proposed sites are inadequate or unlikely to ever become available.lim,at.once the relevant market has been properly defined,the factfinder must determine whether the market contains a sufficient number of potential relocation sites for p laintiffs adult businesses.id.at.
availability of relocation sites 
the county proposed potentially available parcels for déjà vu relocation.déjà vu submitted the declaration of a land use expert contesting the availability and suitability of each site.after an exhaustive survey,the district court excluded eight sites for summary judgment purposes.fantasyland,d at.in its briefs and at oral argument,déjà vu did not contest any of the district court individual determinations with respect to these remaining parcels 
déjà vu argument on appeal draws on the county restriction of adult establishments to industrial zoning districts.all adult establishments must relocate to four industrial districts,and.although presumably available for adult establishments,none of these zones allows for general commercial use.uses are restricted to those providing essential support services to manufacturing plants and their personnel.san diego county zoning ordinance see also.according to déjà vu,this total exclusion from commercial zones suggests that it has not been afforded a reasonable opportunity to relocate.see topanga press,at avoiding the question of whether under renton,a business has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to relocate if all relocation sites are within an industrial zone and no commercial zones are offered.
we disagree.déjà vu position confuses two distinct questions.whether or not an industrial zone permits generic commercial business within its borders rests on a legislative policy judgment.asking whether an industrial zone is suitable for generic commercial activity examines the physical characteristics and infrastructure of the land within the zone.the topanga press analysis is concerned only with the latter.see at see also diamond city of taft,cir.in topanga press,we held that manufacturing or industrial zones may comprise part of the relevant market if they are reasonably accessible to the general public and have a proper.at.we did not hold that industrial sites are potentially available for relocations only so long as they may be used for commercial purposes generally.if an industrial site is reasonably accessible and has sufficient infrastructure to be available under topanga,it remains available even if its use for other commercial purposes may be restricted by the zoning law.
in any case,the ordinance at issue here requires that adult businesses be located within industrial zones.any other interpretation of the zoning scheme would zone adult businesses out of the county.as déjà vu does not challenge any of the district court holdings with respect to the suitability of any one of the parcels for generic commercial use,its argument fails.
sufficiency of alternative sites 
the district court determined that the remaining sites,on which eight to adult entertainment businesses could operate simultaneously,were sufficient to allow déj à only affected adult entertainment business in the opportunity to relocate.fantasyland,d at.déjà vu does not challenge this holding,but argues that the district court should have relied on other secondary measurements to assess sufficiency.
we agree that measuring whether the number of proposed sites is sufficient to meet existing demand for sexual or pornographic speech is one of several tools to assess whether a municipality has afforded an adult business a reasonable opportunity to conduct their trade.see young city of simi valley,cir.nevertheless,we can not identify any error in the district court other calculations to justify reversal.
déjà vu contends that the percentage of available acreage theoretically available to adult businesses in unincorporated san diego county is drastically less than the amount approved in renton.see at.furthermore,it asserts that the ratio of potential adult business sites to population in san diego county is much lower than in renton and eight florida municipalities engaged in similar litigation.yet,déjà vu offers no argument or evidence showing that these communities are comparable to unincorporated san diego county in size,population,or demographics.absent such a connection,its calculations are meaningless.
it also must be borne in mind that the city of san diego and the other incorporated municipalities in the county are not governed by this ordinance.the unincorporated portions of the county take up the substantial majority of the land area but only a small fraction of the population of the county as a whole.it may fairly be presumed that most of the commercial property in the county,including property suitable for adult businesses,is located within municipal boundaries and thus outside the territory governed by the ordinance in question.at least where we are dealing with unincorporated areas,it is appropriate to recognize the likely availability of other locations within the same economic market in neighboring municipalities.
violation of county general plan 
déjà vu also claims the zoning ordinance violates california government code,which requires that zoning ordinances be consistent with the general plan of the county.the district court granted the county motion for summary judgment because déjà vu failed to raise the claim in its complaint.fantasyland,d at.
a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.the plaintiff need not detail all the supporting facts.the statement need only give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.conley gibson,d.
on appeal,déjà vu refers to its allegation that the legislative record fails to establish that this statute significantly advances any important governmental interest.the state law claim is purportedly encompassed within this statement.
déjà vu argument is not persuasive.the above allegation was made in support of the following proposition
