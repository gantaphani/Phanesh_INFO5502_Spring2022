background 
in,todd entered into two task order contracts with the government on two construction projects for roof repairs of government buildings.the parties refer to these projects as building and building.the government agreed to amended completion dates,making the completion dates june,for the building project and july,for the building project.due to a series of delays some of which todd alleges were caused by its subcontractors,the government,or other circumstances outside of its control,the projects were not completed and accepted by the government until september,and october,respectively.
at the time,the federal acquisition regulations far required that for each construction contract for or more,a performance report shall be prepared in accordance with agency procedures and that e ach performance report shall be reviewed to ensure that it is accurate and fair.the government issued er to implement far and establish procedures for contractor performance evaluations.see army corps of engineers regulation er.that regulation,inter alia,required n oti ce to the contractor of the performance elements against which his performance will be evaluated a conference with the contractor prior to the issuance of interim unsatisfactory performance ratings of any interim unsatisfactory rating every three months and issuance of a final evaluation within sixty days of substantial completion of the work.id.a c.it also permitted contractors to submit written comments,which should be addressed and included in the report,and allowed contractors to appeal a final unsatisfactory performance evaluation to one level above the contracting officer.id.c,f.the regulation explained that the evaluations would typically be prepared by the resident engineer and reviewed and approved by the contracting officer.id.c.this was apparently the case with todd evaluations.the final evaluations are filed in a central database where the information is stored for at least six years.c er c.the information is then used by contracting officers in determining future contract awards.see.
todd received negative interim performance evaluations from the resident engineer for both projects on february.on march,the resident engineer issued his proposed negative final performance evaluations for both projects pursuant to and er.on april,todd submitted comments protesting the proposed evaluations.these comments primarily took issue with the purported lack of timeliness of its performance,asserting that its subcontractors and other problems that were beyond todd control caused the delays.todd also asserted that it took extraordinary steps to supervise,manage,coordinate and control its subcontractors,that it was responsive to the government concerns,and that its quality control system was adequate.id.the evaluations were not changed as a result of todd comments.
in the final performance evaluations,the resident engineer assigned todd an overall performance rating of unsatisfactory.the resident engineer also assigned unsatisfactory ratings for each project in fifteen individual performance categories.many of these categories,adherence to approved schedule,correction of deficient work in a timely manner,and resolution of delays related to the timeliness of todd performance.todd was also given unsatisfactory ratings in categories such as coordination and control of subcontractor s,quality of workmanship,management of,and cooperation and responsivness.id.the resident engineer also included specific comments expanding on the negative ratings.for example,the resident engineer stated that the f irst submittal was not received until dec,that the c ontractor did not start work until the week of march,and that the c ontractor quality control system allowed subcontractors to field paint damaged roof panels without government approval.id.
following internal reviews within the department of the army,the final evaluations were issued on july.todd sought review by the contracting officer.on april,the contracting officer issued a final decision regarding todd performance,concluding that the u nsatisfactory performance appraisal was justified and all required procedures were followed.
on may,todd filed a complaint in the claims court,alleging that the government failed to follow the proper procedures and that the unsatisfactory performance evaluations were arbitrary and capricious and seeking,inter alia,a declaratory judgment.in this complaint,todd did not challenge any particular performance ratings.instead,it merely pled that the government issued overall unsatisfactory performance evaluations and that these ratings were arbitrary and capricious.in an initial opinion,the claims court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit under the cda because the claim that the performance evaluations were inaccurate and improper relat ed to the contract,as required by the cda.todd i.at.however,it also determined that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief under court of federal claims rule b.todd ii.at.
on august,todd filed its amended complaint as permitted by the claims court.although todd added a series of factual allegations,it again did not specifically identify which unsatisfactory ratings were arbitrary and capricious.the complaint appeared to challenge primarily the unsatisfactory ratings related to todd timeliness of performance for each project,todd asserted that particular delays were caused by its subcontractors,the government,or other unforeseeable event s not caused by todd.for example,it alleged that it had to terminate a subcontractor for default because of unsatisfactory performance that the government delayed decisions about how to approach differing site conditions discovered at one project site and that forty days of inclement weather made work impracticable during one period.in sum,todd alleged that there were significant problems with the unsatisfactory ratings on account of the delays which were caused by unforeseen events,many of which were neither the fault nor the responsibility of todd.todd also alleged that the government failed to comply with the procedural requirements of er.
in its third and final opinion,the claims court reaffirmed that it had subject matter jurisdiction over todd complaint.see todd iii.however,the claims court also held that todd lacked standing to sue for the alleged procedural violations because there was no discernible injury to the plaintiff from the error.id.at.with respect to todd claim that the performance evaluation was unfair and inaccurate,the claims court held that todd did have standing.id.at.however,the court held that todd failed to state a claim under rule b because todd was responsible for the acts of its subcontractors as a matter of law and there was nothing in the amended complaint beyond todd bare assertion of to support any conclusion that assigning unsatisfactory ratings was an abuse of discretion.id.at.
todd timely appealed to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review de novo the claims court determination that it had subject matter jurisdiction,its dismissal of a complaint on the grounds of standing,and its dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b.maropakis carpentry,united states,bank of guam united states.
we first consider the government contention that the claims court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the cda.the tucker act provides the claims court with jurisdiction over any claim by or against,or dispute with,a contractor arising under the cda,including nonmonetary disputes on which a decision of the contracting officer has been issued under section of the cda.a.the cda,however,does not define such a claim.we held in smith,dalton,that the definition of the term claim in the far governs.the far defines claim as a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking,as a matter of right,the payment of money in a sum certain,the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms,or other relief arising under or relating to the contract.emphasis added.the government does not dispute on appeal that there was a final decision of the contracting officer or a written demand seeking relief as a matter of right.the sole dispute here is whether todd requested relief in essence a declaratory judgment that the government performance evaluations were unfair and inaccurate relat es to the contract.if so,it is a claim under the cda,and the claims court has jurisdiction under the tucker act.
congress overall purpose to confer comprehensive jurisdiction under the cda confirms that we should read the definition of claim broadly.we have previously recognized that i n defining the jurisdiction of the claims court over cda disputes,congress has chosen expansive,not restrictive,language.alliant techsystems,united states.the tucker act provides jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim by or against a contractor arising under section a of the cda,including nonmonetary disputes on which a decision of the contracting officer has been issued under section of the cda.a emphases added.in alliant,the government argued that nonmonetary disputes should be read narrowly to exclude disputes arising prior to the completion of work on a contract and disputes that have not yet ripened into a monetary dispute but could if the contractor could convert the claim into one for monetary relief by its own actions.at internal quotation marks omitted.we rejected this narrow reading,emphasizing that the provision begins by broadly granting the court jurisdiction over any claims,uses the nonrestrictive term including,and ends the provision with equally nonrestrictive language concerning nonmonetary disputes.id.we also explicitly recognized that t he far has ensured that review of contract claims will be relatively easy to obtain,by defining the term claim broadly,to include a demand or assertion seeking relief arising under or relating to the contract.id.at.therefore,the broad language of the statute and far provision supports a broad reading of the term claim.
the legislative history of the cda and tucker act also supports a broad reading of the term claim.both the house and senate reports explained that the cda was intended to implement recommendations of the commission on government procurement,at,reprinted in see also,at.the commission on government procurement had recommended that congress e mpower administrative forums to decide all claims or disputes arising under or growing out of or in connection with the administration of government contracts.report of the commission on government procurement.in,when congress amended the tucker act to provide jurisdiction over nonmonetary disputes on which a decision of the contracting officer has been issued under section of the cda,the bill sponsor reiterated the broad scope of disputes covered by the cda.he noted that the bill would amend the tucker act to clarify the power of the court of federal claims to hear appeals of all contracting officers final decisions,regardless of whether the dispute involves a claim for money currently due.cong.rec.daily ed,emphasis added.
not only is the term claim broad in scope,the relating to language of the far regulation itself is a term of substantial breadth.the term related is typically defined as associated connected.see random house webster unabridged dictionary ed see also black law dictionary ed defining related as s tanding in relation connected allied akin oxford english dictionary ed defining relation as any connection,correspondence,or association,which can be conceived as naturally existing between things.
the supreme court has interpreted the term related to broadly.see,celotex edwards,d holding that congress jurisdictional grant to bankruptcy courts to hear proceedings related to a bankruptcy case suggests a grant of some breadth and includes,inter alia,suits between third parties which have an effect on the bankruptcy estate morales trans world airlines,d holding that preemption provision of airline deregulation act preempting laws relating to rates,routes,or services of any air carrier should be broadly construed shaw delta air lines,d holding that state law relates to an employee benefit plan and is therefore preempted by erisa if it has a connection with,or reference to,such a plan.similarly,in tyco healthcare group lp ethicon endo surgery,we recognized that i n general,related to means one thing has some connection to another thing,and i n legal parlance,the term has similar breadth.we therefore interpreted the contractual phrase related to pending litigation broadly.id.at.
in line with this authority,we have previously held that to be a claim relating to the contract under the cda,the claim must have some relationship to the terms or performance of a government contract.applied united states,the performance evaluations at issue have a direct connection and association with todd government contracts and,under this ordinarily broad understanding of the phrase,tyco,at,appear to be relat ed to the contract.while the unsatisfactory performance evaluations may not relate to the terms of the contract itself,they relate to todd performance under the contract.as the claims court recognized 
the subject of the evaluations is the quality of the contractor performance under the terms of the contract as a matter of logic,a performance evaluation relates to the contractor performance under the contract,in the same way that any evaluation relates to the thing evaluated.
blr grp.of,united states,quoting todd i.at.
the government does not contend that the contracting officer decision regarding the negative performance evaluations bore no relationship to todd performance under the contract.rather,relying on paragon energy united states,the government argues that todd claim can not relat e to the contract unless it is based on a valid contractual theory,breach of contract or mistake.paragon imposes no such limitation.while as a general matter paragon found that the cda statute should not be interpreted quite so broadly as its language at first blush would suggest,it recognized that the language is obviously quite broad.id.at.it found that a narrower interpretation was required only in one respect the term claim should not be interpreted to include a challenge that the legislative history showed congress intended to exclude.id.at.
specifically,the court of claims held that a challenge to the government denial of a request for contract modification under public law was not a claim under the cda.id.at.public law gave government agencies the discretionary authority to modify contracts if the modifications would facilitate the national defense.id.at.congress was concerned that a bill which granted cda jurisdiction over public law challenges would allow agencies to settle claims independent of their legal or contractual merits,horse trade settlements,which could only be done through resort to public law with its attendant safeguards including congressional review.paragon,at quoting,at.therefore,congress passed a final version of the bill that address ed the concerns expressed by several senate committees that the act not permit the contracting officer or the agency boards to grant the discretionary relief authorized by public law.id.at quoting cong.rec.daily ed.
