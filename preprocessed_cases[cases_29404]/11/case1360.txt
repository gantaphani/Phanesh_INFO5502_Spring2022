background 
in,cory,a kansas farmer,executed a purchase order for five buildings from midwest steel span,which is located in overland park,kansas.apparently,midwest then either sold or transferred the purchase order to universal steel factory of kansas city,missouri,which placed the order with defendant steel factory corporation sfc in pennsylvania.cory received the building materials and paid defendant universal steel buildings corporation usbc,which is also located in pennsylvania.cory erected the buildings.
in,after one of the buildings collapsed in the wind,cory ordered replacement parts.defendant aztec steel building,asb,another corporation located in pennsylvania,shipped the parts to cory.in,cory ordered more replacement parts and finished repairing the building.
in june,another building collapsed in high winds.and in,the building that cory had repaired in collapsed again in the wind.cory complained to defendant gary bonacci,sfc plant manager,and then to the kansas attorney general consumer protection division.bonacci had the buildings inspected by an engineer,who concluded that the mode of failure in both buildings appears to be from a lack of resistance to foundation rotation.the buildings should have had a concrete slab as described in the foundation manual.record on appeal roa,doc,ex.m at.cory retained an engineer,who simply opined that the steel arch framing of both of these structures failed from forces exerted on them from wind,doc.at.in march,the attorney general office concluded that there had been no violation of the kansas consumer protection act.

discussion 
personal jurisdiction 
we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction.benton cameco,cir.where,as here,a dismissal is entered without an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction.id.we resolve any factual disputes in the plaintiff favor in determining whether that burden has been met.id.at.
service of a summons is a means of establishing a court jurisdiction over a defendant.james moore et,moore federal practice ed.this case requires that we assess the territorial limits of such service.consequently,we consider first the federal,and then the state statutory bases that would allow the federal district court in kansas to reach into pennsylvania to acquire jurisdiction over sfc,bonacci,and the davises.
cory argues that the district court should have followed the fourth and eleventh circuits and ruled that rico provides a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction over any person in any judicial district in which such person resides,is found,has an agent,or transacts his affairs.d.the defendants counter that the district court followed the better reasoned decisions of the second,seventh,and ninth circuits,which hold that rico,when raised in the proper venue,extends personal jurisdiction into any judicial district of the united states if necessary to satisfy the ends of justice.id.b.for the reasons expressed below,we join the second,seventh,and ninth circuits and hold that subsection b of,rather than subsection d,gives rico its nationwide jurisdictional reach.
where congress has statutorily authorized nationwide service of process,such service establishes personal jurisdiction,provided that the federal court exercise of jurisdiction comports with fifth amendment due process.see peay bellsouth med.assistance plan,cir.our initial inquiry,then,is whether rico service of process provision,potentially confers jurisdiction by authorizing service of process.in relevant part,the statute provides 
a any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any person may be instituted in the district court of the united states for any district in which such person resides,is found,has an agent,or transacts his affairs.
b in any action under section of this chapter in any district court of the united states in which it is shown that the ends of justice require that other parties residing in any other district be brought before the court,the court may cause such parties to be summoned,and process for that purpose may be served in any judicial district of the united states 
c in any civil or criminal action or proceeding instituted by the united states under this chapter in the district court of the united states for any judicial district,subpenas sic issued by such court to compel the attendance of witnesses may be served in any other judicial district 
d all other process in any action or proceeding under this chapter may be served on any person in any judicial district in which such person resides,is found,has an agent,or transacts his affairs.
in,the ninth circuit identified subsection b as providing for service of process upon,and the conferral of personal jurisdiction over,defendants residing beyond the federal court district.butcher union local sdc,cir.the court did not,however,address subsection d service provision.the following year,the seventh circuit followed the ninth,stating that subsection b creates personal jurisdiction by authorizing service.lisak mercantile bancorp,cir.but it too did not mention subsection d.that subsection did not rise to prominence until ten years later,when the eleventh circuit identified subsection d as projecting personal jurisdiction nationwide.republic of panama bcci holdings luxembourg,cir.but that court did not pause long over the question,and oddly,it cited lisak for support.bcci holdings,at.the fourth circuit soon joined the fray,settling on subsection d.esab group,centricut,cir.but the court did not observe the contrary position of the seventh and ninth circuits,and it only mentioned subsection b in passing,characterizing it as a venue provision.id.
the first federal appellate court to actually analyze full text and offer reasoning for its choice of subsections was the second circuit.in pt united can crown cork seal,cir,the court conducted a comprehensive and sequential reading of the statute,concluding that subsection b is the correct jurisdictional provision.the court based its conclusion on three points.first,subsection a sets venue in any district in which a defendant resides,is found,has an agent,or transacts his affairs,a,thereby suggesting that an action can only be brought in a district court where personal jurisdiction based on minimum contacts is established as to at least one defendant,pt united,at.second,subsection b authorizes service of a summons on other parties residing beyond the venued district if necessary to further the ends of justice.id.quoting b.by imposing the quoted limitations,congress expressed a preference that defendants not be unnecessarily haled into unexpected forums.id.at.and third,subsection d reference to a ll other process must mean process different than a summons or a government subpoena,both of which are dealt with in previous subsections.id.at quoting d.
we find this reasoning persuasive and consistent with congressional intent in its report on the organized crime control act of,which gave
