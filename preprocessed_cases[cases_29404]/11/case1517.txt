background 
the cvd statute is a remedial measure that provides relief to domestic manufacturers by imposing duties upon imports of comparable foreign products that have the benefit of a subsidy from the foreign government.a.the statute mandates that if the government of a country or any public entity within the territory of a country is providing a countervailable subsidy with respect to the production or exportation of specific merchandise,then there shall be imposed upon such merchandise a countervailing duty,in addition to any other duty imposed,equal to the amount of the net countervailable subsidy.id.
commerce initiated a cvd investigation on multilayered wood flooring from china in november in response to a petition from domestic producers commerce limited its individual examination to those companies accounting for the largest volume of imports,and selected fine furniture as a mandatory respondent.
during the investigation,commerce sent out questionnaires to analyze an allegation that the government of china subsidized the respondents electricity costs.among other things,commerce sought draft provincial price proposals for and for each province in which the mandatory respondents were located it is undisputed that fine furniture provided all of the information requested of it,while the government of china did not 
commerce determined that the government of china decision not to provide all of the requested information was a failure to cooperate to the best of its ability.specifically,commerce requested information for and documenting how electricity rates were determined for each province in which mandatory respondents were located,including draft provincial price proposals.the government of china declined to provide this information,creating a gap in the record.
accordingly,commerce applied an adverse inference to find that the electricity program provided a financial contribution and was specific to the identified respondents.commerce also applied adverse inferences to determine the benchmark price for is,the price that could have constituted adequate remuneration.commerce compared the respondents reported electricity costs with the calculated benchmark price to determine the benefit that respondent companies received under the electricity program

the role of adverse inferences 
fine furniture appeal calls on us to decide whether commerce properly applied adverse inferences to substitute for information of the purported governmental subsidy not known to the mandatory respondent and not provided by the government.pursuant to a,commerce is required to impose countervailing duties on merchandise that is produced with the benefit of government subsidies.a foreign government sale of goods to a company within a particular industry for less than adequate remuneration is a common type of subsidy.see e iv.such a subsidy exists when a foreign government provides a financial contribution to a specific industry and a recipient within the industry receives a benefit as a result of that contribution.b.analyzing all three factors is therefore necessary for commerce to determine whether a cvd must be imposed.
to analyze these factors,commerce often requires information from the foreign government allegedly providing the subsidy.see essar steel united states,d.int l trade,rev on other grounds by.in particular,commerce asks the foreign government to provide information regarding whether that government provides a financial contribution and whether that contribution is specific to an first two factors of the statutory requirement for a subsidy.commerce requests this information from foreign governments because,normally,those governments are in the best position to provide information regarding the administration of their alleged subsidy programs,including eligible recipients.id.at.
