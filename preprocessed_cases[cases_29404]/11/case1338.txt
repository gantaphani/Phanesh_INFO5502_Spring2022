background 
roland and dawn arnall created the general partnership roda drilling company in.app.roda,llc,and the roland and dawn arnall living trust are partners of.
in april,the arnalls first met with richard siegal,a principal of palace exploration company,palace operating company,b r exploration,bistate oil management,and oil and gas title holding.the purpose of the meeting was to investigate potential oil and gas investments,which would be managed by siegal through palace.app.after several discussions,the arnalls agreed to participate.roda drilling,wl,at.
the parties agreed that roda would provide funding to palace for the purchase of oil and gas properties.id.palace would hold the properties in its own name so the parties might benefit from palace alleged reputation in the marketplace,managing and developing the properties on behalf of the arnalls,and paying roda revenues from the properties.app.under the agreement,roda could request transfer of record title to the properties at any time.app.in addition to capital investment funds,roda was to undertake deferred payment obligations to palace promissory note obligations as compensation to palace and as part of the intangible drilling costs of the properties.app.roda was to pay these additional promissory note obligations out of any returns on the properties.app.these notes ostensibly supported roda tax deductions for intangible drilling costs,app,however,the internal revenue service has since indicated that it may challenge these deductions based on roda lack of record title to the properties,app.see also roda drilling,wl,at.
in may,roda provided palace million as its initial capital contribution.app.throughout,roda invested million,and over the next four years roda invested many more millions of dollars in various properties,all of which were held in the name of palace.app.from through,roda invested million in cash,and orally agreed to invest an additional billion in notes.app.roda has invested nearly billion in cash since to preserve the value of its properties,for an overall total investment of nearly billion.app.
remarkably,no writing was ever executed by both parties on either the capital investments or the promissory note payments.app.however,palace did attempt to memorialize the agreement terms on at least two occasions.in,palace delivered to roda a proposed prospect agreement,which explicitly required palace to transfer record title to the roda properties within thirty days of a written request.app,at.palace executed this agreement,but roda did not.app.in addition,palace delivered to roda a turnkey drilling contract.app.see aplee.br.at.roda declined to sign this contract,stating that the parties had not reached a full meeting of the minds on all the terms of the deal.app.see also app.over the years,the parties have maintained their relationship however,on two occasions,roda has requested transfer of record title to its properties,but due to administrative issues the transfers,while attempted,were never completed.app.see also roda drilling,wl,at.the parties dispute whether palace holds a security interest in the roda properties or whether the transfer of title is conditioned on roda satisfaction of the promissory note agreement.app,aplt.br.at aplee.br.at.
in approximately,the arnalls became concerned about their investments with palace,app,and retained consultants to assist them with the oil and gas investments.app.as a result of the consultants findings,roda requested transfer of title to the properties in late so it could effectively manage them and implement its own business and investment decisions.app.at that point,palace linked the transfer of title to roda satisfaction of its outstanding obligations to siegal and palace,including requests for additional capital and promissory note payments.app.since june,roda has been working directly with robert zinke,the manager of the largest firm operating many of the properties.app.during and,roda met with palace several times in an effort to resolve the dispute,including in september.app.thus far,the parties have not been able to resolve their issues,and palace has refused to transfer record title to any of the oil and gas properties despite roda requests.app.
after an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge ordered transfer of record title to roda of all interests,properties,and assets beneficially held by palace.roda drilling,wl,at.palace claims the magistrate erred in failing to apply the heightened standards applicable when granting a mandatory preliminary injunction that alters the status quo finding that roda will sustain irreparable injury sufficient to warrant such an injunction concluding that roda has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits in its breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims holding that roda made a strong showing that the balance of harms weighs in its favor and failing to require that roda post a bond or otherwise ensure satisfaction of its alleged billion in outstanding obligations to palace.aplt.br.at.
discussion 
we review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal ashcroft,cir,affirmed en banc,cir per curiam,affirmed,d dominion video satellite,echostar satellite,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it commits an error of law,or is clearly erroneous in its preliminary factual findings.dominion video,at internal quotation marks omitted.in our previous cases,we have characterized an abuse of discretion as an arbitrary,capricious,whimsical,or manifestly unreasonable judgment.winnebago tribe of stovall,cir quoting coletti cudd pressure control,cir.we will set aside a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion when the district court applies the wrong legal standard in granting a motion for such an injunction.dominion video,at citing scfc ilc,visa,usa,cir.because the standard for abuse of discretion is high,and we find that the magistrate judge clearly set forth its reasoning for granting the injunction,we affirm.see winnebago tribe,at.
application of a heightened standard 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,the moving party must demonstrate four factors a likelihood of success on the merits a likelihood that the movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief that the balance of equities tips in the movant favor and that the injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,d see also o centro,at.because the primary goal of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo,courts should be especially cautious when granting an injunction that requires the nonmoving party to take affirmative action a mandatory preliminary injunction before a trial on the merits occurs o centro,at.therefore,before we will grant such relief,we require a movant seeking such an injunction to make a heightened showing of the four factors.id.at.in doing so,our aim is to minimize any injury that would not have occurred but for the court intervention.id.at.while we recognize that mandatory preliminary injunctions are traditionally disfavored,schrier of,cir,when the moving party demonstrates that the exigencies of the case require extraordinary interim relief,the district court may grant the motion upon satisfaction of the heightened burden.o centro,at.
palace argues that the magistrate judge failed to apply the appropriate standard for granting a mandatory preliminary injunction.see aplt.br.at.it claims that the ruling does not identify the requisite exigencies upon which such extraordinary relief may be granted and fails to impose,both implicitly and explicitly,the heightened strong showing burden on roda.id.at.essentially,it argues that,because roda already held complete control over the properties at issue and palace never once contravened roda authority,it was impossible for roda to demonstrate irreparable harm.id.
palace arguments lack merit.the district court methodically laid out the standard it relied upon,citing all four factors,discussing the unusual nature of a mandatory injunction,and declaring that an injunction of this sort must be more closely scrutinized to assure the exigencies of the case support the granting of a remedy that is extraordinary even in the normal course.roda drilling,wl at,quoting o centro,at.the magistrate judge further announced that he had more closely scrutinized the factors to assure that the exigencies of the case support the granting of the motion.id.at.while the court did not discuss the heightened burden explicitly,it is clear from the cited language of the order that the magistrate judge was aware that a mandatory injunction is an unusual form of relief and one that must not be granted without heightened consideration.
palace further claims that the district court failed to identify any particular exigencies that would warrant such relief.the contention that the magistrate judge erred because he failed to engage in the proper analysis ignores the many pages of factual findings and legal analysis in which the magistrate found that roda did not grant palace any interest in the properties,transfer of title was not conditioned on any other obligation roda may have had to palace,palace refused to transfer record title to roda,palace continued up until the date of the order to retain revenues generated from the properties each month,and for a variety of other reasons roda had been suffering and would continue to suffer irreparable harm were the title transfers not effectuated.see id.at.in sum,the magistrate judge,after hearing the evidence,found that roda would be denied the opportunity to make use of its own property during the pendency of litigation without the transfer of legal title.surely,palace must recognize that there is a difference between holding full legal title to a property versus merely making all crucial decisions,aplt.br.at,about a property while another holds record title.the fact is that palace objects to the grant of a preliminary injunction because it hopes to recover from roda financially,and by retaining legal title to the properties,palace would ensure a source for that recovery.we have never before required an explicit listing of exigencies,nor do we here.the court clearly found that the situation required immediate action,and we do not see how the order is deficient in any way.the magistrate judge decision on this point certainly does not rise to the level of an abuse of discretion.
ii.irreparable harm 
palace next claims that the magistrate judge erred when he found irreparable harm sufficient to issue the injunction.see aplt.br.at.in essence,palace claims that no harm exists that can not be remedied by money damages,and that roda can not claim irreparable harm in light of its delay in requesting a preliminary injunction.we reject these arguments.
we have previously held that a plaintiff satisfies the irreparable harm requirement by demonstrating a significant risk that he or she will experience harm that can not be compensated after the fact by monetary damages.greater yellowstone coal.flowers,cir quoting adams freedom forge,cir emphasis omitted.purely speculative harm will not suffice,but rather,a plaintiff who can show a significant risk of irreparable harm has demonstrated that the harm is not speculative and will be held to have satisfied his burden.id.in determining whether a plaintiff has made the requisite showing,we further assess whether such harm is likely to occur before the district court rules on the merits.id.at.if a trial on the merits can be conducted before the injury would occur there is no need for interlocutory relief.id.quoting charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at.
in conducting a review of the relevant facts,we find that roda presented sufficient evidence to sustain its claim of irreparable harm.the magistrate judge held that,were the status quo preserved pending litigation,roda would be deprived of control of its real property,thus constituting irreparable harm,and that roda delay in filing for a preliminary injunction did not bar the relief.see roda drilling,wl,at.other courts have held that,when interests involving real property are at stake,preliminary injunctive relief can be particularly appropriate because of the unique nature of the property interest.woodley road joint venture itt sheraton,no.jjf,wl,at,see also narragansett indian tribe guilbert,cir indicating that r eal estate has long been thought unique quoting k mart oriental plaza,cir southland froelich,d.we note that the supreme court has rejected the application of categorical rules in injunction cases.ebay mercexchange,d.we need not decide whether it would be appropriate to assume the existence of irreparable harm because we are dealing with interests in real property rather,as we explain below,roda has made such a showing,establishing its entitlement to injunctive relief.
the record clearly establishes that roda is being denied its right to interest in its real property.while roda provided all of the funds to purchase the property a large but quantifiable amount of money roda has been denied unfettered ownership of that property,resulting in delays,missed opportunities,and,most importantly,unquantifiable damages.see app,see also aplee.br.at.in making its initial arguments,roda provided expert testimony on the issue of irreparable harm and the fact that,at trial,the damages suffered absent a preliminary injunction likely could not be proven.app.essentially,while being denied record title,roda simply can not participate in the everyday operations of its own interests,and the damages arising from that denial are incalculable.see kikumura hurley,cir noting that a plaintiff suffers irreparable injury when the court would be unable to grant an effective monetary remedy after a full trial because such damages would be inadequate or difficult to ascertain.in sum,these properties are income producing,and realizing their income potential depends upon active management of the properties.that makes potential damages most difficult to prove,if not practically unquantifiable.
as the magistrate judge aptly noted,ownership,maintenance,and development of this enterprise is not a passive endeavor,and it is increasingly difficult for roda to manage its properties through an intermediary.roda drilling,wl,at.decisions concerning drilling,joint operating agreements,sales,operators,and the like must be made day to day.id.in addition,roda has been unable to rely on the properties to finance its expenditures,see,app,and the internal revenue service has indicated that it may challenge roda intangible drilling cost deductions because roda does not hol
