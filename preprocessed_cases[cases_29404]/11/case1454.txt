following the remand in bp west coast products,ferc,the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ordered petitioner sfpp,sfpp to pay reparations to the complaining shippers using its watson station facilities.sfpp,ferc order on initial decision.sfpp contends that notwithstanding its failure to file the watson contract rates,ferc decision was arbitrary and capricious for failing to explain why it rejected its previous findings that special circumstances justified enforcement of the unfiled rate contracts.the circumstances surrounding the shippers agreement to the watson contract rates,sfpp maintains,allay any reasonableness or discrimination concerns and manifestly present good cause.pet r br.ferc responds that the unfiled contract rates could not supplant its authority to ensure rates are just and reasonable and that it reasonably determined the payment of reparations was an appropriate remedy.concluding that ferc determination of the rates was not arbitrary or capricious and that the remedy was within its discretion,we deny the petition for review.
the background to this appeal appears in bp west coast products,at.between and,sfpp and its shippers negotiated a set of contracts for the construction of facilities at watson station,which speeded switching between different types of petroleum products stored in sfpp tanks.as part of the contracts,the shippers agreed to pay an additional charge per barrel of cents to cover construction costs and provide sfpp a return on its investment in the facilities.sfpp did not file the watson contract rates with ferc,concluding its services were not jurisdictional.
responding to complaints filed in the by various shippers,ferc ruled in opinion that although sfpp should have filed its watson contract rates,sfpp would not be ordered to pay reparations and the watson contract rates would be deemed reasonable.sfpp,ferc at opinion.ferc relied on section of the energy policy act of epact,stat,reprinted in note,which limited the ability of shippers to challenge pipeline rates in effect for a full year as of october,and deemed such rates,with exceptions not applicable here,just and reasonable.ferc concluded that although the watson contract rates were not on file,the charges for the watson station facilities were the equivalent of lawful rates because the rates were in effect prior to the epact enactment on october,and the shippers had failed to establish substantially changed circumstances,epact b,stat.at.see opinion at.ferc noted that the complaining shippers were sophisticated parties that negotiated sophisticated contracts,and that it would be inequitable to change the negotiated rates years after the contracts were signed.id.at.ferc denied rehearing.sfpp,ferc at opinion.ferc reasoned that if the rates had been filed,it is clear that they would have been grandfathered under the epact,opinion at.
this court vacated opinion and.bp west coast,at.as relevant,the court concluded that ferc reasoning on the significance of not filing the watson contract rates was fundamentally flawed and vacated this portion of ferc order.id.at.observing that if ferc correctly interpreted section of the epact only to apply to filed rates,then ferc could not grandfather unfiled rates on the assumption no challenge would have been brought.id.moreover,the court found ferc reasoning afforded no assurance that all the watson contract rates had been in effect days as of october.id.the court therefore granted the petition and remanded regarding whether the rates were grandfathered.id.at.
on remand,ferc ruled that sfpp watson contract rates could not be grandfathered.sfpp,ferc at order on remand and rehearing.ferc found that regardless of whether the rates were filed,the watson contract rates became effective on november,less than days before october,and thus could not be grandfathered under the epact.id.at.thereafter,sfpp and the complaining shippers settled all outstanding issues,except two legal issues,and stipulated that any reparations amount would be based on a shipping rate of between and cents per barrel subtracted from the or cents per barrel actually charged by sfpp,plus interest,with a specific shipping rate stipulated for each year between and.the two reserved legal issues were whether the watson contract rates established the rate level or limited reparations before april,and the calculation of the period for which any reparations payments would be due.ferc approved this settlement,sfpp,ferc,and referred the two reserved legal issues to an administrative law judge alj,who ruled that the watson contract rates did not establish the rate for service because they had not been filed and that the reparation payment period for each shipper would be limited to two years before the shipper complaint was filed,and awarded reparations to the complaining shippers in the amounts stipulated,see sfpp,ferc at.
upon exceptions filed by sfpp,ferc affirmed that sfpp had violated sections and of the interstate commerce act ica by failing to file the watson contract rates.see order on initial decision,ferc at.ferc noted that ica section requires that common carriers such as sfpp shall file their rates,and that ica section prohibits carriers from transporting property unless the rates have been filed with ferc,and concluded therefore that the carrier state of mind when deciding whether it needs to file a rate is not relevant under the ica.see order on initial decision,ferc at.ferc interpreted the supreme court decision in maislin industries,primary steel,d,as viewing these ica rate filing requirements as necessary to prevent unreasonable or discriminatory rates.see order on initial decision,ferc at.ferc also noted that this court decision in city of piqua,ohio ferc,is quite clear that the mutual agreement of the parties does not relieve the pipeline involved of the fundamental obligation to file the contract with ferc.order on initial decision,ferc at.ferc further ruled that it was a proper exercise of its remedial discretion to order reparations for charges above the stipulated just and reasonable rates,reasoning that the shippers were not required to establish damages because the settlement agreement established the amount of any reparations and reserved the question of whether reparations were due,that the watson contract rates did not supersede the ica rate filing requirement even if the contract negotiations were voluntary transactions,that sfpp received the quantum meruit value of its services,and that the record did not establish that the watson contract rates were just and reasonable rather than an exercise of sfpp market power.see id.at.
sfpp petitions for review of whether the watson contract rates established the rate level or limited reparations for the period before april,when its filed rates became effective.this court reviews ferc orders to determine whether they are arbitrary or capricious,an abuse of ferc discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see,power partners,ferc.the court will defer to ferc decisions in remedial matters and reject its choice of an equitable remedy only if it lacks a rational basis.constellation energy commodities group,ferc,quoting koch gateway pipeline ferc.
sfpp concedes that because the court vacated opinion and in bp west coast products,at,ferc had the discretion to reconsider the whole of its original decision,southeastern michigan gas ferc,and not merely those aspects of the decision related to grandfathering,reply br.however,observing that when changing course an agency must supply a reasoned analysis,see motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d,sfpp contends that ferc has failed to explain why on remand it no longer credits the findings in opinion and that special circumstances justified enforcement of the watson contract rates.these findings,sfpp maintains,are separate and apart from the vacated sections of opinion and on grandfathering.
this court vacated opinion and in their entirety,bp west coast,at,and ferc,in responding on remand,has engaged in no change of course for ferc to explain as sfpp contends.see radio televisi√≥n de fcc.the changing its course analysis of state farm,at,is not the standard.although ferc did state in opinion that it would be unfair to award reparations when the contracts were the result of bargaining between sophisticated parties,ferc premised its reasoning on its initial conclusion that sfpp had not violated its rate filing obligation.see opinion,ferc at.once this court determined that ferc application of the epact grandfathering provisions was erroneous,an entirely different question was presented to ferc,and its answer to that question was completely new and in no sense a deviation from past policy.
on remand ferc was obligated to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.alpharma,leavitt,quoting state farm,at.to satisfy this standard,and to the extent sfpp suggests the court vacated only the analysis in opinion and regarding grandfathering,see bp west coast,at,ferc explained that it had erroneously interpreted city of piqua,and ignored maislin,d,in not requiring sfpp to file its rates despite the agreements of sfpp with the shippers.see order on initial decision,ferc at.sfpp attempt to challenge ferc interpretation of this precedent is unpersuasive,as are the other precedents on which it relies.
the ica requires oil pipelines to file the rates they charge shippers to use their pipelines,and provides a pipeline shall not provide transportation unless the rates are on file with ferc.see app,see also frontier pipeline ferc.a pipeline is liable for damages for violation of the ica.see app.additionally,a pipeline may be ordered to pay reparations,subject to a limitation.see id.b bp west coast,at.in maislin,the supreme court explained that adherence to unfiled rates undermines the basic structure of the ica,at,and that t he duty to file rates with ferc,and the obligation to charge only those rates,have always been considered essential to preventing price discrimination and stabilizing rates,id.at.citations omitted.contrary to sfpp view,the fact that the court was addressing rates negotiated below the filed rate,see id.at,rather than unfiled negotiated rates,does not detract from its interpretation of the statutory obligation to charge only filed rates.nor did city of piqua hold,as sfpp suggests,that an unfiled contractual rate agreement was enforceable,but instead involved a filed contractual rate that ferc determined was reasonable and,upon finding good cause,allowed to be enforced from the initial date of the contract rather than from the date the contract rate was filed.see city of piqua,at.
although galvan,maas transport,cir,and four district court opinions cited by sfpp recognized that voiding contracts is not necessarily an appropriate remedy for violating the ica,the courts acknowledged other penalties under the ica could still apply.moreover,ferc did not void the watson contracts but awarded sfpp the quantum meruit value of its performance under them.see order on initial decision,ferc at.the other cases on which sfpp relies involve different statutory schemes and do not respond to ferc concern that the record before it failed to establish that the watson contract rate s unequivocally reflected effective competition at the time the contractual charge became effective and was not sufficiently clear to warrant a conclusion that the prophylactic purposes of the ica would not be compromised by denying reparations.order on initial decision,ferc at.
sfpp also contends that ferc unreasonably disregarded that its failure to file the watson contract rates was a good faith error regarding ferc jurisdiction over the facilities.however,ferc concluded that the parties joint stipulation of facts did not support sfpp claim of good faith jurisdictional error,and further that the ica filing requirement should not depend on ferc interpretation of a party good faith.ferc noted,moreover,that the ica imposes the filing requirement on carriers rather than shippers,and that sfpp could have protected itself by following the traditional practice of filing a rate with a motion to dismiss,thereby gaining the benefit of a type of safe harbor against the risk of reparations.see id.at.
sfpp contention that ferc erred when awarding reparations because the shippers failed to prove that they had suffered damage from the rates negotiated in the watson contracts fares no better.sfpp relies on parsons chicago northwestern railway,in which the supreme court stated that under the ica a complainant must show,not merely the wrong of the carrier,but that that wrong has in fact operated to his injury.however sfpp fails to consider the context of this statement,which discussed why p enalties are not recoverable on mere possibilities and indicated that appropriate damages would be the excess rate actually,rather than theoretically,paid by a shipper.id.intervenor shippers point out that such a calculation of damages and reparations is,citing the ruling in memphis freight bureau kansas city southern railway,that there are no damages in any proper sense of the word unless the shipper has been compelled to pay more than a reasonable rate.ferc determined that t he settlement agreement stipulates how the just and reasonable rate would be defined retrospectively if liability attaches to sfpp.see order on initial decision,ferc at.sfpp reliance on mobil oil corporation federal power commission,d,is to no avail because there the supreme court held that a settlement proposal alone was not sufficient to establish that the rate structure in the proposed settlement was just and reasonable,id.at,while in the instant case ferc approved the parties settlement agreement and its reparation rates,see sfpp,ferc.as ferc explained,having approved the parties settlement agreement establishing the amount of any reparations,the only question was whether reparations were due,not the amount due.see order on initial decision,ferc at.
finally sfpp contends,first,that ferc erroneously denied that it had equitable discretion to fashion a remedy,and second,that ferc had discretion under section of the ica to view the filing requirements of sections and as less than absolute.the first contention is incorrect.ferc acknowledged an award of reparations is an equitable remedy and that it was not compelled to award reparations.order on initial decision,ferc at.with regard to the second contention,sfpp did not make this statutory argument to ferc,and this court has held that under the ica a party must first raise an issue with an agency before seeking judicial review,exxonmobil oil ferc.in reply,sfpp maintains that it is arguing only that cases interpreting provisions that are analogous to section,rather than section itself,are applicable.but even were this argument timely,ferc observes that section might not apply where the rates were never filed,and that it evaluated as a part of its reparations decision many of the section good cause arguments sfpp presents on brief.for example,sfpp maintains that the watson contract rates did not involve rent seeking by sfpp because its shippers initiated discussions about developing facilities in lieu of costly construction by them and then negotiated the watson contract rates.ferc not only acknowledged its discretion,but carefully exercised it,explaining that reparations were appropriate because the record suggested sfpp had abused its market power by extract ing an economic rent based on the difference between its own costs for resolving the operating issues at watson station and the costs each of the shippers would have incurred on its own hook.order on initial decision,ferc at.
accordingly,because ferc reasoned order of reparations falls within its discretion,sfpp fails to demonstrate that ferc was arbitrary or capricious,or abused its discretion,see exxon mobil ferc,and we deny the petition for review.
