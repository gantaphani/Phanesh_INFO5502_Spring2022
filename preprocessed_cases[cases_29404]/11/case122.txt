this case grows out of contractual arrangements and transactions involving three different companies itv direct,itv essentially a healthy solutions,llc healthy solutions,defendant in the district court but not a party to this appeal,which created a food supplement called supreme greens and cappseals,which undertook to manufacture supreme greens for healthy solutions to sell to itv.
itv and healthy solutions entered into a distribution agreement in april.the agreement provided that itv would market the product primarily through television infomercials,and that alex guerrero,developer of supreme greens and associated with healthy purportedly a doctor of some participate and appear in the infomercials.the agreement provided inter alia 
during the term of this agreement,itv shall issue purchase orders to healthy solutions for the products,which purchase orders shall state this purchase order is placed under the terms and conditions of the distributor agreement between itv and healthy solutions,dated march.
in the event,purchase orders placed by itv did not include this stipulated language.the purchase order at issue in this a quantity of supreme greens for which itv has not yet paid healthy solutions and healthy solutions has not yet paid price,quantity,and delivery terms,and was a standing order for a weekly shipment of supreme greens,subject to change or cancellation upon day written notice.
thereafter,itv learned of an investigation by the food and drug administration fda and the federal trade commission ftc concerning unsupported health claims made about supreme greens by found in the product packaging and labeling and repeated in the infomercials.in february,itv suspended all future product shipments,stopped payment on its most recent check,and told healthy solutions that it would not pay any of the outstanding invoices until future notice.
at that time,itv owed healthy solutions now at least with interest for the supreme greens already shipped and received.healthy solutions was apparently unable to pay cappseals without the payments from itv,and owed cappseals now at least with interest.in march,itv followed up by suing healthy solutions and guerrero,as well as other healthy solutions executives,named and unnamed,in federal district court based on diversity of citizenship.
itv eventually sought to recover against healthy solutions for,among other things,breach of contract,fraud,and violations of the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.healthy solutions counterclaimed against itv for,among other things,breach of contract,unfair competition,and account stated.cappseals,still unpaid,was granted leave to intervene and asserted its own claims for breach of contract against both healthy solutions and itv,and sought to reach and apply any judgment healthy solutions obtained against itv under.laws ch.
when cappseals moved to intervene in this action,it also moved for a preliminary injunction against healthy solutions,which the district court granted on april,preventing healthy solutions from selling,compromising,transferring,assigning,or otherwise disposing of its interest in any and all monies due or to become due to healthy solutions from itv direct.cappseals concern,apparently now a reality,was that healthy solutions would be and its most valuable asset would be its own claims against itv.
in may,the ftc filed a separate action in the same district court against itv and healthy solutions seeking injunctive relief and restitution for false claims made in the infomercials.the ftc entered into a permanent injunction and stipulated final order with healthy solutions the case is apparently still ongoing as to itv,against whom the ftc has obtained a preliminary injunction.
in june,cappseals moved for partial summary judgment,which the district court denied.discovery closed on february.in march,healthy solutions although seemingly unable to pay offered to consent to judgment in cappseals favor for the entire amount owed and to have the preliminary reach and apply injunction made permanent the district court entered the permanent injunction on april.the consent to judgment was later reduced to a judgment in cappseals favor in the amount of plus interest.
at virtually the same time,and unknown to cappseals,itv and healthy solutions privately agreed to dismiss their claims against each other and filed a joint motion requesting the district court approve their stipulation of dismissal.the district court granted the motion but then immediately withdrew approval on learning that reach and apply injunction against healthy solutions still in not consented to healthy solutions release of its own claims against itv.
in july,on cappseals motion,the district court granted summary judgment against healthy solutions in cappseals favor for the latter deliveries of supreme greens.separately,the court granted summary judgment first against itv for failing to pay healthy solutions for the same goods and then against itv in favor of cappseals on the latter reach and apply claim.thus,itv became obligated to pay directly to cappseals most of what itv owed to healthy solutions in order to satisfy cappseals own judgment against healthy solutions.
in granting summary judgment,the district judge refused to allow itv to set off against its debt to healthy solutions whatever might be owed to itv by healthy solutions this left still pending the claim by itv for healthy solutions alleged breach of the distribution agreement.the court also accelerated the finality of the july judgments,certifying them under.b.itv appealed,and itv and healthy solutions also entered a stipulated dismissal,with prejudice,under.a,of their remaining respective claims against each other.
on this appeal,itv argues that the district court should have allowed the original motion of itv and healthy solutions to dismiss their respective claims against each other.itv also says that the district court should not have granted summary judgment in cappseals favor on the reach and apply claim against itv.finally,itv contends that the district court further erred in certifying the july judgments as final under.b.
in response,cappseals defends the district court on the merits and also urges that the case is moot and the appeal should be dismissed it says that itv voluntarily released its claims against healthy solutions,so its alleged right to setoff is lost anyway.the release does complicate itv position,but as we will see,were itv right on the merits,the possibility of some relief would exist as to certain aspects of its appeal,so the appeal as a whole is not moot.
itv first claim is that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the case in april as between itv and healthy solutions based on their first voluntary dismissal under rule a.if this were error,the error might undermine the subsequent july judgment entered by the district court for healthy solutions and against itv,which in turn underpins the reach and apply judgment against itv.so the possibility of affording relief to itv would remain.
however,the district court refusal to allow the voluntary dismissal was not error.an answer having been filed and all parties not having consented,rule a which allows voluntary dismissal without approval of the court did not apply and itv and healthy solutions could only move to dismiss under rule a,which requires the court approval.ordinarily,a refusal to dismiss in such a case would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.doe urohealth,cir.
itv says that the court has to allow a plaintiff to dismiss its claim if it agrees to do so with prejudice,the theory being that the plaintiff should not be forced to go on if the adversary is fully protected.smoot fox,cir shepard egan.we might share this view if no other interests were involved,but,as other cases make clear,a intervenor interests should also be considered 
in this case,cappseals had already become a party and asserted its own reach and apply claim against itv,which would clearly have been prejudiced by a dismissal releasing the predicate claim of healthy solutions against itv.further,the discharge of that claim was specifically forbidden by the in
