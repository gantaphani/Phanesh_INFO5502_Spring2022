background 
doj request for quotations 
on august,the doj issued a draft request for quotations rfq for an automated recruiting and staffing system the system,which performs the basic functions associated with the internet listing of doj job postings and the submission and tracking of applications submitted in response to the vacancies.
the draft rfq contained a number of technical requirements that are discussed below in association with the final rfq.in addition,it contained two provisions particularly relevant to allied protest.first,it required that t he offeror shall highlight any provisions that conflict with the terms and conditions outlined in document b setting forth the substantive terms of the contract.conflicting provisions will be considered as exceptions to the terms and conditions of the rfq.app x.second,it noted that t he offeror is advised that any exceptions taken to the terms and conditions of the rfq may adversely impact its evaluation rating.the government reserves the right not to accept any exceptions to this rfq.id.
the draft rfq provoked comments from potential offerors,including monster and allied.allied objected to the provision that conflicting terms will be considered as exceptions,noting that t his language does not allow for consideration of alternative terms that meet the agency needs and suggest s that an offeror runs the risk of a proposal being found nonresponsive if any terms in an offeror standard msa master subscription agreement or sla service level agreement are highlighted as directed.this would be inconsistent with far federal acquisition regulation,as noted above,and should be clarified.
the doj final rfq called for an effective userfriendly application for initially handling about employees,and capable of expanding to cover up to employees as other converted to the system.the rfq included four evaluation factors,listed here with their contribution to the total score technical merit points,live system demonstration points past performance points and price discussed below.
regarding price,the rfq explicitly noted that t he government considers technical merit,system demonstration and past performance factors,when combined,to be significantly more important than price,but that the final award would be made on the basis of a best value determination,wherein t he total evaluated price will be the determining factor for award where two or more quotes are considered substantially technically equal.if,however,the department determines that there are significant technical differences between the capabilities of two or more offerors,then a more expensive quote may be selected for award where the doj determines that the value of the selected quote is worth the price differential.
the technical merit factor included a requirements list detailing technical requirements,each rated as high,medium,or low priority.three high priority requirements are relevant here.first,the rfq required that it take precedence over any other agreement between the government and the offeror.second,the rfq required compliance with section of the rehabilitation act of,which guaranteed access to the system for people with disabilities under the far.the rfq noted that the contractor must comply with the federal electronic and information technology accessibility standards set forth at.moreover,the rfq required that a section compliance certification be signed by the contractor.finally,the rfq required that the system shall use unique employee identifiers in lieu of social security numbers or other personally identifiable information.
critically,the final rfq noted that to be eligible,and offeror must accept each of the requirements,provisions,terms and conditions,and clauses stated in all sections of this rfq.the final rfq also maintained the language from the draft rfq objected to by allied in a section titled part additional documents,requiring that 
the offeror shall highlight any provisions that conflict with the terms and conditions outlined in document b.these documents will be reviewed by the government.any terms and conditions that are considered unacceptable by the government and can not be resolved may result in the offeror being removed from consideration.conflicting provisions will be considered as exceptions to the terms and conditions of the rfq.
further,the rfq warned that any exception taken to the terms and conditions of the rfq may adversely impact its evaluation rating.the rfq noted that t he government intends to make an award on the basis of initial quotation without the use of discussions however,the government reserves the right to use discussions after receipt of quotations if it is considered in the government best interests to do so.
allied and monster bids 
only allied and monster submitted bids in response to the rfq.both offerors submitted price plans for systems intended for between to users.the contracting officer evaluated the proposals at the initial anticipated user count of to.allied proposed price was approximately million,assuming a percent annual prepayment discount.without the prepayment discount as called for by the rfq,allied price totaled approximately million over five years.allied bid contained a section titled part exceptions.allied stated 
the nature of the avue platform requires that the avue msa,signed with all clients,takes precedence over all other and conditions across our entire client base.as such,section,order of precedence,needs to be removed from the bpa blanket purchase agreement terms and conditions,leaving the msa as the overriding document.the remainder of the exceptions outlined below flows sic from this change.
as described by the contracting officer,and not disputed by allied,the exceptions resolve into the following 
allied msa would govern the confidentiality of data,the government rights in data produced under the contract,and the rights of inspection and acceptance.
allied msa would require that any early termination of this agreement shall not result in a refund or reduction of the annual subscription fees and the annual extranet fees for that portion of the subscription period so terminated,regardless of whether such fees are paid on an annual or monthly basis.
if the government performs penetration testing pursuant to technical requirement,allied would require extensive financial indemnity coverage.
allied would remove the rfq section requiring monthly payment in arrears.
relatedly,allied would have the initialization fee paid up front to take advantage of the discount reflected in its price quote,in conflict with the rfq requirement that payments be made monthly in arrears.
aside from these exceptions,it is undisputed that allied proposal met all the requirements of the rfq.
monster proposal certified that it would meet all technical requirements for a total price of approximately million.in particular,monster indicated that its system,training content,and its output are compatible with section of the rehabilitation act,and also the privacy provision requiring the use of unique employee identifiers in lieu of social security numbers.moreover,monster submitted the required signed section compliance certification,certifying that its service is in compliance with the electronic and information technology accessibility standards.in a section titled part.exceptions,monster included the following overview of its section compliance 
the information contained within this voluntary product accessibility template vpat is the result of an independent audit that tested the compliance of the monster government solutions hiring management employer hm employer application with the requirements of section of the rehabilitation act of as amended.
hm employer is generally compliant with exceptions to the relevant section requirements.hm employer has minor compliance exceptions with the accessibility of forms,text equivalents for elements,and keyboard accessibility.
contracting officer award decision 
the doj established a technical evaluation panel the panel to evaluate the technical merit of the competing proposals.the members of the panel scored each product for technical strengths and weaknesses under the criteria of the rfq.the contracting officer received the scores from the panel,and asked for further comments and descriptions from the members of the panel.the panel members then attended the live systems demonstration,and collected past performance scores regarding both companies products.the contracting officer averaged the scores awarded by each member of the panel for technical merit and the live demonstration and added the average to the past performance scores.the result was a total score for allied of,and for monster of.
on august,the contracting officer awarded the contract to monster.in his memorandum opinion,the contracting officer explained his award decision on two independent bases.first,he determined that allied exceptions were a refusal by to accept material requirements,provisions,terms and conditions and clauses to the rfq,and determined that this made allied offer unacceptable from a business standpoint.the contracting officer stated that monster took no exceptions.second,and despite allied exceptions,the contracting officer compared allied and monster proposals on their merits because they were the only two offerors.
on the merits,the contracting officer determined that monster provided the best value for the project,because allied small technical advantage could not justify the increased price there is no reasonable way to assert that,receiving a technical score of higher than monster justifies paying more than twice as much,resulting in millions of additional dollars over the five year term of the bpa.the contracting officer further noted that because allied price was based on the doj taking advantage of a payment arrangement,the true price disparity between allied and monster was even more than.at the end of his analysis,the contracting officer concluded that even if allied business proposal were acceptable,which it is not,monster still presents the best value to the department.
gao bid protest 
allied filed a bid protest with gao,challenging the contracting officer finding that allied quotation was unacceptable,his finding that monster quotation was acceptable,and the methodology of the contract award.the gao denied allied protest because allied was put on notice of the risks of taking exception and does not dispute that it took exceptions the phrase can not be resolved in the rfq could not reasonably be read to require discussions and even if it could,this would result in a patent ambiguity within the contract between the discussion requirement and the statement that the doj intended to make the award without discussions,and that allied failure to protest this patent ambiguity prior to bidding waived its right to assert that discussions were required.the gao also rejected allied argument that monster should have been disqualified on the basis of alleged noncompliance with section of the rehabilitation act and the collection of social security numbers through usajobs.as to the first point,the gao determined that allied statements of compliance,and the determination by the independent consultant that monster was generally compliant,did not mandate a determination of unacceptability.
the gao did not rule on allied protest of the best value determination and the alleged procedural deficiencies of the rating system,because it held that allied was not an interested party and could not raise those issues,since the agency had reasonably found allied quotation to be unacceptable and monster quotation to be acceptable.
complaint in the court of federal claims 
allied continued its bid protest by filing a complaint in the claims court,making essentially the same arguments it did to the gao.the claims court granted appellees motion for judgment on the administrative record,holding that allied disqualification and monster were proper.the claims court agreed with allied that there were errors in doj technical evaluation process,but determined that allied could not show prejudice because the large price gap between allied and monster made it impossible for allied to reasonably show that it would have received the award in the absence of doj errors.relying on electronic data systems,llc united states,fed.cl.may,and data general johnson,the claims court reasoned that t he record simply does not suggest that any doj errors reasonably could offset the price difference so as to make doj selection improper.
allied timely appealed.this court has jurisdiction under.a.
ii.discussion 
allied appeal presents three distinct issues whether the government was required to engage in discussions with allied over the exceptions in allied offer before disqualifying it whether the contracting officer properly considered monster offer despite its exceptions to section and whether the government acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making its best value determination.we address the first two issues and,in light of our decision,need not address the third.
standard of review 
this court reviews the claims court grant of a judgment on the administrative record de novo,applying the same standard over the gao decision as did the claims court.bannum,united states.the must show that the contracting officer award lacked a rational basis,centech,united states,or violates to prejudicial effect an applicable procurement regulation,caci field,united states.the test under the first ground is whether the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion,and the disappointed bidder bears a heavy burden of showing that the award decision had no rational basis.centech,at.the test under the second ground is whether the disappointed bidder has shown a clear and prejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.id.to show prejudice,the protestor must show that but for the alleged error,there was a substantial chance that it would receive an award that it was within the zone of active consideration.statistica,christopher,internal citations omitted.
whether a government contract is ambiguous and whether that ambiguity is patent or latent are questions of law,reviewed without deference.stratos mobile networks usa,llc united states.
b.the disqualification of allied proposal 
allied argues that the rfq unambiguously requires the contracting officer to engage in discussions with an offeror who takes exception to any terms in the contract,before the contracting officer may properly disqualify such an offeror from consideration.this is based primarily on the phrase italicized below from an rfq section titled part additional documents 
any terms and conditions that are considered unacceptable by the government and can not be resolved may result in the offeror being removed from consideration.
emphasis added.allied interprets this to mean that exceptions would not be grounds for disqualification unless the conflicts as a whole were thought to be significant enough to warrant disqualification may and could not be resolved through discussions can not be resolved.br.of allied at.
appellees counter that two provisions unambiguously give the contracting officer the discretion over whether to engage in discussions.first,in the general quote instructions,the rfq states 
i nitial offers shall contain the offeror best offer from a technical and price standpoint.the government,however,reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.
emphasis added.second,in a section titled discussions,the rfq stated 
the government intends to make an award on the basis of initial quotations without the use of discussions.offerors should therefore submit their most advantageous quote in response to the initial solicitation.however,the government reserves the right to use discussions after receipt of quotations if it is considered in the government best interests to do so.
emphases added.appellees further argue that allied interpretation would create a patent ambiguity in the contract between giving the contracting officer the discretion to engage in discussions,but requiring the contracting officer to engage in discussions in the case of exceptions which allied can not challenge under the holding of blue gold fleet,united states,considering a disappointed bidder argument on the basis of a patent ambiguity waived for failure to raise it prior to bidding.
allied makes two arguments in response.first,allied argues that the appellees interpretation would fail to give meaning to the can not be resolved phrase in the rfq.second,allied argues that that phrase was added in response to allied comments on the draft rfq.these arguments are unpersuasive.
the relevant provision of the draft rfq read 
the offeror shall include a copy of any master subscription agreement msa,service level agreement sla or any other documentation that the offeror will request the government to sign in order to receive the offeror services.the offeror shall highlight any provisions that conflict with the terms and conditions outlined in document conflicting provisions will be considered as exceptions to the terms and conditions of the rfq.
in response,allied stated 
the draft rfq requires offerors to highlight any provisions in an msa or sla that conflict with the terms and conditions in document b,but states that such conflicting provisions will be considered exceptions to the terms and conditions in the rfq.this language does not allow for consideration of alternative terms that meet the agency needs and suggest that an offeror runs the risk of a proposal being found nonresponsive if any terms in an offeror standard msa or sla are highlighted as directed.
the doj then added the following 
these documents will be reviewed by the government.any terms and conditions that are considered unacceptable by the government and can not be resolved may result in the offeror being removed from consideration.
allied argues that the only reasonable reading of the amendment is that doj wanted to prevent offerors from being found nonresponsive,and so,required discussions.this court disagrees.
the rfq unambiguously gives the contracting officer the discretion over whether to engage in discussions,as seen from the emphasized provisions above.under allied reading,such discretion is eliminated by the offeror initiative to take exceptions or propose additional terms that the government would find unacceptable.in other words,allied would allow the contracting officer discretion to engage in discussions only when the offer exactly conformed to the rfq,a situation which would be unlikely to be unacceptable to the government.however,the can not be resolved provision is activated only when the additional terms are considered unacceptable by the government.thus,allied interpretation fails to give meaning to the provisions above,reserving to the contracting officer the discretion to engage in discussions,and is therefore an improper reading of the rfq.see,burnside ott aviation training ctr.dalton,a contract must be interpreted as a whole in a manner that gives reasonable meaning to all its parts and avoids conflicts in,or surplusage of,its provision.
the doj did not remove the objected to provisions the final rfq,like the draft,required offerors to highlight any provisions in an msa or sla that conflicted with the terms and conditions of the rfq,and categorized such conflicting provisions as exceptions.allied,through its comments,has already acknowledged that these provisions may reasonably be read to allow disqualification where alternative terms are proposed in the offer.there is nothing in the added language that necessarily changes the effect of those provisions.the added language does not mention discussions,nor define what is required before the government may properly determine that terms in the offer are unacceptable.instead,the doj answered allied objection,warning offerors that a bid proposing alternative terms may well result in its removal from consideration.
in light of this,a reasonable reading of the can not be resolved phrase may be to require discussions where additional terms are proposed,but maintain as exceptions and thus allow disqualification conflicting terms between the rfq and the submitted additional documents.this interpretation is consistent with the rest of the rfq,which requires offerors to submit their most advantageous quotes,and their best offer from a technical and price standpoint and retains the contracting officer discretion over whether to engage in discussions.we need not go so far as to definitively opine on the meaning of that phrase it is enough to note that it does not require the contracting officer to engage in discussions before disqualifying an offer from consideration.
on a more practical level,the rfq explicitly states that offerors should submit complete and acceptable quote s,those which accept each of the requirements,provisions,terms and conditions,and clauses stated in all sections of this rfq.it makes little sense to reward contractors who choose to submit proposals that fail to conform to the rfq by requiring the government to engage in discussions with them.
because discussions were not required by the rfq prior to disqualification on the basis of unacceptable exceptions,the only remaining question is whether the contracting officer acted rationally in disqualifying allied on the basis of its exceptions.allied argues that two of its six exceptions were not true exceptions because allied told the doj during clarification that it would agree to payment in arrears for a percent bump in the price.allied then argues that the contracting officer disqualified allied on the cumulative basis of all six exceptions,and that a determination that any of the six exceptions are not true exceptions requires a remand,on the basis of the restriction in s.chenery,that an appeals court must make its judgment solely by the grounds invoked by the agency,and if those grounds are inadequate or improper,the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.id.at.
allied argument rings hollow for three reasons.first,allied admits that all of its exceptions stem from an insistence that its msa take precedence over the rfq.app x at the remainder of the exceptions outlined below flows sic from this change.allied admits that all six exceptions were material.br.of allied at.even if we agreed with allied that two of its exceptions were not true exceptions,affirming on the basis of the other four exceptions would not constitute a new ground for affirmance.it would be an affirmance of allied disqualification on the same ground that the contracting officer disqualified allied because it took a material exception in requiring the precedence of the msa over the rfq,that the contracting officer considered unacceptable from a business standpoint.second,the contracting officer did not,as allied contends,make a finding of unacceptability only on the aggregate of the six exceptions.the contracting officer opinion states 
it is the opinion of the contracting officer that these exceptions are a refusal by to accept material requirements,provisions,terms and conditions,and clauses of the rfq,and result in quote being unacceptable from a business standpoint.
the contracting officer reference to these exceptions is most naturally read as referring to each exception.by analogy,were this court to say,we affirm the decision of the claims court for three reasons,that sentence alone does not necessarily indicate that the affirmance is based on the aggregate of the three reasons.finally,as this court has stated,a proposal that fails to conform to the material terms and conditions of the solicitation should be considered unacceptable and a contract award based on such an unacceptable proposal violates the procurement statutes and regulations.bliss united states.as discussed above,this is explicitly laid out in the rfq,which requires that e ach offeror shall submit a complete and acceptable quote in accordance with the instructions contained herein.such a quote accepts each of a requirements,provisions,terms and conditions,and clauses stated in all sections of this rfq.there is thus no substantial doubt whether the administrative agency would have made the same ultimate finding with the erroneous findings by assumption or inferences removed from the picture.see branff airways,cab.
because of our holding that the rfq did not require discussions prior to disqualifying allied,we need not determine whether the failure to conduct such discussions was prejudicial to allied.for each of the reasons discussed above,this court affirms the contracting officer decision to disqualify allied.
c.the acceptability of monster proposal 
allied next argues that the award to monster lacked a rational basis because monster alleged exceptions to the rfq necessarily required its disqualification by the contracting officer.
first,allied argues that the contracting officer may not award the contract to an offeror who fails to meet all the requirements of the rfq,and that monster did not meet the requirements of section of the rehabilitation act,providing for accessibility to the system for disabled individuals.next,allied also argues that monster failed to meet rfq technical requirement that the offeror must use unique employee identifiers in lieu of social security numbers or other personally identifiable information.
allied attempts to frame the section issue as whether the contracting officer could have waived the requirement of compliance,and cites numerous statutes,regulations,and the rfq itself for the proposition that compliance is mandatory.see a a a a app x at technical requirement number requires compliance with section.this court agrees with allied that compliance with section is mandatory,may not be waived by the contracting officer,and that if the contracting officer had made an award to a offeror,that decision would be subject to reversal.
however,allied improperly frames the issue.monster explicitly certified that it was compliant with section,both in the listing of requirements,and by submitting a signed section compliance certification,which stated,t he quote for products or services in response to this request for quotation x is is not in compliance with the electronic and information technology accessibility standards cfr,specified below,as a minimum.the certification also included the following note after the signature block see monster exceptions in the previous section.
where an offeror has certified that it meets the technical requirements of a proposal,the contracting officer is entitled to rely on such certification in determining whether to accept a bid,and the offeror potential failure to comply with the proposal requirements is ordinarily a matter of contract administration,which does not go to the propriety of accepting the bid.see centech,at citing with approval in re orincon,wl july,a s a general matter,an agency judgment as to whether a small business offeror will comply with the subcontracting limitation is a matter of responsibility,and the contractor actual compliance with the provision is a matter of contract administration.however,where a proposal,on its face,should lead an agency to the conclusion that an offeror could not and would not comply with the applicable requirement,we have considered this to be a matter of the proposal technical acceptability,which does affect the propriety of accepting the offer.id.emphasis added see also in re spectrum,b,wl,at may,a n agency may accept a quotation representation that indicates compliance with the solicitation requirements,where there is no significant countervailing evidence reasonably known to the agency evaluators that should create doubt whether the offeror will or can comply with the requirement.
the proper framing of the acceptability of monster proposal is,therefore,whether the generally compliant with exceptions language in monster proposal constitutes significant countervailing evidence reasonably known to the agency evaluators that should create doubt whether the offeror will or can comply with the requirement.spectrum,wl,at.
this court,consistent with the claims court,determines that the contracting officer did not lack a rational basis to accept the proposal because the exceptions language does not constitute such countervailing evidence for three reasons.
first,the statement of exception is consistent with monster two certifications that its offer would comply with section.compliance with section is not an attribute of a product,requiring perfect compliance or disqualification,as evidenced by the flexible statutory requirement that the agency shall ensure that the electronic and information technology allows individuals with disabilities who are federal employees to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.u.d a a.this flexibility is reflected in the implementing regulations.see requiring comparable access allowing alternative technologies that result in substantially equivalent or greater access to and use of a product for people with disabilities.
a reasonable reading of the generally compliant with minor exceptions language in the context of the offer as a whole is that monster certifies that whatever minor exceptions it takes,it nevertheless considers its offer to meet the flexible requirements of section.this reading is supported by the note at the end of monster section compliance certification,because,in spite of the referenced exceptions in part,monster nevertheless certified its compliance with section.it was not irrational for the contracting officer to credit monster representation to determine that monster met all the requirements of the rfq.indeed,as discussed above,the contractor must credit monster certification unless there is significant countervailing evidence.because nothing in the statutes,regulations,or the rfq requires that an offer must be considered simply because it is not perfectly compliant,the phrase generally compliant with minor exceptions does not constitute significant countervailing evidence that should make the agency doubt the offeror compliance.
allied argues,and the dissent agrees,that a requires a proposal to be perfectly and unequivocally compliant with section to be acceptable because it requires that products covered by this part shall comply with all applicable provisions of this part.emphasis added.this argument presumes that monster minor exceptions indicate that monster service would fail to satisfy some provisions of section,but,as discussed immediately above,monster may satisfy section even if it considers itself to have minor exceptions because of the flexibility inherent in the statute.
second,monster statement is not the kind of significant countervailing evidence that this court and the gao have found to require disqualification in light of satisfactory certifications of compliance.for example,in centech,at,this court determined that gao recommendation to the air force not to accept centech offer was rational,where a statute required that centech perform percent of the work itself,and centech proposed to only perform percent and subcontract the rest.likewise in in re mmi federal marketing service,b,wl gao,a case cited by allied,the gao determined that the agency could not accept without verification the winning bidder of compliance with the berry amendment requiring that certain products be purchased and treated domestically where the winning bidder initial bid called for treatment at a plant in china as the only place in the world where such treatment was performed,and the was made as part of a modified manufacturing plan.id.at.t he agency evaluation of iguana quotat
