robinson company appeals the final decision of the court of international trade finding robinson liable for duties,taxes,and fees for certain entries of wearing apparel from china.united states robinson,d.int l trade.for the reasons below,we affirm.
background 
this appeal arises out of an action brought by the united states against robinson,a carrier,to recover certain duties,taxes,and fees under section of the tariff act of,and c.specifically,the government seeks to recover duties,taxes,and fees accrued for three entries subject entries of wearing apparel from the people republic of china subject merchandise,which entered the united states as transportation exportation t e entries but were never exported and are currently missing.
the subject merchandise entered the united states in december at the port of los angeles under t e numbers,and.intercambio comercial ekim intercambio,a mexican company,was the importer of record and consignee of the subject merchandise.the t e entry documents designated robinson as the bonded carrier and indicated that the merchandise was to be delivered to the care of forwarding freight broker in laredo,texas,for exportation to mexico.robinson engaged mario transports to transport the subject merchandise from los angeles to laredo.
although there is no dispute that the subject merchandise left los angeles,it is not clear what happened to the merchandise after that.what is known is that,on january and,mario peña,peña,a licensed customs broker,stamped the t e entry documents customs forms at an unmonitored stamp machine in the lobby of the export lot of the customs service customs at the port of laredo.peña did not transport the subject merchandise to the export lot,nor did he see,inspect,or take possession of the subject merchandise.peña official log book shows receipt of the t e entry forms,but does not show a corresponding date of exportation for each entry.
customs never inspected or took possession of the subject merchandise at the port of laredo.at the time,customs used a process at the port of laredo in which customs did not supervise exportation or require carriers to report their arrival at the port of destination or the exportation of the merchandise.instead,customs relied on a system designed to ensure compliance with procedures for t e entries.through this system,customs selectively required carriers to demonstrate disposition of the merchandise upon customs request.the combined reliance on an export lot and a process was neither uncommon nor unusual at the time,in particular along the border.
in march,customs initiated a on the subject merchandise and contacted robinson requesting information regarding the disposition of the merchandise.robinson informed customs that the merchandise had been exported to mexico.as proof of exportation,robinson submitted the stamped t e entry forms and three stamped mexican importation forms,or pedimentos,that were provided by intercambio.
customs contacted mexican customs authorities to verify the authenticity of the pedimentos.after mexican authorities confirmed that the pedimentos were false,customs issued three notices of liquidated damages claims against robinson custodial bond,each for.the notices charged robinson with misdelivery of the subject merchandise in violation of.in response,robinson submitted administrative petitions to customs,seeking a reduction in the amount of liquidated damages.based upon mitigation guidelines,customs reduced the amount of liquidated damages owed for the three subject entries from to.
robinson paid the in and filed a complaint in the court of federal claims seeking a full refund.the court of federal claims stayed the action to permit the government to pursue collection of duties against robinson.customs made a demand on robinson,pursuant to and c,for payment of,plus interest,for duties,taxes,and fees owed on the subject entries.the demand explained that robinson failed to ensure that the subject merchandise was exported to mexico and,consequently,t he goods subject to restrictions were diverted into the united states resulting in a loss of lawful duties due to the government.joint appendix at.robinson did not protest the demand or pay the duties,and its challenge to commerce assessment of liquidated damages pending before the court of federal claims remained stayed.
in,the government filed the present action in the court of international trade seeking to recover the in unpaid duties,taxes,and fees.in march,robinson moved to dismiss the government complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,alleging that does not allow the collection of duties.the court of international trade denied robinson motion to dismiss,explaining that section contemplates that customs will promulgate regulations governing t e entries and,in turn,c imposes an obligation on the bonded carrier to pay duties on any missing merchandise.in january,the court of international trade further clarified that the government would bear the burden of persuasion at trial to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject merchandise is missing within the meaning of c.the court also noted that the government burden of persuasion may be satisfied by cast ing enough suspicion over the of the merchandise for the to conclude that the merchandise was not exported.at.
following a bench trial,the court of international trade found c.robinson liable for the duties,taxes,and fees demanded by the government.first,the court found that the government established by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject merchandise was missing.among other evidence,the court considered expert testimony by the assistant commissioner for post import and commercial fraud for the mexican customs service,rodolfo torres herrera,who confirmed that the pedimentos were false and contained numerous discrepancies that were unverifiable by search of official mexican electronic databases the name of the mexican customs broker did not match the broker license number the tax identification number and population registration number for the broker did not exist and there was no record of a relationship between the importing company and the broker or the bank listed as having received payment of mexican customs duties.see robinson,d at.torres herrera testified that,in his experience,illegal entry,smuggling of merchandise into mexico is most often accomplished by using pedimentos that,unlike the pedimentos submitted by robinson,are valid in all respects except for the listed country of origin,so as to minimize the risk of raising suspicion at the various mexican checkpoints through which all truck cargo must pass upon crossing the mexico border.see id.at.jesus alberto fernandez wilburn,the port director of colombia,nuevo leon,mexico,further testified that mexican customs would have seized cargo whose pedimentos did not appear in mexican customs electronic database and that there is no record that mexican customs seized the merchandise at issue in this case.see id.
the court of international trade further found that robinson failed to account for the missing merchandise.the court noted that robinson conceded at trial that the pedimentos were not genuine and could not be verified by mexican authorities.id.at.the court also found that none of the evidence submitted by robinson the pedimentos,driver hand tags and freight bills,and peña log book showed that the subject merchandise was exported to mexico at most,the evidence demonstrated proof of delivery of the subject merchandise to the port of laredo in accordance with c.see id.at.the court concluded that robinson,as the bonded carrier,not only had a responsibility to deliver the merchandise at the destination port,but also to ensure that the subject merchandise was either exported or lawfully entered into the united states.see id.at.accordingly,the court found robinson liable for duties,taxes,and fees under and c.
robinson timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of international trade legal determinations without deference.united states ford motor.its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.id 
generally,merchandise imported into the united states may be entered for consumption,entered for warehouse,admitted into a foreign trade zone,or entered for transportation to another port.transportation allows movement of imported merchandise from one port to another port in the united states without appraisement or payment of duties,provided a transportation entry document is filed customs form and a bond is paid.once the merchandise arrives at a destination port in the united states,the merchandise may be officially entered into commerce and duties and other imposts or charges are paid,or the merchandise may be exported and duties and charges are not paid.for example,in this case,imports of the subject merchandise from china would be subject to normal duties and,potentially,to other charges arising from import quotas and other trade restrictions applicable to certain apparel products originating from china.
a t e entry is the type of movement typically used when merchandise is to be exported at a port other than the port of entry.see a.a bonded carrier transporting merchandise pursuant to a t e entry must comply with certain regulations governing the receipt,safekeeping,and disposition of bonded merchandise.under a,the bonded carrier is responsible for any shortage,irregular delivery,or nondelivery at the port of destination or exportation of bonded merchandise received by it for carriage.a.the bonded carrier may be liable for liquidated damages under the carrier bond for any such shortage,failure to deliver,or irregular delivery.id.b.additionally,the bonded carrier may be liable for duties 
c in addition to the penalties described in paragraph b of this section,the carrier shall pay any taxes,duties,or other taxes accruing to the united states on the missing merchandise,together with all costs,charges,and expenses caused by the failure to make the required transportation,report,and delivery.
the court of international trade held robinson liable under c because the court found that the government established by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject merchandise is missing and robinson failed to account for the merchandise.on appeal,robinson does not challenge the validity of the regulation,but argues instead that the subject merchandise is not missing within the meaning of c.specifically,robinson urges us to interpret the term missing in c as limited to losses occurring prior to delivery,as a result of a shortage,failure to deliver,or irregular delivery.according to robinson,a bonded carrier transporting merchandise under a t e entry is only responsible for delivering the merchandise at the port of exportation and not for any losses occurring after that.robinson contends that the stamped t e entry forms it provided in this case are conclusive proof that it fulfilled its duty irrespective of what happened to the merchandise after arriving at the port of laredo.
we agree with robinson that the bonded carrier of merchandise imported under a t e entry is only responsible for ensuring delivery,not exportation.however,although properly receipted customs forms may constitute acceptable proof of delivery under a,such proof is not conclusive.customs retains the authority to verify that delivery in fact occurred.as part of such verification,for example,customs may request,as it did in this case,additional evidence of proper delivery to the port of exportation,such as bills of lading or delivery receipts.if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that the bonded merchandise was not properly delivered,stamped customs forms do not insulate a bonded carrier from liability for any shortage,failure to deliver,or irregular delivery.
in the case of t e entries,evidence of proper delivery may include documents showing that the bonded merchandise was exported.conversely,lack of exportation evidence may support a finding that delivery never occurred.any merchandise that is imported under bond for exportation but is not actually exported must necessarily have remained within the united states and remains the carrier responsibility unless the carrier can account for the shipment by,for example,providing proof of delivery or transfer to the exporting carrier.accordingly,we agree with the court of international trade that,where merchandise is entered and transported for exportation,the bonded carrier may be required to provide evidence of delivery,even where the bonded carrier otherwise submits a properly receipted customs form under a.
as the court of international trade pointed out,there is no statute or regulation that imposes a burden on customs to search for or locate merchandise to establish that it was not properly delivered.see robinson,d at.customs need only establish by a preponderance of the evidence that complete delivery did not occur,which may include showing that the merchandise was not exported.if any merchandise is not exported and is otherwise unaccounted for,it is missing and customs may collect duties from the bonded carrier pursuant to and c.
robinson relies on to distinguish between the obligations of a delivering carrier and an exporting carrier.while a requires the delivering carrier to surrender the manifest,customs form to customs no more than working days after arrival at the port of exportation,c provides that it is the exporting carrier who should maintain exportation records for years from the date of exportation and make those records available to customs upon request.see a,c.robinson argues that,pursuant to the t e entry documents,robinson was not the exporting carrier it was not required to take the goods to mexico and forwarding,the consignee,was instead the party responsible for exportation.
we disagree with robinson that the court of international trade improperly conflated an exporting carrier obligation to provide,when asked,proof of exportation,with the delivering carrier obligation to provide notice of arrival by surrendering the manifest to customs.the court held robinson liable under c because it is the bonded carrier,not the exporting carrier,and the regulation provides that the bonded carrier may be liable for duties on missing merchandise.while a bonded carrier may not be required to maintain exportation records and provide proof of exportation pursuant to c unless it is also the exporting carrier,it may nonetheless be required,pursuant to c,to account for missing merchandise transported under bond.in this case,the court of international trade correctly placed upon the government the initial burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject merchandise was missing.once the government met its initial burden,robinson failure to provide satisfactory proof of exportation or any other evidence regarding the disposition of the merchandise exposed it to liability under c,irrespective of the duties imposed separately on the exporting carrier under c.
finally,robinson argues that the court of international trade erred when it clarified that,to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that merchandise is missing,the government needed only to cast enough suspicion over the of the merchandise for the to conclude that the merchandise was not exported.at.c.robinson also contends that the court erred in finding that the government met its burden of proof entirely based on circumstantial evidence.although we disagree with the court of international trade characterization of the government proof to the extent it implies a lower burden than a preponderance of the evidence,the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence both are valid measures of proof.the only question is whether the proofs offered satisfy the applicable burden of proof,and we find that the government met its burden in this case.
the court of international trade properly weighed all the evidence presented at trial in holding that,although there was no direct evidence as to the whereabouts of the subject merchandise,the united states presented enough evidence to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the merchandise is missing.robinson,d at.specifically,the court considere
