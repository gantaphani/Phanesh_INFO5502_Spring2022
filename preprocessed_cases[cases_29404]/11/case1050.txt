california statute copyright act 
the panel affirmed the district court order granting special motion to strike,pursuant to california statute,the action brought by patrick maloney and tim judge,alleging that exploited their likenesses commercially.
plaintiffs alleged that exploited their likenesses by selling licenses permitting consumers to download photographs from the national collegiate athletic association photo library for use.plaintiffs asserted statutory and common law claims and an unfair competition claim under california law.
the california statute,cal.civ.proc.code,was enacted to allow for early dismissal of meritless first amendment cases aimed at chilling expression though litigation.
section of the federal copyright act adopted a test to determine whether a state law claim was preempted by the act first,whether the subject matter of the state claim fell within the subject matter of copyright,as described in and and second,if so,whether the rights asserted under state law were equivalent to the rights contained in.
at step one of the copyright act test,the panel held that the subject matter of the state law claims fell within the subject matter of copyright.specifically,the panel held that a claim may proceed when a likeness is used on merchandise or in advertising but where a likeness has been captured in a copyrighted artistic visual work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use,a claim is little more than a copyright claim because it seeks to hold a copyright holder liable for exercising his exclusive rights under the copyright act.the panel concluded that plaintiffs claims and the derivative unfair competition law claim challenged control of the artistic work itself,and accordingly,the subject matter of the state law claims fell exclusively within the subject matter of copyright.
at step two,the panel held that the rights plaintiffs asserted were equivalent to rights within the general scope of copyright.
the panel concluded that plaintiffs state law claims were preempted by section of the federal copyright act because plaintiffs sought to hold liable for exercising rights governed exclusively by copyright law.the panel further held that plaintiffs could not demonstrate a reasonable probability of prevailing on their challenged claims and the district court did not err in granting the special motion to strike,and dismissing without leave to amend.
former patrick maloney and tim judge allege that defendant,exploited their likenesses commercially by selling licenses permitting consumers to download photographs from the national collegiate athletic association ncaa photo library for art use.maloney and judge assert statutory and common law claims and an unfair competition claim under california law.the district court held that the federal copyright act preempts plaintiffs claims and granted special motion to strike pursuant to california statute.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the parties 
plaintiffs patrick maloney and tim judge are former ncaa who played for the catholic university cu men basketball team between and.in their final year at cu,they made it all the way to the division iii national championship game,and helped lead the underdog cardinals to an upset victory over the william paterson university pioneers.the game drama was captured in a series of photographs depicting the plaintiffs in play,and later posing as members of the team with cu national championship trophy.the ncaa owns or controls the copyright to these photographs.it accordingly placed them into its collection,the ncaa photo library.
provides storage,hosting,and licensing services for a wide variety of digital content.in,it contracted with the ncaa to store,host,and license the images in the ncaa photo library.the ncaa photo library itself contains thousands of photographs chronicling seventy years of ncaa sports history.until,made the photographs available to the public through its website.
consumers could view digital thumbnails of the images contained in the ncaa photo library on,and obtain for to a license permitting them to download a copy of a chosen photograph.brief descriptions of the events depicted in the images accompanied the digital thumbnails users were also required to assent to a content license agreement in order to download one of the photographs.pursuant to that agreement,consumers could use a single copy of the image for art use.consumers did not obtain any right or license to use the name or likeness of any individual including any athlete,announcer,or coach appearing in the content in connection with or as an express or implied endorsement of any product or service.
procedural history 
plaintiffs commenced this action in the central district of california in june.they allege that exploited their names and likenesses commercially by selling photographs on depicting their triumph.they purport to represent a putative class of all current and former ncaa whose names,images,and likenesses have been used without their consent by for the purpose of advertising,selling,or soliciting purchases of the photographs themselves.the complaint asserts claims for violation of california statutory right of publicity,cal.civ.code,common law right of publicity,and unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus.code et 
in october,moved to strike the complaint pursuant to california statute.cal.civ.proc.code.argued that the federal copyright act preempts plaintiffs claims,that they are barred by the first amendment,and that california statutory exemption for news,public affairs,or sports broadcasts or accounts precludes liability for any violations.the district court granted motion to strike on march,holding that the copyright act preempts plaintiffs claims,and declining to reach the other defenses.
according to the district court,the plaintiffs asserted rights that fell within the subject matter of copyright because their claims derived from the licensing of copyrighted photographs,which were original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression under the circumstances.the court rejected plaintiffs argument that a claim involving a photograph is not subject to preemption.it distinguished between claims derived from selling a copyrighted photograph containing an athlete likeness,which it said require preemption,and claims based on using the athlete likeness contained in the photograph for some other purpose,which it said do not.the district court also concluded that plaintiffs were asserting rights equivalent to the exclusive rights contained in the copyright act because they did not identify a use of their names or likenesses independent of the display,reproduction,and distribution of the copyrighted images in which they are depicted.lastly,the district court found that the plaintiffs ucl claim was derivative of the claims,and thus concluded that it failed because the claims were preempted by the copyright act.the court denied plaintiffs request for additional discovery because the identified topics did not bear on the issue of preemption.the court also acknowledged that plaintiffs had been afforded an opportunity to amend and to conduct at least minimal discovery,so it struck the complaint without leave to amend and dismissed the action with prejudice.the court later awarded attorneys fees in favor.cal.civ.proc.code c.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on april.

california statute permits defendants to file a special motion to strike any cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue.cal.civ.proc.code b.the statute was enacted to allow for early dismissal of meritless first amendment cases aimed at chilling expression through costly,litigation.batzel smith,cir.quotation marks omitted.its mechanism weeds out lawsuits brought to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.manzari associated newspapers,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
at step one of the analysis,the moving defendant must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff suit arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant constitutional right to free speech.makaeff trump,llc,cir.at step two,assuming that showing has been made,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish a reasonable probability that it will prevail on its claim s.id.
here,plaintiffs concede that their suit arises from acts in furtherance of right to free speech.that conclusion is sound because their claims stem from the publication and distribution of expressive photographs over the internet it is thus incumbent on plaintiffs to demonstrate a reasonable probability of prevailing on their challenged claims.insists that feat is impossible because the federal copyright act preempts plaintiffs claims.we agree.
preemption under section of the copyright act 
the copyright act affords copyright owners the exclusive rights to display,perform,reproduce,or distribute copies of a copyrighted work,to authorize others to do those things,and to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.the copyright,in other words,gives the owner the right to control the work,including the decision whether or not to make the work available to the public.laws sony music entm t,cir.
section of the act seeks to preempt and abolish any rights under the common law or statutes of a state that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works,so long as the rights fall within the scope of the federal copyright law,at.we have adopted a test,in accordance with section,to determine whether a state law claim is preempted by the act.laws,at.first,we decide whether the subject matter of the state law claim falls within the subject matter of copyright as described in and.id.second,assuming it does,we determine whether the rights asserted under state law are equivalent to the rights contained in,which articulates the exclusive rights of copyright holders.id.at.
here,the parties joust solely with respect to step one and assert competing rules that seek to define the boundary between copyright preemption and state law rights of publicity.plaintiffs maintain that claims categorically fall outside the subject matter of copyright because such claims protect an individual persona,which itself can not be fixed in a tangible medium of expression,by contrast,insists that the publicity right protects against the use of one name or likeness on merchandise or in advertising.would permit claims to proceed in those contexts,but find preemption where,as here,a likeness has been captured in an artistic work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use.
the right of publicity seeks to prevent commercial exploitation of an individual identity without that person consent.see hilton hallmark cards,cir.stating that the core of the right of publicity is preventing merchandising of a celebrity image without that person consent facenda films,cir.stating that the core of the publicity right is the right not to have one identity used in advertising toney usa,cir.the basis of a right of publicity claim concerns the message whether the plaintiff endorses,or appears to endorse the product in question.mindful of that premise,we conclude that a claim is not preempted when it targets use of one name or likeness on merchandise or in advertising.but when a likeness has been captured in a copyrighted artistic visual work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use,a claim interferes with the exclusive rights of the copyright holder,and is preempted by section of the copyright act.
here,maloney and judge do not contend that their likenesses were ever used on merchandise or in advertising.they challenge instead the copyright holder decision to distribute the copyrighted images themselves by selling consumers a license to download a chosen photograph from the ncaa photo library for noncommercial art use.under these circumstances,the claims and the derivative ucl claim challenge control of the artistic work itself.laws,at.because plaintiffs seek to hold liable for exercising rights governed exclusively by copyright law,the claims are preempted by section of the copyright act.
we derive these conclusions from the text of the copyright act,our precedents,the reasoning of other circuits,and a leading copyright treatise.
step one the subject matter of the state law claims falls within the subject matter of copyright.
a.the statutory text and our precedents.
the subject matter of copyright embodies original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which they can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated,either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.a.works of authorship include,among other things,pictorial works.id.a,a.additionally,a work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated for a period of time of more than transitory duration.id.
here,the claims arise from the licensing of photographs,which plaintiffs concede are expressive pictorial works to which a photographer contributes some original elements.there is also no doubt that a photograph is sufficiently permanent to permit it to be perceived for more than transitory duration.the subject matter of the state law claim s the photographs therefore appears to fall within the subject matter of copyright.laws,at.
plaintiffs resist this conclusion by drilling down on the content of a claim.plaintiffs maintain that the right of publicity as it pertains to photographs protects against exploitation of an individual likeness or persona.since those attributes exist independent of any single photograph,plaintiffs argue that claims categorically fall outside the subject matter of copyright.in other words,plaintiffs insist they do not assert any right in the particular photographic works of authorship at issue here.instead,they claim that the personal attributes protected by the right of publicity can not be fixed in copyrightable form in the same way as an actor performance or an author writings.
plaintiffs draw support for their position primarily from downing abercrombie fitch,cir.there,clothing retailer abercrombie fitch developed a surfing theme for its catalog,which was the company largest advertising vehicle.id.at.as part of the campaign,abercrombie purchased photographs depicting the plaintiffs taking part in the makaha international surf championship in hawaii.id.at.abercrombie used the photographs in a section of the catalog entitled surf nekkid.id.it also decided to create,exactly like those worn by the plaintiffs in the photograph,for sale in the upcoming issue.id.these final heat tees appeared in the catalog for sale two pages after the pictures of the plaintiffs.id.abercrombie did not obtain at any time the plaintiffs permission to use the photographs in the catalog.id.
we held that section of the copyright act did not preempt plaintiffs claims.id.at.we reasoned that it is not the publication of the photograph itself,as a creative work of authorship,that is the basis for plaintiffs claims,but rather,it is the use of the plaintiffs likenesses and their names pictured in the published photograph.id.at.we observed that a person name or likeness is not a work of authorship within the meaning of.id.at.this is true,we said,notwithstanding the fact that plaintiffs names and likenesses are embodied in a copyrightable photograph.id.
contrary to plaintiffs argument,downing did not mint a categorical rule that claims relating to a likeness in a photograph are not subject to preemption.instead,we said that when the use of a likeness forms the basis of a claim,the claim is not preempted.downing,at.we did not state that a likeness is the basis of a claim any time it is fixed in a photograph.the crux of the issue is thus deciding when a claim seeks to vindicate misuse of an individual likeness,as opposed to merely interfering with the distribution,display,or performance of a copyrighted work.
on that point,plaintiffs rely almost entirely on the idea that a theoretical line should separate claims based on photographs from other works protected by the copyright act.they insist that a different preemption rule applies to claims arising from performances in film and sound recordings as opposed to those arising from a mere likeness in a photograph,and that the latter type of claim is not subject to preemption because u nlike a performance,a person mere likeness is not a copyrightable contribution to a photograph.
the text of the copyright act does not support plaintiffs construction.section draws no distinction among different types of copyrighted works when it comes to federal preemption see a.it directs attention to sections and,which list the categories of works in which copyright protection subsists,suggesting that the same preemption rule applies to all works that are contained within the subject matter of copyright.id.given that pictorial works appear on that list alongside motion pictures and sound recordings,id.a,there is no textual basis to carve out a preemption rule that applies solely to photographs.
moreover,our precedents clarify that the distinction pertinent to the preemption of a claim is not the type of copyrightable work at issue,but rather the way in which one name or likeness is affected by the use of the copyrighted work.
for example,in downing,the claim was not permitted to proceed simply because an individual likeness was fixed in a photograph.indeed,it was not the publication of the photograph itself,as a creative work of authorship,that formed the basis of the claim.at.instead,it was the unauthorized use of the plaintiffs likenesses to advertise abercrombie products,and the creation of,exactly like those worn by the plaintiffs in the photograph,for sale in abercrombie catalog.id.the plaintiffs sustained injury to their individual personas because their likenesses were exploited commercially without their consent.the plaintiffs were not seeking to use the right of publicity simply to prevent publication of an artistic,visual work.
laws bolsters the interpretation that preemption turns on how a copyrighted photograph is used.in particular,laws distinguished downing as a case involv ing photographs used in advertising.id.at emphasis added.we observed that abercrombie went well beyond the mere republication of the photograph.rather,it published the photo in connection with a broad advertising campaign,identified the by name,and offered for sale the same worn by the plaintiffs in the photo.id.importantly,we said that abercrombie had suggested that the surfers had endorsed abercrombie.accordingly,downing concluded that it is not the publication of the photograph itself that is the basis for plaintiffs claims,but rather,it is the use of the plaintiffs likenesses and their names pictured in the published photographs.id.quoting downing,at emphasis added.laws strongly implies that misuse of an individual likeness is the basis of a claim when the name or image is exploited in advertising or on merchandise.it correspondingly implies that one likeness does not form the basis of a claim when the tort action challenges control of the artistic work itself,id.at,or involves the mere republication of the photograph,id.at.
in further support of this interpretation,laws appears to reject plaintiffs reading of fleet cbs,cal.app.in fleet,the plaintiffs were actors in a film,white dragon,to which the defendant,cbs,owned the copyright.id.at.having been denied certain compensation,plaintiffs sued cbs alleging that cbs did not have permission to utilize their names,pictures,or likenesses in conjunction with any exploitation of the film.id.cbs released the film anyway and included a picture of one of the plaintiffs on the packaging and in advertising materials.id.at.the court held that section of the copyright act preempted the plaintiffs claims.id.at.it agree d that as a general proposition civil code section is intended to protect rights which can not be copyrighted.id.but it found that the plaintiffs analysis crumbles in the face of one obvious fact their individual performances in the film white dragon were copyrightable.id.once the performances were put on film,they became dramatic work s fixed in a tangible medium of expression.id.quoting a.at that point,the court said,the performances came within the scope or subject matter of copyright law protection.id.at.given that the claims sought only to prevent cbs from reproducing and distributing plaintiffs performances in the film,the court concluded that the claims must be preempted by federal copyright law.id.at.
maloney and judge read fleet holding to be limited to preemption of dramatic performances,and not to include photographs,because it observes that t he celebrity who has merely had his picture taken has not engaged in a dramatic work or other work of authorship,and,as professor nimmer said,would be afforded no protection under federal copyright law.id.at.they believe fleet supports their line between photographs and dramatic performances because fleet adds if not for state law,the celebrity who had his picture taken would have no remedy against those who would misappropriate his image for their own gain.id.emphasis added.the state law,of course,is the right of publicity,so plaintiffs read fleet to support a dichotomy between likenesses in photographs and likenesses in other copyrightable works.
laws explains that in fleet,however,s ince cbs use of plaintiffs likenesses did not extend beyond the use of the copyrighted material it held,there was no right of publicity at issue,aside from the actors performances.id.at emphasis added.laws does not read fleet,as plaintiffs contend,to draw a line between photographs and performances.instead,it endorses the practice of looking at how one likeness is affected by the use of the copyrighted material whether that material is a photograph or something else.
laws itself illustrates the same point.there,debra laws recorded a song,very special,to which elektra obtained the copyright.id.at.sony then obtained a license from elektra to sample laws recording of very special in a song by jennifer lopez and cool id.after the song became a hit,laws brought claims alleging that sony use of very special misappropriated her name and voice.id.we held that section of the copyright act preempted the claims.id.
we distinguished cases where the defendant obtained a license to a song and then imitated the singer voice,which we said did not necessitate preemption because misappropriation of the voice itself was the subject of those claims.id.at.by contrast,we concluded it is clear that federal copyright law preempts a claim alleging misappropriation of one voice when the entirety of the allegedly misappropriated vocal performance is contained within a copyrighted medium.id.at.applying that rule,we concluded that laws claim challenge d control of the artistic work itself and could hardly be more closely related to the subject matter of the copyright act because sony had merely licensed copyrighted content and did not use laws image,name,or the voice recording in any promotional materials.id.at.
laws is significant in another respect it considered the argument that the subject matter of a copyright claim and a right of publicity claim are substantively different.id.at.like plaintiffs here,laws argued that a copyright claim protects ownership rights to a work of art,while a right of publicity claim concerns the right to protect one persona and likeness.id.sony responded that the subject matter of a right of publicity claim in one voice is not different from a copyright claim when the voice is embodied within a copyrighted sound recording.id.sony added that once a voice becomes part of a sound recording in a fixed tangible medium it comes within the subject matter of copyright.id.
we sided with sony.we acknowledged that california law recognizes an assertable interest in the publicity associated with one voice.id.at.but again,we held that federal copyright law preempts a claim alleging misappropriation of one voice when the entirety of the allegedly misappropriated vocal performance is contained within a copyrighted medium.id.
finally,our most recent decision in this area further buttresses the concept that whether a right of publicity claim is preempted turns on the way in which one name or likeness is affected by the use of a copyrighted work.in jules jordan video,canada,cir,an actor who retained the copyright to the adult films in which he performed sued a video company for replic ating and distribut ing a number of his copyrighted dvds without license or authority.id.at.the actor brought claims alleging that the defendants misappropriated his name and persona,in addition to his dramatic performance.id.at.the actor contended that his publicity rights were offended by the unauthorized reproduction,counterfeiting,and sale of his copyrighted works.id.thus,he maintained,the factual basis of his right of publicity claim was the unauthorized reproduction of his performance on the dvds.id.at.
we held that the copyright act preempted the claims because the actor assertion that defendants misappropriated his name and persona wa s based entirely on the misappropriation of the dvds and the actor performance therein.id.at.in other words,the actor was objecting to the unauthorized distribution and republication of a copyrighted work,not the exploitation of his likeness on an unrelated product or in advertising.we also considered the actor argument that it is the use of his name and likeness on the covers of the counterfeit dvds that violated his right of publicity.id.at.we concluded that even under that theory,the claims would still be preempted because the pictures on the covers of the dvds are still shots of the copyrighted video performance.id.
in sum,our cases clarify that a claim may proceed when a likeness is used on merchandise or in advertising.but where a likeness has been captured in a copyrighted artistic visual work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use,a claim is little more than a thinly disguised copyright claim because it seeks to hold a copyright holder liable for exercising his exclusive rights under the copyright act 
persuasive authority.
a trio of cases out of the third and eighth circuits lends further support to this conclusion.in facenda films,cir,the third circuit considered a clash between the right of publicity and the exploitation of a defendant copyright.id.at.the plaintiff had narrated several nfl films,and the defendant repurposed some of those copyrighted clips for use in a production about the football video game madden nfl.id.at.consistent with our holding that there is no categorical preemption rule separating photographs from everything else,the court stated that w here a defendant in a claim obtained a copyright in a work featuring the plaintiff,courts must separate legitimate exploitations of what congress intended to be a copyright holder exclusive rights from particular uses that infringe the right of publicity.id.at emphasis added.
turning to that task,the court observed that when defendants use the work for the purposes of trade,such as in an advertisement,plaintiffs claims have not been held to be preempted.id.at citing nimmer b b iv l.conversely,when defendants uses constitute expressive works,claims have been preempted.id.
applying that distinction,the third circuit concluded that preemption was not appropriate because t he nfl used the sound recordings of the plaintiff voice in a television production promoting the video game.id.at.this was akin to advertising,and the core of the publicity right,according to the court,is the right not to have one identity used in advertising.id.at.
in ray espn,cir,the eighth circuit applied the same distinction that guided the third circuit in facenda.the plaintiff in ray was a professional wrestler whose matches were filmed.id.at.defendant espn those films without obtaining the plaintiff consent.id.at.the court found that the filming of the plaintiff wrestling performances clearly generated an original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression.id.at.it thus concluded that the subject matter of the claim fell within the subject matter of copyright because the claim was based on the distribution of copyrighted material.id.in response to the plaintiff argument that misuse of his likeness was the true focal point of the case,the court maintained that the claim was preempted because espn did not use the plaintiff likeness or name in an advertisement without his permission to promote its commercial products.id.at internal quotation mark omitted.
a year later,the eighth circuit revisited the issue in dryer national football league,cir.there,three nfl players argued that their publicity rights were violated by use of their game footage in various nfl films,which subsequently were licensed and broadcast to the public.id.at.they maintained that their performances in football games were part of their identities rather than fixed works eligible for copyright protection.id.at.the court acknowledged that athletic performances are not copyrightable,but found the copyright act specifically includes within its purview fixed recordings of such live performances.id.continuing,the court observed that a suit challenging the use of a copyrighted work in a commercial advertisement could have purposes unrelated to the aims of copyright law.id.at emphasis added.but it said that w hen a suit challenges the expressive,use of a copyrighted work,that suit seeks to subordinate the copyright holder right to exploit the value of that work to the plaintiff interest in controlling the work dissemination.id.because the plaintiffs d id not challenge the nfl use of their likenesses or identities in any context other than the publication of th e game footage,the court held that the claims fell within the subject matter of copyright.id.at.
a leading copyright treatise invoked by the third and eighth circuits further bolsters our conclusion.nimmer on copyright suggests that the right of publicity should be construed in accordance with the restatement of unfair competition,which limits liability to misappropriation for the purposes of trade.see nimmer b b iv internal quotation marks omitted.according to the restatement,t he name,likeness,and other indicia of a person identity are used for purposes of trade if they are used in advertising the user goods or services,or are placed on merchandise marketed by the user,or are used in connection with services rendered by the user.restatement third of unfair competition.use for purposes of trade would not ordinarily include the use of a person identity in news reporting,commentary,entertainment,works of fiction or nonfiction,or in advertising that is incidental to such uses.id.
the use for trade considerations can almost perfectly distinguish between the cases finding preemption and those permitting claims to proceed as our precedents reflect,the crucial distinction is not between categories of copyrightable works,but how those copyrighted works are used 
application 
as noted,maloney and judge do not allege that their names and likenesses were ever used in connection with the sale of any merchandise.nor do they contend that their likenesses were ever used in any advertising.instead,the copyrighted images themselves were licensed to individuals for art use.moreover,the licensees of the maloney and judge photos did not obtain any right or license to use the name or likeness of any individual in connection with or as an express or implied endorsement of any product or service.
plaintiffs claims and the derivative ucl claim challenge control of the artistic work itself.laws,at.pursuant to laws,the subject matter of the state law claims therefore falls within the subject matter of copyright.
we believe that our holding strikes the right balance by permitting athletes to control the use of their names or likenesses on merchandise or in advertising,whil
