we have for review a question of florida law certified by the united states eleventh circuit court of appeals that is determinative of a cause pending in that court and for which there appears to be no controlling precedent.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
the pertinent facts of this case,as set forth by the eleventh circuit,are as follows 
in october,a rare confluence of meteorological events led to a massively powerful weather system off the new england coast.the fishing vessel known as the andrea gail was caught in this storm and lost at sea.all six of the crewmembers on board the andrea gail,including billy tyne and dale murphy,were presumed to have been killed.newspaper and television reports extensively chronicled the storm and its impact.based on these reports,and personal interviews with meteorologists,local fisherman,and family members,sebastian junger penned a book,entitled the perfect storm a true story of men against the sea,recounting the storm and the last voyage of the andrea gail and its crew.the book was published in.
that same year,warner purchased from junger and his publisher the rights to produce a motion picture based on the book.warner released the film,entitled the perfect storm,for public consumption in.the picture depicted the lives and deaths of billy tyne and dale murphy,who were the main characters in the film.it also included brief portrayals of each individual that is a party to this appeal.nonetheless,warner neither sought permission from the individuals depicted in the picture nor compensated them in any manner.
unlike the book,the picture presented a concededly dramatized account of both the storm and the crew of the andrea gail.for example,the main protagonist in the picture,billy tyne,was portrayed as a swordboat captain who was obsessed with the next big catch.in one scene,the picture relates an admittedly fabricated depiction of tyne berating his crew for wanting to return to port in gloucester,massachusetts.warner took additional liberties with the interpersonal relationships between the crewmembers and their families.
while the picture did not hold itself out as factually accurate,it did indicate at the beginning of the film that this film is based on a true story.a disclaimer inserted during the closing credits elaborated on this point with the following statement this film is based on actual historical events contained in the perfect storm by sebastian junger.dialogue and certain events and characters in the film were created for the purpose of fictionalization.
on august,the tyne and murphy children,along with tigue and kosko,filed suit against warner in the united states district court for the middle district of florida seeking recompense under florida commercial misappropriation law section,florida statutes and for common law false light invasion of privacy.

appellees thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that there were no genuine issues of material fact to be resolved by a jury.the district court granted the motion of appellees on all claims.tyne time warner entertainment,d.
with respect to the appellants claim of commercial misappropriation under section,florida statutes,the district court held that section applies only to actions in which a person name or likeness is used for commercial trade or advertising purposes.m erely using an individual name or likeness in a publication is not actionable under.a motion picture is not,therefore,in and of itself,a commercial purpose.d at.the court based this decision on the fourth district court of appeal decision in loft fuller,so d dca.the federal district court further concluded that the promotion and advertising of the picture did not constitute a commercial purpose.in so holding,the court quoted section of the restatement third of unfair competition,which excludes the use of a person identity in entertainment,works of fiction or nonfiction,or in advertising that is incidental to such uses.because the appellants failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the use of the decedents or plaintiffs likenesses were used for the purposes of trade or a commercial purpose,the court granted summary judgment on this claim.tyne,d at.
the appellants appealed the district court decision to the eleventh circuit court of appeals,arguing that the district court erred in finding that section did not apply to the facts of this case.the eleventh circuit recognized that this issue is similar to that presented in loft,as held by the district court,but concluded that it was uncertain as to the scope of section and the applicability of loft to these circumstances.the court thus certified the following question to this court 
to what extent does section of the florida statutes apply to the facts of this case 
tyne,at.this court granted review to address the certified question.as the eleventh circuit stated we could,we rephrase the certified question to the specific issue that we conclude is presented by this case.
does the phrase for purposes of trade or for any commercial or advertising purpose in section,florida statutes,include publications which do not directly promote a product or service 
the question before this court is a narrow one.as noted by the federal courts,the fourth district court of appeal considered the applicability of section,florida statutes,to a publication which did not directly promote a product or service,but this court has not directly addressed this question.
in loft,dorothy loft and her two children brought an action for,among other things,violation of section for the alleged unauthorized publication of the name and likeness of the lofts deceased husband and father,robert loft.robert loft had been the captain of an eastern airlines flight that crashed while en route from new york to miami in.the crash was followed by reports of the appearance of apparitions of the flight crew members,including robert loft,on subsequent flights.subsequent to the press stories,the ghost of flight was published in.the book was a nonfictionalized account by the author of his investigation of the reports.a movie was also made based on this book.loft,so d at.
the fourth district held as follows 
in our view,section,by prohibiting the use of one name or likeness for trade,commercial or advertising purposes,is designed to prevent the unauthorized use of a name to directly promote the product or service of the publisher.thus,the publication is harmful not simply because it is included in a publication that is sold for a profit,but rather because of the way it associates the individual name or his personality with something else.such is not the case here.
while we agree that at least one of the purposes of the author and publisher in releasing the publication in question was to make money through sales of copies of the book and that such a publication is commercial in that sense,this in no way distinguishes this book from almost all other books,magazines or newspapers and simply does not amount to the kind of commercial exploitation prohibited by the statute.we simply do not believe that the term commercial,as employed by section,was meant to be construed to bar the use of people names in such a sweeping fashion.we also believe that acceptance of appellants view of the statute would result in substantial confrontation between this statute and the first amendment to the united states constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press and of speech.having concluded that the publication as alleged is not barred by section,we need not decide if,under the allegations of the complaint,the book was of current and legitimate public interest,thus removing it entirely from the scope of the statute.
loft,so d at emphasis added citations omitted.
we approve the fourth district logical construction of section in loft.this construction has been applied to cases construing the statute for more than thirty years,and the statute has remained unchanged by the legislature for this period.
