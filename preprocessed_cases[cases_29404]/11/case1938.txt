procedural background 
plaintiff and appellant national council against health fraud,ncahf brought a representative action against defendants and respondents king bio pharmaceuticals,and its president frank king,collectively king bio for unfair competition bus,and false advertising bus.ncahf alleged that king bio advertising claims for of its homeopathic remedies were false and misleading,in that the products were not effective as claimed.the case proceeded to court trial.at the conclusion of ncahf,king bio moved for judgment under code of civil procedure section.the trial court granted the motion on the ground ncahf had failed to prove the advertising claims were false or misleading.judgment was entered in favor of king bio.ncahf appealed.we gave the consumer justice center,cjc permission to file a brief as amicus curiae in support of ncahf.
king bio sells homeopathic remedies.according to its product labels and website,king bio products relieve a variety of symptoms and ills,including stress,colds,flu,eating disorders,learning disorders,menstrual irregularities,snoring,and tobacco and alcohol cravings.
homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine.homeopathic remedies are manufactured using extremely small quantities of various ingredients.recognized homeopathic remedies are listed in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia,which is updated by the homeopathic pharmacopoeia convention,a group of homeopathic practitioners.the convention will not accept a new remedy for inclusion in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia without evidence of its safety and efficacy the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act the act recognizes as official the remedies and standards in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia.the federal food and drug administration fda has issued guidelines under which homeopathic remedies may be marketed.the fda guidelines permit a homeopathic remedy meeting the standards for strength,quality,and purity set forth in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia to be marketed.with the exception of certain labeling and registration requirements not at issue,the fda does not require homeopathic remedies to satisfy other requirements of the act.all of the homeopathic remedies marketed by king bio are listed in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia and comply with fda guidelines.
discussion 
at trial,ncahf proceeded on the theory that there is no scientific basis for the advertised efficacy of king bio products.ncahf performed no tests to determine the efficacy of king bio products and presented no anecdotal evidence.ncahf instead argued that king bio products were drugs,and the scientific community required representations regarding the efficacy of drugs to be supported by acceptable scientific evidence.ncahf asserted that the burden of proof should be shifted to king bio to prove its products efficacy.on appeal,ncahf acknowledges that,under current california law,a false advertising plaintiff bears the burden of proving the defendant advertising claim is false or misleading.ncahf contends,however,that we should shift the burden of proof to the defendant to facilitate the campaign against health fraud.ncahf argues that federal law shifts the burden to the defendant in false advertising actions.
we conclude there is no basis in california law to shift the burden of proof to a defendant in a representative false advertising and unlawful competition action.we conclude further that the legislature has indicated an intent to place the burden of proof on the plaintiff in such cases.finally,we conclude federal authority is not apposite.

business and professions code section 
business and professions code section establishes an administrative procedure whereby prosecuting authorities may require an advertiser to substantiate advertising claims.this procedure is limited to prosecuting authorities and may not be utilized by private persons.business and professions code section,subdivision a prohibits advertisers from making any false or misleading advertising claim,including claims that purport to be based on factual,objective,or clinical evidence,that compare the product effectiveness or safety to that of other brands or products,or that purport to be based on any fact.
business and professions code section,subdivision b provides in pertinent part upon written request of the director of consumer affairs,the attorney general,any city attorney,or any district attorney,any person doing business in california and in whose behalf advertising claims are made to consumers in california,including claims that purport to be based on factual,objective,or clinical evidence,that compare the product effectiveness or safety to that of other brands or products,or that purport to be based on any fact,shall provide to the department or official making the request evidence of the facts on which such advertising claims are based.if the advertiser does not respond by adequately substantiating the claim within a reasonable time,or if the prosecuting authority shall have reason to believe that any such advertising claim is false or misleading,the prosecuting authority may do either or both of the following seek an immediate termination or modification of the claim by the person in accordance with business and professions code s ection,disseminate information,taking due care to protect legitimate trade secrets,concerning the veracity of such claims,or why such claims are misleading,to the consumers of this state.bus,subd.c.

in sum,both private persons and prosecuting authorities may sue to enjoin false advertising and obtain restitution.when they bring such actions,both private persons and prosecuting authorities bear the burden of proving the advertising claims to be false or misleading.prosecuting authorities,but not private plaintiffs,have the administrative power to request advertisers to substantiate advertising claims before bringing actions for false advertisement,but the prosecuting authorities retain the burden of proof in the false advertising actions.
ii.shifting burden of proof or production 
although ncahf phrases its argument in terms of the burden of proof,we deem ncahf to be making arguments both as to the burden of producing evidence and the ultimate burden of proof a false advertising defendant should have the burden of producing evidence substantiating the challenged advertising claim and a false advertising defendant should have the burden of proving the challenged advertising claim to be true.we address the two arguments in turn.
burden of producing evidence 
burden of producing evidence means the obligation of a party to introduce evidence sufficient to avoid a ruling against him on the issue.the burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party against whom a finding on that fact would be required in the absence of further evidence.the burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is initially on the party with the burden of proof as to that fact.as a general rule,a plaintiff has the burden of producing evidence to support the allegations of the complaint.witkin,cal.evidence ed.burden of proof and presumptions.more specifically,a plaintiff in a false advertising or unlawful competition action has the burden of producing evidence that the challenged advertising claim is false or misleading.south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance supra,th at,d.thus,in this case,under current california law,ncahf has the burden of producing evidence that the challenged advertising claims of king bio are false or misleading.
ncahf argues that a private plaintiff is in the same position as the attorney general and other prosecuting authorities and a failure to shift the burden of producing evidence of truth to the defendants in false advertising actions under business and professions code sections et and et would cripple the attorney general and other prosecuting authorities in their efforts to protect consumers from false or misleading advertising.this argument is not persuasive.the legislature,by enacting business and professions code section,recognized the need for the attorney general and other prosecuting authorities to be able to require advertisers to substantiate advertising claims.with business and professions code section,the legislature established an administrative procedure by which prosecuting authorities may demand such substantiation.the statute is expressly applicable only to prosecuting authorities.private plaintiffs are not authorized to demand substantiation for advertising claims.
nevertheless,ncahf claims private plaintiffs should be authorized to seek substantiation of advertising claims from advertising defendants by bringing false advertising actions pursuant to business and professions code sections et and et and shifting the burden of production to the defendants.ncahf asserts that a private plaintiff may simply allege that an advertising claim is false or misleading and thereby require the defendant to produce evidence that the claim is true.thus,ncahf seeks to obtain by its private plaintiff false advertising action a right which has affirmatively been withheld from private plaintiffs by the legislature.we decline to thwart the intent of the legislature by this means.
the legislature has expressly permitted prosecuting authorities,but not private plaintiffs,to require substantiation of advertising claims.such a distinction is certainly rational.business and professions code section permits only a limited number of prosecuting authorities to demand substantiation of advertising claims,not an unlimited number of private persons.this limitation prevents undue harassment of advertisers and is the least burdensome method of obtaining substantiation for advertising claims.moreover,a prosecuting authority is authorized to disseminate information to consumers concerning unsubstantiated advertising claims.bus,subd.c.however,the prosecuting authority is directed to tak e due care to protect legitimate trade secrets.ibid.no such restriction would be applicable to private plaintiffs prosecuting false advertising actions were we to shift the burden of production to defendants.
we reject ncahf request to change current california law to shift the burden of production of evidence to defendants in false advertising actions.under current california law,the plaintiff in a false advertising action has the burden of producing evidence to prove the allegations of the complaint that the challenged advertising is false or misleading.the legislature has indicated an intent to alter the burden of substantiating advertising claims only with respect to prosecuting authorities.ncahf has presented no persuasive argument that would justify a change in the existing burden of production as to private plaintiffs,in light of this clear legislative intent.
burden of proof 
burden of proof means the obligation of a party to establish by evidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or the court.except as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief that he is asserting.the party claiming that a person is guilty of wrongdoing has the burden of proof on that issue.the plaintiff in a false advertising action has the burden of proving that the challenged advertising claim is false or misleading.south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance,supra,th at,d.
on rare occasions,the courts have altered the normal allocation of the burden of proof.mcgee cessna aircraft d.the shift in the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant rests on a policy judgment that there is a substantial probability the defendant has engaged in wrongdoing and the defendant wrongdoing makes it practically impossible for the plaintiff to prove the wrongdoing.see galanek wismar th,d.thus,the normal allocation of the burden of proof has been shifted in spoliation of evidence cases ibid negligence per se actions mcgee cessna aircraft,supra,d at,and product liability cases based on design defect barker lull engineering cal d,even in these cases,however,the plaintiff has the burden of producing some evidence before the burden of proof is shifted to the defendant.in spoliation of evidence cases,for example,the plaintiff must produce evidence that the defendant failed to preserve the evidence and establish a substantial probability of causation before the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove the failure to preserve the evidence did not cause damage to the plaintiff.galanek wismar,supra,th at,d.as another example,in negligence per se actions,the plaintiff must produce evidence of a violation of a statute and a substantial probability that the plaintiff injury was caused by the violation of the statute before the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove the violation of the statute did not cause the plaintiff injury.haft lone palm hotel cal d.similarly,in design defect cases,the plaintiff must produce evidence that his or her injury was caused by the design of the product,before the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove the design of the product was not defective.barker lull engineering,supra,cal d at.we are aware of no cases in which the burden of proof shifts to the defendant upon the filing of the complaint.see jones ortho pharmaceutical d.there is a limit to the number of presumptions in which the court will indulge solely for the purpose of assisting plaintiff in proving a case,especially when there is no evidentiary starting point from which those presumptions can flow.
in this case,ncahf alleged that k
