this matter is before us on the petitioner national labor relations board nlrb application for enforcement of its order against respondent velocity express,corporate express delivery systems velocity.velocity contests the calculation of backpay for wrongfully terminated employees.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to e,and enforce the order.
background 
velocity is a company that provides delivery and related services.edwin and hildegard kirk were both velocity drivers.they owned the vehicles they used for their delivery routes.they were paid flat salaries.from those salaries,velocity deducted amounts for vehicle insurance and pager service.the kirks were responsible for payment of any vehicle operating expenses they might incur.velocity discharged the kirks in and each obtained interim employment.edwin kirk was and subsequently obtained a job that paid an hourly wage.hildegard kirk was employed during the interim period and received an hourly wage.the nlrb determined that velocity wrongfully discharged the kirks in retaliation for their union activities and ordered their reinstatement.corporate express delivery systems,nlrb.the nlrb also ordered velocity to make the kirks whole for any loss of earnings.id.
in,the circuit enforced the nlrb order and denied velocity petition for review.corporate express delivery nlrb.in doing so,the court held that the kirks were employees,rather than independent contractors.a supplemental compliance proceeding was initiated to determine the amount of backpay that velocity owed the kirks.the nlrb regional director issued a compliance specification.in it,the regional director calculated each kirk gross backpay,with deductions for vehicle insurance and pager services,estimated vehicle operating expenses,severance pay,and interim earnings.the specification calculated edwin kirk interim earnings by subtracting his business expenses from gross receipts.it based hildegard gross backpay on her average base pay for.
all parties objected to the specification.specifically,the union,the charging party before the nlrb,argued that the specification should not have reduced gross backpay by the operating expenses the kirks presumably would have incurred,had they continued to be employed at velocity.velocity contested the backpay formula determination of operating expenses,the calculation of edwin interim earnings,and the use of average pay rate to determine hildegard backpay.a hearing was held on july,before an administrative law judge alj.the alj issued a supplemental decision and recommended order,dated september.the alj determined that the kirks gross backpay should be calculated without deduction for vehicle operating expenses but found that the compliance specification was otherwise appropriate.velocity filed exceptions to the alj recommended order,which the nlrb considered and overruled.in a split decision,the nlrb adopted the alj recommended order on august.it directed velocity to pay edwin and hildegard plus interest,less appropriate tax withholdings.
velocity contends that enforcement of the nlrb order should be denied because the nlrb backpay formula was arbitrary and unreasonable and does not approximate what the kirks would have earned absent discharge,the most accurate backpay calculation is based upon the kirks tax returns,the alj rulings at the hearing regarding the appropriate backpay formula and subsequent reversal of those rulings denied velocity the opportunity to present evidence,and the rate of pay the alj used to calculate hildegard gross backpay is without support in the evidence.
discussion 
our standard of review over a nlrb order is we will grant enforcement of an nlrb order when the agency has correctly applied the law and its findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.nlrb interstate builders,cir quoting miera nlrb,cir see also e universal camera nlrb.our scope of review is a limited one and an nlrb decision will not be overturned just because an appellate panel may have decided the matter differently.interstate builders,at ready mixed concrete nlrb,cir review is quite narrow.we do not the evidence or second guess the nlrb factual inferences.interior alterations,nlrb,cir see also universal camera,at.rather,we review only to ensure the nlrb acted within reasonable bounds and substantial evidence supports the order.interstate builders,at quoting ready mixed concrete,at.substantial evidence is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.at see also dickinson zurko,d allentown mack sales and,nlrb,d.
we must give special respect to the nlrb choice when we review a remedy imposed for violation of the national labor relations act nlra.monfort nlrb,cir citing nlrb gissel packing,d.the nlrb power to order backpay is a broad,discretionary one,subject to limited judicial review.fibreboard nlrb,d monfort,at angle nlrb,cir.it is a power for the nlrb,not this court,to wield.angle,at citing nlrb bottling.this deference,however,ends when the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the nlra.monfort,at quoting virginia power nlrb.
it is against this deferential backdrop that we turn to velocity arguments against enforcement.we hold that the nlrb decision not to deduct presumed operating expenses from gross backpay was reasonable.a backpay award is only an approximation and the nlrb has considerable discretion in selecting a method reasonably designed to approximate the amount of pay a wrongfully discharged employee is entitled to.angle,at.our sister circuits have appropriately described this wide discretion,overturning a backpay order only when the award is arbitrary or unreasonable.see nlrb international ass of bridge,structural reinforced iron,local,cir woodline motor freight,nlrb,cir.
the nlrb applied its standard formula in calculating the kirks took the amount of gross pay each would have earned absent wrongful discharge,then subtracted interim earnings and regular withholdings.as noted above,edwin was paid a flat salary and vehicle operating expenses were not regularly withheld.nevertheless,velocity argues that the nlrb also should have deducted vehicle operating expenses the kirks would have incurred,had they been employed by velocity.rejecting this argument,the nlrb relied on settled law that it does not deduct from the gross backpay those expenses that employees would have incurred had they not been unlawfully discharged.supplemental d o at citing laborers local,nlrb,enf.in relevant part,cir declining to deduct expenses for transportation,lodging and meals that the discriminatees would have incurred had they been employed during the backpay period myerstown hosiery mills,nlrb.
like the dissent in the supplemental decision and order,velocity argues that the vehicle operating expenses in this case are direct expenses associated with the work performed driving the trucks and should be treated like the insurance and pager service deductions.see supplemental d o at battista,chairman,dissenting.it distinguishes prior cases not allowing a deduction as involving an employee personal and domestic expenses room,board,transportation,or child care,not expenses.the nlrb rejected this distinction as unsupported by its precedent,and found the application of such a principle,at least as to a reduction in gross backpay based upon interim expenses being less than estimated actual expenses,as unsupported by the evidence.supplemental d o at.the dissent would have compared the expenses in relation to gross pay reported on edwin tax return and reduced gross backpay for all years by that percentage.id.at battista,dissenting.the majority noted that it need not decide whether such reduction could be based upon estimated expenses or whether tax returns often containing a standard mileage rate are conclusive as velocity contends.id.at,resp.br.the majority correctly noted that velocity had the burden of proof on mitigation of its backpay obligation.supplemental d o at see hansen.enterprises,nlrb,respondent has burden of proving all facts to mitigate his backpay liab
