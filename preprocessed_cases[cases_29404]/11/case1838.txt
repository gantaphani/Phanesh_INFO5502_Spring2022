this case presents the question of whether fraudulent conduct by an insurer,which is connected with conduct that would violate insurance code section et referred to as the unfair insurance practices act can also give rise to a private civil cause of action under the unfair competition law ucl,business and professions code section et.the trial court ruled that it does not and,therefore,sustained defendant and real party in interest california capital insurance company demurrer to a cause of action under the ucl.we disagree and will direct the trial court to reinstate the cause of action.
statement of facts 
the content of the allegations are not in dispute and may be quickly summarized.plaintiff yanting zhang has sued her insurer,california capital insurance company,over a dispute following a fire at zhang commercial premises.in the complaint factual background and first two causes of on the legal theories of breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good sets out a litany of misconduct relating generally to california capital handling of her loss claim and its refusal to authorize adequate payment under the policy for the repair and restoration of the premises.in the third cause of action,that based on the ucl,zhang incorporates all of the previous paragraphs,but she also alleges that defendant engaged in unfair,deceptive,untrue,misleading advertising defendant promises its insureds that it will timely pay proper coverage in the event the insured suffers a covered loss however defendant in fact has no intention of properly paying the true value of its insureds covered claims.defendant had and has no intention of honoring such advertised promises.
defendant demurred to this cause of action on the basis that the conduct alleged in the third cause of action was prohibited by insurance code section,and plaintiff could not state a private cause of action due to the decision in fireman fund ins.companies cal d.in accepting this position,the trial court also relied on textron financial national union fire ins.th,d textron financial.we are compelled to disagree in part with the decision in textron financial and to hold that does not bar the claim under the ucl.
discussion 
first,in reviewing a ruling on demurrer,we are not concerned with the plaintiff ability to prove the allegations,but only with the allegations adequacy to state a cause of action.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.we are also required to give a generous interpretation of the pleading in favor of stating a cause of action.sanchez city of modesto th,d.this means that if any of the allegations would support a cause of action under the ucl,it is immaterial,for our purposes,that some of them might not.for this reason,we find it unnecessary to determine whether plaintiff allegations,found in other causes of action but incorporated into the ucl cause of action,relating to claim handling procedures would alone permit suit under the ucl.this is because we consider it clear that her claims of false advertising do support the cause of action 
in,the supreme court reversed its decision in royal globe ins.superior court cal d,and held that the prohibitory provisions of insurance code section did not create a private right of action under the statute against insurers who commit the unfair practices enumerated in that provision,supra,cal d at.while was a third party is,the plaintiff had been injured by the insurance defendant principle was later extended to first party suits,those brought by the insured against the insurer.zephyr park superior court d.neither case expressly references the ucl,but both stand for what is now the accepted principle that a violation of section does not result in a private cause of action for unfair practices.to that extent we agree that plaintiff would be unable to state a cause of action for tort damages based directly and solely on real party in interest alleged violations of the statute.
the issue before us,however,is not so simple.
the ucl,which on its face applies to all businesses and certainly does not expressly except or exempt insurers,does authorize any injured person to sue for the violation of its requirements is,for unfair competition.bus.unfair competition is defined in business and professions code section to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue,or misleading advertising undoubtedly an insurer is subject to suit under the ucl,and numerous cases so reflect.see,quelimane stewart title guaranty,supra,cal th,d,ticconi blue shield of california life health ins.th,d.
in the case at hand,the trial court followed textron financial in ruling that the principles of barred plaintiff attempt to state a cause of action against california capital under the ucl.textron financial is indeed quite similar to this case there,the plaintiff was a secured party with respect to the subject vehicle and alleged that when the owner cancelled coverage,the insurer failed to notify the plaintiff.the complaint alleged that the insurer used misleading documents to falsely suggest that it would provide insurance where it had no intention to do so falsely suggested that it would provid e timely notice of policy cancellations,misrepresented the terms and meaning of its policies,and engaged in a pattern and practice of wrongful and false cancellations of insurance policies textron financial,supra,th at,d.
in upholding the trial court ruling sustaining the defendant insurer demurrer to the ucl cause of action,the court of appeal commented that the specific allegations of wrongful conduct contained in plaintiff fourth cause of action,using misleading documents and misrepresenting both the terms of the insurance policies and its obligations under them for its own benefit,are the type of activities covered by the unfair insurance practices act,subds.a h.textron financial,supra,th at,d.the court relied on safeco ins.superior court d.safeco,rejecting a third party ucl claim based on the insurer having,during negotiations,taken the position that its insured was not legally liable for a certain item of claimed damages.this claim was concededly covered by insurance code section,subdivision h description of prohibited unfair claims settlement practices.the safeco court had no difficulty finding that controlled and that the alleged misconduct would not support a ucl claim.safeco,at.
safeco was a case in which the alleged misconduct of the insurer was very arguably only proscribed by the unfair insurance practices act,and we agree that the result in that case was required by.our differences with the textron financial the trial court from the fact that plaintiff in this case alleges conduct that is not merely improper under the unfair insurance practices act.
the supreme court in did not state that insurers who violate the unfair insurance practices act can never be liable in tort to the injured party,whether first party or third party.indeed,after explaining that enforcement of violations of insurance code section was vested solely in the insurance commissioner,it noted that the courts retain jurisdiction to impose civil damages or other remedies against insurers in appropriate common law actions,based on such traditional theories as fraud,infliction of emotional distress,and as to the insured either breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,supra,cal d at.
consistent with this expression of understanding,in manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,d,manufacturers life at page,d,the court expressly eschewed the idea that the unfair insurance practices act was intended to displace existing rights and remedies for unlawful business practices in the insurance industry,among them the cartwright act bus,and the ucl.the petitioning insurers in that case were attempting to persuade the court that they were in essence untouchable with respect to civil claims based on anticompetitive conduct,but the court rebuffed the argument by stating,nor has this court,or any other,accepted defendants argument that the unfair insurance practices act exempts insurance companies from other state anti
