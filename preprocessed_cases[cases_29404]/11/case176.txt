tighter environmental regulations at times force businesses to try new methods and technologies to meet more stringent requirements.in this case,one of those technologies tubes made by industrial ceramics.the tubes were used by wellons,in high temperature heat exchanges,part of a new system to dry wood chips.in the ensuing litigation,wellons was awarded some but not all of what it sought,in turn,objects to the amount of wellons prejudgment interest award.consequently,we examine massachusetts commercial law,particularly as to awards of prejudgment interest.we affirm the denial of wellons claim for relief under.laws ch.and reverse and remand on the prejudgment interest award.
on november,filed for declaratory relief that it was not liable under warranties it provided in the contract selling the tubes to wellons.claimed that the breakage was not caused by a defect in the tubes and that,in any event,wellons had failed to make a demand for repair or replacement as required by the warranty.wellons filed a counterclaim for breach of warranty and revocation of acceptance,seeking as damages over million,the full purchase price of the ceramic tubes.
at trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of wellons on its warranty claim,finding that the limited repair and replacement remedy agreed to by the parties in the contract failed to fulfill its essential purpose.the jury awarded wellons in damages,not the full purchase price.the jury also ruled against wellons on its revocation of acceptance claim.the district court denied wellons claim that had violated chapter of the massachusetts consumer and business protection act.laws ch.the district court also awarded wellons prejudgment interest from december,the date by which the parties agreed delivery of all the tubes was complete.
appealed the district court prejudgment interest award on the ground that such interest should be awarded from december,the date wellons filed its claim,since the date of breach had not been found by the jury as required by statute.wellons from the denial of its chapter claim.
we describe the facts as found by the district court or as agreed to by the parties.wellons is an company that designs and builds energy and drying systems for the forest products industry.in late,in response to air emissions regulations,wellons developed a new system for drying wood chips,which used high temperature air heaters,known as heat exchangers.wellons contracted with to build the energy and drying systems of two large prototype facilities that would manufacture a kind of building panel called oriented strand board.one facility was located in hope,west virginia,and the other in brookneal,virginia.wellons agreed to supply heat exchangers as part of these systems.
around april,mark chenard,an engineer for wellons,approached kevin coston,a senior applications engineer for,a ceramics manufacturer based in worcester,massachusetts.chenard asked coston about the use of ceramic tubes for the heat exchangers wellons had agreed to design.chenard told coston and other engineers that the ceramic tubes would be exposed to combustion gases with an operating range of temperatures between degrees fahrenheit at the inlet to degrees fahrenheit at the exit of the tube bank.he also said that the system would have an abort device to prevent temperatures from exceeding degrees.
initially recommended its silicon carbide product,crystar.chenard told coston that crystar was too expensive and would put wellons.chenard asked,instead,about a less expensive product.coston,after investigation,told chenard about a silicon carbide product known as advancer that was typically used in roll form in roller hearth kiln applications.he cautioned that advancer had not been previously used for heat exchanger tubes and that advancer was more porous than crystar,making advancer more susceptible to oxidation.but coston also suggested that refiring advancer might result in improved resistance to oxidation.ultimately,the heat exchanger design called for crystar tubes to be installed in the two rows of the heat exchangers where the highest temperatures were expected and for advancer tubes to be installed in the remaining rows.there were additional issues before the parties actually contracted for the purchase and sale of the tubes.
because oxidation was a concern,that topic was discussed in july among,wellons,and representatives.coston had provided chenard with technical literature about oxidation of silicon carbide materials like crystar at temperature ranges between degrees fahrenheit and degrees fahrenheit,but not with any such literature about oxidation of silicon carbide materials like advancer or refired advancer.
wanted to perform additional tests on the tube materials,and at the july meetings it was agreed that sample tubes would be inserted in the ductwork at an existing plant in skippers,virginia.the energy system had been installed by wellons but did not employ the same heat exchanger technology contemplated for the hope and brookneal facilities.was told that the conditions in the ducts at skippers were equivalent to or more severe than what could be expected at the hope and brookneal facilities.the first stage of testing at skippers was concluded in late,and the tubes,after removal,showed no visible signs of deterioration although wellons asserts that they did show alkali metal deposits,sodium and potassium compounds.
and wellons also made their own investigation of the proposed use of advancer in the system,hiring charles semler,a former university professor and past president of the american ceramics society.semler report dated february,indicated satisfaction with the tube material selections for the normal anticipated operating temperatures,but warned that the tubes could fail if exposed to temperatures above the normal expected range degrees fahrenheit air temperatures and degrees fahrenheit exhaust gas temperatures,especially as the temperatures approached degrees fahrenheit,or if exposed to rapid decreases of temperature caused by exposure to ambient air while the tubes were still hot also known as thermal shocking.
on march and,wellons issued purchase orders to for ceramic tubes to be installed in the hope and brookneal facilities.the purchase orders included warranties proposed by and specifically negotiated by the parties.warranted that the ceramic tubes would operate without failure for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the tubes or eighteen months from the date of completed installation,whichever was sooner.the warranty provided that in the event of breach sole obligation was to replace the tubes.however,the warranty also provided that would not be responsible for total or partial failure resulting from occurrences such as improper operation,operating conditions beyond those for which the plant was designed,acts of god.also reserved the right to review operating data employ the services of an expert third party to determine whether proper operating procedures were followed during the warranty period and to be given the opportunity to make any repairs or replacement it deemed reasonable and appropriate to meet the terms of the warranty.
the hope facility began operation in july and the brookneal facility in december.at a meeting on february,representatives informed chenard and james lashbrook,a senior applications engineer for,that increasing incidents of breakage of advancer tubes had occurred broken pieces of the tubes,cracked and with holes,were showing up in the ash hoppers at both sites.in the spring of,the ceramic tubes began to fail in substantial numbers.by june of,recognized that a tide of failures had occurred.
from march until early june,employees visited the facilities,inspected the heat exchangers and failed tubes,interviewed employees about operating conditions and any unusual occurrences,and took tube samples back to worcester for analysis.laboratories reported inconclusive results as to the causes of the failure of the tubes.its marketing manager informed chenard that still did not know what was causing the tubes to fail.
there was conflicting expert testimony as to the causes of failure.wellons expert witness opined that sodium and potassium compounds in the combustion gases oxidized the material.in contrast,expert witness found the cracking patterns in the tubes to be consistent with thermal shocking and the cristobalite levels to be consistent with exposure to temperatures in excess of degrees anticipated top potential temperature of the systems.
on june,chenard informed that all the ceramic tubes in the units at hope and brookneal would be replaced with metal tubes and demanded a refund to wellons of more than million,the full purchase price of the tubes.removal of the tubes began later that year.
appeals the district court decision to award wellons prejudgment interest from december,the date by which delivery of all the tubes was complete.wellons the dismissal of its claim of unfair or deceptive business practices under.laws ch.
prejudgment interest under.laws ch,
the district court awarded wellons prejudgment interest from the date of delivery of the tubes december,which the district court equated with the date of breach of warranty,rather than from the date wellons filed its claims in this action december.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.see,industrial sequoia pac,cir.
the district court applied the massachusetts prejudgment interest statute.laws ch,which provides that 
in all actions based on contractual obligations,upon a verdict,finding or order for judgment for pecuniary damages,interest shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages,at the contract rate,if established,or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum,from the date of the breach or demand.if the date of the breach or demand is not established,interest shall be added by the clerk of the court,at such contractual rate,or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the commencement of the action 
laws ch.the statute requires that where the date of the breach or demand is not established prejudgment interest must be awarded from the date the claim was filed.here,wellons never sought a jury determination on the date of breach.the district court concluded,however,that the date of breach can be established from the undisputed facts.indus.ceramics wellons,d.specifically,the court found that tender of delivery was made no later than december,the date of commencement of operations at the brookneal facility and that prejudgment interest should accrue from that date.id.it thus concluded that as a matter of law the date of breach of contractual warranties under section is the date of tender of delivery.
argues that the district court erred because the massachusetts supreme judicial court decision in deerskin trading post,spencer press,establishes a rule that,in the absence of a specific finding by the trier of fact,prejudgment interest must be assessed from the date of filing,even where the evidence is arguably sufficient to establish breach or demand at an earlier date.see id.at.
in deerskin,the sjc affirmed an award of prejudgment interest to spencer press on its counterclaim from the date that the counterclaim was filed since the date of breach or demand had not been established at trial.id.the sjc held that establishing the date of breach or demand is a determination for the trier of fact,and,where trial has proceeded before a jury,neither the judge nor an appellate court can make such a determination.id.the sjc concluded that there had been no finding as to the date of breach or demand,nor had spencer press objected to the judge failure to instruct the jury to so find.see also karen constr.lizotte,the date of an alleged breach is a question of fact for the trier of fact neither this court nor the trial judge is permitted to determine when the breach occurred.internal citations omitted.
wellons argues that here,in contrast to deerskin where the date of demand seemed to be in dispute,see at,the date of breach or demand was essentially admitted by the parties in the pleadings.wellons argues that because the parties agreed as to the date of delivery complete by december,and the date of delivery is tantamount to the date of breach of warranty for the tubes,the date of breach is therefore established within the meaning of section,notwithstanding the absence of a specific jury finding on point.wellons maintains that deerskin requires a separate finding by the trier of fact only where the date of breach or demand is actually in dispute or otherwise ambiguous.karen constr,at case referring to alleged date of breach in dispute involving owner refusal to pay builder balance on several installments of contract concluding that date of breach had not been established at trial and awarding prejudgment interest from date complaint was filed graves packer,case where there was no admission as to the date of breach of oral contract to repair and maintain underground storage tank upholding award of prejudgment interest from date of commencement of the action.
in deerskin,the sjc established a rule mandating an award of prejudgment interest under the statute from the date of commencement of the action where the demand of breach or demand is not established.at emphasis added see also siegel kepa homes,wl,at.june,parties agree that prejudgment interest must be assessed from date of demand,not from date of apparent contract breach,absent any specific finding by the jury.while we agree that a date of breach can be established by agreement of the parties point one of wellons syllogism,there was no such agreement here more importantly,it is far less certain that the legal proposition point two of wellons syllogism is correct.we are being asked here essentially to carve out a general exception to deerskin for breach of warranty claims.
while massachusetts may one day choose to adopt the rule that the date of breach of warranty is the date of delivery of the goods for purposes of awarding prejudgment interest under section,it has yet to do so.and we,as a federal court,will not depart from deerskin to craft such a new rule a decision that involves competing policy considerations better left to the state.we outline some of those competing considerations.
section of the provides in relevant part that a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.laws ch,adopting.assuming arguendo that the section applies,this provision describes when a breach of warranty claim accrues for statute of limitations purposes.see wilson hammer holdings,cir bay provincetown steamship,caterpillar tractor,there may be very sound reasons for not using a statute of limitations trigger provision for breach of warranty claims in order to establish the date of breach as a matter of law for purposes of calculating prejudgment interest under section.indeed,in deerskin,prejudgment interest was assessed from the later date of the filing of the counterclaim even though that claim had presumably accrued for statute of limitations purposes upon the earlier date of delivery of the defective sales catalogs and accompanying order forms.
furthermore,making the date of delivery the date of breach for prejudgment interest purposes would,at least in some instances,contravene section intent to avoid windfalls to plaintiffs to the extent they have not actually incurred a loss.in sterilite continental cas,a case,the sjc stated that it would not adopt the literal meaning of section without regard for its purpose and history.id.at.although section did away with the common law rule of calculating prejudgment interest based on whether the damages were liquidated or unliquidated,the statute retained the rule basic purpose,which was to compensate a damaged party for the loss of use or unlawful detention of money.id.at quoting perkins school for the blind rate setting comm n.the sjc concluded that prejudgment interest under section was due from the date sterilite was actually deprived of use of its money by paying the legal expenses,and that any
