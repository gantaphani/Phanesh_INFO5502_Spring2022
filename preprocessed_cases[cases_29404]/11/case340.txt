background 
bigelow,a connecticut corporation,is a manufacturer and distributor of specialty teas.celestial is a competitor of bigelow in the herbal tea market.liberty mutual,a massachusetts company,provided liability insurance to bigelow.the policy contained an advertising injury provision,discussed below,which is at issue in this litigation.
celestial suit in colorado.in june,celestial filed in the united states district court for the district of colorado a complaint against bigelow for trade dress infringement,false advertising,unfair competition,and trade dress dilution,arising under section a of the lanham act,a,and under state statutes and common law.in february,celestial filed an amended complaint,adding a damage claim to its false advertising claim and adding a new claim for dilution of a famous mark under section c of the lanham act,c.the first claim,for trade dress infringement,alleged that in january,bigelow introduced its herbal teas in new packaging with trade dress confusingly similar to that of celestial boxes.the second claim,for false advertising,alleged that bigelow failed to correctly indicate on the packaging that the teas were artificially flavored,and that bigelow engaged in false advertising by mounting an aggressive marketing and print advertising campaign to promote these teas,while conveying the false and misleading impression that those herbal teas were all natural.the third claim,for unfair competition,incorporated the factual allegations from the first two claims and alleged that bigelow had misappropriated celestial product image,trust,loyalty,and goodwill.the fourth and fifth claims,for trade dress dilution and common law trade dress dilution,incorporated the factual allegations from the trade dress infringement claim and alleged that bigelow had intentionally whittled down,blurred or tarnished plaintiff trade dress so as to dilute the trade dress in commerce.
in january,the district court in colorado entered judgment in favor of bigelow on all counts in celestial action.
request for liberty mutual to defend and indemnify.while the colorado suit was pending,bigelow notified liberty mutual of the suit,sent the insurer a copy of the complaint,and requested the insurer to defend and indemnify bigelow in the action.in february,bigelow sent liberty mutual a copy of celestial amended complaint.in march,liberty mutual denied bigelow claim for coverage.
bigelow suit in connecticut.in august,bigelow brought the instant suit against liberty mutual in the connecticut district court,seeking damages for defense of the colorado suit and indemnity against potential liability.on for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of liberty mutual in january.bigelow,liberty mutual insurance,civ,amended ruling.
bigelow maintains that liberty mutual was obligated to defend it against celestial suit in colorado and,having failed to do so,must now pay the costs of defense that bigelow incurred.bigelow contends that celestial suit alleged a claim within the scope of the advertising injury provision of liberty mutual policy and that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that trade dress infringement could never take place in the context of advertising.liberty mutual contends that none of celestial claims alleges an advertising injury as defined in the policy,and that therefore it did not have a duty to defend.
discussion 
the advertising injury provisions.the personal and advertising injury liability endorsement in the liberty mutual insurance policy provides 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury or advertising injury to which this coverage part applies.we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.
b.this insurance applies to advertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods,products or services.
the definitions section provides 
advertising injury means injury arising out of paid announcements in the print or broadcast media resulting in one or more of the following offenses 
oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services 
oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy 
copying a person or organization advertising ideas or advertising style or

the failure of goods,products or services to conform with advertised quality or performance 
the incorrect description or mistake in the advertised price of goods,products or services

an offense committed by an insured whose business is advertising,publishing or telecasting.
bigelow contends that the trade dress infringement and related claims in celestial complaint fell within the third type of advertising injury covered by the policy,injury from c opying a person or organization advertising ideas or advertising style.liberty mutual contends,and the district court found,that none of the five claims in celestial complaint alleged an advertising injury and therefore liberty mutual was under no duty to defend.
the duty to defend.under connecticut law,which applies in this diversity action,an insurer duty to defend,being much broader in scope and application than its duty to indemnify,t he obligation of the insurer to defend does not depend on whether the injured party will successfully maintain a cause of action against the insured but on whether he has,in his complaint,stated facts which bring the injury within the coverage.springdale donuts,aetna casualty and surety,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the duty to defend does not hinge on the skill or manner in which a complaint is drafted,but rests on the substantive thrust of the complaint,and the surrounding facts.see qsp,aetna casualty and surety,schwartz stevenson,noting that the duty to defend depends on whether the complaint stated facts which appeared to bring the plaintiff claimed injury within the policy coverage emphasis in original.i f an allegation of a complaint falls even possibly within the coverage,then the insurance company must defend the insured.imperial casualty and indemnity state,emphasis in original.
in determining the scope of coverage under a policy,connecticut applies the following rules of interpretation 
the interpretation of an insurance policy involves a determination of the intent of the parties as expressed by the language of the policy including what coverage the insured expected to receive and what the insurer was to provide,as disclosed by the provisions of the policy a contract of insurance must be viewed in its entirety,and the intent of the parties for entering it derived from the four corners of the policy the policy words must be accorded their natural and ordinary meaning and any ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured because the insurance company drafted the policy.
