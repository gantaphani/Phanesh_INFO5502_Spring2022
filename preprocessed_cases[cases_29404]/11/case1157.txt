we must decide whether a restaurant violates the fair labor standards act,when,despite paying a cash wage greater than the minimum wage,it requires its wait staff to participate in a tip pool that redistributes some of their tips to the kitchen staff.
misty cumbie worked as a waitress at the vita caf Ã© in portland,oregon,which is owned and operated by woody woo,woody woo ii,and aaron woo collectively,woo.woo paid its a cash wage at or exceeding oregon minimum wage,which at the time was more than the federal minimum wage in addition to this cash wage,the servers received a portion of their daily tips.woo required its servers to contribute their tips to a tip pool that was redistributed to all restaurant employees the largest portion of the tip pool between and went to kitchen staff,dishwashers and cooks,who are not customarily tipped in the restaurant industry.the remainder between and was returned to the servers in proportion to their hours worked.
cumbie filed a putative collective and class action against woo,alleging that its arrangement violated the provisions of the fair labor standards act of flsa,et the district court dismissed cumbie complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,and cumbie timely appealed.
on appeal,cumbie argues that because woo tip pool included employees who are not customarily and regularly tipped employees,m,it was invalid under the flsa,and woo was therefore required to pay her the minimum wage plus all of her tips.woo argues that cumbie reading of the flsa is correct only employers who take a tip credit toward their obligation.see id.because woo did not claim a tip credit,it contends that the arrangement was permissible so long as it paid her the minimum wage,which it did.
although we ordinarily begin our analysis with the text of the relevant statute,we pause to elucidate a background principle that guides our inquiry in businesses where tipping is customary,the tips,in the absence of an explicit contrary understanding,belong to the recipient.where,however,such an arrangement is made,in the absence of statutory interference,no reason is perceived for its invalidity.williams jacksonville terminal,internal citations omitted emphasis added 
williams establishes the default rule that an arrangement to turn over or to redistribute tips is presumptively valid.our task,therefore,is to determine whether the flsa imposes any statutory interference that would invalidate woo arrangement.the question presented is one of first impression in this court 
under the flsa,employers must pay their employees a minimum wage.see a.the flsa definition of wage recognizes that under certain circumstances,employers of tipped employees may include part of such employees tips as wage payments.see id.m.the flsa provides in relevant part 
in determining the wage an employer is required to pay a tipped employee,the amount paid such employee by the employee employer shall be an amount equal to 
the cash wage paid such employee which for purposes of such determination shall be not less than the cash wage required to be paid such an employee on august,and 
an additional amount on account of the tips received by such employee which amount is equal to the difference between the wage specified in paragraph and the wage in effect under section a of this title.
the additional amount on account of tips may not exceed the value of the tips actually received by an employee.the preceding sentences shall not apply with respect to any tipped employee unless such employee has been informed by the employer of the provisions of this subsection,and all tips received by such employee have been retained by the employee,except that this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the pooling of tips among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips.
we shall unpack this dense statutory language sentence by sentence.the first sentence states that an employer must pay a tipped employee an amount equal to a cash wage of at least plus an additional amount in tips equal to the federal minimum wage minus such cash wage that is,an employer must pay a tipped employee a cash wage of at least,but if the cash wage is less than the federal minimum wage,the employer can make up the difference with the employee tips also known as a tip credit.the second sentence clarifies that the difference may not be greater than the actual tips received.therefore,if the cash wage plus tips are not enough to meet the minimum wage,the employer must top up the cash wage.collectively,these two sentences provide that an employer may take a partial tip credit toward its obligation.
the third sentence states that the preceding two sentences do not apply,the employer may not take a tip credit unless two conditions are met.first,the employer must inform the employee of the provisions in section m.second,the employer must allow the employee to keep all of her tips,except when the employee participates in a tip pool with other customarily tipped employees.
cumbie argues that under section m,an employee must be allowed to retain all of her in the case of a valid tip pool involving only customarily tipped of whether her employer claims a tip credit.essentially,she argues that section m has overruled williams,rendering agreements presumptively invalid.however,we can not reconcile this interpretation with the plain text of the third sentence,which imposes conditions on taking a tip credit and does not state freestanding requirements pertaining to all tipped employees.a statute that provides that a person must do x in order to achieve y does not mandate that a person must do x,period.
if congress wanted to articulate a general principle that tips are the property of the employee absent a valid tip pool,it could have done so without reference to the tip credit.it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.united states menasche,internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we decline to read the third sentence in such a way as to render its reference to the tip credit,as well as its conditional language and structure,superfluous 
here,there is no question that woo tip pool included tipped employees,and that cumbie did not retain all of her tips because of her participation in the pool.accordingly,woo was not entitled to take a tip credit,nor did it.see richard marriott,cir i f the employer does not follow the command of the statute,he gets no tip credit.since woo did not take a tip credit,we perceive no basis for concluding that woo tippooling arrangement violated section m 
recognizing that section m is of no assistance to her,cumbie disavowed reliance on it in her reply brief and at oral argument,claiming instead that t he rule against forced transfer of tips actually originates in the minimum wage section of the flsa.section provides that e very employer shall pay to each of his employees wages at the prescribed minimum hourly rate.id.a.
while section does not mention tips,let alone tip pools,cumbie maintains that a department of labor dol regulation elucidates the meaning of the term pay in such a way as to prohibit woo arrangement.she refers to the regulation which requires that the minimum wage be paid finally and unconditionally or free and clear,and forbids any kick back to the employer or to another person for the employer benefit the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee.the free and clear regulation provides as an example of a prohibited a requirement that an employee purchase tools for the job,where such purchase cuts into the minimum or overtime wages required to be paid him under the act.id.
according to cumbie,her forced participation in the invalid tip pool constituted an indirect to the kitchen staff for woo benefit,in violation of the regulation.as she sees it,the money she turned over to the tip pool brought her cash wage below the federal minimum in the same way as the tools in the regulation example.the secretary of labor agrees,asserting that if the tipped employees did not receive the full federal minimum wage plus all tips received,they can not be deemed under federal law to have receive
