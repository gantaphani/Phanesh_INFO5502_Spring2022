defendant household retail services,hrsi or household,appeals from a jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs echo acceptance corporation and echosphere corporation collectively,echo on echo breach of contract claim.the district court jurisdiction was based on.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
the plaintiffs in this case are echosphere corporation echosphere,which manufactures and sells home satellite television systems,and echo acceptance corporation eac,an echosphere subsidiary organized to facilitate the financing of such sales while some echosphere customers no doubt make their own financial arrangements,echosphere referred many of its customers to eac.eac would then enter a loan agreement with the customer,pursuant to which eac agreed to finance the system for the customer.eac then sold the loan agreements to an ultimate financier.until,that financier was the central bank of denver,which purchased the agreements from eac for a flat,fee.
on july,eac entered a merchandise financing agreement mfa with the defendant,household,a private label credit card company.pursuant to the mfa,a customer interested in purchasing echosphere equipment on credit submitted an application to echosphere,which was transmitted to eac and then to household for credit approval.upon approval,eac purchased the customer financing contract,then resold and assigned that agreement to household,which thereafter assumed the credit relationship with the customer.upon assignment,the mfa typically relieved eac from liability for the customer default.household then issued a credit card to the approved customer to be used for future purchases of echosphere equipment.the customer contract provided for finance charges on the credit account.household also offered credit insurance to customers,for a separate charge.through the arrangement just described,household provided funding for credit purchases of echosphere equipment.the customers made monthly payments on their account balances toward principal,finance charges,and in some cases,insurance premiums.aplt.br.at.
in its initial pricing letter,hrsi confirmed the execution of the mfa and reiterated that it would purchase from time to time revolving credit contracts at the price agreed upon from time to time and as outlined below 
the consumer annual percentage rate will be with a per contract discount of charged by hrsi.
hrsi will pay eac eight percent of billed finance charges monthly.
hrsi will pay eac a percent of billed finance charges equivalent to thirty percent of billed insurance charges.
hrsi understands that eac does not initiate retail installment sales or revolving credit sales directly to the consumer.however,hrsi will respond to eac as though eac initiates all contracts per the merchandise financing agreement.
see also id.at merchandise financing agreement.collectively,the credit agreements originated by eac and sold to hrsi were referred to as the eac portfolio.id.at tr.at.
echo contends,and the district court agreed,that merchant and insurance participation payments were part of the price hrsi paid for eac accounts.aplee.br.at.accordingly,the court held that payments on each individual account by hrsi to eac were to continue for the life of that particular financing,as long as hrsi continued to receive revenue from the account.on the other hand,hrsi maintains that the payments were designed merely as incentives to encourage sales.aplt.br.at.in hrsi view,its payment obligation ended with its interest in encouraging future,when it stopped purchasing new accounts from eac.id.
procedural history 
as the district court aptly noted the word simple should not be used in any sentence involving this case.t here nothing simple about this.it convoluted and it a beast with a strange heartbeat.tr.at.we will attempt to simplify the procedural history nonetheless,reciting only those motions,orders,and proceedings relevant to our analysis.of the four causes of action alleged in echo first amended complaint only a portion of the first breach of at issue in this appeal.specifically,we are concerned with echo contention that hrsi was contractually obligated to make merchant participation and insurance percentage payments for the life of each individual loan in the eac portfolio,and that hrsi failure to make any such payments after the termination of the mfa constituted a breach.id.at.
in december,echo moved for partial summary judgment on that portion of its breach claim,id.at hereinafter echo breach motion in february,hrsi filed a for summary judgment on the same issue.id.at hereinafter hrsi.simultaneous with its cross motion,hrsi also filed a separate motion for summary judgment,arguing that all four claims were barred by,the statute of frauds for credit agreements.id.at hereinafter hrsi statute of frauds motion three years later,the district court entered an order on the foregoing and other motions,denying hrsi statute of frauds motion,granting echo breach motion,and denying hrsi.id.at.in pertinent part,the court held that was inapplicable to echo claims as a matter of law.id.at.the court also found that the mfa unambiguously provided for payments to continue,and that hrsi failure to make such payments was a breach of contract.id.at.finally,the court noted that the determination of the applicable rates for payments was a question of fact,appropriately decided by a jury id.at.
prior to trial,echo filed a preemptive motion in limine,requesting the exclusion of evidence relating to certain defense theories that the court had already rejected as a matter of law.id.at.the court granted the motion in part,confirming that it would not admit evidence or allow arguments concerning hrsi statute of frauds defense,or hrsi claim that payments were intended as incentives,rather than part of the purchase price.id.at order on mot.in limine id.at,order on mots.for summ.the remainder of echo motion was taken under advisement.id.at order on mot.in limine.
in a conference with counsel at the close of echo case,the court clarified that the only fact issue here is what the percentage that applies.id.at tr.at.in hrsi view,this announcement constituted a restructuring of the trial,which prejudiced its case in a variety of ways.aplt.br.at.accordingly,hrsi moved the court for a curative instruction,advising the jury to disregard evidence relating to the monetary amount of damages,at,tr.at,oral motion to strike specified testimony and exhibits relating to the amount of damages,id.at,tr.at,oral motion see also id.at brief and to declare a mistrial.id.at tr.at see also id.at brief.hrsi also moved that the court enter judgment in its favor as a matter of law,arguing that echo had failed to establish any agreement between the parties as to rates.id.at tr.at oral motion see also id.at brief.subject to the foregoing motions,hrsi rested its case.id.at tr.at.all four motions were denied.id.at denying motions for mistrial and for judgment as a matter of law id.at,tr.at,denying motions to strike and for curative instruction.but id.at inst.you need not be concerned with the actual monetary amount owed by hrsi to eac.
in response to a special interrogatory,the jury found that echo had proven,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the applicable merchant participation rate was and the applicable insurance participation rate was,as agreed upon by the parties and evidenced by a letter from defendant.id.at emphasis added.the court then applied the jury percentage to the stipulated value of the portfolio,granted echo motion for prejudgment interest,and entered judgment for echo in the amount of in past damages,in prejudgment interest,and in future damages.id.at.the court awarded prejudgment interest at the statutory rate of eight percent,but reduced the interest award by in the interest of fairness,due to the court delay in ruling on the parties motions for summary judgment.id.at.both parties filed motions to alter or amend the judgment.see.e.hrsi objected to the court methodology in calculating damages.echo objected to the prejudgment interest award,contending that the court abused its discretion by failing to award moratory interest at a rate higher than the statutory minimum,and reducing the total interest award.id.at.hrsi motion was granted echo was denied.id.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,hrsi claims that the court a matter of law and of holding that the mfa is not subject to.second,hrsi contests the district court holding that the mfa unambiguously provides for merchant participation and insurance percentage payments to continue after the mfa has itself been terminated.based on the foregoing arguments,hrsi insists that it was entitled to summary judgment on the portion of the breach claim at issue.third,hrsi argues that the evidence adduced by echo did not provide the jury with an adequate basis to determine damages,and that hrsi was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in the alternative,hrsi claims that the uncertainty of echo damages precluded any award beyond nominal damages.fourth,hrsi claims that various trial errors caused such prejudice to its case that they resulted in a mistrial.echo disagrees with each of the foregoing arguments,and from the court prejudgment interest award on the same grounds asserted in its rule e motion.
hrsi statute of frauds defense 
under,claims relating to a credit agreement involving a principal amount in excess of thousand dollars are barred unless the credit agreement is in writing.according to hrsi,the mfa is a credit agreement,and the statute therefore bars echo claims relating to the mfa aplt.br.at.in the alternative,hrsi contends that even if the mfa is not a credit agreement,is still applicable because echo claims relate to the individual credit agreements assigned to hrsi.id.at.in its order on the parties respective motions for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the was inapplicable as a matter of law.upon de novo review,see medina city county of denver,cir,we agree with the district court conclusion.
hrsi must establish three elements to invoke that at least one plaintiff is a statutory creditor or debtor,that echo claims relate to a credit agreement,and that the underlying credit agreement involves a principal amount in excess of.n o debtor or creditor may file or maintain an action or a claim relating to a credit agreement involving a principal amount in excess of thousand dollars unless the credit agreement is in writing and is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.both at trial and on appeal,the parties primary focus has been the second element whether the claims relate to a credit agreement 
echo claims do not relate to a credit agreement 
the mfa plainly indicates that hrsi is purchasing commercial paper contract and slips.see seller eac desires household to purchase from time to time said contracts and slips at the price agreed upon from time to time by seller and household and evidenced by household letter.thus,the claims in this case relate to the purchase of commercial paper.as the defendant conceded at oral argument,there is no colorado authority to support the construction of the mfa itself as a credit agreement,and in the absence of such authority,we decline to treat it as one.section defines credit agreement,in pertinent part,as a contract,promise,undertaking,offer,or commitment to lend,borrow,repay,or forbear repayment of money,to otherwise extend or receive credit,or to make any other financial accommodation.a i emphasis added.in hrsi view,our interpretation of the phrase financial accommodation is not limited by the other terms in the definition.see aplt.br.at t he statutory definition is not limited only to a lending of money or an extension of credit.we disagree.
colorado courts interpret statutory language to reach a reasonable result consistent with the general assembly intent,and to give harmonious effect to all of the statute parts.sky fun schuttloffel,internal quotations and citation omitted see also.of revenue cray computer,w e consider statutes as a whole in order to effectuate legislative intent,and give consistent,harmonious,and sensible effect to all the statute parts.internal quotations,citation,and alteration omitted.the colorado supreme court has held that the purpose of is to discourage lender liability litigation and to promote certainty in credit agreements involving sums of more than.schoen morris.because hrsi broad construction of financial accommodation would effectively graft an onto an otherwise specific statute,thereby eviscerating the statute focus on credit agreements,we must reject it.see matter of title,ballot title submission,summ.for,we must read and interpret statutory language in its context.
an agreement for the purchase of commercial paper,such as the mfa,is not a financial accommodation as that term is used in.financial accommodation must be construed in light of the overall purpose of the statute,in a manner that is consistent with the rest of the statutory language.that language is clearly concerned with transactions and agreements that involve the extension or receipt of credit,and financial accommodation can not be read without that context in mind.beecham united states,d that several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well.we therefore agree with the district court conclusion that the mfa is not a credit agreement.
echo claims do not relate to the underlying customer credit agreements for purposes of 
in the alternative,hrsi argues that even if the mfa itself is not a credit agreement,echo claims still relate to a credit agreement in that the claims relate to the mfa,which in turn,relates to the individual credit agreements and the balances assigned to hrsi.univex,at.this argument also fails.we agree with the district court legal conclusion that the connection between echo claims and the credit agreements is too attenuated to justify the application of.to permit such a broad reading of the phrase relating to a credit agreement would be inconsistent with the statute exclusive concern with discouraging lender liability litigation and promoting certainty in credit agreements.schoen,at see generally stephanie shafer,limiting lender liability through the statute of frauds.law.accordingly,we do not believe the colorado supreme court would adopt the interpretation urged by hrsi,and we affirm the district court conclusion that.is inapplicable 
no procedural error 
finally,hrsi contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against hrsi without notice.aplt.br.at.this argument is also unavailing,in part because it mischaracterizes the district court ruling as to.the court denied hrsi statute of frauds motion on purely legal grounds.given the obviously legal nature of the court ruling,we can not fathom how an additional opportunity to present statute of evidence could have furthered hrsi case,nor do we understand why hrsi expected to be able to press its statute of frauds argument to the jury.although the district court ruling as to did not become the law of the case until the entry of final judgment,see united states smelting refining min.in re unioil,cir,it is axiomatic that the jury role is as.juries are not empowered to decide questions of law.see,jones united states,d the principle that the jury were the judges of fact and the judges the deciders of law was stated as an established principle as early as see also byrd blue ridge rural cooperative,d an essential characteristic of the federal system is the manner in which,in civil actions,it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and,under the not the the seventh amendment,assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury.
ii.participation 
echo claim for participation encompasses three.first,what is the duration of the defendant participation obligation echo contends that the obligation continues through the life of the individual loans hrsi claims that its obligation ended with the termination of the mfa.second,assuming a obligation,what are the applicable merchant participation and insurance percentage rates echo argues that the applicable rates are and,respectively hrsi insists that the parties never reached any agreement as to rates,and that it was therefore entitled either to judgment as a matter of law or to an instruction that the jury could only award nominal damages.see infra section iii.third,assuming a obligation and an agreement as to the applicable rates,how should those rates be applied to the eac portfolio to compute echo total damages echo claims that the rate must be applied to the outstanding balance of the entire eac portfolio,while hrsi contends that different rates apply to different accounts,depending on when each account was created by eac or sold to hrsi.see infra section iv c.in this section,we deal only with the first issue the duration of hrsi participation obligation.
in its summary judgment order,the district court held that the mfa as a whole and the circumstances surrounding its making unambiguously display an intent to continue payments until the termination of the loan agreements.we agree.participation payments are clearly part of the price hrsi agreed to pay for the accounts revolving credit contracts it purchased from eac between and.we are not persuaded by the defendant contention that the mfa silence as to the duration of hrsi duty to make participation payments demonstrates the parties intent to make the participation obligation with the mfa.aplt.br.at.
a fundamental rule of contract law is that the court should strive to ascertain and give effect to the mutual intent of the parties.pepcol denver union,citation omitted.t he intent of the parties to a written instrument must be determined primarily from the written terms.kn energy,great western sugar,citations omitted.in general,the interpretation of a contract is a question of law,pepcol,at,and where the evidence consists exclusively of documents,as in this case,the law is clear that the determination of their effect is a matter of law.radiology professional trinidad area health ass n,citations omitted.whether an ambiguity exists is also a question of law.pepcol,at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the contract at issue.in pertinent part,the mfa provides as follows 
undersigned eac herein called seller regularly sells merchandise and desires to offer a plan whereby a qualified customer may elect to make purchases from us from time to time on a revolving credit account herein called account an account is established by customer execution of a master agreement herein called contract describing his rights and obligations with respect to all purchases made from us on such account.once established,purchases may be made on such account from time to time by means of written memoranda herein called slips.each s lip shall describe the total amount of credit extended.
seller desires household retail services,herein called household,to purchase from time to time said contracts and slips at the price agreed upon from time to time by seller and household and evidenced by household letter.
id.at the mfa does not define the word price,but the first pricing letter outlined the structure of the price as including 
the consumer annual percentage rate will be with a per contract discount of charged by hrsi.
hrsi will pay eac eight percent of billed finance charges monthly.
hrsi will pay eac a percent of billed finance charges equivalent to thirty percent of billed insurance charges.
id.at.the second pricing letter,dated april,also speaks in terms of pricing.id.at.
we recognize that the third letter,dated january,uses the word incentive rather than price.id.at.nonetheless,we do not believe that a subtle and unilateral choice of words in a single letter is sufficient to alter the inherent nature of hrsi participation commitment as part of the price it had agreed to pay for eac contracts and slips.even a cursory reading of the letter reveals that hrsi use of the phrase incentive structure did not refer to the payment of merchant and insurance participation as a general matter.clearly,incentive structure referred specifically to the system outlined in the letter,according to which participation percentages would increase proportionately with total credit volume.id.at.
to the extent that the district court relied on extrinsic,the circumstances surrounding the contract reach the conclusion that the contract was unambiguous as to duration,such reliance was consistent with colorado law.see,kn energy,at holding that courts may consider extrinsic evidence,including the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract,in order to determine whether a contractual ambiguity exists.in this case,the summary judgment record included numerous affidavits as to the circumstances surrounding each new pricing arrangement,all of which indicate that participation payments were considered part of the price.for example,james defranco of eac stated that hrsi offered two options for the pricing agreement an payment equal to of the opening account balance or merchant participation payments equal to of billed monthly finance charges,defranco aff.defranco also stated that hrsi represented that the two options were financially equivalent,and demonstrated that point by comparing the payment to the participation payments,paid at each month until the account balance reached.id.at emphasis added accord id.at,fears aff.see also id.at,ergen,describing initial negotiations in and declaring that hrsi stated that participation payments were part of the purchase price.
in sum,the duration of hrsi participation obligation was obvious from the nature of the contract,and confirmed by the terms of the incorporated pricing letters and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract.the price of each revolving credit contract sold by eac to hrsi included a percentage of billed monthly finance charges.implicit in any arrangement to pay a purchase price in installments is the expectation that payments will continue until the entire balance is paid.the fact that the mfa and pricing letters do not explicitly affirm that common sense expectation does not create an ambiguity.see cheyenne mountain school dist.thompson,silence does not by itself necessarily create ambiguity as a matter of law.see also radiology professional,at the mere fact that there is a difference of opinion between the parties does not of itself create an ambiguity.accordingly,we affirm the district court conclusion that the contract,including the mfa and the pricing letters incorporated therein,are unambiguous as to the duration of hrsi participation obligation.such payments were part of the ongoing price that hrsi agreed to pay for the accounts it acquired from eac,and accordingly,the discontinuation of those payments in january constituted a breach of contract.
iii.hrsi motion for judgment as a matter of law damages 
at the close of echo case,hrsi moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule a,arguing that because the evidence did not show any agreement between the parties as to the rate of participation,any damages award would be necessarily speculative and therefore void under colorado law.in the alternative,hrsi argued that plaintiffs could not recover anything beyond nominal damages.
echo damages were not impossible of ascertainment 
where claims for damages are premised on breaches of contracts,damages that are merely speculative,remote,imaginary,or impossible of ascertainment can not be recovered.nat.bank of denver friedman,internal quotations,citations,and alteration omitted.this rule is cited most frequently with respect to claims for lost profits,western cities,schueller,vacating lost profits award based on testimony of econometrician,an expert in applying statistical and mathematical tools to general economic data in order to make predictions or forecast or attempt to examine economic behavior or what makes an economy tick,based on six different hypothetical models master palletizer,ragsdale,lost profits are not recoverable if either the amount of the profit that would have been earned or the fact that the plaintiff would have earned them is too speculative,remote,imaginary,or impossible to ascertain.citing,inter alia,prutch ford motor.in this case,hrsi argues that there was no evidence of any pricing agreement after.that claim is not supported by the record.
the parties stipulated that between june,and january,hrsi made monthly merchant and insurance participation payments to eac at the following rates 
june,merchant participation was paid at and insurance participation at 
december,merchant participation was paid at and insurance participation at 
august,merchant participation was paid at and insurance participation at 
october,merchant participation was paid at and insurance participation at.
tr.at.throughout this time period,merchant participation payments were calculated by multiplying the applicable rate by the finance charges billed on the total outstanding balance of all loans within the eac portfolio.id.at tr.at.similarly,insurance participation payments were calculated by multiplying the applicable rate by the total insurance charges billed on all loans within the eac portfolio.id.at tr.at.
not every pricing letter between echo and hrsi set forth specific numbers.the pricing letter,for example,merely confirmed that there would be no change in the parties existing arrangement.see also id.at tr.at testimony of frank nardi,acknowledging.as pricing letter.similarly,hrsi letter dated january,noticing its intent to terminate the mfa,failed to enumerate any specific numbers in connection with its pledge to honor its current participation commitment.specifically,the january letter promised that hrsi would continue to provide eac with the same quality service until may,under our existing agreement and honor our current participation commitment.id.at emphasis added.a reasonable jury could have read the foregoing sentence as evidencing two separate agreements,only one of which was to expire on may.in our view,the jury was entitled to interpret the january letter as a dual promise by hrsi first,to continue to purchase contracts and slips through may,and second,to honor its current participation commitment,to pay merchant and insurance the life of each revolving credit contract.there are no doubt alternative ways to read this and subsequent letters from hrsi.yet the ultimate question presented in hrsi rule motion was whether the facts were so clear that the law required the entry of judgment in hrsi favor.see weisgram marley,d.in this case,the facts were far from clear,and the court was correct in submitting the case to the jury.
nor do we agree that the evidence was insufficient to support an actual damages award.in their constitutional capacity as triers of fact,jurors are necessarily required to resolve close factual questions to the best of their ability.obviously,not every evidentiary uncertainty renders a damage award impermissibly speculative.see,bohrer church mut.ins,w e instruct jurors to use their best judgment based on the evidence when uncertainty arises regarding the amount of damages to be awarded.indeed,colorado courts have consistently held that once the fact of damage has been established with the requisite degree of certainty,uncertainty as to the amount of damages will not bar recovery.tull gundersons,accord western cities,at.it is equally that a plaintiff will not be barred from recovery for failing to prove the amount of loss with mathematical certainty pomeranz mcdonald.thus,in light of the evidence recited above,we hold that the court properly denied hrsi motion for judgment as a matter of law.
nominal damages 
to recover an award beyond nominal damages for breach of contract a plaintiff must prove that he suffered a loss resulting from the defendant actions.isaac american heritage bank and trust,see also doyle mcbee,i n an action for breach of contract,only nominal damages can be recovered,if there is no evidence produced from which the facts necessary to determine the damages under the proper rule can be determined.because there is no question that the plaintiffs in this case made the threshold showing required to obtain damages in excess of nominal damages,the court did not err in refusing to limit echo recovery.
iv.alleged trial errors 
the trial errors alleged by hrsi are as follows the court midstream determination that the jury would only decide the applicable rates of payments,not the total monetary amount of damages the preliminary instruction reference to hrsi liability instruction reference to course of performance evidence the multiple choice format of the special verdict form the court rejection of various instructions tendered by hrsi and the exclusion of three defense exhibits on hearsay grounds.we reject each assignment of error.
court determination that jury would only decide rate of merchant participation and insurance percentage 
hrsi claims that l ate in the plaintiff case and without adequate prior notice,the district court restructured the trial to withdraw certain damages issues from the jury.aplt.br.at.according to the defendant,its trial strategy was based on its belief that the jury would not only consider the applicable rate of payments,but also the total amount of damages.id.on the contrary,we find that the court plan never changed.from the entry of summary judgment on march,it was clear to all parties that the only issues left for the jury were the applicable rates of merchant and insurance participation.see,summary judgment order characterizing jury issue as which was the last pricing letter from defendant to which the parties agreed,and noting that the present record would not support a jury determination of plaintiff damages at less than the rate id.at tr.at court statement of the case,read to venire members during voir dire on july,there is a question of fact in this case appropriately decided by you,the jury regarding which was the applicable pricing letter for purposes of calculating plaintiffs share.id.at tr.at statement by court during the of echo first witness on july,t here only one limited purpose for which this jury is going to sit.they going to decide what the rate is,period.at the pretrial motions hearing on july,defense counsel himself proposed that the court statement of the case be modified to state that the court found that the obligation continue d but that the issue as to the rate,if any,of that obligation is for the jury to decide.id.at tr.at emphasis added.in short,hrsi professions of surprise when the court reiterated its position two days later is flatly contradicted by the record.
jury instructions preliminary instruction statement of the case and instruction 
hrsi claims that the district court statement of the case deprived it of the right to a fair and impartial jury by stating that hrsi had breached the contract,thereby casting the defendant as a wrongdoer from the outset,failing to state that the plaintiffs had the burden to prove their damages,and improperly suggest ing that plaintiffs were entitled to some amount of actual damages.aplt.br.at.hrsi also objects to instruction failure to reference certain defense theories,and to its implicit reliance on course of performance evidence for the proposition that the rate at which payments should be calculated was the rate set forth in the last most recent agreed pricing letter concerning participation id.at.when considering a party challenge to jury instructions,our initial inquiry is whether the party properly preserved that issue for appeal by objecting at the district court level to the instruction on the same grounds raised on appeal.comcoa,nec,cir.this inquiry is mandated by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides that n o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.
although the defendant did raise a number of objections to the court proposed statement of the case,see tr.at id.at tr.at,its current objections were not among them similarly,while hrsi did raise its current objections to instruction at the penultimate charge conference,id.at tr.at,it failed to do so the following day at the final instruction conference.id.at tr.at.at the final conference,hrsi requested only two changes to the court revised instruction,both of which the court agreed to make.id.upon inquiry,hrsi stated that it had no additional objections to the court proposed instruction.id.tr.at.accordingly,hrsi waived its current objections to the statement of the case and to instruction,and we find no plain error.
special verdict form 
next,hrsi objects to the special verdict form,claiming that it left the jury with no choice but to find a single rate of merchant participation applicable during the entire damages period to all balances in the eac portfolio,thereby depriving hrsi of its right to have its positions considered on the issue of rates.aplt.br.at.we view this objection as including two components that the verdict form forced the jury to select one of the three rates given,and that the verdict form did not permit the jury to consider whether different rates might apply to different accounts.both are without merit.see webb abf freight system,cir noting that the language of a special verdict form is reviewed under the same abuse of discretion standard that we apply to jury instructions.first,the special verdict form consisted of three nearly identical questions,which differed only in terms of the merchant participation percentage has the plaintiff proven by a preponderance of the evidence,that the applicable merchant participation rate was or,or and the applicable insurance participation rate was,as agreed upon by the parties and evidenced by a letter from defendant yes or no.emphasis added.nothing in the special verdict form prevented the jury from answering no to all three questions.
as to the court determination that a single rate applied to all outstanding loans,it is important to note the parties stipulation that hrsi calculated merchant participation payments to eac by multiplying the rate in effect at the time by the finance charges billed on the total outstanding balance of the loans within the portfolio,see also id.at comparable stipulation as to insurance participation payments.we recognize that the stipulation refers only to past practice,but the trial court was legally entitled to rely on the stipulation in order to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to the appropriate method of calculating payments.under colorado law,w hen a contract or agreement has been given a practical construction,as reflected by the conduct and acts of the parties in its performance,such construction may,and perhaps even should,be considered by the court in eliminating any ambiguity,and in ascertaining the mutual meaning of the parties at the time of contracting.pepcol,at internal quotations and citation omitted see also kn energy,at the parties course of performance following execution of the contract is relevant to the interpretation of the agreement.citations omitted.the elimination of contractual ambiguity is a matter for the trial court,not for the jury.pepcol,at whether an ambiguity exists is a question of law.we find no error in the court legal determination that the mfa and incorporated pricing letters required that all payments both pre and by hrsi to eac be calculated by applying a single participation rate to the entire portfolio,regardless of the dates on which the individual loans originated.
rejection of defendant tendered instructions 
hrsi also complains that the district court erred in refusing to give 
defendant proposed instructions and,requiring the jury to award only nominal damages if it found that the parties had failed to agree on merchant participation or insurance participation rates for any period of time 
defendant proposed instructions,id.at,regarding contract formation 
defendant proposed instruction,aplt,ex.e copy of,stating that o nce agreed upon,the terms of an agreement on participation under the merchandise financing agreement may be changed only by a subsequent amendment between hrsi and eac,which is evidenced by a letter from hrsi 
defendant proposed instruction,aplt,ex.e copy of,regarding the use of extrinsic evidence and 
defendant proposed instruction,regarding hrsi lack of consideration defense.
aplt.br.at.
i t is not error to refuse to give a requested instruction if the same subject matter is adequately covered in the general instructions.schuchmann,cir internal quotations,citations,and alteration omitted.as to proposed instructions and,we have already explained that nothing in the special verdict form required the jury to find that the parties had agreed to applicable rates.see supra section iii c.the subject matter of defendant proposed instructions,how to determine the parties agreement as to participation adequately addressed in the court instruction,which required the jury to determine which was the last pricing letter from the defendant to which the parties agreed,as required by the mfa.id.at see also special verdict form,requiring jury to find that the applicable rates were agreed upon by the parties and evidenced by a letter from defendant.instruction and the special verdict form also adequately addressed the subject matter of defendant proposed instructions and the requirement of the mfa.finally,given that the court summary judgment order had already rejected hrsi lack of consideration argument as a matter of law by finding that payments were part of the price of the contracts and slips assigned to hrsi,the court did not err in rejecting defendant proposed instruction,which attempted to resurrect that theory at trial.in sum,we find no error in the court rejection of defendant proposed instructions,and.
exclusion of defense exhibits,and 
finally,hrsi claims that the district court erred in sustaining echo hearsay objections to the admission of three letters from hrsi.in its opening brief to this court,hrsi claims that the letters were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted,but rather as verbal acts with independent legal significance,to provide context for various letters that had already been admitted,and to show notice of hrsi position.hrsi also claims that the letters were admissible as business records evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.general joiner,d.we see no abuse of discretion here.
verbal acts 
the federal rules of evidence define hearsay as an statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.by contrast,i f the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made,no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted,and the statement is not hearsay.advisory committee note.according to hrsi,the excluded exhibits were not proffered as evidence of the truth of the statements therein,but rather,for their independent legal significance.aplt.br.at.specifically,hrsi claims that defense exhibits,and were offers,and therefore admissible as verbals acts.we disagree.
the verbal acts doctrine applies only where the statement actually affects the legal rights of the parties,or where legal consequences flow from the fact that the words were said.pungitore,quoting black law dictionary ed.thus,it is not enough to simply characterize a statement as an offer.only utterances by the parties constituting the offer and acceptance which brought the contract into being qualify as verbal acts.mccormick on evidence ed emphasis added.in this case,hrsi candidly acknowledges that eac rejected the offers contained in defense exhibits and dated march,and april,respectively.aplt.reply br.at citing.similarly,there is no evidence that eac or echosphere ever accepted the offer contained in defense exhibit,dated april,which appears to have been superseded on december,if not earlier,by a subsequent hrsi letter.accordingly,it is clear that none of the excluded exhibits brought the contract into being,mccormick,affect ed the legal rights of the parties,pungitore.at,or had any legal consequences independent of its substantive content.compare united states montana,cir explaining difference between verbal acts such as a promise,offer,or demand,which commit the speaker to a course of action,and hearsay statements,which narrate,describe,or otherwise convey information,and so are judged by their truth value emphasis added,and trepel roadway,cir upholding exclusion of statement as hearsay where statement was not an offer to sell but rather,a declaration of the price range the owner would be willing to take should someone make an offer to buy with puma sullivan,holding that oral statement containing an offer,which statement proponents had accepted,was admissible for consideration on summary judgment as a verbal act.the district court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining echo hearsay objection against hrsi proffer of the exhibits as verbal acts.
given our standard of review,hrsi argument that the excluded exhibits were admissible to provide context is also unpersuasive.the trial court was familiar with the evidence in this case,and we decline to its judgment as to whether the excluded exhibits were necessary to provide context or completeness.see,vii wigmore on evidence ed.united states catano,cir.the case upon which hrsi relies,united states catano,arose on very different facts.because the question of whether a document is necessary to put another in context will depend upon the circumstances of each case and the character of each document,factually distinct cases have minimal persuasive value,if any.vii wigmore on evidence.unlike the written correspondence at issue here,catano involved an audio tape of oral conversations between a criminal defendant and an informant.at.in that case,the court held that the informant portions of the conversations were admissible to provide context for the defendant portions because they served as reciprocal and integrated utterance s,reasonably required to place the defendant admissions into context and make them intelligible to the jury.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted see also,united states mcdowell,cir nor can a defendant,having made admissions,keep from the jury other segments of the discussion reasonably required to place those admissions into context.united states,cir holding that statements on tape recording were admissible for the limited purpose of putting the responses of the defendant in context and making them intelligible to the jury and recognizable as admissions internal quotations and citation omitted.the intelligibility difference between a recorded conversation that has been edited to omit every other line as in catano,mcdowell,and and selected pieces of business correspondence as in the instant case,is obvious.we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court ruling.
further,the exhibits that hrsi seeks to put in context were either stipulated exhibits,see tr.at,or introduced by hrsi itself.see id.at tr.at id.at tr.at id.at tr.at.in hrsi view,the circumstances under which the exhibits were admitted are irrelevant to its allegedly absolute right to introduce otherwise inadmissible hearsay in order to provide context.aplt.reply br.at no such limitation exists in the federal rules of evidence.a party is entitled to put into context any and all evidence.this assertion is patently incorrect.
the rule of completeness provides that the opponent,against whom a part of an utterance has been put in,may in his turn complement it by putting in the remainder,in order to secure for the tribunal a complete understanding of the total tenor and effect of the utterance.beech aircraft rainey,d citation omitted,emphasis added see also.when a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party,an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.emphasis added.the rule of completeness,both at common law and as partially codified in rule,functions as a defensive shield against potentially misleading evidence proffered by an opposing party.see united states collicott,cir only if the evidence by one party needs to be met or explained away by the other side does its mere introduction provide independent warrant for the introduction of other evidence.quoting weinstein berger,weinstein evidence,at united states corrigan,cir the rule is protective,merely.it goes only so far as is necessary to shield a party from adverse inferences internal quotations,citation,and alteration omitted.the rule does not allow a party to introduce otherwise inadmissible hearsay on the coattails of its own or stipulated exhibits i f evidence is misleading in a way that harms the case of the proponent,he can cure this by not introducing it.charles alan wright kenneth graham,fed.practice procedure,at.accordingly,the circumstances under which.and def.ex,and were admitted are critical to hrsi standing to invoke the rule of completeness.we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court rejection of hrsi proffers on completeness grounds.
hrsi final argument is that the excluded letters were admissible to show notice from hrsi advising plaintiffs of hrsi position.aplt.br.at.it is true that an statement may be admitted over a hearsay objection if the statement is offered not for the truth of the matter asserted in the statement but merely to show that a party had knowledge of a material fact or issue,marsee tobacco,cir ruling,in product liability action,that articles regarding health problems associated with smokeless tobacco were not hearsay because they were not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted,but only on the issue of whether the defendant had notice of the potential dangers its product posed to consumers benford richards med,cir sustaining admission of deposition testimony that deponent heard former president advise current representative against use of cast stainless steel in product because testimony was offered to show notice of associated dangers,not for the truth of the matter asserted.we believe that doctrine is inapplicable in this case.hrsi entire notice argument comprises only a sentence fragment in its opening brief it is not referenced at all in the reply brief.aplt.br.at.without further development,we fail to see the relevance of whether or not echo had notice of hrsi position on march,april,or april.craven of.hosp,cir we will not manufacture arguments for an appellant,and a bare assertion does not preserve a claim,particularly when,as here,a host of other issues are presented for review.internal citation omitted adler,at arguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting notice as a basis to admit the exhibits at issue.
rule business records exception 
the district court also rejected hrsi proffer of the letters under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.see.the court determined that the letters constituted legal posturing,drafted by lawyers in anticipation of litigation,and that rule was therefore inapplicable.tr.at see also id.at tr.at id.at tr.at.rule requires that the custodian or other qualified witness testify that the records were made contemporaneously with the events and kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity,and it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the record.united states samaniego,cir quoting.footnote omitted.business records are inadmissible,however,where the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.emphasis added see also id.advisory committee notes describing rationale underlying exception as t he element of unusual reliability said variously to be supplied by systematic checking,by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision,by actual experience of business in relying upon them,or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation citation omitted.thus,the motivation of a record author is relevant to admissibility.id.
not every item of business correspondence constitutes a business record.see,breeden abf freight system,cir sustaining exclusion of letter from chiropractor proffered as medical business record timberlake const.fidelity guar,cir holding that court erred in admitting letters written in anticipation of litigation as business records.it is that one who prepares a document in anticipation of litigation is not acting in the regular course of business.timberlake,at citing palmer hoffman.advisory committee note see also certain underwriters at lloyd,london sinkovich,cir noting that documents prepared in view of litigation are not admissible as business records under rule and illustrate that such documents prepared specifically for use in litigation are dripping with motivations to misrepresent citing hoffman palmer,cir noble.dep t of envtl,cir holding that court erred in admitting letter as business record where testimony was not adequate to establish that the letter was compiled as a matter of regular practice,as opposed to one prepared in anticipation of litigation.upon a thorough review of the exhibits and the testimony surrounding their proffer,we have found nothing to satisfy the foundational requirement that they were kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.like the letters we found inadmissible in timberlake,the exhibits at issue in this case have all the earmarks of being motivated and generated to further hrsi interest,with litigation not far around the corner.at.we see no abuse of discretion in the court refusal to admit defense exhibits,and as business records under rule.
as to prejudgment interest 
the district court granted echo motion for prejudgment interest,awarding interest at a rate of eight percent per annum.i n the interests of fairness,however,the court reduced the total interest award by,noting that defendant withholding was not wrongful for of the prejudgment period due to the court substantial delay in ruling on the parties cross motions for summary judgment.see also id.at order denying echo rule e motion.in its,echo contends that the district court abused its discretion by reducing the total award and by failing to award interest at a rate higher than eight percent,the statutory minimum.aplee.br.at.echo argues for a higher rate based upon hrsi shareholders overall,return on equity or,in the alternative,hrsi average yield on receivables.
as a preliminary matter,we must address hrsi pending motion to strike plaintiffs december,reply brief,filed december.as noted in that motion,echo reply brief addresses not only the,but also the merits of hrsi appeal.thus,echo reply brief effectively constitutes two briefs echo reply brief,and appellee echo brief.only the first of the two is authorized by the federal rules of appellate procedure.fed.a c providing that appellant may file an opening brief and a reply brief,that appellee may file an answer brief,and that u nless the court permits,no further briefs may be filed.if the latter portion of echo reply brief had been submitted to the clerk of court under the correct title,appellee brief,it would not have been accepted for filing.see fed.c.accordingly,hrsi motion to strike is granted as to all portions of the brief that address the merits of hrsi appeal.
we now turn to the merits of the.in pertinent part,the colorado statute governing prejudgment interest in contract suits provides that 
a when money or property has been wrongfully withheld,interest shall be an amount which fully recognizes the gain or benefit realized by the person withholding such money or property from the date of wrongful withholding to the date of payment or to the date judgment is entered,whichever first occurs or,at the election of the claimant,
b interest shall be at the rate of eight percent per annum compounded annually for all moneys or the value of all property after they are wrongfully withheld or after they become due to the date of payment or to the date judgment is entered,whichever first occurs.
emphasis added.we refer to prejudgment interest awarded pursuant to subsection a as moratory interest,see chaparral,monsanto,cir,and interest awarded pursuant to b as statutory interest.

denial of moratory interest without an evidentiary hearing 
the plaintiffs also contend that the court abused its discretion by rejecting their application for moratory interest without an evidentiary hearing.aplee.br.at see also statement by court during status conference,indicating intent to have hearing on moratory interest.echo claims that statutory interest is insufficient to fully recognize the gain or benefit realized by hrsi during the period in which payments were withheld.aplee.br.at quoting.a.
i n order to receive the higher interest rate,it is that the claimant must specifically prove that the withholding party actually benefitted in an amount greater than eight percent per annum.northwest cent.pipeline jer partnership,cir emphasis added citing lowell staats mining pioneer uravan,cir.the statute specific proof requirement is extremely demanding and,accordingly,moratory interest awards under a are very rare.atlantic richfield farm credit bank of wichita,cir.compare great western sugar,at,endorsing sophisticated economic model used to determine gain realized on the specific property withheld,and davis cattle great western sugar,finding sufficient specificity where claimant showed that the offending party was able to leave of its credit line untapped and thereby save in interest,aff,cir with,atlantic richfield,at rejecting return on equity analysis as too speculative where underlying balance sheets failed to distinguish between corporate entities and were based,in part,on investments made outside the relevant time period,and ballow,at vacating moratory interest award at,the united states treasury rate at the time,because there was no evidence in the record to support that interest rate as the gain or benefit realized by the defendant.

hrsi financial statements,see 
excerpts of deposition testimony by hrsi representative joseph hoff that a release of a reserve amount would result in an increase in shareholders equity because the amount of the reserve had previously served to reduce income,and calculating shareholders average,return on equity,see id.at and 
an affidavit by echo expert witness,steven williams,explaining that at a minimum the economic benefit hrsi derived from the use of wrongfully withheld funds is commensurate with the yield hrsi was generating on the eac portfolio.
aplee.br.at.despite the plaintiffs insistence that they have made the specific showing we found to be lacking in atlantic richfield,aplee.br.at,we see no meaningful distinction between the evidence in that case and the evidence presented to the district court in support of echo motion.as in atlantic richfield,the evidence upon which echo relied was of a general nature the plaintiffs arguments,like those that failed to persuade the atlantic richfield court,are entirely based on ratios derived from financial,the average return on equity and average return on any specific proof as to
