in december,plaintiff mag jewelry company mag purchased some costume jewelry at a target store in rhode island.the necklaces,whose pendants were comprised of four crystal stones in the shape of an angel,were of interest to mag because it holds a copyright on that crystal angel design,and target was not one of mag customers.mag subsequently filed this copyright infringement action against target corporation and its supplier,style accessories,style the defendants denied copying mag angel,claiming that their jewelry was based on an identical design independently created by someone else.following presentation of mag case to a jury,the district court granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law.mag appeals that ruling,and,in a,defendants challenge the district court refusal to award attorney fees after careful review of the record,we affirm the judgment for defendants on the merits but reverse the fees ruling.
the angel design at the center of this controversy is a fairly simple figure.a round crystal stone serves as its head and a teardrop stone as its body,two oblong navette stones create the wings,and a metal jump piece typically used to link a charm to a attached at the top as a halo.the crystal stones are commercially sold in standard sizes,and the stones are neither cut nor otherwise altered to create the angel shape at issue here.the design has been used for necklaces,earrings and pins.
the facts underlying the than the ultimate question whether copying largely undisputed.mag president,daniel magnanimi,applied for copyright registration for the angel in november,listing as the year of its creation and june,as the date of first publication.the united states copyright office issued the registration and,in the following months,mag sent letters through counsel to dozens of individuals and businesses demanding that they stop selling similar crystal angels.
one such letter was sent to alan gregerman,a rhode island jewelry designer and manufacturer who was selling a crystal angel virtually identical to mag.gregerman hired an attorney,who in february sent a response to mag stating that gregerman had created the same angel design earlier than and that he also had first manufactured,marketed,and sold products incorporating the angel design before that year.gregerman later testified that he created his crystal angel in the summer of,that he began selling and shipping copies by september,and that his angel was included in a gift catalog.his attorney letter reciprocally accused mag of copyright infringement and demanded that mag cease and desist using the angel in any products.
there were further communications between mag and gregerman attorneys,followed by two significant events.first,in june,mag filed a supplement to its original copyright registration,changing its crystal angel date of creation to march than two years earlier than gregerman claimed to have created his angel.second,gregerman and magnanimi agreed that they both would sell crystal angels without interference or threat of suit from the other,and gregerman also gave mag permission to make and sell two other angel jewelry designs that he had created.magnanimi sent gregerman a letter reflecting that arrangement in september,stating that we have both agreed that you can make the crystal angel as copyrighted by mag jewelry at trial,gregerman testified that he rejected his attorney advice to pursue litigation at that time because he could continue to use the angel design,and litigation would have upset his mother,who was elderly and ill.
mag and gregerman continued to make and sell crystal angels,without incident until mag discovered the crystal angel necklaces sold by target corporation in late.after purchasing some at the target store in warwick,rhode island in december and more at a target store in new york the next month,mag filed this copyright infringement action against the retailer target later identified style as its supplier,and mag amended its complaint to add style as a defendant,alleging that style had sold crystal angel items that were copied from mag angel.
style,however,was a customer of gregerman.in its answers to mag interrogatories,the company denied that it had copied any piece sold or created by mag jewelry and reported that it had adapted a piece purchased from alan gregerman to create the target necklace.style had purchased crystal angels from gregerman between may and august and subsequently had similar pieces produced,at a lower cost,by two other companies.style did not obtain gregerman permission to bring the design to other manufacturers.
based on the uncontroverted evidence that style crystal angel was modeled on a design it obtained from gregerman the defendants moved for summary judgment in july.in support of their motion,they cited a june affidavit from gregerman stating that he had independently created his crystal angel in opposition,mag offered a new affidavit from gregerman,taken on september,that included the following assertions 
based on an agreement with daniel magnanimi,alan gregerman company can make and sell the subject crystal angel jewelry piece.
i inform any potential customer interested in purchasing the subject crystal angel piece that it has been copyrighted by mag jewelry,and that alan gregerman company has an agreement with mag and can make and sell the piece to its customers.
to the best of my recollection,i informed chad mollica of style accessories,of the fact that the subject crystal angel piece was copyrighted by mag jewelry.
relying on the new affidavit,mag argued during a hearing on the summary judgment motion that factual disputes remained,particularly whether gregerman independently created that piece and,even if he did create a crystal angel,whether the angel gregerman sold to style was his own or the mag design.mag counsel suggested that gregerman was a licensee of mag,and he told the court that,if the new affidavit is read precisely,what it says is that he sold to style the mag angel.assuming that there even is an angel that he still maintains that he independently created,that not what he sold to style.
at the end of the hearing,the district court denied the summary judgment motions,observing that there are just too many factual links that have to be established here for the court to say as a matter of law that this is not an infringing product.the case thus proceeded to trial before a jury.
in preparation for trial and in response to gregerman second affidavit,defendants sought further discovery and obtained permission to depose him.at his february deposition,gregerman testified that he originally refused to sign a new affidavit proposed to him by mag counsel because it stated that alan gregerman company had a license from mag and that was not the case.gregerman agreed to the affidavit ultimately submitted to the court after it was revised to eliminate the license reference.at the deposition,the following exchange took place between gregerman and defense counsel 
q.you did understand that you had a license,correct 
i did not far as i was concerned,based upon my definition or my understanding of a license,i did not have a license from danny.
q.you were selling your crystal angel in the summer of,correct 
and that was your creation that you were selling,correct 
at trial,magnanimi testified about his creation of the crystal angel in and stated that the piece,which was first created as a pin,had been displayed at jewelry shows in providence,rhode island between and.the earliest evidence that mag crystal angel was distributed to others was an invoice showing that a sample piece was mailed to a company,merlite industries,in september.magnanimi testified that the first documented sale of a crystal angel item occurred in march and that more than pins with that design were sold in the first half of.at one point during,when asked about his company effort to secure an assignment from gregerman of the copyright in his angel,magnanimi stated that 
there was never a dispute as to whose crystal angel it was.alan gregerman claims that he independently designed it,and i claim that i independently designed it.
whose crystal angel it was from and until this day me and alan gregerman never discussed,did care whose crystal angel it was.
gregerman,also called as a witness by mag,described his own creation of a crystal angel in at a customer request.on,in response to a question by defense counsel,he agreed that he had always considered that he independently created that angel,and further agreed that it was his own angel that he sold to style.however,he also acknowledged that he told customers who purchased the crystal angel,including style president,chad mollica,that mag jewelry had a copyright on the design and that he and magnanimi had an understanding or agreement that he could manufacture and sell the angel without any legal repercussions.upon questioning by mag counsel,gregerman testified that the crystal angel design sold to style was the same crystal angel design as mag and that,t echnically,gregerman had been selling the crystal angel design that was copyrighted by mag jewelry.
at the close of mag presentation of its,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,arguing,inter alia,that mag had failed to prove that style copied the mag crystal angel.in its oral ruling,the district court stated that the only reasonable conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence was that defendants had copied the angel they had obtained from gregerman.the court explained 
i do see how there could be any contention here that the defendants copied mag crystal angel as opposed to gregerman,because they had ready access to gregerman,and there would be no reason for them having gregerman crystal angel and having a history of selling it why they would possibly go to take mag crystal angel.
the court then went on to consider the fundamental question whether gregerman crystal angel infringed on mag copyright.to establish copyright infringement,a plaintiff must prove two elements ownership of a valid copyright and copying of the protected work by the alleged infringer.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d johnson gordon,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of proof on both elements.johnson,at.mag ownership of a valid copyright has not been contested the focus in this case has been on the element of copying.direct evidence of copying is rare,id.at grubb kms patriots,cir,but an inference of copying may be drawn from evidence that an alleged copier had access to the copyright holder previously created design and that there is a high degree of similarity between the works,johnson,at grubb,at 
consistent with that framework,the district court noted that,for mag to prevail,it would have to make two showings.first,mag needed to demonstrate a sufficient degree of similarity between its crystal angel and gregerman to give rise to an inference of actual copying.johnson,at.the court found that mag evidence supported such a finding.second,mag had to prove that the similarity in the designs was attributable to gregerman having had access to mag crystal angel rather than to gregerman independent creation of the same design.the district court concluded that mag evidence on this prong fell short,explaining that mag failure to elicit probative evidence of access precluded a jury from finding that the items sold and manufactured by the defendants were copied from mag angel the defendants were therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
on appeal,mag contends that the district court applied the wrong legal standard to the issue of access and further erred by failing to consider style access to the mag design along with gregerman.mag also claims that the court improperly neglected a dispositive independent basis on which mag could have prevailed before the gregerman sold mag crystal angel design to style,and not his own independent creation.
in a,defendants claim that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting their request for attorney fees.
the parties contentions in this case are sufficiently unusual that we think it helpful to pause briefly for the purpose of clarifying the relationships among the central characters.as noted above,it is undisputed that gregerman was the original source of the crystal angel jewelry that style distributed to target.although style directly purchased crystal angels from gregerman for a little more than a year,it later hired other companies to make similar items,but at a lower cost and without gregerman authorization.the necklaces that mag found at target were produced by one or more of these other companies.
when mag sued target and style for copyright infringement,style defended in part by claiming the crystal angel could be copyrighted mag was not the copyright holder whose design had been infringed.style asserted that the crystal angel necklace sold at target was based on gregerman independently created design and impliedly claimed that,if any infringement occurred,it was of gregerman design,not mag.
mag ultimately responded in two ways.first,it maintained that gregerman was not,in fact,an independent creator,and so gregerman design was in reality mag design.second,mag argued that even assuming that gregerman independently created an identical crystal angel,the angel design that gregerman sold to style was mag,and not his own under either theory,mag would have a viable copyright claim against style.
gregerman is not a defendant in this case because he and magnanimi agreed that both of their companies could make the or not gregerman was an independent gregerman also was free to sell the design to style and his other customers.thus,in selling the crystal angel to style,gregerman did no more than was authorized by the september letter agreement.mag claim is that style committed copyright infringement permission from either mag or took the design it had obtained from gregerman to other companies for production of crystal angel jewelry.
mag argues that we should reject out of hand what it characterizes as style unprecedented independent creation defense,that style is protected by gregerman independent creation notwithstanding the fact it did not have gregerman permission to make the allegedly infringing items.while we can appreciate mag dismay,principles of copyright law on which mag itself relies appear to permit just such a defense by style.mag acknowledges in its brief that it is axiomatic that separate copyrights exist in independently created designs,even if the works are identical.see boisson banian,cir see also melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a a work is original and may command copyright protection,even if it is completely identical with a prior work,provided it was not copied from such prior work but is rather a product of the independent efforts of its author.presumably,then,if gregerman independently created his design,and if style copied the crystal angel from gregerman,only gregerman rights would be implicated.it would be up to gregerman to pursue,or not,his rights in his design 
the pivotal issues before us,therefore,are whether mag provided sufficient evidence of copying by gregerman to allow a jury to reject the claim of independent creation,and whether,even if gregerman did independently conceive a crystal angel,the particular design taken without permission by style was mag.
with this background in mind,we turn to our review of the district court judgments.
we review de novo the grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule,viewing the evidence,and inferences to be drawn therefrom,in the light most favorable to the,cir quoting mangla brown,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if the presentation of the party case reveals no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party.a see also id.at.
the district court concluded that defendants were entitled to judgment because,in its view,there was insufficient evidence to permit a jury to conclude that style crystal angel originated with mag copyrighted design.specifically,the court ruled that there was no evidentiary basis for a finding that gregerman had access to mag crystal angel before he made his thus no basis for concluding that he copied the mag angel.
mag argues that the court erred in evaluating access.it claims that copyright law requires only that a defendant had a reasonable opportunity to view the plaintiff work and that the court erroneously utilized a more demanding standard.according to mag,the court required it to prove that gregerman actually took advantage of viewing opportunities and saw the work.
we find this argument unpersuasive.mag is correct that reasonable opportunity is the applicable standard for evaluating access a copyright owner need not demonstrate an alleged infringer actual access to a protected work.see grubb kms patriots,cir.however,e vidence that only creates a bare possibility that the defendant had access is not sufficient.see also,gaste kaiserman,cir requiring evidence of a reasonable possibility of access,which is more than a bare possibility and may not be inferred through speculation or conjecture melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a of course,reasonable opportunity does not encompass any bare possibility in the sense that anything is possible.access may not be inferred through mere speculation or conjecture.there must be a reasonable possibility of viewing plaintiff a bare possibility.footnotes omitted.
here,as the district court noted,there was no evidence that the mag angel was widely distributed before gregerman first produced large quantities of his crystal angel in late a sample was provided to a customer,merlite,in september,but mag recorded no sales until early the following year.mag did not create its first catalog until december.although there was evidence that the crystal angel was displayed at jewelry shows between and each year in rhode island,where gregerman lived the district court observed that t he problem is that there is no evidence that gregerman attended any of those shows,let alone that he went to mag display.
mag complains that this statement of t he problem reflected the incorrect view that mag had to show that gregerman actually viewed the design at the shows,while the standard requires only an opportunity for viewing.however,the gap in evidence is larger than mag admits.while evidence that gregerman attended the rhode island jewelry,even more generally,that he sometimes attended similar have permitted an inference that he had a reasonable opportunity to view mag design,mag failed to identify any such evidence.notably,gregerman was called as mag witness at trial,but was not asked about his attendance at trade shows 
mag asserts that a reasonable opportunity to view the copyrighted work can be shown through a chain of events or a link by which access might have occurred.it cites flag fables,jean ann country flags crafts,to support its contention that the annual display of mag crystal angels at trade shows in rhode island,in gregerman own locality,was sufficient to establish such a chain.access was not disputed in flag fables,id.at,but the judge briefly noted that the defendant could not credibly argue lack of access in part because plaintiff decorative banners had been displayed at the same craft fairs where the defendant later sold her flags for more than a year before defendant began producing her own versions.in addition,the court relied on evidence that plaintiff banners had achieved rapid and widespread popularity,id.at,and were the subject of a local newspaper article.no equivalent chain of events was shown here.no evidence placed either gregerman or style at the jewelry trade shows,and,as noted earlier,there is no evidence of widespread awareness of mag crystal angel before gregerman began selling his jewelry.
mag seeks to mitigate the absence of affirmative and probative evidence of access,jorgensen records,cir quoting scott paramount pictures,aff,table,by pointing to the striking similarity between the mag and gregerman crystal angel pieces.mag argues that numerous courts have held that such equivalence between works is itself independent evidence of access,see bucklew hawkins,ash,baptie,cir citing cases,and it suggests that other facts in the record also tend to rebut gregerman claim of independent creation.mag notes gregerman failure to register the copyright in his angel,despite his registration of other contemporaneous designs his failure to enforce his claimed rights in the crystal angel design against infringers,despite enforcing his copyright in other contemporaneous works and his issuance of a license to mag to sell other of his designs,suggesting a quid pro quo for mag allowing him to sell its crystal angel 
while the designs similarity and these additional facts would have assisted mag before the jury had it offered some probative evidence of access,any finding of copying by the jury based on gregerman failure to register copyrights in other designs or to enforce his rights in the crystal angel beyond his agreement with magnanimi would be mere speculation or conjecture.in addition,as the district court noted,the striking similarity between the designs is a little less compelling in this case because we dealing with basically an arrangement of geometric shapes and we dealing with a final creation that is sort of fixed in concept t here are only so many ways one can depict an angel.in a case such as this,where the simplicity of the design makes independent creation highly plausible,similarity alone could not establish access and,in turn,copying bucklew,at w hen the similarities concern details of such an arbitrary character that the probability that the infringer had duplicated them independently is remote,an inference of copying may be drawn without any additional evidence.gaste,at though striking similarity alone can raise an inference of copying,that inference must be reasonable in light of all the evidence.selle gibb,cir a n inference of access may be established circumstantially by proof of similarity which is so striking that the possibilities of independent creation,coincidence and prior common source are,as a practical matter,precluded however,striking similarity is just one piece of circumstantial evidence tending to show access and must not be considered in isolation.
on this record,we agree with the district court that no reasonable finder of fact could conclude that gregerman had a reasonable opportunity to view mag work before gregerman produced his crystal angel.consequently,the court properly found as a matter of law that mag could not establish that style copied its crystal angel design by copying gregerman design 
mag alternatively asserts that,even assuming that gregerman independently conceived his crystal angel,mag was entitled to prove to a jury that the angel gregerman sold to style was not his own creation,but mag that when style copied the design,it was copying from mag,not gregerman.mag claims the district court erred in failing to consider this basis for the infringement claim.
we view this argument to be so implausible as to verge on frivolity.the record as a whole unequivocally refutes the theory that gregerman sold his customers crystal angels that he considered to be based on mag copyrighted design,rather than on his own essentially identical concept.gregerman consistently testified that he sold his own crystal angel design to his customers,specifically including style.
mag attempt to create a factual dispute by characterizing magnanimi letter to gregerman in september as a license agreement is,at best,disingenuous.the letter,stating that we have both agreed that you can make the crystal angel as copyrighted by mag jewelry,provides no basis for an inference that from that time forward gregerman was selling mag angel pursuant to a license rather than his own creation.indeed,such a suggestion defies reason.gregerman and magnanimi both testified that the two angels were essentially the same given the assumption of independent that is the starting point for this alternative the angel gregerman sold to style was his own design or mag depended entirely on gregerman representation.in either case,the jewelry would look the same.thus,if gregerman said he was selling his own he did so jury could find otherwise only if gregerman statements or behavior at the time of the sales contradicted that assertion 
in attempting to show such inconsistency,mag relies in part on the september letter.the letter contains only the single sentence concerning gregerman use of the mag design per our telephone conversation we have both agreed that you can make the crystal angel as copyrighted by mag jewelry as we already have pointed out,this says nothing about which angel gregerman actually would make and sell.as magnanimi testified,neither he nor gregerman was concerned about that question because both designs were,essentially,the same angel.in other words,both men agreed that the crystal angel as copyrighted by mag jewelry was identical to the crystal angel that gregerman claimed to have created.
mag also highlights gregerman disclosure to his customers that mag possessed a registered copyright on the crystal angel,as well as gregerman assurance that there would be no litigation over his customers use of the crystal angel that these actions demonstrate that gregerman was selling mag angel.mag reads too much into these messages.gregerman decision to inform his customers that there was no risk of legal action stemming from their purchase of his angels,despite mag formal copyright protection,does not contradict his testimony that he sold style his own angels.
nor does the new gregerman affidavit that was offered by mag in its effort to stave off summary judgment fill the gap.without doubt,the affidavit could be read out of context as stating that,in gregerman view,he was selling mag copyrighted angel.in it,gregerman refers to the mag design as the subject crystal angel jewelry piece and states that the alan gregerman company sold the subject crystal angel jewelry piece to style accessories,once again,however,the fact that all parties saw gregerman angel as indistinguishable from mag provides necessary context.gregerman testimony unmistakably shows that it was the uniformity between the pieces that caused him to view any sale of the former as t echnically also a sale of the latter 
mag asserts that sufficient ambiguity exists surrounding these various agreement,the verbal assurances to customers,the averments in the new it was entitled to a jury judgment on the credibility of gregerman assertion that he sold his own angel design to style.we disagree.to the extent any of these indicators is equivocal in isolation,the uncertainty is dispelled when the record is considered as a whole.on this record,a jury could find for mag only by engaging in conjecture or speculation,and defendants rule motion may not be denied on such a basis.see santiago,cir even though we draw all rational inferences from the facts in favor of the party,that party is not entitled to inferences based on speculation and conjecture.quoting ferrer zayas,cir russo baxter healthcare,cir stating that party may not rely on conjecture or speculation to justify submitting an issue to the jury.
in sum,we conclude that a reasonable jury could not have found that gregerman sold mag angel rather than his own to style.we therefore affirm the district court grant of defendants motion for judgment under rule.
under section of the copyright act,the district court in its discretion may award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party.such fees are to be awarded to defendants on an evenhanded basis with plaintiffs.fogerty fantasy,d see also invessys,cir.among the factors that may be considered are frivolousness,motivation,objective unreasonableness both in the factual and in the legal components of the case and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.fogerty,at.quoting lieb topstone,cir.the goal of such awards is to vindicat e the overriding purpose of the copyright act to encourage the production of original literary,artistic,and musical expression for the public good.lotus dev.borland int l,cir see also fogerty,at.
defendants challenge the district court refusal to make a fee award in this case,arguing that the court overemphasized mag subjective good faith and improperly failed to take into account both the weak factual basis for mag position and mag misleading representations at the summary judgment hearing concerning whether gregerman sold style his own,or mag,crystal angel design.although we may not disturb the trial court judgment simply because we would have approached the matter differently,the court misapprehension of either the law or the facts may justify vacating its ruling as an abuse of discretion.see invessys,at lotus dev,at edwards red farm studio,cir.
having closely reviewed the record,we agree with defendants that in rejecting a fee award,the district court relied on a mistaken notion of the factual reasonableness of mag infringement claim.during the hearing on defendants fees motion,the court noted that it was undisputed that style had copied an angel obtained from gregerman and that the issue thus became whether gregerman was producing this crystal angel simply as a licensee of mag pursuant to mag copyright.the court observed that,despite its finding that mag presented insufficient evidence of access to warrant an inference of copying,that evidentiary failure did not necessarily lead to an award of attorney fees.the court thought it significant that the issue of gregerman access to mag crystal angel did really surface,did become a big issue until the time of trial.the court stated 
it might have been a different matter if this were an issue that was fully explored prior to trial,but that was the case.this issue,although it may have been touched on somewhat collaterally,did really emerge as the focal point in the case until the time of trial.at least that was my recollection.
the court went on to identify as the other significant point the agreement,whether you call it a licensing agreement or however one characterizes it,there was an agreement between mag and gregerman under which they agreed to sell each other crystal angel.the court found very troubling the alleged misrepresentations by mag concerning the gregerman affidavit at the summary judgment hearing but said that i certainly ca conclude based on what been presented to me that there was any attempt to mislead the court as to what gregerman position was in this.
we think the court misunderstood the extent and significance of mag shift in its theory of the case to avoid summary judgment and,indeed,the comments quoted above indicate that the court may have decided differently had it fully appreciated mag strategy.at the outset of the litigation,mag was pursuing style as an infringer of its crystal angel.once it discovered that style angel originated with gregerman,the infringement claim as originally conceived was no longer viable.at that point,mag could show copyright infringement only if it could prove either that gregerman independent design had in fact been copied from mag,or that gregerman had sold mag angel,rather than his own,to style.
our analyses in the preceding sections explain why neither of those positions was vindicated at trial,and we think it apparent that the inadequacies in mag showings are traceable to facts of which the company had full knowledge at the time of summary judgment that gregerman had consistently maintained that he independently created his crystal angel,and the angel he sold to style was his own though identical to mag.mag offered no meaningful contrary evidence at trial.
at both the summary judgment and fees hearings,mag counsel muddied the district court understanding of the facts by describing the september letter from magnanimi to gregerman as a licensing agreement and asserting that gregerman had agreed to sell mag angel.there is no evidence that gregerman agreed to sell mag angel rather than his own,and counsel assertion at the fees hearing that gregerman testified that he sold the mag piece to style we have on statements taken out of context.mag counsel skillfully prepared the gregerman affidavit to create that same ambiguity about gregerman sales to style,despite the company awareness that gregerman at all times insisted that he sold only his own design.
mag may well have revealed its hand in this litigation when its coun
