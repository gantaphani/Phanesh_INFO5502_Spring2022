background 
asi is a publisher that facilitates the meeting of purveyors and purchasers of corporate promotional products asi has approximately distributor members and supplier members.through its affiliate,the asi show,asi holds roughly shows per year throughout the united states.of these,five are major,or,shows that are held in chicago,dallas,las vegas,new york and orlando.the chicago show has been held in may or july every year since.both asi and the asi show are owned by the cohn family.matthew cohn cohn is the vice chairman of asi and president of the asi show.
the present case involves asi relationship with and national premium show,nps,the latter of which does business as the motivation show.is the exhibition manager for this show,which is held annually in the fall at mccormick place in chicago.peter erickson erickson is the president and sole shareholder of.he is also vice president and sole shareholder of nps.
on february,the motivation show entered into an agreement with asi that purported to create a strategic alliance.the contract created a obligation on the parties jointly to operate a pavilion within the motivation show.asi sought to benefit its members by exposing them to,as well as to promotion and advertising agencies.for its part,the motivation show stood to gain additional exhibitors and booths representing distributors and suppliers to sell products to.paragraph nine of the agreement,which bestowed upon asi the right of first refusal concerning any activity,alliance,or opportunity concerning the promotional specialty industry,is of central importance to the present appeal.the contract provided that it would be subject to pennsylvania law.paragraph eight stated that the agreement would not be extended to any other promotional products association,trade show,or conference,ppai.as noted,ppai is a close rival of asi.
the parties differ markedly in how they construe the events leading up to the present dispute.asi contends,and the district court agreed,that erickson solicited and invited ppai to its trade show with the motivation show at mccormick place in chicago.this,the district court found,violated paragraph nine of the contract because the motivation show failed to grant asi a right of first refusal over this opportunity,which the court determined to be in the industry.
the district court determined that the motivation show literally bent over backwards to make clear to all attendees at both shows that this was a joint endeavor,which was the attractive quality that enticed ppai to the.tr.at.judge grady further found that erickson and the motivation show sponsorship was central to ppai success in obtaining approval from the chicago convention and tourism bureau cctb to lease space in mccormick place in september.the district court also held that erickson failure to advise asi of his cooperation with ppai was deliberate and was designed to conceal from asi the fact that there was an opportunity in the offing.judge grady concluded that mr erickson knew that asi would be interested,and he had every reason to believe that had he offered the opportunity to asi,asi would have been likely to accept it.indeed,he found that asi would have accepted such an offer,had it been forthcoming.unsurprisingly,asi fully supports these findings on appeal.
and nps present a more innocuous account.they appeal primarily to the testimony of erickson,who stated that he received an independent courtesy call from slagle,president and chief financial officer of ppai,who supposedly said that ppai was looking to move its trade show to a day period that would be near the motivation show.he observed that shows with similar audiences can impact each other negatively,as attendees will go to one,but not to both.based on this perceived fact,and given that ppai was apparently intent on coming,erickson testified that any detrimental impact could be eliminated by steering ppai to the motivation show.indeed,by persuading ppai to come to mccormick place on the same dates,he asserted that there could be a very positive impact for the motivation show and for the asi pavilion.tr.at.he further stated that he provided the cctb,at ppai request,with information that the motivation show and ppai were not competitive.id.at.this was information that the cctb deemed relevant in determining whether ppai was entitled to a permit.erickson concluded that he did not believe that anything he had done breached the motivation show agreement with asi.
the district court rejected erickson testimony,characterizing it as just regrettably false and further labeling certain of his explanations as completely untruthful.judge grady readily concluded that the was an opportunity for the purpose of paragraph nine.the district court thus found that the motivation show had violated its contract by failing to make available to asi the opportunity to exercise its right of first refusal.
however,despite concluding that the defendants were in breach of contract,the district court found that asi had failed to prove damages with reasonable certainty.although it reached this conclusion without addressing the factual record in great depth,the district court did note that in view of its attitude toward the defendants breach,it would not be reluctant to make a reasonable estimate of damages if it believed that it could do so.
in the present appeal,asi contends that the district court committed clear error in finding that damages had not been proven with reasonable certainty.the motivation show judge grady liability determination.
ii.discussion 
a.the defendants decision not to invite asi to the motivation show constituted a breach of contract 
the motivation show advances four unconvincing arguments why it did not breach its contract with asi.in the first place,it contends that it had neither the authority nor the ability to control the issuance of dates at mccormick place.thus,the motivation show contends,it could not have offered asi a right of first refusal as a matter of law.second,it argues that it had no control over ppai decision to relocate.third,it submits that asi could not have accepted an offer to put on a trade show.last,it argues that the provision in the contract did not apply to the production of trade shows.none of these contentions has merit.
as to the first point,it may be true that the defendants lacked an absolute legal right to dictate the issuance of dates by the cctb.but the record reveals that the defendants had significant,de facto influence over the cctb issuing ppai a september date in to with the motivation show.the district court did not clearly err in finding as a fact that the success of ppai in obtaining a september date in to with the motivation show was due,in large part,to the sponsorship of erickson and the motivation show.tr.at.it also properly found that without that sponsorship,without that cooperation,it is not at all clear that the bureau or the building would have approved a september date for ppai.id.since that same influence could have been employed for asi benefit,and would surely have resulted in the cctb similarly approving a for asi,the district court did not err in holding that the provision in the contract was triggered by the opportunity.
the defendants second argument is that ppai alone had control over its decision to move its event to coincide with the motivation show.the defendants rely on the testimony of erickson,who stated that he could not prevent ppai or any other trade show from moving to mccormick place.we note at the first instance that the district court found his testimony to be entirely lacking in credibility,completely untruthful and regrettably false.tr.at.we are especially deferential to determinations by district courts,since they enjoy a superior setting in which to make such findings.see united states,cir united states garcia,cir.in any event,the idea that ppai could act independently of the motivation show in securing dates at mccormick place is in itself irrelevant.the district found that without the motivation show cooperative effort,ppai would not have been interested in any.tr.at.ultimately,the district court did not clearly err in finding that erickson solicited and invited ppai to avail itself of the opportunity.id.the defendants present argument that ppai decision to was an independent action is inconsistent with the district court reasonable fact findings and credibility determinations.
the motivation show next submits that asi,the signatory to the contract,does not hold or produce trade shows and therefore could not accept a offer.this argument is borderline frivolous.there is no reason why a promisee can not avail of an opportunity to which it is contractually entitled by contracting in turn with a third party,most obviously the asi show in the present case.tr.at.
last,we fully agree with the district court determination that paragraph nine of the contract applied to the production of trade shows.the defendants argue that the parties could not have intended that this provision could have extended to anything beyond the ambit of the motivation show.but pennsylvania law provides that,where the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous,the intent of the parties is to be ascertained from the document itself.see insurance adjustment bureau,allstate ins,chen chen.reviewing the contract de novo,we conclude that paragraph nine is clear and unambiguous when read in light of the contract as a whole.the defendants argument that paragraph nine is limited to activities taking place within the ambit of the motivation show is based on the fact that other provisions in the contract are similarly limited by their explicit terms.but the district court correctly noted that the absence of such language in paragraph nine is highly instructive.that paragraph provision that asi is entitled to a right of first refusal with respect to any activity,alliance,or opportunity concerning the promotional specialty industry clearly captures the opportunity that the motivation show provided to asi close competitor.we agree with the district court that it would do violence to the contract to interpret it in any other way.tr.at.
b.the district court did not commit clear error in determining that asi failed to prove damages with reasonable certainty 
the district court concluded in no uncertain terms that asi had failed to establish damages with reasonable certainty.although its finding was not clearly erroneous,we are concerned that the court may have overstated the inadequacy of the proffered evidence.having reviewed the record,we believe that the question whether asi has made a sufficient showing of damages is a close one.nevertheless,given our review,the question is not what we would find were we sitting at the trial level.see lever northwestern,cir jones hamelman,cir.we must affirm if the district court account of the evidence is plausible viewed in light of the record in its entirety.see id.since a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the proffered evidence falls short of proving damages with reasonable specificity,we affirm.
we begin by noting that the district court correctly identified relevant pennsylvania law,which provides that contract damages are not recoverable for loss beyond an amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable certainty.spang steel,relying on restatement second of contracts.in considering whether the district court clearly erred in finding that asi failed to prove damages with reasonable certainty,we note that pennsylvania law generally resolves doubts against the breaching party.id.at citing restatement.we note too the pennsylvania supreme court pronouncement in that mere uncertainty as to the amount of damages will not bar recovery where it is clear that damages were the certain result of the defendant conduct.pugh holmes.notwithstanding this language,which might be read to relieve victims of contractual breach of the obligation of identifying actual damages with reasonable certainty,so long as they can demonstrate that they were in fact injured,the law still requires a plaintiff to produce evidence which establishes,with a fair degree of probability,a basis for assessing damages.wujick yorktowne dental associates.
we proceed by discussing the district court analysis of the relevant testimony and explaining some of our concerns in particular,we question the court characterization of cohn testimony,which provided the plaintiff primary evidence for establishing damages.the court declared 
i do know that cohn testimony,which ranges from a half million to a million dollars without any specification whatever as to what would account for a difference between a half million and a million,is completely speculative and is not something that the court could rely upon for an award of damages.
we believe that three issues merit discussion here.first,having reviewed the transcript of cohn testimony,it is indeed true that the witness estimation of damages ranged from to and even beyond.cohn originally maintained that the relevant damages range was to.tr.at.this,being a narrower band,may have been less troubling to the district court.nevertheless,in light of the testimony of david former employee of the.cohn subsequently concluded that his original,estimated range was extremely conservative.id.at.on,cohn clarified that the range of damages was linked to the number of booths asi would have sold at the event with the motivation show.he testified that booths would have yielded a profit of dollars.he also explained that booths would correspond to over a million dollars profit.id.at.
for this reason,we are troubled by the district court assertion that cohn failed to provide any specification whatever to explain the range of estimated damages.his testimony made clear that that range depended on the court estimate as to the likely number of booths that asi would have sold.cohn also indicated that the figure was based on the lowest level of profit that asi had ever enjoyed when it sold the same number of booths that ppai did at the event.he testified that asi show in philadelphia,which was a show,yielded more than in profit.tr.at.he then explained that frankly,we would have done better than that in the event with the motivation show because we would have had shared costs that we would not have needed to spend the money on.id.at.he testified that asi would not need to have spent as much money on a keynote speaker and that the it spent on education in philadelphia mostly would have been saved.id.at.
reviewing the transcript,we do not understand the district court conclusion that cohn testimony did not provide any specification whatever about the range of damages.it seems clear to us that cohn believed that was an extremely conservative minimum and that a more accurate estimate of damages would be greater.tr.at.
our second concern is that the record suggests a slight possibility that the district court may have decided that cohn testimony on damages was speculative before it entertained the evidence.we direct our attention to this particular exchange during the direct examination of cohn,when the question of quantifying damages was first broached
