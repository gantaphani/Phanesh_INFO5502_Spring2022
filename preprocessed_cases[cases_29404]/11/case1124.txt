freecyclesunnyvale fs is a member group of the freecycle network tfn,an organization devoted to facilitating the recycling of goods.fs filed a declaratory action against tfn arising from a trademark licensing dispute,alleging noninfringement of tfn trademarks and tortious interference with fs business relations.fs moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether its naked licensing defense to trademark infringement allowed it to avoid a finding of infringement as a matter of law tfn argued that it had established adequate quality control standards over its licensees services and use of the trademarks to avoid a finding of naked licensing and abandonment of its trademarks.the district court granted summary judgment to fs.we hold that tfn did not retain express contractual control over fs quality control measures,did not have actual controls over fs quality control measures,and was unreasonable in relying on fs quality control measures.because we find that tfn engaged in naked licensing and thereby abandoned its trademarks,we affirm.
in march,deron beal beal founded tfn,an umbrella arizona corporation dedicated to freecycling.the term freecycling combines the words free and recycling and refers to the practice of giving an unwanted item to a stranger so that it can continue to be used for its intended purpose,rather than disposing of it as practiced by tfn,freecycling is primarily a local activity conducted by means of internet groups,which are created by volunteers through online service providers like groups and google groups although not required to do so,most tfn member groups use groups as a forum for members to coordinate their freecycling activities.tfn also maintains its own website,which provides a directory of member groups as well as resources for volunteers to create new groups.the website also includes a section devoted to etiquette guidelines.
tfn asserts that it maintains a freecycle ethos a democratic leadership structure,in which decisions are made through a process of surveys and discussions among volunteer moderators.local volunteer moderators are responsible for enforcing tfn rules and policies,but the moderators have flexibility in enforcement depending on the moderators assessment of their local communities.since may,tfn has been using three trademarks,freecycle,the freecycle network,and a logo collectively the trademarks to identify tfn services and to identify member groups affiliation with tfn.federal registration of the trademarks is currently pending in the united states,but the trademarks have been registered in other countries.tfn permits member groups to use the trademarks.when tfn first started,beal personally regulated the use of the trademarks but,as tfn has grown,it has relied on local moderators to regulate member groups use of the trademarks.
lisanne abraham abraham founded fs on october,in sunnyvale,california,without tfn knowledge or involvement.she established the group by entering into a service contract with groups and becoming the group moderator.upon establishing fs,abraham adapted etiquette guidelines and instructions for how to use fs from either tfn or one of tfn member group website.on october,abraham emailed beal directly asking for a logo for fs,and they spoke over the phone within days of the email communication.after the phone conversation,beal emailed abraham on october,stating you can get the neutral logo from,just do use it for commercial purposes or you sic maybe mark or albert can help you to do your own fancy schmancy logo this email is the only record of a direct communication between fs and tfn regarding the use of any of the trademarks.
between october,and october,fs was added to tfn list of online freecycling groups displayed on tfn website.then,on october,abraham received an email from beal addressed to nineteen moderators of new freecycle groups which,among other things,welcomed them to tfn.the email did not discuss or include any restrictions or guidance on the use of tfn trademarks.on october,abraham received another email from tfn,this time an invitation to join the freecyclemodsquad group modsquad group,an informal discussion forum exclusively for the moderators of freecycle groups to share ideas.
before,tfn had only a few suggested guidelines in the etiquette section of its website,including a keep it free rule.then,on january,beal sent an email to the modsquad group,asking whether tfn should also limit listed items to those that were legal.ultimately,beal proposed the adoption of a keep it free,legal appropriate for all ages rule and asked that all moderators vote on whether they feel this is the one rule that should apply to all local groups or not.between january and january,a majority of the modsquad group voted to require all local groups to adopt the rule and,on january,beal informed the group that i glad to say we now have one true guiding principle.although the moderators adopted the keep it free,legal appropriate for all ages rule,following its adoption,they frequently discussed what the actual meaning of the rule was and,ultimately,its definition and enforcement varied from group to group.
although the underlying reason is not evident from the record or the parties briefs,on november and november,tfn sent emails to fs ordering the group to cease and desist using the freecycle name and logo and threatening to have terminate fs group if fs did not comply.on november,fs emailed and disputed tfn ability to forbid the use of the trademarks by informing of the license that tfn allegedly had granted fs in october,beal october,email authorizing abraham to use the logo.on november,terminated the fs group at tfn request,after receiving a claim from tfn that fs was infringing on tfn trademark rights.
on january,fs filed a declaratory judgment action against tfn in the district court for the northern district of california,alleging noninfringement of tfn trademarks and tortious interference with fs business relations.tfn brought counterclaims for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the lanham act and california business and professions code section.
fs then moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether its naked licensing defense to trademark infringement allowed it to avoid a finding of infringement as a matter of law.fs argued that tfn had abandoned its trademarks because it engaged in naked licensing when it granted fs the right to use the trademarks without either the right to control or the exercise of actual control over fs activities.on march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fs,holding that tfn engaged in naked licensing and therefore abandoned its rights to the trademarks.the parties stipulated to dismiss the remaining claims,and final judgment was entered on may.tfn thereafter timely filed its appeal.

in ruling on a motion for summary judgment,our inquiry necessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits.id.at.we have held that the proponent of a naked license theory of trademark abandonment must meet a stringent standard of proof.barcamerica,at internal quotation marks omitted see also prudential ins.of am.gibraltar fin.of cal,cir abandonment of a trademark,being in the nature of forfeiture,must be strictly proved.edwin williams edwin williams.cir a person who asserts insufficient control of a trademark must meet a high burden of proof.
we have yet to determine,however,whether this high standard of proof requires clear and convincing evidence or a preponderance of the evidence.see electro source,llc group,cir reserving the issue of the standard of proof to show trademark abandonment,but noting that at least one district court in the ninth circuit had required clear and convincing evidence.indeed,in grocery outlet albertson,cir per curiam,judges wallace and mckeown disagreed in separate concurrences as to which standard applies.judge wallace advocated the clear and convincing standard,while judge mckeown argued that the preponderance of the evidence standard applied.id.
a review of our sister circuits decisions reveals that only two circuits have considered which standard to apply,with one reserving the issue and the other adopting a preponderance of the evidence standard.see cumulus media,clear channel commcn,cir declining to address the meaning of strict burden because the outcome of the case would be the same with either standard of proof cerveceria centroamericana,cerveceria india,adopting the preponderance of the evidence standard.most published lower court decisions that have reached this issue appear to have interpreted the strictly proven standard to require clear and convincing evidence of naked licensing.see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed 
here,we need not decide which standard of proof applies because,even applying the higher standard of and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to tfn as the party,fs has demonstrated that tfn engaged in naked licensing and consequently abandoned the trademarks.
an introduction to naked licensing of trademarks is in order,as this issue has seldom arisen in this circuit or in our sister circuits.our only discussion of this subject is in barcamerica,at holding that barcamerica,a vintner,engaged in naked licensing and abandoned its trademark by failing to retain or otherwise exercise adequate quality control over the trademark it had licensed to another company,and that decision informs and guides our discussion here.
as a general matter,trademark owners have a duty to control the quality of their trademarks.mccarthy.it is that a trademark owner may grant a license and remain protected provided quality control of the goods and services sold under the trademark by the licensee is maintained.barcamerica,at quoting moore bus.forms,ryu,cir.
naked licensing occurs when the licensor fails to exercise adequate quality control over the licensee.id.at.naked licensing may result in the trademark ceasing to function as a symbol of quality and a controlled source.id.citing mccarthy.we have previously declared that naked licensing is inherently deceptive and constitutes abandonment of any rights to the trademark by the licensor.id.at.consequently,where the licensor fails to exercise adequate quality control over the licensee,a court may find that the trademark owner has abandoned the trademark,in which case the owner would be estopped from asserting rights to the trademark.id.at quoting moore,at.
at issue here is whether there is clear and convincing evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to tfn,that tfn allowed fs to use the trademarks with so few restrictions as to compel a finding that tfn engaged in naked licensing and abandoned the trademarks.tfn contends that disputed issues of material fact remain as to whether tfn quality control standards,during the relevant time period,were sufficient.although tfn concedes that it did not have an express license agreement,it alleges that a reasonable jury could find that it had adequate quality control measures in place when fs was authorized to use the trademarks,making summary judgment inappropriate.
when deciding summary judgment on claims of naked licensing,we first determine whether the license contained an express contractual right to inspect and supervise the licensee operations.see barcamerica,at.the absence of an agreement with provisions restricting or monitoring the quality of goods or services produced under a trademark supports a finding of naked licensing.id.at see also stanfield osborne,cir granting summary judgment where license agreement lacked right to inspect or supervise licensee operations and gave the licensee sole discretion to design the trademark.
tfn concedes that it did not have an express license agreement with fs regarding fs use of the trademarks.without an express license agreement,tfn necessarily lacks express contractual rights to inspect and supervise fs.however,tfn argues that the october,email,in which beal advised abraham that you can get the neutral logo from,just do use it for commercial purposes,reflects an implied license.emphasis added.
even assuming that beal emailed admonition to abraham not to use the trademarks for commercial purposes constitutes an implied licensing agreement,it contained no express contractual right to inspect or supervise fs services and no ability to terminate fs license if fs used the trademarks for commercial purposes.see barcamerica,at determining that a license agreement lacking similar controls was insufficient.we therefore hold that,by tfn own admission,there is no disputed issue of material fact as to whether tfn maintained an express contractual right to control quality.
tfn next contends that,despite its lack of an express contractual right to control quality,a material issue of fact remains as to whether tfn maintained actual control over its member groups services and use of the trademarks when fs was granted use of the trademarks in october.the lack of an express contract right to inspect and supervise a licensee operations is not conclusive evidence of lack of control.barcamerica,at.however,where courts have excused the lack of a contractual right to control quality,they have still required that the licensor demonstrate actual control through inspection or supervision.see,stanfield,at the absence of an express contractual right of control does not necessarily result in abandonment of a mark,as long as the licensor in fact exercised sufficient control over its licensee.
tfn asserts that it exercised actual control over the trademarks because it had several quality control standards in place,specifically the keep it free,legal,and appropriate for all ages standard and tfn incorporation of the groups service terms the services requirement expressed in beal october,email the etiquette guidelines listed on tfn website and tfn freecycle ethos which,tfn contends,establishes policies and procedures for member groups,even if local member groups are permitted flexibility in how to apply those policies and procedures.in addition,tfn cites birthright birthright.for the principle that loosely organized like tfn and fs that share the common goals of a public service organization are subject to less stringent quality control requirements.
first,we disagree with tfn contentions that the keep it free,legal,and appropriate for all ages standard and its incorporation of the groups service terms constituted actual controls over its member groups the undisputed evidence showed that tfn licensees were not required to adopt the keep it free,legal,and appropriate for all ages standard,nor was it uniformly applied or interpreted by the local groups.similarly,fs was not required to use groups and was not asked to agree to the groups service terms as a condition of using tfn trademarks.moreover,the groups service terms,which regulate generic online activity like sending spam messages and prohibiting harassment,can not be considered quality controls over tfn member groups services and use of the trademarks.the service terms apply to every group,and do not control the quality of the freecycling services that tfn member groups provide.thus,the keep it free,legal and appropriate for all ages standard and the groups service terms were not quality controls over fs use of the trademarks.
second,we conclude that tfn requirement says nothing about the quality of the services provided by member groups and therefore does not establish a control requiring member groups to maintain consistent quality.thus,it is not an actual control in the trademark context.third,because member groups may freely adopt and adapt tfn listed rules of etiquette and because of the voluntary and amorphous nature of th
