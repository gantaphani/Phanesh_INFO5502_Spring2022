these two consolidated appeals concern a real estate mortgage investment scheme perpetrated by debtors,first investment,ftd and joint development,jdi the trustee of their consolidated chapter bankruptcy estates,appellee todd neilson the trustee,filed an adversary action against defendants,investors in ftd alleging that collateral notes and trust deeds security instruments assigned by ftd to defendants as security for their investments did not perfect their interests because defendants did not have possession of the security instruments.
twenty years ago,in a case with facts very similar to those here,we held that such security interests could not be perfected under california law without actual possession of the security instruments.see greiner wilke in re staff mortgage inv,cir staff mortgage citing cal.more than a decade later,the california legislature created an exception to this rule by enacting california business and professions code,which,under limited circumstances,permits perfection without possession of the security instruments.
at issue here is whether the exception created by applies to the transactions between defendants and ftd,such that defendants security interests are deemed perfected.the bankruptcy court found that applies and granted summary judgment in favor of those defendants who filed an answer in the adversary proceeding answering defendants.the district court reversed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.we hold that applies to defendants security interests,and therefore the trustee attempt to avoid defendants priority status must fail.we also reject the trustee argument that we should impose a constructive trust to circumvent.accordingly,we reverse in case chang appeal.
in a related appeal,case appeal from default judgments,defendants who defaulted in the adversary proceeding defaulting defendants challenge the bankruptcy court entry of final default judgments under federal rule of civil procedure b.defaulting defendants argue that the final default judgments were inconsistent with the bankruptcy court earlier summary judgment ruling that answering defendants security interests were deemed perfected under.because we hold that applies to the investor transactions at issue here,we conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion and reverse the judgment of the district court with instructions to reverse the entry of final default judgments.
factual background 
prior to its involuntary bankruptcy,ftd was in the business of investing in real estate mortgages.it initiated and purchased home loans evidenced by collateral notes and secured by trust deeds on real property owned by the borrowers borrowers.
ftd financed its investment scheme with approximately million borrowed from hundreds of individual investors,typically immigrants in southern california investors.ftd secured its loans from investors by assigning to them the collateral notes and trust deeds security instruments from its home loan portfolio.ftd recorded the assignments with the county recorder where the property was located,but ftd maintained possession at all times of the collateral notes and trust deeds 
additionally,ftd entered into a servicing agreement with each investor that authorized ftd,as a real estate broker acting as a servicing agent,to collect all loan payments from borrowers and to take other actions necessary or convenient to servicing of the note.while many investors at the time mistakenly believed they had actually purchased the trust deeds,defendants accept,for purposes of this appeal,that they were merely assigned the trust deeds in a security transaction 
ftd,in violation of california law,commingled funds received from investors and borrowers,using funds from any source for any and all purposes to continue its operations.ftd frequently used payments from one investor to pay interest and other payments to another classic ponzi scheme.
the investment scheme ultimately unraveled.petitions for involuntary bankruptcy against ftd and jdi were filed under chapter of the bankruptcy code on october,and november,respectively.the cases were subsequently consolidated and converted to chapter proceedings in april.appellee todd neilson was appointed as trustee to manage the consolidated bankruptcy estates.
ii.procedural history 
chang appeal 
seeking to treat all creditors on an equal basis for asset distribution,the trustee filed an adversary action in bankruptcy court against of the investors who held recorded assignments of specific trust deeds defendants.the trustee alleged that defendants security interests were unperfected under california law because defendants never obtained possession of the original collateral notes or trust deeds.under a,unperfected security interests are avoidable and can be relegated to the status of general unsecured claims.in this way,the trustee sought to prevent defendants from receiving priority in the distribution of ftd and jdi assets.
on for summary judgment with respect to of the answering defendants,the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment on january,in their favor and against the trustee.the bankruptcy court held that the transactions between ftd and answering defendants fell within the scope of and thus,although they lacked actual possession of the security instruments,answering defendants interests were deemed perfected.chang,at.
because the issue of perfection under was of such importance to the entire adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court entered a final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the trustee appealed to the district court.the district court reversed,holding that the transactions at issue were not within the scope of.
appeal of default judgments 
on april,prior to entry of summary judgment for answering defendants,the trustee moved for entry of default and default judgment against the defaulting defendants who had not answered the complaint in the above adversary proceeding the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion,but the interlocutory order was not appealable.
in may,four months after the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment for answering defendants,the trustee moved to certify the default judgments as final under federal rule of civil procedure b.defaulting defendants objected to entry of final judgments because the judgments were inconsistent with the bankruptcy court earlier summary judgment ruling,holding that the security interests of answering defendants were perfected under.chang,at.in granting the trustee motion to certify,the bankruptcy court stated in the final default judgments that the defaulting defendants failed to perfect their security interest in the collateral notes and deeds of trust by failing to obtain possession of same.notwithstanding defaulting defendants objections to the inconsistent rulings,the bankruptcy court entered the final judgments on june.
defaulting defendants appealed the entry of the final default judgments to the district court,which affirmed,citing its contemporaneous ruling reversing the bankruptcy court on the applicability of to answering defendants.
iii.discussion 
chang appeal 
defendants contend that applies to their loan transactions with ftd,and under the provisions of that statute,their security interests are deemed perfected.they seek reversal of the district court decision to the contrary.

relying on the text of the statute and established rules of statutory construction under california law,we conclude that applies to the loan transactions in question,and accordingly,that defendants security interests are deemed perfected.the statute legislative history provides further support for our conclusion.
section of the bankruptcy code,the clause,grants a trustee in bankruptcy the rights and powers of a hypothetical creditor who obtained a judicial lien on all of the property in the estate at the date the petition in bankruptcy was filed.in re commercial fin,cir citing a.one of these powers is the ability to take priority over or avoid security interests that are unperfected under applicable state law id.avoiding such interests relegates them to the status of a general unsecured claim.see collier on bankruptcy,lawrence king,ed.
the general rule in california requires the secured party to take possession of the security instrument in order to perfect the security interest.cal.section,enacted in through california senate bill,creates an exception to the normal rule requiring possession in certain types of transactions involving real estate brokers.cal.legis.serv.ch.west.section deems a security interest perfected,without possession of the security instruments,provided five requirements are met a broker,acting within the meaning of california business and professions code or possesses the security instrument the broker has arranged a loan or sold a promissory note or any interest therein the broker undertakes to service the promissory note the trust deed or collateral documents in favor of the lender are recorded in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the security property is located and the note is made payable to the lender or is endorsed or assigned to the purchaser.
the trustee does not dispute that the transactions between ftd and defendants satisfy requirements one,three,four,and five.the trustee concedes that ftd is a real estate broker within the meaning of and.the only dispute concerns whether ftd arranged a loan or sold a promissory note or any interest therein in its transactions with investors.
with the exception of the bankruptcy and district courts below,no state or federal court has had occasion to interpret.we therefore apply california rules of statutory construction.see fed.sav.loan ins.butler,cir construing cal.civil code.california code of civil procedure provides that i n the construction of a statute the intention of the legislature is to be pursued,if possible.the california supreme court has declared that the ultimate task in statutory interpretation is to ascertain the legislature intent.people massie,cal th,d,cert.denied,d.ordinarily,the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent.pacific gas county of stanislaus,cal th,d.courts should give the language of the statute its usual,ordinary import and accord significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose,fair employment hous.comm n,cal d.when the wording of the statute is ambiguous,however,a court may consider extrinsic evidence of the legislature intent,including the statutory scheme of which the provision is a part,the history and background of the statute,the apparent purpose,and any considerations of constitutionality.hughes bd.of architectural exam rs,cal th,d.
the critical issue for our purposes in interpreting concerns the application of to this statute,and specifically,its application to the word sold as used in sold a promissory note or any interest therein in.section provides,in relevant part 
a real estate broker within the meaning of this part is also a person who engages as a principal in the business of buying from,selling to,or exchanging with the public,real property sales contracts or promissory notes secured directly or collaterally by liens on real property,or who makes agreements with the public for the collection of payments or for the performance of services in connection with real property sales contracts or promissory notes secured directly or collaterally by liens on real property.
as used in this section,sale,resale,and exchange include every disposition of any interest in a real property sales contract or promissory note secured directly or collaterally by a lien on real property,except the original issuance of a promissory note by a borrower or a real property sales contract by a vendor,either of which is to be secured directly by a lien on real property owned by the borrower or vendor.
we agree with the trustee that the generally accepted definition of sale does not include the assignment of a security interest.see milana credit disc,cal d,golden state lanes fox,d,black law dictionary ed a sale is distinguished from a mortgage,in that the former is a transfer of the absolute property in the goods for a price,whereas a mortgage is at most a conditional sale of property as security for the payment of a debt or performance of some other obligation,subject to the condition that on performance title shall revest in the mortgagor.
nonetheless,provides an expansive definition of sale,which include s every disposition of any interest in a real property sales contract or promissory note secured directly or collaterally by a lien on real property emphasis added.we previously have held that this definition of sale includes the assignment of security interests by a real estate broker to investors.see lucas thomas in re thomas,cir transaction by which investors in sole proprietorship delivered money to owner of proprietorship,a licensed real estate broker,in exchange for which broker issued promissory notes secured by deeds of trust on two condominiums that broker owned is a sale within meaning of.
the outcome of this case turns on which definition of sale or sold the california legislature intended to adopt when it included the phrase sold a promissory note or any interest therein in if it intended to adopt the conventional definition of sold and thus limit the application of exclusively to the term broker in,then would not apply to ftd assignment of security interests to defendants.consequently,defendants interests would be unperfected under california law,and the trustee could avoid them under.if,however,the legislature intended to adopt the more expansive definition of sale from,then would apply to the assignment of security interests,rendering defendants interests perfected and therefore not avoidable by the trustee.
statutory language 
the text of suggests that it adopts the definitions of both broker and sold provided by.section states,in relevant part when a broker,acting within the meaning of subdivision d or e of section or section,has arranged a loan or sold a promissory note or any interest therein.although placement of the clause immediately after broker might normally indicate that the clause modifies only this term,use of the words acting within suggests that and apply not only to define broker but also to define the type of broker,arranged a loan or sold a promissory note or any interest therein covered by.
we see no reason why the california legislature would incorporate two different definitions of sold into a broad one to define broker and a narrow one to define the type of broker transactions covered under the statute.i t is generally presumed that when a word is used in a particular sense in one part of a statute,it is intended to have the same meaning if it appears in another part of the same statute.people dillon,cal d.it follows that the legislature intended to use a single definition of sale throughout,as applied to both the term broker and the term sold.
we find unconvincing the trustee argument that the restrictive language of as used in this section limits the expansive definition of sale to broker.such restrictive language can not bar a newer statute,such as,from incorporating through reference the definition in an older statute.see collection bureau rumsey,cal th,d,if conflicting statutes can not be reconciled,later enactments supersede earlier ones here,the california legislature use of the phrase acting within the meaning of or evidences its intent to use the same definition throughout.
we also reject the trustee argument that the expansive definition of sale would render the terms arranged a loan and sold a promissory note superfluous.without these terms,all types of broker transactions would be included within the scope of,including situations where a broker services a note without having participated in the origination,assignment,or sale of the note.the terms arran
