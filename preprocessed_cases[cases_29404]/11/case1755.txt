tomatoes extraordinaire,dba specialty produce specialty sued wellington,dba jack la jolla jack and its controlling officer,william berkley,for failure to pay outstanding invoices for produce supplied by specialty to jack.after a court trial,berkley was found personally liable for specialty damages.this personal liability was based on the perishable agricultural commodities act paca,which regulates qualifying transactions in the produce industry.
on appeal,berkley raises an issue of statutory interpretation,arguing that specialty did not establish that jack was a produce dealer within the meaning of paca to support the imposition of personal liability permitted under paca.we agree,and reverse the judgment.
background 
specialty,a produce seller,incurred damages when jack failed to pay for produce it received from specialty,and then went out of business specialty filed an action against jack,as well as against berkley in his individual capacity,to recover the monies owed for the produce.specialty alleged that berkley was personally liable for jack debts under two theories berkley had provided a personal guarantee to specialty and jack was a dealer within the meaning of paca and hence the paca provisions which allow imposition of personal liability on corporate officers who were controlling the operations of the produce buyer applied to berkley.
specialty obtained a default judgment against jack.as to berkley individual liability,the trial court rejected specialty personal guarantee claim,but ruled in its favor on the paca claim.based on the ruling under paca,specialty obtained a judgment against berkley in his personal capacity for jack debts.
paca provisions apply to produce buyers who qualify as dealers.the dispute on appeal concerns the statutory definition of the term dealer.berkley argues that based on the plain language of the paca statute and accompanying regulations,there are two requirements for a produce buyer to qualify as a dealer a threshold requirement,showing that the produce buyer purchased produce in wholesale or jobbing quantities meaning at least one ton of produce in any day,and a supplementary requirement applied to retailers,showing that the produce buyer purchased more than worth of produce in any calendar year.specialty,on the other hand,argues that under a proper interpretation of the paca statute and relevant regulations,a produce retailer qualifies as a paca dealer if it meets the requirement,and that the requirement is inapplicable to retailers.
at trial,specialty was represented by counsel and berkley represented himself.specialty presented evidence relating to the requirement,and the court found this requirement had been met.specialty did not present evidence concerning the requirement,and neither party raised it as an issue.after the trial court entered the judgment in specialty favor,berkley filed motions to vacate and enter a new judgment or for a new trial.berkley now represented by counsel argued the judgment was legally erroneous because specialty had not established the requirement the trial court rejected berkley claim concerning the requirement and denied the motions.
on appeal,berkley reiterates his assertion that the trial court application of paca in this case was erroneous because specialty did not establish that jack met the requirement.as alternative arguments,he asserts there was insufficient evidence to support the court finding that jack met the requirement,and the amount of damages was erroneously calculated because the court failed to remove items in specialty bills to jack that were not perishable commodities under paca.
as we shall explain,we conclude that berkley interpretation of the paca statute is correct,a retailer must meet both the and requirements to qualify as a paca dealer.because specialty has not cited to anything in the record establishing that jack satisfied the requirement,the trial court erred in applying paca to impose personal liability on berkley and the judgment must be reversed.given our holding,we need not address berkley alternative arguments challenging the judgment.

relevant here,paca applies to produce buyers who meet the statutory definition of a dealer under the act.see magic restaurants,supra,at.paca defines a dealer as any person who buys or sells produce in wholesale or jobbing quantities,as defined by the secretary b,italics added.further,in an exceptions clause to section,the statute excludes retailers from the definition of a paca dealer until the invoice cost of his purchases of perishable agricultural commodities in any calendar year are in excess of.b b.section also states that a retailer who is excluded as a paca dealer under the exceptions clause may elect to secure a paca license,and during the term of the license the retailer will be considered a dealer.b.

specialty argues the requirement does not apply to retailers,and the only requirement to invoke paca for retailers is the requirement.in support,specialty contends that regulation m the regulation that mirrors the section statutory provision defining dealers reflects an intent to remove the wholesale or jobbing quantities requirement for retailers.specialty interpretation does not comport with the plain language of section,nor with the plain language of regulation m.
the language of section and accompanying regulation x is straightforward a paca dealer is a person who buys or sells produce in wholesale or jobbing quantities,which means at least one ton in any day,except if the person is a retailer the paca rules do not apply until the retailer annual produce invoices reach more than or the retailer elects to secure a paca license.that is,the retailer provision in section excludes retailers who would otherwise qualify as dealers based on the requirement,if their annual produce purchases are or below.or stated differently the retailer provision imposes a requirement that supplements the requirement by mandating that retailers have more than annual produce purchases to qualify them as dealers.there is nothing in section retailer provision that suggests it is a,alternative standard for retailers that replaces the threshold requirement that would oth
