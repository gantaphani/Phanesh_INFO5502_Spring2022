poweroasis,and poweroasis networks,llc poweroasis appeal the united states district court for the district of new hampshire grant of summary judgment that claims,and asserted claims of patent patent and patent are invalid as anticipated under b.in reaching its decision,the district court concluded that none of the asserted claims of the two patents were entitled,under,to the benefit of the filing date of poweroasis original application because the earlier application did not provide a written description of the invention claimed in the asserted patents,as required by.we affirm the grant of summary judgment of invalidity with respect to all asserted claims.
background 
the two poweroasis patents at issue,the patent and the patent poweroasis patents,are directed to vending machines that sell telecommunications access.the poweroasis patents contain virtually identical specifications.the stated purpose of the poweroasis patents is to provide a vending machine that enables a customer to connect a laptop to a telecommunications channel.the and patents list filing dates of november,and october,respectively.the and patents stem from a series of continuation and applications.the first application in the patent chain original application was filed on february,and ultimately issued as patent patent.poweroasis does not assert the patent in this litigation.
poweroasis filed a continuation application on september,which was later abandoned,and on june,it filed a application cip application,which issued as patent patent.the patent is not asserted by poweroasis in this litigation.the cip application added considerable new language to the specification,which the district court characterized as substantial new matter.poweroasis,usa,wl,at.
poweroasis subsequently filed the two applications that led directly to the two patents asserted in this suit first the patent,then the patent.poweroasis sued for patent infringement alleging that wireless hotspot network infringes claims,and of both poweroasis patents.each of the asserted claims depends from independent claim,which is not asserted by poweroasis.except for minor variations in the language of the independent claims that do not relate to the issues on appeal,the language of the asserted claims is identical in both poweroasis patents.independent claim recites 
a vending machine for vending telecommunications channel access to a customer,said vending machine comprising 
a payment mechanism for obtaining information from the customer to initiate a vending transaction 
a customer interface for indicating the status of said vending machine 
an electronic circuit for determining when the vending transaction is completed 
a telecommunications channel access circuit adapted to be connected to at least one external telecommunications channel for enabling access to the at least one external telecommunications channel at the beginning of a vending transaction and disabling access at the end of the vending transaction 
a telecommunications channel access connector connected to said telecommunications channel access circuit for enabling connection to an external telecommunications device of the customer and 
a control unit having a device for receiving payment information from the customer and for controlling said electronic circuit and said telecommunications channel access circuit.
the parties had agreed that customer interface is an interface that enables information to be passed between a human user and hardware or software components of a system,but disagreed about the location of the customer interface.poweroasis argued that the customer interface may occur on a customer laptop.argued that the customer interface must be located on the vending machine itself.relying entirely on new language added to the cip application,the district court adopted poweroasis proposed construction that the claim term customer interface encompasses an interface that is located on the customer laptop.
in light of the district court construction of customer interface,filed a motion for summary judgment that the asserted claims were anticipated by the mobilestar network.it is undisputed that prior to june,mobilestar networks,a company acquired by in developed,deployed,publicly used,and offered for sale the mobilestar network,which was a wireless data network that connected users to the internet.it is also undisputed that prior to june,the mobilestar network contained all of the same features that form the basis of poweroasis allegation that the hotspot network infringes its patents.argued,therefore,that this public use,sale,and offer for sale more than one year prior to the june,filing date of the cip application constituted b prior art which anticipated the poweroasis patents.b.poweroasis responded by claiming its asserted claims should have the benefit of priority going all the way back to the filing date of its original application february,which would antedate the mobilestar network.
on summary judgment,the district court determined that the asserted claims were not entitled to the priority date of the original application because the written description of the original application did not support the later issued claims.the district court noted that,to arrive at the broad construction it accorded the customer interface,it relied exclusively on the new matter that was added to the cip application.poweroasis,wl,at.because the district court concluded that the and patents are not entitled to the effective filing date of the original application,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment of invalidity.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.medrad.summary judgment is not appropriate if the dispute about a material fact is genuine,that is,if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
poweroasis appeals two aspects of the district court summary judgment determination.first,poweroasis argues that the district court erred when it placed the burden of proof on poweroasis to show that it is entitled to the priority date of the original application.second,poweroasis argues that the district court erred in concluding that the disclosure of the original application does not provide a written description adequate to support the asserted claims of the and patents.see.poweroasis contends that,at a minimum,there is a genuine issue of material fact which prevents summary judgment of invalidity.we consider each issue in turn.
burden of proof 
it is well established that a patent is presumed valid,and the burden of persuasion to the contrary is and remains on the party asserting invalidity.ralston purina.the district court acknowledged a challenged patent is entitled to a presumption of validity,but questioned whether the presumption of validity extends to the question of priority.the district court concluded that when a dispute arises concerning whether a cip patent is entitled to priority to the date of the original application and the patent office has not addressed the issue,the burden of proof ordinarily should rest with the party claiming priority to the date of the original application.poweroasis,wl,at.accordingly,the district court held that poweroasis had the burden of proving that it is entitled to claim priority to the filing date of the original application.id.
poweroasis contends that the party asserting invalidity must always bear the burden of proof as to whether claims in a patent application are entitled to the priority date of a parent application.poweroasis relies on this court decision in ralston for support of its position that the party attacking validity bears the burden to show that claims stemming from a cip application are not entitled to an earlier filing date.in short,poweroasis argues the presumption of validity should include a presumption that claims in a cip are all entitled to the earliest effective filing date in ralston,both the patent and trademark office pto and the board of patent appeals and interferences board made a priority determination.ralston purina.ralston involved an appeal related to patent,which issued from a continuation of application serial,filed december,cip application,which was a of application serial,filed july.id.at.in ralston,the cip application had been the subject of an interference,which awarded the inventor the benefit of his earliest application in a detailed opinion by the board.id.at.the district court in ralston properly accorded deference to the board decision on priority.see id.at.
additionally,the a prior art on which the defendant in ralston relied was brought to the attention of the examiner during prosecution.see id.at.when an attacker simply goes over the same ground travelled sic by the pto,part of the burden is to show that the pto was wrong in its decision to grant the patent.am.hoist derrick sowa sons,emphasis in original.this court has explained that 
when no prior art other than that which was considered by the pto examiner is relied on by the attacker,he has the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job,which includes one or more examiners who are assumed to have some expertise in interpreting the references and to be familiar from their work with the level of skill in the art and whose duty it is to issue only valid patents.
id.at.in ralston,accordingly,the defendant had the added burden of overcoming the deference due to the pto.
in contrast to ralston,in this case,the pto did not,at any point,make any determination with regard to the priority date of the various claims of the asserted patents.there was no interference in this case related to the asserted patents or the cip application that awarded poweroasis the benefit of priority for its original application nor was there any determination of priority during prosecution incident to a rejection.the mobilestar network prior art was never considered by the examiner.in fact,in this case the pto did not make a determination regarding the priority date for the asserted claims with respect to any reference.
in the absence of an interference or rejection which would require the pto to make a determination of priority,the pto does not make such findings as a matter of course in prosecution the pto own procedures indicate that examiners do not make priority determinations except where necessary 
unless the filing date of the earlier nonprovisional application is actually needed,for example,in the case of an interference or to overcome a reference,there is no need for the office to make a determination as to whether the requirement of,that the earlier nonprovisional application discloses the invention of the second application in the manner provided by the first paragraph of,is met and whether a substantial portion for all of the earlier nonprovisional application is repeated in the second application in a.
seventh ed.july,at.when neither the pto nor the board has previously considered priority,there is simply no reason to presume that claims in a cip application are entitled to the effective filing date of an earlier filed application.since the pto did not make a determination regarding priority,there is no finding for the district court to defer to.
of course,the fact that the mobilestar network prior art was never before the pto does not change the presumption of validity or who has the burden of proof with respect to the prima facie case of invalidity.see am.hoist,at,the party asserting invalidity,must still show by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted patent is invalid.once it has established a prima facie case of invalidity and its burden is met,the party relying on validity is then obligated to come forward with evidence to the contrary.ralston,at.
established its prima facie case of invalidity with respect to the asserted claims.it is undisputed that the mobilestar network was in public use more than one year prior to the june,filing date of the cip application.poweroasis conceded that the mobilestar network would infringe the claims of the and patents if it were in operation today.t hat which would literally infringe if later in time anticipates if earlier.schering geneva,internal citation omitted.accordingly,poweroasis has conceded that unless the asserted claims are accorded an earlier filing date than the cip application,the mobilestar network is b prior art.once established by clear and convincing evidence that the mobilestar network was b prior art to the asserted claims of the and patents,the burden was on poweroasis to come forward with evidence to the contrary.the district court therefore correctly placed the burden on poweroasis to come forward with evidence to prove entitlement to claim priority to an earlier filing date.
ii.written description requirement 
application of the written description requirement is central to the resolution of this appeal.it is elementary patent law that a patent application is entitled to the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed application only if the disclosure of the earlier application provides support for the claims of the later application,as required by.in re chu,see also augustine,gaymar,different claims of a cip application may therefore receive different effective filing dates subject matter that arises for the first time in a cip application does not receive the benefit of the filing date of the parent application.
to satisfy the written description requirement the disclosure of the prior application must convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that,as of the filing date sought,the inventor was in possession of the invention.mahurkar,emphasis in original.while a prior application need not contain precisely the same words as are found in the asserted claims,see eiselstein frank,purdue pharma lp faulding,holding that the disclosure does not have to provide in haec verba support in order to satisfy the written description requirement,the prior application must indicate to a person skilled in the art that the inventor was in possession of the invention as later claimed.ralston,at see also janice mueller,patent misuse through the capture of industry standards,berkeley tech,the written description requirement operates as a timing mechanism to ensure fair play in the presentation of claims after the original filing date and to guard against manipulation of that process by the patent applicant.entitlement to a filing date does not extend to subject matter which is not disclosed,but would be obvious over what is expressly disclosed.in re huston,quoting lockwood am.airlines.in lockwood,we held 
while the meaning of terms,phrases,or diagrams in a disclosure is to be explained or interpreted from the vantage point of one skilled in the art,all the limitations must appear in the specification.the question is not whether a claimed invention is an obvious variant of that which is disclosed in the specification.rather,a prior application itself must describe an invention,and do so in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude that the inventor invented the claimed invention as of the filing date sought.
at.we have explained that to satisfy the written description requirement,the missing descriptive matter must necessarily be present in the original application specification such that one skilled in the art would recognize such a disclosure.tronzo biomet,see also martin mayer,holding that the written description requirement is not a question of whether one skilled in the art might be able to construct the patentee device from the teachings of the disclosure rather,it is a question whether the application necessarily discloses that particular device emphasis in original.this requires that the written description actually or inherently disclose the claim element.see turbocare div.of demag delaval turbomachinery,holding that to comply with the written description requirement the location of the spring must be actually or inherently disclosed that the location may be obvious from the disclosure is not enough tronzo,at holding a claim invalid for failure to satisfy the written description requirement when the specification did not disclose all cup shapes lite
