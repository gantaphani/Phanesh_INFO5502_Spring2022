in a contest involving competing products claiming trademark priority,the district court determined,in order to acquire priority,a use in commerce means a lawful,a use compliant with federal labeling requirements.we agree.
background 
in the spring of,appellant creagri,creagri began selling olivenol,a dietary supplement containing an apparently beneficial antioxidant found in olives called hydroxytyrosol.at the time,olivenol label indicated that each tablet contained of hydroxytyrosol,the product primary active ingredient although the scientist who developed olivenol claimed no standardized method to accurately measure a substance hydroxytyrosol content was yet available,neither he nor creagri applied for an exemption from the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca labeling requirements due to this technological limitation apparently content with the results of creagri own testing and the testing done by two outside companies selected and paid for by creagri.
one year later,however,olivenol label had changed.it had been brought to creagri attention that its hydroxytyrosol measurement might be in error thus,creagri ordered further testing,which suggested that each olivenol tablet contained only of hydroxytyrosol.creagri changed the olivenol label accordingly its contention that a standardized measurement method was still failed to apply for an exemption from the fdca labeling requirements and,in fact,claimed on olivenol label that the measurement was hplc certified.
creagri now admits that each tablet contains at most of hydroxytyrosol and that olivenol was,therefore,inaccurately labeled in both instances.indeed,as a result of this prompted creagri to test olivenol again,using what olivenol developer admits to be a more accurate testing method than the methods previously label was again changed in february to accurately reflect the product contents by this time,creagri application to register olivenol on the principal register had been denied creagri october,amended application olivenol had been listed on the supplemental register 
on june,than a year after creagri began selling usana health sciences,usana filed an intent to use application with the patent and trademark office pto asserting that it intended to begin selling a series of vitamins,minerals,and nutritional supplements containing an ingredient called olivol,an olive extract containing apparently beneficial polyphenols.usana began selling these products in august,the pto granted usana application,and olivol is now listed on the principal register with a priority date of june,the present suit arises because,according to creagri,the name of usana olivol ingredient is confusingly similar to the name of its own olivenol product and,the june,priority date attached to olivol principal is infringing upon the trademark rights creagri acquired when it began selling olivenol more than a year earlier.
procedural history 
shortly after usana began distribution of its product,creagri brought an action for trademark infringement,unfair competition,unjust enrichment,and a number of related claims.usana counterclaimed requesting declaratory relief as to all of creagri claims,as well as cancellation of the olivenol mark from the supplemental register.
following briefing,the district court granted usana motion for summary judgment.the court concluded that,even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to creagri,the olivenol mark had not been lawfully used in commerce prior to usana priority prerequisite to all of creagri claims against usana.accordingly,the district court dismissed creagri claims,entered declaratory judgment in favor of usana on its counterclaims,and ordered olivenol cancelled from the supplemental register.creagri appeals this final judgment.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.klamath siskiyou wildlands ctr.boody,cir.for creagri to ultimately prevail on its trademark infringement claims,it must have acquired trademark rights to olivenol before usana had acquired trademark rights to olivol.see sengoku works rmc int l,cir it is axiomatic in trademark law that the standard test of ownership is priority of use.because olivol was registered on the principal register with a priority date of june,creagri does not challenge the lawfulness of that question becomes whether creagri had acquired trademark rights to olivenol prior to that date.see b r egistration of a mark upon the principal register shall be prima facie evidence of the registrant ownership of the mark,and of the registrant exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce.
if use in commerce were the only requirement for acquiring trademark rights then creagri would have an easier path to establishing priority of its mark because it began selling olivenol more than one year before usana intent to use application was filed.see a,requiring use in commerce to establish trademark rights cal.bus,mirroring federal law.
but the inquiry does not stop with use in commerce.it has long been the policy of the pto trademark trial and appeal board that use in commerce only creates trademark rights when the use is lawful.see,in re midwest tennis track,wl clorox,wl in re pepcom,wl in re stellar int l,wl.at least one circuit has adopted and applied this rule.see united phosphorus,midland fumigant,cir.a question of first impression in this circuit,we also agree with the pto policy and hold that only lawful use in commerce can give rise to trademark priority.
the rationale for this rule is twofold.first,as a logical matter,to hold otherwise would be to put the government in the anomalous position of extending the benefits of trademark protection to a seller based upon actions the seller took in violation of that government own laws.see in re stellar,at.it is doubtful that the trademark pursuant to congress power under the commerce clause was intended to recognize shipments in commerce in contravention of other regulatory acts promulgated by congress under that same constitutional provision.id.second,as a policy matter,to give trademark priority to a seller who rushes to market without taking care to carefully comply with the relevant regulations would be to reward the hasty at the expense of the diligent.
here,it is undisputed that,at all times prior to usana priority date,olivenol labels were not in compliance with the labeling requirements of g i and,thus,olivenol was being sold in violation of a,a prohibiting sale of misbranded food as determined by reference to the relevant regulations.by creagri own admission,each tablet sold under the olivenol name before june,contained,at most,of hydroxytyrosol,while olivenol label claimed that each tablet contained either or of this nutrient.g i,however,requires that the actual amount of a nutrient added to a product be at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label.because the actual amount of hydroxytyrosol at most was less than the values for hydroxytyrosol declared on olivenol labels and,creagri product was,at all relevant times,in violation of g i 
creagri seeks to avoid the consequences of its noncompliance in three ways first,by arguing that the nexus between its labeling violation and its use of the olivenol mark is too attenuated to justify depriving olivenol of trademark protection second,by contending that it was technologically infeasible to accurately measure the content of hydroxytyrosol when olivenol was mislabeled and that,because the regulations provide for an exemption in such circumstances,sale of olivenol was not actually unlawful and third,by asserting that its violation was not material,citing general mills,health valley foods,wl.we are not persuaded by these arguments.
the nexus requirement springs from decisions of the trademark trial and appeal board there must be some nexus between use of a mark and an alleged violation before it can be said that the unlawfulness of a sale or shipment has resulted in a trademark invalidity satinine societa in nome collettivo produits,wl kera,concurring general mills,at adopting this rule.creagri argues that its labeling violation was collateral to its use of the olivenol mar
