biltmore forest broadcasting fm,appeals an order of the federal communications commission awarding an fm radio station license to intervenor liberty productions,which was the high bidder in the auction of that license.biltmore and intervenor orion communications,each of which also bid,claim that liberty should have been disqualified because errors in liberty license application were not correctable after the auction and in its application liberty had misrepresented facts about its access to a transmitter site.because neither contention has merit,we affirm the order of the commission.
background 
in thirteen radio companies,including biltmore,liberty,and orion,filed applications with the commission for an fm station license in biltmore forest,north carolina.at that time the commission policy was to hold comparative hearings in order to determine the qualifications of the applicants and to decide which of the qualified applicants would best serve the public interest.an administrative law judge held such a hearing and determined that neither biltmore nor liberty had a reasonable assurance that a transmitter tower site was available to it,as the commission then required.the alj determined also that liberty had intentionally misrepresented facts about the availability of a site.communications,rcd,wl alj.
the following evidence was before the alj when he made his finding concerning liberty misrepresentation.valerie klemmer,the general partner behind liberty,certified that liberty had a reasonable assurance a certain site was available.klemmer,a neophyte in the broadcasting arena,testified before the alj that her certification was based upon a conversation she and a friend named tim warner had had on august,with vickey utter,the owner of a parcel of land near biltmore forest.warner had had prior dealings with utter in his capacity as an executive at wcqs,a public radio station in asheville.he also had experience certifying that an applicant had a reasonable assurance a site would be available to it.klemmer believed she had reached an agreement with utter on august.she made no plans to secure any other site for the tower in the event the deal with utter fell through.
utter consistently denied having made any deal with klemmer.in other respects,however,utter testimony was most inconsistent.in a february,affidavit she said she had no knowledge of klemmer or liberty and had never given klemmer or any other representative of liberty any assurance that her property would be available for a transmitter.indeed,she denied having spoken to anyone representing liberty.in a signed statement dated march,however,utter said that warner had reminded her that he and klemmer had visited her and that they had discussed leasing a portion of her land,but since klemmer never contacted me again i assumed she found some place more suitable for her project.later in march utter reiterated her position that she had never given klemmer any assurance the land would be available,explaining that i f we had discussed this or i had given her this assurance i certainly would have remembered and i would have been looking for her to make a commitment of some sort.
at a deposition in april,utter again recalled speaking with klemmer and warner,but she could not remember the details of the conversation.she did recall telling klemmer and warner about a lease she and brian lee,a representative of orion,had executed on august,for the use of a portion of her land as a transmitter site.she had signed the february affidavit at the request of lee,she explained.on march,utter stated,klemmer and warner had visited her at her home and refreshed her memory of their earlier meeting.they had wanted her to sign a statement that she would be willing to lease the site to liberty utter had refused but instead wrote and signed the statement of march in which she acknowledged having discussed the matter with klemmer and warner in august.utter stated in her deposition that although at the time she signed the march statement she did not recall ever having discussed leasing her land to klemmer,she included the assertion that she had done so because that what warner kept telling me the night he and klemmer were at the house.
klemmer testified to a different version of events.she said that at the august meeting she and warner told utter of liberty interest in leasing a portion of utter property in the event liberty received the license.they discussed a price of per year.there was no mention of utter having entered into a prior lease agreement with lee or orion.klemmer believed her oral agreement with utter gave her a reasonable assurance of the site being available for two reasons warner told her both that utter had honored previous oral agreements he had made with her on behalf of wcqs,and that he understood from wcqs attorney that an oral agreement was sufficient for an applicant to certify having a reasonable assurance.in his testimony warner corroborated klemmer account of their meeting with utter and the two statements she attributed to him.
upon this record the alj made findings adverse to liberty.in particular,the alj concluded that klemmer had absolutely no basis for representing that she had obtained a reasonable assurance the utter site was available to liberty.further,
she knew she had no basis for doing so.to argue that her feeble,effort to obtain some of vicki utter land constitutes reasonable assurance strains credulity.no,valerie klemmer has blatantly dissembled in a manner that does befit a prospective broadcast permittee.
rcd.at.the alj did not address warner testimony at all.
various parties appealed the alj decision to the review board,which affirmed that liberty was disqualified on the site issue and therefore did not reach the misrepresentation issue.communications,rcd,wl bd.the board decision survived review by the full commission as well as two petitions for reconsideration.communications,rcd,wl liberty,rcd,wl liberty,rcd,wl.when the appeal reached this court,however,we summarily reversed and remanded the case to the commission for reconsideration,biltmore forest broad.fm,fcc,wl,in light of our intervening decision in bechtel fcc,there we had held the commission integration policy,which favored an applicant who intended personally to manage and operate the proposed station over one who intended to entrust its operation to employees,was arbitrary and capricious.as a consequence,the alj disqualification of liberty and biltmore for want of an available site was never reviewed by the court,and the alj disqualification of liberty for misrepresentation was never reviewed at any level not by the review board or the commission or the court.
before the commission reconsidered on remand which of the applicants would best serve the public interest,however,the congress authorized the commission to award licenses for fm stations upon the basis of competitive bidding,balanced budget act of,stat,and the commission adopted a method of doing so using auctions.implementation of section j of the communications act,rcd,wl,on recon.at rcd,wl,aff sub nom.orion communications,fcc.
on july,the commission announced the requirements and procedures for bidding in auction,which would include the fm license at biltmore forest.public notice,rcd,wl.among other things,the july notice announced the starting date of the auction september,id.at,the deadline for the submission of short form applications august,and the various showings and certifications required of each applicant.id.at.liberty timely filed its short form application but failed to certify its compliance with the commission policies relating to media interests of immediate family members.id.
on september,liberty arranged to borrow a large sum of money from cumulus broadcasting,a nationwide media company.it reported the loan agreement to the commission on september.liberty,rcd,wl.the auction began on september and lasted until october.liberty was the high bidder,followed by biltmore and orion.id.on november liberty amended its application to include details of the cumulus loan agreement.id.on november it provided the family certification to the commission.id.
because liberty was the high bidder,the commission on november recommenced its proceeding to consider the alj previously unreviewed findings on the false certification issue.id.in the order now under review,the commission reviewed the question of liberty misrepresentation and addressed biltmore and orion new charges that liberty had engaged in irregularities in the auction process.
the commission held that liberty failure to submit the family certification with its short form application did not require dismissal of its application or invalidation of its selection as the permittee on the basis of the auction,id,and that the loan agreement between liberty and cumulus did not improperly bring a new party into the auction.id.the commission also held that liberty,by entering into the loan agreement with cumulus,was no longer eligible for the new entrant bidding credit,id,pursuant to which a company without major media interests was not required to pay the full amount of its bid.and the commission rejected the suggestion that liberty becoming ineligible for the bidding credit required it either to dismiss liberty application or to set aside the results of the auction.id.finally,the commission reversed the alj finding that liberty had misrepresented the availability of the proposed transmitter site in its application.id.
having found no reason to disqualify liberty,the high bidder in the auction,the commission awarded it the license.biltmore appealed,orion intervened in support of biltmore,and liberty intervened in support of the commission.
ii.analysis 
biltmore and orion objections to the commission award of the license to liberty are of two types claims that liberty failure to adhere to all the rules of the auction disqualifies it from holding the license,and claims that liberty engaged in misrepresentation before the commission and is therefore unfit to be a licensee.
auction violations 
biltmore claims that both liberty failure timely to file the family certification and its entering into the loan agreement with cumulus disqualify it from the auction.
family certification 
biltmore argues that both the july notice and the commission regulations require that liberty application be dismissed for failure to file the required family certification.the july notice stated that bidders must certify compliance with the commission policies relating to media interests of immediate family members,rcd.at,and b requires that the short form application contain all required certifications,information and exhibits,pursuant to the provisions of a and any commission public notices.
regarding the effect of an applicant failure to submit required information,b provides two different sanctions.first,b states 
any application that does not contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this section is unacceptable for filing and can not be corrected subsequent to the applicable filing deadline.the application will be dismissed with prejudice and the upfront payment,if paid,will be returned.
other omissions are not subject to such draconian treatment,however.section b provides the commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects specified herein except for failure to sign the application and to make certifications and to resubmit a corrected application.the commission grace is not unlimited if the applicants fail to correct defects in their applications in a timely manner as specified by public notice,then they will have their applications dismissed without opportunity for resubmission.b.as for the july notice,it states only that f ailure to submit required information by the resubmission date will result in dismissal of the application and inability to participate in the auction.see b.rcd.at.
the commission argues that neither b nor the notice requires liberty disqualification the regulation applies by its terms only to the certifications required pursuant to this section.because the family certification was required by the july notice rather than by,according to the commission,the disqualification provided in b does not apply to the omission of that certification.rather,the applicable provisions are the more forgiving b,which afford an applicant the opportunity to make corrections before the commission dismisses its application with no opportunity for resubmission.the parenthetical exception in subsection b taking failure to make certifications out of the class of defects curable under that subsection does not apply to the family certification,the commission argument suggests,because the certifications in question are only those implicated in subsection b,namely the certifications required pursuant to.
as for the july notice,the commission contends it simply is not clear enough to require liberty automatic disqualification for failure to submit the family certification although the notice stated that a bidder that failed to submit required information before the auction would be unable to participate in the auction,it did not state that such an omission was incurable if it came to light after the auction was held.because the notice did not directly speak to liberty situation,the commission goes on,disqualifying liberty based upon the notice would deprive it of fair warning that its application might be disqualified without an opportunity to correct it,contrary to the rule we endorsed in high plains wireless,fcc,that the rule did not afford adequate notice reflexive bidding was unlawful is itself sufficient justification for the commission not to penalize the bidder.
we give controlling weight to the commission interpretation of its own regulation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.id.at.here the commission interpretation does not fall below that standard.the commission is,of course,correct in pointing out that the family certification is not among those required pursuant to,the omission of which incurably disqualifies the applicant as specified in b.it was not unreasonable for the commission to treat the omission of a certification required only by a public notice as a defect other than failure to make a certification as that term is used in b,and thus to provide the opportunity for correction that b allows for such a defect.we also agree with the commission that it should not more properly,that it need not disqualify liberty after the auction on the basis of an omission that,according to the notice,would disqualify an applicant if discovered prior to the auction.
biltmore arguments to the contrary notwithstanding,neither mckay wahlenmaier,nor superior oil udall,requires a different conclusion.in each case we reversed the secretary of the interior award of a lease based upon an incurably defective application.indeed,in those cases the secretary had awarded the lease after finding specifically that the defect was incurable.see mckay,at the secretary found that his application was defective and that it was filed in an inherently unfair situation which would have caused it to be rejected had the real situation been disclosed before the drawing superior oil,at quoting the secretary,the deficiency in union bid can not be waived,nor can it be supplied after the time for receipt of the bids.in this case the commission made the opposite finding because the family certification was not required by,the omission could be cured.hence,mckay and superior oil are not controlling.
loss of bidding credit 
section b provides that m ajor amendments can not be made to a application after the initial filing deadline,and states that such amendments include changes in an applicant size which would affect eligibility for designated entity provisions.similarly,the july notice,citing this provision,stated that a s described more fully in the commission rules,after the filing deadline a pplicants will not be permitted to make major modifications to their applications,change bidding credits.rcd.at.
biltmore claims that because liberty amendment after the filing deadline of its short form application to reflect the loan from cumulus affected its eligibility for a bidding credit,the change was a major amendment and therefo
