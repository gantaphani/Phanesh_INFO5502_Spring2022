the united states district court for the southern district of new york heard a dispute between apotex,and apotex apotex,the appellants,and unigene laboratories,and upsher smith laboratories,collectively,unigene,the appellees,over claim of patent no.e patent.on for summary judgment,the district court granted unigene motion that the patent would not have been obvious at the time of invention.unigene,apotex,summary judgment opinion,cv,dkt,slip op.at.the trial court also denied apotex motion to breach the privilege under the exception.unigene,apotex,crime fraud opinion,cv,dkt,slip op.at.in addition,the district court determined that apotex had waived several.unigene,apotex,counterclaim opinion,cv,wl july.because the district court correctly decided all of these motions,this court affirms.
unigene owns the patent through assignment from inventor william stern stern.the patent is a reissue of u.patent patent.the reissue occurred on june,while this case was before the district court.
covered by the patent,fortical is an food and drug administration fda approved pharmaceutical nasal spray with the active ingredient salmon calcitonin salmon calcitonin or calcitonin.unigene filed for fda approval under b and now holds the new drug application nda for fortical.unigene nda claims miacalcin as its reference drug,meaning that for fda approval,unigene had to prove that fortical was a bioequivalent of miacalcin.upsher smith is the exclusive patent licensee,with rights to market and sell fortical in the united states.fortical treats,among other things,postmenopausal osteoporosis.
fortical is a bioequivalent of novartis international ag miacalcin calcitonin nasal spray.miacalcin has been marketed since,before the patent february,priority date.unigene developed fortical as an alternative to miacalcin.
both miacalcin and fortical use salmon calcitonin at a concentration of ml as their active ingredient.salmon calcitonin is a natural polypeptide hormone.calcitonins help regulate calcium ions in the blood and therefore address conditions like osteoporosis.to be effective,polypeptides,like salmon calcitonin,must reach the bloodstream.delivery to the bloodstream,however,is not easy because calcitonins are readily degraded by bodily fluids,are relatively unstable in pharmaceutical compositions,and are poorly absorbed through tissues.miacalcin and fortical are both nasal sprays.
fortical and miacalcin have different formulations.for instance,miacalcin also contains mg of sodium chloride,which acts as a tonicity agent nitrogen,which acts as a sparging agent hydrochloric acid,which acts as a ph adjuster and purified water,which acts as a carrier.of particular importance to this appeal,miacalcin contains mg of benzalkonium chloride bzk which functions as a preservative,absorption enhancer,and surfactant.in contrast,fortical contains mm of citric acid,which functions as an absorption enhancer and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate polysorbate,which acts as a surfactant and phenylethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol,which serve as preservatives.
apotex,a canadian pharmaceutical company,filed abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda on june.apotex anda certified under j a vii iv paragraph iv certification intends to make,use,offer to sell,sell,import a generic version of unigene fortical product before the expiration of the patent.because a paragraph iv certification is an act of infringement under e,see also glaxo group apotex,unigene lodged a complaint for infringement in the district court.the only asserted claim in the litigation is claim.claim reads 
a liquid pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration comprising about mrc units of salmon calcitonin,about mm citric acid,about phenylethyl alcohol,about benzyl alcohol,and about polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate 
apotex original answer of september,contained numerous affirmative defenses.in addition to allegations of invalidity under,and,apotex alleged noninfringement and inequitable conduct.the inequitable conduct assertions cited the failure to disclose an allegedly material piece of prior art and making allegedly misleading statements during patent prosecution.apotex filed an amended answer on may,with two more inequitable conduct allegations,one based on an error in table of the patent and another based on the failure to disclose a piece of prior art.
in september,during fact discovery,apotex moved to breach unigene privilege under the exception.in support of these allegations,apotex referred to unigene alleged failure to disclose patent patent to the patent and trademark office patent office and to errors in table of the patent,the same conduct upon which apotex premised some of its inequitable conduct claims at issue in this appeal.
the prior art patent,with stern as a,carries the title oral salmon calcitonin pharmaceutical products.the patent claims entericcoated solid pharmaceutical formulations of salmon calcitonin,administered orally.the patent discloses a solid oral tablet that the specification touts as a more convenient and comfortable dosage method for patients.the patent teaches an oral formulation that resists degradation during the digestion process to keep the salmon calcitonin active.the patent discloses experiments measuring the effects of citric acid on buffer ph,bioavailability of salmon calcitonin,and absorption of salmon calcitonin in the presence of enhancers.these experiments injected ml of liquid formulation containing citric acid,taurodeoxycholic acid,mannitol,and calcitonin into the exposed duodenum of anesthetized rats.the experiments showed an increase in calcitonin bioavailability when the amount of citric acid was increased and noted that bioavailabilty was minor in the presence of enhancers when compared to citric acid alone.
table of the patent,reproduced below,shows the effect of citric acid concentration on the stability of salmon calcitonin stored at.table shows the percentage of calcitonin in formulations with different amounts of citric acid over fifteen days.as published patent,table had two errors,indicated by the lines 
at.the error on the top axis,characterized as clearly typographical in nature by the district court,labels a column mm instead of mm.second,the point of apotex allegations,a data point on the table reads percent instead of the percent actually measured.the column containing the second error shows that a salmon calcitonin solution with mm of citric acid degrades over time,as the percentages of recovered calcitonin decrease from percent to percent over time.whether the day measurement is percent or percent,the recovery is still below the percent recovered after days.
the record indicates that stern immediately informed the patent office when he became aware of the errors in table.specifically,stern submitted a declaration on september,explaining an inadvertent error during automated data analysis.he explained further that the error did not affect the trend of salmon calcitonin reduction.
the district court declined to find that these errors or were sufficient to pierce the privilege.the district court found the patent to be either immaterial to the patent or cumulative to the other cited references.crime fraud opinion,at.while both the patent and patent related to pharmaceutical formulations of salmon calcitonin,the district court found that the patent formulations were considerably different than formulations in the patent and were,therefore,immaterial.crime fraud opinion,at.the district court also found that apotex proffered evidence of fraudulent intent regarding the patent was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of fraud.id.at.
the district court also found that the errors in table of the patent were immaterial.id.at.the district court found the corrected version of the table consistent with unigene assertions at the patent office.id.at.the district court concluded that the errors were not material with respect to patentability or common law fraud.id.the district court also determined that evidence of stern submission of a second declaration to clarify errors in table lacked deceptive intent,making that conduct insufficient to support an assertion of common law fraud.id.at.
unigene and apotex for summary judgment on obviousness.the patent office granted reissue of the patent on june,at which point the district court granted unigene motion to amend the complaint to replace all references to the patent with the reissued patent.apotex filed an answer to unigene amended complaint on july,that included several additional counts of inequitable conduct.without addressing these new claims,the district court granted unigene summary judgment of nonobviousness and entered judgment.
the district court found that the patent would not have been obvious at the time of invention as a matter of law.summary judgment opinion at.in considering pieces of prior art submitted by apotex also considered by the patent office during prosecution of the patent,the district court found that no prior art teaches using mm citric acid to achieve both shelf stability and enhanced bioavailability in a nasal salmon calcitonin formulation.summary judgment opinion at.
the district court also found that it would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to modify miacalcin to reach the formulation of claim.the record shows that a person of ordinary skill was an individual with a masters degree in chemistry,pharmaceutical chemistry,biochemistry,or a similar field with at least eight years of practical experience in pharmaceutical liquid dosage form development,or an individual with a in the same fields with at least four years of practical experience in pharmaceutical liquid dosage form development.specifically,the district court determined first that bzk serves as an absorption enhancer,a preservative,and a surfactant in miacalcin.then,the court relied on expert testimony to conclude that a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to find other compounds that serve as both absorption enhancers and preservatives of calcitonin.further,the district court found that the prior art taught alternative methods of improving bioavailability and absorption of calcitonin.
in response to the court summary judgment rulings,apotex moved for reconsideration in light of its counterclaims of inequitable conduct.the district court granted apotex motion to consider its counterclaims.nonetheless the district court judgment for unigene.the district court held that all of apotex defenses and counterclaims,those asserted in and those apotex sought to add in,had been conceded,waived,barred,abandoned,or improperly raised.apotex appeals the district court rejection of the three added inequitable conduct counterclaims count xii,count xiii,and count xiv.this court has jurisdiction under a.
this court applies its own law to review a district court application of the exception to the privilege.in re spalding sports worldwide.this court reviews a district court determination of material protected by the privilege for an abuse of discretion.apotex merck.
a party must establish walker process fraud,also known as common law fraud,to successfully pierce the privilege under the exception.see walker process,food mach.chem.a finding of common law fraud in the patent context must be based on independent and clear evidence of deceptive intent together with a clear showing of reliance.spalding,at see nobelpharma ab implant innovations,holding that both fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions can support a finding of common law fraud.such independent and clear evidence must establish a prima facie case of fraud,which is generally held not to exist unless the accusing party can show 
a representation of material fact,the falsity of that representation,the intent to deceive or,at least,a state of mind so reckless as to the consequences that it is held to the equivalent of intent scienter,a justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation by the party deceived which induces him to act thereon,and injury to the party deceived as a result of his reliance on the misrepresentation 
spalding sports,at citing nobelpharma,at.this court need only examine apotex proffered evidence of intent to uphold the district court refusal to invoke the exception.
the record does not show clear evidence of intent for either of the alleged fraudulent acts by unigene.as noted by the district court,the record contains only an essentially unsupported allegation that stern intentionally left the patent off of the initial information disclosure statement of the patent.crime fraud opinion,at.the second allegation of fraud rests on a similarly flimsy foundation.
in the first place,the typographical error in table of the patent,corrected on reissue,does not call for the extreme remedy of piercing the privilege.the district court found the evidence tend ed to prove that this error was an honest mistake,though perhaps a careless one.id.at.indeed,stern submitted a declaration during the reissue proceedings to explain the error in table.further,as the trial court found,the error itself did not alter the arguments made by unigene to the pto.accordingly,the district court concluded that the record did not show any evidence of intent to deceive the patent office.id.at.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in these findings on the exception to the privilege.this court need not reach the district court materiality determinations because the record is devoid of sufficient intent evidence.
this court reviews a district court denial of a party motion to amend its pleadings under the law of the regional circuit.panduit all states plastic.the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reviews a district court denial of a request to amend pleadings for an abuse of discretion.parker columbia pictures,cir.apotex appeals the court refusal to add counts xii,xiii,and xiv to its answer to unigene amended complaint.apotex does not challenge the district court rulings with respect to the allegations of inequitable conduct asserted in its original and first amended answers.the district court decision was based on its determination that unigene amended complaint did not change the scope of the original complaint and therefore did not provide an opportunity for apotex to expand the breadth of its affirmative defenses or counterclaims.
the record shows that the district court acted well within its discretion in finding that apotex added counterclaims were not colorable grounds for relief.blaskiewicz cnty.of suffolk,d,citation omitted.the trial court is especially well positioned to assess whether the amended complaint it authorized materially changed the scope of the original complaint.counts xii,xiii,and xiv all relate to inequitable conduct.the district court found that the filing of an amended complaint,which merely renamed the patent in suit,did not so materially alter the proceedings as to authorize previously unasserted counterclaims.the district court found count xii improper because,inter alia,the new claim provided inadequate notice to unigene.the district court barred counts xiii and xiv,which mirror apotex allegations,based on the same fatal absence of materiality and intent already addressed in the crime fraud opinion.this court agrees that the record shows insufficient evidence of fraudulent intent and erects an insurmountable obstacle to apotex new counterclaims.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying claims xii,xiii,and xiv.
