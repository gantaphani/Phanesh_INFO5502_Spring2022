background 
cvgia is a florida corporation that arranges and secures the shipment of goods for a large venezuelan conglomerate.prior to its relationship with venus,another venezuelan company compa√±ia anonima venezolana de navegacion cavn handled cvgia freight pursuant to annual contracts that were renewed each year.in march,cvgia began doing business with venus after cavn went bankrupt by arranging one voyage carrying the products of the venezuelan conglomerate northward to mobile and carrying the cvgia procured shipments southward to venezuela.later,cvgia solicited bids for the shipment of goods southward from miami,port everglades,and mobile to venezuela.cvgia requested bids to carry goods for one year at a fixed tariff rate,and the bid request contained terms similar to cavn last contract with cvgia.venus filed its tariff rates and terms for the service with the federal maritime commission venus submitted its bid,and cvgia accepted it in april.
over the next few months,michael kobiakov,venus president,met with representatives from cvgia on several occasions to discuss the possibility of a agreement.venus contends the parties agreed to a service contract in october at a meeting between kobiakov and cvgia executive vice president ramon iglesias,and that the terms of this contract were recorded in kobiakov notes,which he took on the face of an earlier contract between cvgia and seafreight line.cvgia,however asserts the parties never finalized a contract.over the next two years,venus and cvgia discussed possible written agreements,but were never able to agree on written terms.cvgia rejected several drafts that venus proposed.in september,cvgia informed venus that its services were no longer needed for the miami to venezuela run.
venus sued cvgia in the southern district of florida,alleging that cvgia breached its contract with venus,and seeking liquidated damages provided for in the oral agreement.alternatively,venus sought damages for misrepresentation and promissory estoppel,alleging cvgia actions led venus to believe it was engaged in a contractual relationship,and to rely on that belief to its detriment.venus also alleged cvgia failed to pay demurrage and freight charges specified in the bills of lading venus issued cvg with each voyage.
after a five day bench trial,the district court found that no long term contract existed between venus and cvgia,as there had never been any agreement on the fundamental issues of duration and price.the district court rejected venus promissory estoppel and misrepresentation claims,finding that cvgia made no clear and unambiguous promise upon which venus relied,that any additional expenditures venus made to service cvgia were necessary expenditures,and that there was insufficient evidence to support a misrepresentation claim.the court found that the doctrine of laches barred venus demurrage claims for and,because venus had an obligation to demand payment from cvgia rather than waiting until this lawsuit to file its demurrage claims for those years.the court found venus made a timely demand for the demurrage and was entitled to recover from cvgia under the terms of the bills of lading.the court ordered that venus was entitled to collect plus ten percent interest per annum running from the date the freight or demurrage was due,and for the attorneys fees relating to the prosecution of freight and demurrage claims.

contract claim 
venus contends the district court erred when it framed the central issue of whether a contract existed between cvgia and venus as one of formation and not modification.venus also argues the district court misstated the rule governing parties contemplating a written agreement,because the intention to sign a written agreement does not prevent the parties from agreeing to an enforceable oral contract.venus asserts it had an enforceable oral contract to ship goods for cvgia that arose from a modification of the contract formed when cvgia accepted venus bid,and that the modified terms were the contract extended duration and modified scope of service.
it is not necessary to reduce an agreement to writing to bind the parties,as long as the parties intend to be bound at the time of the oral agreement.nautica int l,intermarine usa,d.in april,cvgia accepted venus bid to perform the services contract.acceptance of a bid to perform services can create an enforceable contract in the absence of a written agreement.see roberts schaefer hardaway,cir.cvgia does not dispute that the parties entered into a contract in april,but it argues that the relationship between cvgia and venus was a series of discrete contracts to ship the goods at the tariff rate,and that these agreements were never modified in favor of a agreement.we agree with the district court that the parties did not form a valid agreement.
in order to form an enforceable oral contract,there must be a meeting of the minds on all essential terms and obligations of the contract.browning peyton,cir.venus has failed to establish there was a meeting of the minds between itself and cvgia on all of the essential terms of the alleged contract.venus maintains that it always charged,and cvgia always paid,the tariff rate.however,kobiakov notes allegedly reflected the terms of the oral agreement reached in october.those notes,taken on the face of a prior contract between cvgia and another company,reflect rates that were not implemented.furthermore,the tariff rates were never revised to implement the negotiated rate terms reflected in kobiakov notes.the district court found,and we agree,that the rate term was an essential term upon which the parties had to agree.the conduct of the parties after they reached the alleged oral agreement suggests there was no meeting of the minds on the rate term.
even if venus were correct that the central issue in this case is not whether the parties formed a new contract,but whether they modified an existing one,the conduct of the parties after they reached the purported agreement demonstrates there was no valid modification of the contract formed when cvgia accepted venus bid.a meeting of the minds on modified terms is necessary to validly modify a contract.see united contractors,united constr,so d,holding one party to a contract can not alter its terms without the assent of the other parties the minds of the parties must meet as to the proposed modification.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the parties in this case continued to negotiate,trying to work out a deal.cvgia continued to compensate venus at the tariff rate,and venus continued to accept payment at that rate,not at the modified rates that would be required by the modified scope of service.venus also alleged that the modified contract contained a liquidated damages clause,but venus did not seek to enforce that clause until more than a year after it originally filed this action.these facts indicate that there was no mutual assent on the new terms of the contract.
venus is correct that in certain contractual situations,the parties intent to eventua
