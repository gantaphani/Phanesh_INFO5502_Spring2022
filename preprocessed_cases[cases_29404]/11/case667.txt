background 
adrian blissfield railroad company is a railroad based in lenawee county,michigan.the railroad owns approximately miles of track that run through the village,and,although the railroad does not cross state lines,the traffic that originates or terminates on the railroad crosses state lines.at dobronski test.at.the railroad also has a small depot in the village,located on.
the village administrator,james wonacott,testified that in and the village implemented a program pursuant to.comp.laws.the project derived from the village concern that without the benefit of a sidewalk or dedicated pedestrian way,pedestrians would have to cross us at a street intersection and a rail grade crossing and a drainage ditch.at wonacott test.at.apparently,owing to the previous railroad president failure to transfer records,the railroad president,mark dobronski,did not become aware of the correspondence from the village regarding the sidewalk project until he received a letter from the village attorney,frank riley,in august.the letter stated that,if the railroad failed to complete the sidewalk,the village would complete the construction and bill the railroad.dobronski testified that he responded with a letter stating that he thought the federal railway safety act frsa preempted the village actions.
dobronski met with town officials in.after talking with the engineer for the project,dobronski became concerned because he did seem to know much of anything about what the railroad standards or the specifications were.at dobronski test.at.despite these discussions,the village installed the sidewalk without the railroad consent between november and december.at mem.op.at.the sidewalk constructed along is within the of the michigan department of transportation mdot and abuts real property owned by the railroad on which the train depot is situated.at mem.op.at.additionally,a portion of the constructed sidewalks near where the railroad tracks cross several hundred feet east of the depot is outside the mdot and is on the railroad property.id.
the village sidewalk project involved installing a new walkway across the railroad tracks and repairing two existing walkways.on august,the village sent a letter to the railroad stating that,because the railroad had not responded,the village would once again contract out the sidewalk work and bill the railroad unless the railroad completed the work by september.as in,when the railroad did not proceed with construction,the village did.on september,dobronski was alerted that one of the railroad engineers had to conduct an emergency stop because a gravel truck used in the construction was parked across the tracks.dobronski immediately visited the area and observed construction taking place.dobronski testified that he was in utter disbelief seeing a bulldozer going down bumping into my rail,chopping up ties,doing damage to the railroad infrastructure.at dobronski test.at.after this incident,dobronski sent a cease and desist letter to the village.at mem.op.at.in december,the village completed work on the walkways across the tracks.
the district court found that the sidewalks constructed by the village have not benefitted the railroad in any material respect.at mem.op.at.in fact,the district court found that the sidewalk construction was detrimental to the railroad because it potentially increas ed its premises liability,and thereby has affected negatively the value of the railroad operations.at mem.op.at.there currently is a lien against the railroad property as a result of its failure to pay the assessments for the construction.at the time of the trial in november,the district court found that the lien amount exceeded.the district court found that the sidewalk construction constituted a financial burden on the railroad and divert ed money which could be spent on other matters,particularly given that the railroad had lost money since.at mem.op.at.finally,the district court found that the railroad did not pay property taxes to the village for property that it owns within village limits.
on january,the railroad filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan seeking declaratory relief.the railroad requested a declaratory judgment that the village 
may not impose its rules and regulations against the railroad for safety matters occurring on or about the railroad property and right of way,in particular,requiring the railroad to construct roadways,grade level crossings and assessing against the railroad and its property a fee for construction of walkways along and upon the the railroad property and right of way.
at complaint.the railroad also sought a declaratory judgment that the lien filed by the village against the railroad property for construction of walkways was invalid.at complaint.the railroad claimed money damages incurred during the village construction,but this claim was dismissed without prejudice on april,pursuant to the parties stipulation.
the district court denied the railroad motion for summary judgment on october.at that time,the district court noted that although the preemptive effect of the iccta appears to have evolved into plaintiff primary argument,both parties focused their briefing for the motion for summary judgment more on the frsa than on the iccta,and the district court requested additional briefing on the iccta prior to trial.at op.order den.pl.mot.for summ.at.the district court held a bench trial on november,and,on april,the district court issued a written opinion entering judgment in favor of the railroad.the village filed a timely appeal.the railroad,but later voluntarily withdrew its.

preemption 
the district court held that the termination act preempted the michigan statute requiring the railroad to pay for both pedestrian crossings installed across the railroad tracks and sidewalks near and on the railroad property.the district court analyzed the preemption provisions of the termination act and determined that the construction or repair of all of the sidewalks in this case constitutes construction of facilities under,and thus falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the stb.at mem.op.at.it held that the iccta preempts not only an attempt to require a railroad to construct facilities,but also an attempt to require a railroad to pay for that construction.id.in addition,the district court held that the statute imposed an unbudgeted and undue burden on the railroad,thus diverting funds from other railroad expenses or operations,particularly from the railroad maintenanc
