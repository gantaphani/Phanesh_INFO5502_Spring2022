a discharge in bankruptcy,simpliciter,ordinarily does not wipe out previously perfected security interests in tangible personal property.the lienholder retains a right of repossession,subject,however,to the bankrupt possible right of redemption.if timely exercised,this right of redemption allows an individual chapter debtor to redeem certain tangible personal property intended primarily for personal,family,or household use,from a lien securing a dischargeable consumer debt by paying the lienholder a sum equal to the amount of the allowed secured claim.
the cases that undergird this appeal present something of an anomaly.they involve a preserved security interest but no secured claim per se.thus,they involve a right of repossession,and the parties,by instruments that they refer to as redemption agreements we shall honor that characterization even though,technically,this may not be the type of redemption agreement that section agreed to cancel that right of repossession on payment of an agreed value for the collateral.that value is not in issue as we shall see,the parties agreed to specific dollar figures,and they are bound by those agreements.what is in issue are particular aspects of the negotiated transactions.
to be specific,the former chapter debtors seeking to represent a putative that the principal defendant,sears,roebuck company habitually violated the bankruptcy code by the manner in which it essayed to enforce security liens in household goods and other personal property.their claim has two subparts.first,they allege that redemption agreements between lienholders and debtors,entered into after the granting of a discharge in bankruptcy,invariably violate the prohibitions of the bankruptcy discharge injunction,codified in.second,they allege that,in all events,such agreements require bankruptcy court approval which was never obtained.
in addition to these asseverations,the appellants also advance a claim under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.this the individual defendants lawyers representing sears transgressed the fdcpa while supposedly attempting to effect a determination of whether the fdcpa reaches the defendants activities.that,in turn,requires us to consider the nature of a debt as that term is employed in the fdcpa.
the district court wrote a thoughtful opinion in which it answered both the bankruptcy and the fdcpa questions adversely to the appellants.arruda sears,roebuck.it thereupon dismissed their complaints.id.at.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order.
background 
the district court has furnished an exegetic account of each appellant situation and the litigation procedural history.see id.at.rather than repastinate that soil,we present here only the background facts necessary to frame the issues on appeal.because the district court acted under.b,we derive these facts from the several complaints,purged,however,of empty rhetoric.see sec sg,cir aulson blanchard,cir.
the appellants are rhode island residents,all of whom had filed for personal bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.each had purchased consumer goods from sears,refrigerators,sewing machines prior to filing for bankruptcy.on the filing date,each owed money to sears for the purchases and each listed the sears debt as an unsecured,nonpriority claim on bankruptcy schedules.the bankruptcy court granted each appellant a general discharge encompassing the sears indebtedness.
of course,the discharges did not erase sears prepetition security interest in the purchased property.see id.c and f see also in re brown,discussing how section operates in connection with purchase money security interests in household goods.relying on this fact,sears thereafter asserted its rights of repossession.its correspondence with the appellant dorothy arruda was typical.sears letter asked arruda to contact its office to arrange for turning over the collateral in her case,a range hood,a lawn mower,and a sewing machine.arruda no longer possessed two of the three items in which sears claimed an interest.when she called to discuss the situation,she was told by a sears representative that she could either surrender the goods or redeem them by paying their fair market value as determined by sears.
two other appellants,melanie velleco and blanche sroka,had similar experiences.in each instance,lawyers representing sears insisted that the discharged debtor either surrender the affected property voluntarily,state an intention to redeem it,or forfeit it through state replevin proceedings in which the sheriff would go out with a sears representative to take possession of the items in question.
sears interaction with the appellants vincent and kathleen kowal was along the same lines.the kowals allege that various individuals representing sears sent them letters offering to allow them to retain the articles that were the subject of the replevin action a bicycle,a gas range,a sofa,and some exercise equipment in exchange for a payment equaling the merchandise fair market value.these letters indicated that the kowals had requested payment terms to settle sears claim of repossession and that sears will settle the claim s for a lump sum payment totaling for the four items that sears believe d represent ed the fair market value of the items.
in every case,the appellants eventually received documents which,for present purposes,were materially identical to the memorandum of redemption received by velleco and reproduced in the appendix.arruda,velleco,and sroka each signed the proffered redemption agreement and returned it to sears with a check reflecting the agreed value specified therein.the kowals signed a similar redemption agreement for the sofa and gas range,paying the amount established by sears for those items.they did not attempt to redeem either the bicycle or the exercise equipment,and sears subsequently repossessed those articles.
without exception,sears asserted its right of repossession only after an appellant bankruptcy proceedings were completed.once a discharged debtor signed a redemption agreement,sears notified attorney that it was unable to file the agreement because the bankruptcy case was closed.see generally permitting,but not requiring,secured creditor to file a proof of claim or interest during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings.it stated,however,that it nonetheless intended to honor the agreement.
the appellants allege that the amounts sears required in order to release its security liens on the goods bore no correlation to actual market values and,in fact,exceeded market value.the appellants also allege that the cost of replevying the goods outweighed any residual value that sears realistically could have hoped to realize from a resale of the merchandise.conspicuously absent are allegations that the redemption values were in any way linked to the amount of the debt owed with respect to the purchase of the goods.
against this backdrop,the appellants portray sears activities as part of an illicit scheme they envision sears as lying in wait until a debtor bankruptcy case is closed and the bankruptcy court attention focused the debtor and threatening to repossess useful household goods unless the debtor enters into a redemption agreement.this scheme,the appellants say,violates the bankruptcy discharge injunction,as an attempt to collect discharged debt without judicial approval of either the redemption agreements or the valuations assigned to individual items of collateral.the kowals add two further arguments that sears use of inaccurate valuation tables and other scurrilous tactics constitute fraud and false pretenses,and that the debt collectors actions violate the fdcpa.
treating the several cases as an integrated whole,the district court dismissed the complaints insofar as they purported to allege federal claims.as to the bankruptcy issues,the court ruled that sears efforts anent repossession and the ensuing redemption agreements did not offend the bankruptcy code.arruda,at.as to the remaining federal issue,the court held that the fdcpa did not apply to the challenged activities.id.at.finally,the court declined to retain supplemental jurisdiction over the appellants claims,dismissing them without prejudice.id.at citing a.this appeal followed.

we review a district court dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim de novo.garrett tandy,cir.in so doing,we follow the same rules that bound the district court.consequently,we assume the truth of all facts and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom that fit the plaintiff stated theory of liability.rogan menino,cir.in that process,we give no weight to bald assertions,unsupportable conclusions,and opprobrious epithets.chongris bd.of appeals,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.within these guidelines,we will affirm a rule b dismissal only if the factual averments do not justify recovery on some theory adumbrated in the complaint.rogan,at.
two special principles are also relevant here.for one thing,the appellants attached various documents,including the memoranda of redemption,to their complaints.when a complaint annexes and incorporates by reference a written instrument,any inconsistencies between the complaint and the instrument must be resolved in favor of the latter.see clorox.proctor gamble commercial,cir see also young lepone,cir.for another thing,the civil rules require fraud to be pleaded with particularity.b.this requirement entails specifying in the pleader complaint the time,place,and content of the alleged false or fraudulent representations.powers boston cooper,cir.
with this framework in place,we turn to the appellants assignments of error.
a.the bankruptcy discharge injunction.
the most pervasive issue in this case hinges on the scope and operation of the bankruptcy discharge injunction.this is a matter of statutory construction,and we approach it by examining the language of the pertinent statutes.united states charles george trucking,cir.in determining the meaning of a statute,we presume that congress intended all of the constituent words and passages to have meaning and effect.hawayek,cir.concomitantly,we defer to congress choice of phrase and give words used in a statute their ordinary and accepted meaning.smith motiva enters.llc,cir.
section c deals specifically with agreements between debtors and those who hold claims against them.it states in pertinent part 
an agreement between a holder of a claim and the debtor,the consideration for which,in whole or in part,is based on a debt that is dischargeable in a case under this title is enforceable only to any extent enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law and only if certain elements not relevant here are satisfied.
c.for present purposes,then,the threshold inquiry is whether the consideration underlying a particular redemption agreement is based to any degree on a debt that is dischargeable or that has been discharged in bankruptcy.this inquiry involves two different bodies of law the dischargeability of a debt is a matter of federal bankruptcy law,but whether the consideration for the underlying agreement is based on that debt is a matter of state contract law.
we start with the federal question.although the terms discharge and dischargeable are not explicitly defined in the bankruptcy code,a sheds considerable light upon the matter.it states that a discharge voids any judgment to the extent that it is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor and enjoins the commencement or continuation of an action,the employment of process,or any act,to collect,recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor id.a emphasis supplied.thus,only a debtor personal liability is dischargeable in a chapter case.it follows,therefore,that the strictures of section c apply only to those agreements the consideration for which involves,in whole or in part,the imposition or reimposition of personal liability with respect to a debt dischargeable or previously discharged in bankruptcy.
this brings us to the second phase of our inquiry.here,the relevant state law is the law of rhode island.under rhode island law,u nambiguous language is to be accorded its plain and natural meaning.newport plaza assocs.durfee attleboro bank,cir.the interpretation of such language presents a question of law.id.at citing judd realty,tedesco.and when intent is plainly revealed by the express terms of a written contract,an inquiring court should not search for some undisclosed intent but rather,look to that intent expressed by the language contained in the contract.woon.teachers guild,local school.
each redemption agreement at issue here contains an explicit acknowledgment that the debtor failure to redeem as described within this agreement shall not impose any personal liability on the debtor.each agreement adds that if the debtor fails to pay the redemption amount,sears only recourse is against the collateral.this language appears just above the agreement signature line and just below the underscored heading no personal liability.the appellants do not allege that they were unaware of this language indeed,their complaints confirm that they consented to this very formulation.given these facts,the agreements can not plausibly be interpreted to impose personal liability on the appellants in any way.to cinch matters,the appellants do not allege any facts which,under rhode island law,might justify judicial disregard of the clear contractual text.we conclude,therefore,that because these agreements do not purport to impose any personal liability on account of discharged debts,section c does not affect their enforceability.
the appellants labor to avoid this dead end.their escape route involves two related points that sears,by means of its valuation tables,greatly overstated the worth of the collateral,and that the district court disregarded the method of rule b when it failed to indulge the appellants allegation that these inflated valuations represented veiled attempts to collect on account of discharged debts.but this route also leads to a blind alley,for it overlooks the express terms of the redemption agreements.
in these agreements,the appellants attest that they agreed to the replacement value of the property,for the purpose of redemption.they then agreed that,upon payment of the stipulated amount s,sears sic security interest in the merchandise shall be terminated.each agreement,therefore,makes manifest the parties objective intent to leave the goods in situ,settle upon an agreed fair market value,and exchange that sum for extinguishment of sears right of repossession.the appellants attempt to contradict this clear contractual language can not be credited.see clorox,at.
in an effort to rebut this reasoning,the appellants suggest that the redemption agreements lack force because they were not judicially approved.this is a red herring neither the bankruptcy code nor the implementing rules demand judicial approval of all redemption agreements.the relevant section of the bankruptcy code provides that an individual debtor may redeem certain property.in a similar vein,the relevant bankruptcy rule provides that the court may authorize the redemption upon the debtor motion.fed.these provisions are obviously precatory.there is no imperative requiring judicial approval in every instance only when there is some disagreement between the individual debtor and the secured creditor,usually over value,is the court called upon to act.lawrence king et,collier on bankruptcy ed.the complaints in these cases do not contain any allegation that the parties reached any such impasse in their redemption negotiations.
that omission conclusively rebuts the appellants suggestion.taken in light of the explicit terminology of the redemption agreements,the omission reveals the appellants motive allegation to be nothing but a bald assertion about an undisclosed intent.because such an assertion flies in the teeth of explicit contractual language,it must be disregarded.to hold otherwise would frustrate both rhode island contract law,newport plaza,at woon.teachers guild,at,and federal procedural orthodoxy,young,at clorox,at.
the appellants next asseverate that sears violated section by deliberately awaiting the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings before asserting its r
