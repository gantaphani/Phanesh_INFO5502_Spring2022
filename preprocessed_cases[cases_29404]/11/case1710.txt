in this case,borrowers defaulted on a loan secured by separate deeds of trust on three parcels of real property.the creditor bank conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure of one property and then proceeded with serial foreclosure sales of the remaining properties prior to each successive sale,it did not seek a judicial determination of fair market value of the property sold or purport to credit such amount to the debt.
we granted review to determine whether the bank thereby violated the antideficiency provisions of code of civil procedure section or.there was no violation.code of civil procedure section does not limit a creditor right to proceed against multiple items of collateral.nor did the sales fall under code of civil procedure section restriction against deficiency judgments.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
the loan at issue herein originated in june,when four entities,lcf income group,la canada flintridge development corporation,san martin investment development corporation,and peppertree corporate business park,hereafter collectively the borrowers,borrowed million from the bank of california,predecessor in interest to defendant union bank of california hereafter the bank.the loan,intended to be used to purchase and develop a large parcel of property in simi valley known as the peppertree property,was secured by a deed of trust covering the property.the deed of trust provided that upon any default by the borrowers,the bank could elect to sell the property and was entitled to bid for and purchase the property by credit bid in any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure.it also provided that if the bank held any additional collateral,it could,at its sole option,exercise any rights or remedies under the deed of trust,either concurrently or in such order as it might determine.gilbert dreyfuss was the general partner of lcf income group he and his wife,evelyn dreyfuss,executed personal guaranties on the loan.the loan was to mature on july.
the borrowers defaulted.the bank subsequently extended the maturity date on the loan until october,under a modified loan agreement.the modified loan agreement provided for additional collateral,consisting of two parcels of real clinton property,located in maryland,and lot hereafter lot,located in la canada,california.the deeds of trust stated that the additional collateral was provided to secure the entire loan they permitted recourse to the collateral,at the bank option,either before,concurrently,or after a sale of any additional security.the modified loan agreement contained an integration clause,under which the agreement and all instruments referred to therein constituted the entire agreement between the parties and superseded any and all prior agreements and understandings with respect thereto,whether oral or written.
in october,the borrowers again defaulted.the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on the peppertree property,the clinton property,and lot.the borrowers filed for bankruptcy protection,resulting in an automatic stay.in april,the bank obtained relief from the automatic stay.
in june,the borrowers,the guarantors,and the bank entered a limited forbearance agreement.under the terms of the forbearance agreement,the bank agreed to desist from further foreclosure activities and to discount the debt to million if paid in full by december,the borrowers agreed to waive the automatic stay as to the bank in any future bankruptcy proceedings.thereafter,at the borrowers request,the final date for payment in full was extended,pursuant to an extension agreement,until december.
the borrowers again defaulted and the bank recommenced nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with regard to the peppertree property.on the morning of the scheduled nonjudicial foreclosure sale,the lcf income group filed a second bankruptcy proceeding the bank immediately moved for and obtained relief from the automatic stay.
as of january,the remaining indebtedness exceeded million.on that date,the bank made a successful million credit bid at the nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the peppertree property,leaving a balance of more than million on the debt.on february,a foreclosure action against the clinton property was conducted in maryland under maryland law the bank made a successful million credit bid at that sale,leaving more than due on the debt.on may,the bank nonjudicially foreclosed on the lot property,making a successful credit bid at the sale.the bank did not seek a money judgment against any of the borrowers or guarantors in connection with the loan or any deficiency remaining after the foreclosures of the properties pledged as security for the loan.
gilbert and evelyn dreyfuss and lcf income group hereafter plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking monetary and other relief.they contended,inter alia,that the foreclosures of the clinton and lot properties constituted wrongful attempts to obtain a deficiency judgment after the foreclosure of the peppertree property,in violation of code of civil procedure section.in the alternative,they urged that,even if the sales were not altogether precluded,the bank was required to credit them with the fair market value of the peppertree property pursuant to code of civil procedure section before foreclosing against the additional properties.they also alleged that the sale of the clinton and lot properties breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the bank moved for summary judgment.at the hearing,the superior court observed the foreclosure was an open auction.i do see anything contesting the actual foreclosure proceedings,the actual sale,and nothing prevented either the borrower from bidding in money if he thought it was worth it or someone else and letting the market set the price.it granted the motion on the grounds that the bank conduct was not wrongful under code of civil procedure section or and that the plaintiffs failed to raise any triable issue of material fact.code civ.proc,subd.c.plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment 
the court of appeal affirmed the judgment.it held that neither section nor section of the code of civil procedure applied in these circumstances any revision of the statutes,based on policy considerations,to require a determination of fair market value in foreclosure situations when a debt is secured by multiple items of real property is a matter for the legislature to consider if it deems it appropriate to do so.
we granted review we now affirm.
do the antideficiency provisions of code of civil procedure sections and restrict the ability of a creditor to exhaust multiple items of collateral in a series of nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings we address the question under a de novo standard of review.birman loeb th,d.the answer is no the provisions are not implicated when a creditor merely exercises the right to exhaust all of the real property pledged to secure an obligation.specifically,a creditor may proceed seriatim in foreclosing against multiple items of collateral without commencing a judicial action to determine the fair market value of each item sold,and crediting that amount to the debt,before proceeding with foreclosure sales of any additional collateral.
code of civil procedure section,in pertinent part,provides whenever a money judgment is sought for the balance due upon an obligation for the payment of which a deed of trust or mortgage with power of sale upon real property was given as security,following the exercise of the power of sale in such deed of trust or mortgage,the plaintiff shall set forth in his or her complaint the entire amount of the indebtedness which was secured by the deed of trust or mortgage at the time of sale,the amount for which the real property or interest therein was sold and the fair market value thereof at the date of sale and the date of that sale before rendering any judgment the court shall find the fair market value of the real property sold,at the time of sale.the court may render judgment for not more than the amount by which the entire amount of the indebtedness due at the time of sale exceeded the fair market value of the real property or interest therein sold at the time of sale with interest thereon from the date of the sale provided,however,that in no event shall the amount of the judgment,exclusive of interest after the date of sale,exceed the difference between the amount for which the property was sold and the entire amount of the indebtedness secured by the deed of trust or mortgage.italics added.
code of civil procedure section,in pertinent,part provides no judgment shall be rendered for any deficiency upon a note secured by a deed of trust or mortgage upon real property or an estate for years therein hereafter executed in any case in which the real property or estate for years therein has been sold by the mortgagee or trustee under power of sale contained in the mortgage or deed of trust.italics added.
by their terms,both provisions apply only when a personal judgment against the debtor is sought after a foreclosure.code of civil procedure section refers to money judgment for the balance due upon an obligation secured by a deed of trust or mortgage.code of civil procedure refers to a judgment rendered for any deficiency upon a note secured by a deed of trust or mortgage upon real property.a deficiency judgment is a personal judgment against a debtor for a recovery of the secured debt measured by the difference between the debt and the net proceeds received from the foreclosure sale.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.deeds of trust and mortgages,fn.omitted accord,hatch nat.bank cal d,defining a deficiency judgment as a personal judgment for the unpaid balance due upon an obligation after unsuccessful resort to the security.a deficiency judgment requires court proceedings to establish the debtor liability following the foreclosure of the deed of trust.miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,italics omitted.
under settled decisional law,a creditor resort to any and all security on a debt does not implicate the antideficiency provisions.as we held nearly years ago in hatch nat.bank,supra,cal d at page,code of civil procedure section applies only to shield a borrower from personal liability it has no application to a situation where no attempt is made by the creditor to secure a personal judgment against a debtor for a deficiency remaining after sale under a deed of trust.
we subsequently reaffirmed that rule in freedland greco cal d,expressly referring also to code of civil procedure section.when a note is secured by multiple items of security,the creditor may exhaust the additional security and need not follow the procedure following a sale under a trust deed prescribed by section of the code of civil procedure citation,nor is he prevented from exhausting the other security where the trust deed is a purchase money one on which no deficiency judgment may be given by analogy the same rule would apply to section here involved t he pursuit of additional security is not a deficiency judgment freedland at,fn.omitted.as one treatise summarizes the rule when the beneficiary holds two or more deeds of trust on separate parcels of property to secure the same debt,he can foreclose the lien on one parcel of real property and then proceed to foreclose the liens on the remaining parcels by sales h owever,once the beneficiary has exercised the power of sale and the property has been sold,the beneficiary can not recover a personal judgment against the trustor either before or after he has enforced the additional security.miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,fns.omitted.
more recently,in western security bank superior court cal th,d,we reiterated the rule a creditor that draws on additional security does no more than call on all the security pledged for the debt.when it does so,it does not violate the prohibition of deficiency judgments.see also birman loeb,supra,th at,d the courts have repeatedly held that resort to additional security following a nonjudicial foreclosure is not an attempt to secure a deficiency judgment.
accordingly,under our case law,there is no requirement under code of civil procedure section that a creditor,after foreclosing on one item of real property security,obtain a judicial determination of any unpaid balance remaining on the debt before resorting to additional security.as we explained in hatch,the language of the provision does not indicate legislative intent to so protect additional property pledged in security for the principal obligation by its express terms,the statute is concerned only with actions to recover deficiency judgments after the security is exhausted.hatch nat.bank,supra,cal d at.no steps must be taken under section to determine the fair market value of any real property security sold in a nonjudicial foreclosure before the creditor is entitled to resort to any additional security for an obligation.hatch,at.t he giving of additional security for a note gives the right to exhaust such security freedland greco,supra,cal d at,see also mortgage guarantee sampsell d,foreclosure sale of real property under a deed of trust does not prevent the creditor from proceeding to recover upon any additional primary security.
significantly,although the legislature has made several nonsubstantive changes to code of civil procedure section subsequent to our decision in hatch nat.bank,supra,cal d,it has not altered the wording or scope of the statute,which continues to refer to a money judgment for the balance due upon an obligation,a deficiency judgment against the personal assets of the borrower.see stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch.
neither appraisal nor judicial determination of fair market value is required as part of nonjudicial foreclosure of real property securing a loan.alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,d.nor is there any requirement that the sales price approximate the fair market value of the property.i t is settled that where there is no irregularity in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale and the purchaser is a bona fide purchaser for value,a great disparity between the sales price and the value of the property is not a sufficient ground for setting aside the sale.id.at,d,quoting moeller lien th,d central nat.bank bell cal d,it is no new doctrine in this state that mere inadequacy of price is not sufficient ground for setting aside a trustee sale legally conducted bfp resolution trust,d m ere inadequacy of the foreclosure sale price is no basis for setting the sale aside,though it may be set aside if the price is so low as to shock the conscience or raise a presumption of fraud or unfairness.thus,in moeller lien,supra,th,d,a sale price of only percent of the value of the property was not grounds for invalidating the sale 
there is no different rule when the creditor is the purchaser of the real property security.anyone,including the creditor,can bid at a foreclosure sale.miller starr,cal.real estate,supra.the creditor is entitled to make a credit bid up to the amount of the indebtedness without payment of additional cash,subd.b.such a credit bid can be made in an amount up to the sum of the total amount due,including the fees and expenses of the trustee,subd.b.t he mortgagee is not required to open the bidding with a full credit bid,but may bid whatever amount he thinks the property worth.indeed,many creditors continually enter low credit bids to provide access to additional security or additional funds.citation.it has been said that this is what the creditor should do cornelison kornbluth cal d.
plaintiffs assert that the policies underlying the antideficiency provisions preclude a creditor from obtaining not only a deficiency judgment,but what they characterize as the functional equivalent of a deficiency judgment.specifically,they argue that application of the fair market value provisions of code of civil procedure section is required to avoid a windfall recovery to the creditor.without such protection,a borrower who secures a debt with items of multiple security runs the risk that all of it will be sold to satisfy the obligation,even if the fair market value of one item of security is sufficient to satisfy the debt.they urge that there is room,and a serious need,for this court to carve out a fair value exception where a creditor holds several items o
