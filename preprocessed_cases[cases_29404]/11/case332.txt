dallas aerospace,dallas,a buyer of a used jet engine from cis air corporation cis,appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york barbara jones,district judge,granting summary judgment to cis.
dallas and cis are both corporations in the business of buying,selling,and leasing aircraft and aircraft engines.the various claims at issue in this appeal arose out of cis sale to dallas of a engine in august under a written agreement.months after the purchase,dallas discovered that the engine had been involved in a hard landing years earlier that rendered the engine not airworthy.airworthy is a term of art in the aviation industry indicating that an engine is safe and that it comports with faa requirements.dallas brought this diversity action alleging various claims under new york law to recover the million it paid for the engine.
the district court agreed with cis that there was no genuine issue of material fact precluding a grant of summary judgment in cis favor and concluded that,as a matter of law for the purposes of dallas breach of contract claim,the agreement between dallas and cis,which disclaimed all representations about the engine,had not been modified for the purposes of its fraud claim,dallas could not show it justifiably relied on any purported misrepresentation under the contract because a the contract specifically disclaimed the very representation alleged to be fraudulent,and b the truth of the allegedly misrepresented matter was easily discoverable by dallas the contract terms were not unconscionable and no special relationship existed between the parties that would trigger a duty to disclose on cis part,for the purposes of dallas negligent misrepresentation claim.
background 
a japan air systems jas aircraft experienced a hard landing in japan in april.while the ensuing fire substantially destroyed the aircraft,the engine remained intact and was salvaged from the wreckage.the insurance company that took title to the engine sold it to charlotte aircraft corporation charlotte.in,american air ventures,aav,a broker,negotiated the sale of the engine to cis and took title from charlotte pursuant to a separate contract before transferring it to cis for,which was paid directly by cis to charlotte.cis paid aav a finder fee of.
cis understood that it would have to overhaul the engine to get it back into serviceable condition under guidelines established by the engine manufacturer,pratt whitney p w,for returning a used engine to service in compliance with faa regulations.cis claims that it had no specific knowledge of the hard landing,however,and undertook a less expensive overhaul that was appropriate for used,but not,engines.cis sent the engine for overhaul to st aerospace st,a reputable repair shop authorized by the faa,with overhaul instructions that had been provided by aav.cis asserts that it relied on aav because cis has no internal technical staff.cis paid approximately for the overhaul and,in due course,st returned the engine to cis,certifying as it turned airworthy.st was not aware of the engine status,which,under the p w guidelines,would have necessitated a overhaul.
upon return of the engine to cis,cis found dallas as a willing buyer in august,and the two parties quickly reduced their agreement to a written contract,subject to dallas inspection of the engine and its records.while the contract between charlotte and aav expressly stated that the engine had been involved in an accident,neither the contract between aav and cis,nor the one between cis and dallas contained any such provision.the extent of cis own knowledge about the hard landing and cis corporate relationship with aav are both disputed.it is undisputed,however,that dallas was not told prior to its purchase about the hard landing in japan or that st overhaul was other than adequate.dallas extensive baroscopic physical inspection of the engine prior to purchase revealed no defects and its review of the engine records did not bring the fact of the jas accident to light.accordingly,dallas consummated its purchase of the engine from cis.
dallas contract with cis,dated august,the agreement disclaimed that cis had made any representations regarding the engine.it specifically disclaimed any representation as to the engine airworthiness in paragraph and obligated plaintiff to accept delivery of the engine and its records,in paragraph.all of the exclusions and disclaimers in the agreement were conspicuous,as required by of the uniform commercial code ucc and the agreement contained an integration clause stating that no warranties,representations or undertakings have been made by either party except as expressly set forth herein.on august,dallas signed the agreement as well as an engine delivery receipt,which recited that dallas accepted delivery of the engine and confirms its acceptance of the engine,in as is where is condition.
dallas did not pay for the engine until september,or thereabout.dallas claims that at the time it payment,it also delivered to cis a purchase order that,after stating that a ll the terms and conditions of this purchase are stated in the contract dated august,purported to modify the contract by requiring cis to deliver a serviceable and airworthy engine that had not been subjected to extreme stress or heat as in a major engine failure,accident,incident or fire.the status of the purchase order is a disputed issue and is discussed more fully in connection with dallas breach of contract claim below.
dallas subsequently leased the engine to sky trek airlines,and the engine was flown in daily service for several months without incident.in,dallas attempted to sell the engine,but the prospective buyer walked away from the negotiations after informing dallas that the engine was.p w confirmed this information to dallas p w had always known about the engine history because it keeps records on every engine it manufactures,including data related to incidents and accidents.while just who had access to the p w records at the time of dallas negotiations with cis is disputed,it is not disputed that both jas and charlotte knew about the engine history and would not have withheld the information if they had been asked about it by dallas at any time.
after unsuccessfully trying to recover its purchase price from cis,dallas filed suit against cis for breach of contract,fraudulent misrepresentation,and negligent misrepresentation in the district court.applying new york law,pursuant to the agreement of the parties,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of cis on all of dallas claims.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.when ruling on a summary judgment motion,the district court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
b.the breach of contract claim 
dallas alleges that cis breached their agreement by delivering an engine that was falsely represented as airworthy based on an airworthiness inspection for engines performed by cis responds that two clear and unambiguous contractual provisions in the agreement disclaim any representation as to airworthiness.paragraph of the agreement states with emphasis in the original 
disclaimer of warranty seller has not made and does not make,nor shall seller be deemed to have made or given,and hereby expressly disclaims,any warranty,guaranty or representation,express or implied,as to the engine title,airworthiness,design,value,operation,condition,quality,durability,suitability,merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose 
paragraph of the agreement states 
this agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the purchase and sale of the e ngine,and no warranties,representations or undertakings have been made by either party except as expressly set forth herein.any other previous oral or written communications,representations,agreements or understanding between the parties are no longer of any force and effect,and are superseded and replaced in their entirety by the provisions of this agreement.
dallas asserts that the foregoing disclaimer provisions were nullified by a subsequent purchase order it claims to have delivered to cis with its payment on september.the record,however,contains no affirmative testimonial or documentary evidence that the purchase order was ever sent by dallas or that it was ever received by cis.while we assume that it was sent and received for the purposes of summary judgment,dallas claim still fails as a matter of law.
the district court applied the standard battle of the forms analysis set forth in ucc accordingly,the district court rejected dallas purported modification because the new contract term contained in the purchase order materially alter ed the contract without the express consent of d efendant it was therefore ineffective pursuant to ucc b.dallas argues that the district court erred in applying to construe the purported modification,and that the applicable provision is ucc.
we need not decide whether or is the proper provision under which dallas purchase order should be construed under either provision the purported modification was ineffective.
dallas does not dispute the district court conclusion that under the additional terms contained in its purchase order materially altered the terms of the agreement,and thus were ineffective absent cis express assent.nor could it,given that the terms contained in the purchase order voided the express disclaimers contained in the agreement,thereby altering the allocation of risk expressly agreed upon by the parties.
lorbrook g t,cited by the district court,reinforces the point.there,a party attempt to add a forum non conveniens clause by means of a purchase order that was issued without the express consent of the other party was held to be an ineffective material alteration under.as was the case in lorbrook,dallas attempt here to undo the disclaimer of representations can only be considered an unsuccessful ploy unilaterally to add a term not covered by the preexisting binding contract.id.at.
ucc,entitled modification,rescission and waiver,states,in relevant part 
an agreement modifying a contract within this article needs no consideration to be binding.
a signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing can not be otherwise modified or rescinded 
the requirements of the statute of frauds section of this article section must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.
as dallas notes,the agreement does not exclude modifications,so does not apply.however,because the agreement as purportedly modified is a sale of goods for or more,it does fall within ucc,the statute of frauds.the relevant portions of ucc read 
except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought 
a contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection but which is valid in other respects is enforceable c with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted 
dallas argues that the modification satisfies because although cis did not sign the modification embodied in the purchase order after it purportedly received it,cis accepted payment for the engine after it received the purchase order with the modification,signifying its intention to be bound by it under c.thus,dallas urges,and c,when applied together,give effect to the terms of the purchase order.
this argument is misguided.the function of c is to preclude a party from raising a statute of frauds defense where the parties have already performed their obligations under the alleged contract.the rationale underlying the exception is that r eceipt and acceptance either of goods or of the price constitutes an unambiguous overt admission by both parties that a contract actually exists.ucc,official comment.accordingly,partial performance of contractual obligations validates a contract,but only to the extent of such partial performance.id.here,however,because acceptance of payment for the engine was entirely consistent with cis rights and obligations under the unmodified agreement,it can not be said that cis performance constitute d an unambiguous overt admission that the contract had been modified.
but even if the purchase order did satisfy c,that fact is insufficient alone to render it an enforceable modification under.compliance with is only one of the requirements a purported modification must meet its purpose is solely to remove the bar of the s tatute of f rauds.bazak int l mast,ucc,official comment.
to be enforceable under,the purported modification must still be based on an agreement to modify,as required under,as well as be valid in other respects,as required under.under new york law,parties may modify a contract by another agreement,by course of performance,or by conduct amounting to a waiver or estoppel.ct chems.vinmar impex,see martin peyton.indeed,f undamental to the establishment of a contract modification is proof of each element requisite to the formulation of a contract,including mutual assent to its terms.beacon terminal chemprene,see also becker faber,holding that contractual obligations can not be modified without the consent of the party that has assumed the obligation.
dallas does not contend that the purchase order constituted a mutual agreement to modify.instead,it argues that cis course of performance demonstrated mutual assent to the modification.dallas relies primarily on hunt oil ferc,cir,where the court applied ucc together with c and held that a contract modification was enforceable under mississippi and texas law.there,however,the parties subsequent course of performance of the contract confirmed a prior oral modification.here,dallas concedes that there was no oral modification.rather,it contends that cis acceptance of payment amounted to a course of performance signifying its assent.however,a single act of accepting payment is not a course of performance sufficient to demonstrate mutual assent.see ucc james white robert summers,uniform commercial code,c,at ed ct,at requiring repeated occasions for performance and opportunity for objection emphasis added.
moreover,for a course of performance to demonstrate mutual assent to a modification,it must be unequivocally referable to the modification.rose spa realty,golf,prods.investors.similarly,for conduct to amount to a waiver or estoppel,it must not otherwise be compatible with the agreement as written rather,the conduct of the parties must evidence an indisputable mutual departure from the written agreement.rose,at.here,because cis acceptance of payment after having delivered the engine was wholly consistent with the agreement,it fails to demonstrate mutual assent to the modification.see beacon terminal,at fact that defendant paid bills charging higher rate did not demonstrate mutual assent to higher rate.
while we have assumed for summary judgment purposes that the purchase order was sent and received at some point,that assumption can not be used to bootstrap a finding of mutual assent absent some evidence that cis received it prior to accepting payment and issuing the bill of sale.see celotex,at.one of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses.because dallas payment was sent by wire transfer,the purchase order was necessarily sent through other channels.dallas witness testified that,as a general matter,dallas mailed purchase orders out.it often fax es them out beforehand.thus,even if we assumed that the purchase order and payment were sent simultaneously,there is no evidence to support a finding that cis received the purchase order prior to its accepting payment and issuing the bill of sale the next day.in any case,dallas signed an engine delivery receipt on august,representing that it accepted the engine,rendering the purchase order an attempt to accept anew,with a new condition,something it had already accepted more than a week before dallas plainly does contend that it revoked its acceptance of august.
finally,we note that while cis course of conduct was at all times consistent with the terms of the agreement,dallas own conduct was inconsistent with the belief that the agreement had been modified.as noted by the district court,dallas did not assert that the agreement had been modified until it filed its opposition to cis motion for summary judgment,some months after the litigation began.in addition,dallas complaint admitted that the agreement was the contract between the parties numerous witnesses for dallas acknowledged that its contract with cis was the one announced in the agreement,without mentioning the purported modification and dallas inventory receipt of september,after cis accepted reference to the purchase order but still recites that the terms and conditions associated with the engine are contained in the agreement of august.while this conduct falls largely beyond the course of contract performance,it reinforces our conclusion here that the asserted modification was ineffective.ct,at refusing to enforce alleged modification where parties subsequent course of conduct was inconsistent with terms of modification.
under all of the circumstances,no reasonable jury could find that the parties agreed to modify the agreement so as to nullify its disclaimer provisions.accordingly,for all the foregoing reasons,the district court grant of summary judgment on the appellant breach of contract claim is affirmed.
c.the fraudulent misrepresentation claim 
to succeed on a theory of fraudulent misrepresentation under new york law,a plaintiff must show that the defendant made a false representation of a material fact to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of justifiable reliance upon that fact.see sec.investor prot.bdo seidman,brackett griswold,the elements requisite to sustain an action for fraud are a false representation,known by defendant to be such,made by the defendant,calculated and intended to influence the plaintiff,and which came to his knowledge,and in reliance upon which he,in good faith,suffered the injury of which he complains.under new york law,each element of a fraud claim must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.see hutt lumbermens mut.cas.
dallas alleges that w hen cis air delivered to plaintiff the e ngine r ecords,cis air knew that the e ngine r ecords falsely certified the e ngine as airworthy.plaintiff complaint.dallas offers evidence,hotly disputed by cis,that cis knew the engine was involved in a hard landing,though there is no dispute that cis failed to disclose that fact.for the purposes of this appeal and cis motion for summary judgment,we accept as true dallas elaborate conspiracy cis and aav were in cahoots to defraud we thus assume that cis made a material misrepresentation.dallas fraud claim founders,nevertheless,because dallas can not demonstrate justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation given the agreement explicit disclaimers and dallas ability to discover the truth about the misrepresentation.
for the reasons discussed in connection with dallas breach of contract claim,we conclude that the relevant agreement on the fraud claim is the agreement signed by both parties in august,unmodified by dallas purchase order.that agreement precludes dallas from claiming reliance on any asserted misrepresentation because a party can not justifiably rely on a representation that has been disclaimed by agreement.see danann realty harris.to be sure,it is well established that a general,boilerplate disclaimer of a party representations can not defeat a claim for fraud.see id.at citing bridger goldsmith.however,a party can not justifiably rely on a representation that is specifically disclaimed in an agreement,as occurred here.id.in this case,the agreement,in paragraph,explicitly disclaims any representations about the airworthiness of the engine.in addition to paragraph,the agreement integration clause,paragraph,specifies that the written agreement supersede s and replace s in their entirety a ny other previous oral or written communications,representations,agreements or understanding between the parties.moreover,the engine delivery receipt contains a conspicuous as is where is acknowledgment of receipt of the engine in its condition,a receipt the agreement required dallas to execute at paragraph.section a of the ucc provides that the term as is,when used in a contract for the sale of goods,negates all implied warranties concerning the condition of the goods.see also ucc,official comment.as we recognized in grumman allied,rohr,cir,danann stands for the principle that where the parties to an agreement have expressly allocated risks,the judiciary shall not intrude into their contractual relationship.
dallas argues that its case comes within a recognized exception to danann for misrepresented facts that are peculiarly within the knowledge of the declarant.see warner theatre assocs.metro.life ins,cir danann,at.that exception holds that if the allegedly misrepresented facts are peculiarly within the misrepresenting party knowledge,even a specific disclaimer will not undermine another party allegation of reasonable reliance on the misrepresentations.warner theatre,at.
this exception raises the question of what it means for a fact to be peculiarly within someone knowledge,a question that new york case law does not clearly answer.the district court agreed with dallas that to defeat the peculiarly within exception,the plaintiff must have a means to ascertain the truth underlying a misrepresentation that has been made by the defendant.
dallas claims that it could not have directly obtained p w engine event history eeh because they were exclusively accessible only to owners at the relevant time period at issue.therefore,dallas argues,it should be irrelevant that the p w report exposed the fact that the engine was.we are inclined to agree with dallas and disagree with the district court that the eeh direct availability to dallas presented an open factual question that could not be resolved on summary judgment.nevertheless,the existence of this factual dispute does not defeat cis entitlement to summary judgment because dallas had independent means of learning about the engine history.as dallas conceded at oral argument,both charlotte and jas knew about the hard landing and would have disclosed it to anybody if asked.of course,dallas knew of their prior ownership of the engine.finally,even if dallas is correct that only owners could procure the p w reports,dallas could have asked cis to procure one for it.accordingly,we agree with the district court that the hard landing was not peculiarly within cis knowledge because dallas had available the means of ascertaining the truth,which was readily accessible to any interested party who cared to make inquiry.banque arabe et internationale maryland bank,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
dallas counters that it was not put on inquiry notice about the misrepresentation and,therefore,that it was not reckless in failing to investigate further the airworthiness of the engine.under the law of new york,however,whether dallas was reckless or on inquiry notice is not relevant in this context involving a signed agreement containing a disclaimer of the very representation alleged to have been fraudulently made.the recklessness standard invoked by dallas is drawn from the section securities fraud context it is inapposite in the context of an ordinary fraud action between two experienced and sophisticated parties.see,royal am.managers,irc holding,cir using the recklessness standard in the context of a securities fraud action.moreover,even the cases involving the recklessness standard in the securities fraud context do not involve a signed disclaimer for the very representation alleged to have been fraudulent.indeed,the dis
