we must decide whether stores,may be liable for false imprisonment because of its failure to disclose to the district attorney that its check identification system could provide inaccurate information,resulting in the arrest of innocent persons.the trial court said no.but the court of appeals said yes,and reversed the trial court summary judgment for we hold that can not be held liable for false imprisonment because there is no evidence that it knowingly provided the district attorney with false information intending that martin rodriguez be arrested.we reverse the court of appeals judgment in part and render judgment for.
on february,rodriguez was spending his saturday at a hays county public park when a police officer passing by asked to see his identification.rodriguez produced his driver license.the officer found that a warrant had been issued for his arrest on a charge of theft by check.rodriguez was handcuffed and taken to the hays county jail,where he remained from saturday afternoon until he made bail sunday evening.the next day rodriguez spoke with an assistant district attorney,who learned the following facts after a short investigation.
while rodriguez was employed by r c enterprises,a company owned by rex long,he purchased supplies for r c at the local,paying by company check.because rodriguez was the first employee to present an r c check there,register prompted the cashier to request personal identification.rodriguez offered his driver license,and the cashier entered his license number into check identification system.under that system,any r c check presented thereafter would be approved without a prompt for further identification,and register would automatically print rodriguez driver license number on the back of the presented r c check.store policy further required the cashiers to request identification if the check appeared defective in some respect,if they had a question about the check,the signature,or the amount of the check,and to print the drawer name under the signature if the signature was illegible.
in july,after rodriguez had left the company employ,long purchased goods at the same with an r c check for.long signed the check illegibly,but his name was not printed under the illegible signature as required by store policy.although the check contained r c address and business phone number,its only legible personal identification was rodriguez license number,which register automatically imprinted on the check back.
long r c check,bearing his illegible signature,was returned for insufficient funds.following the store usual procedure,employees called the phone number printed on the check and sent three letters to the address it listed for r c.the third letter,sent certified mail,was returned as undeliverable.an employee then filled out a preprinted hot check complaint form and delivered that form and the returned check to the hays county district attorney office in september.the complaint listed r c enterprises as the check maker,and rodriguez driver license number was written in the space provided for the maker number.the complaint was signed by widener,a former assistant manager.above his signature,the form stated i understand that if charges are filed a warrant will be issued for the maker who may be placed in jail.had nothing further to do with processing its complaint or filing the criminal charge.
shortly after rodriguez visit with the assistant district attorney,the charges against him were dismissed.he then sued for malicious prosecution,false imprisonment,negligence and gross negligence,libel,invasion of privacy,and later added an unfair debt collection claim.filed a motion requesting summary judgment under both traditional and no evidence standards.the trial court granted summary judgment on all of rodriguez claims except unfair debt collection,which rodriguez subsequently nonsuited.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court summary judgment on all but the false imprisonment claim and the only claim now before us is the false imprisonment claim.
the essential elements of false imprisonment are willful detention without consent and without authority of law.contends that there was no evidence that willfully detained rodriguez.in reviewing a summary judgment,we examine the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,looking to see if rodriguez presented more than a scintilla of evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on the element of willful detention the court of appeals noted that,in the complaint delivered to the district attorney,failed to disclose that it knew that its check identification system could provide an erroneous driver license number in relation to a company check.failure to disclose this possibility,according to the court of appeals,raised a fact issue about whether could be liable for rodriguez alleged false imprisonment we disagree.
no employee participated in rodriguez arrest and detention.only connection to the imprisonment was delivering the returned check and complaint to the district attorney office.but in texas,as both parties concede,liability for false imprisonment extends beyond those who willfully participate in detaining the complaining party to those who request or direct the detention false imprisonment first element may thus be satisfied by conduct that is intended to cause one to be detained,and in fact causes the detention,even when the actor does not participate in the detention we have sometimes referred to this causation standard as instigat ion of the false imprisonment 
when the alleged detention results from an unlawful arrest,to prove instigation a plaintiff must show that the defendant clearly directed or requested the arrest as the restatement explains,i n the case of an arrest,instigation is the equivalent,in words or conduct,of officer,arrest that man to hold a third party liable for instigating the detention,then,the act of arrest must be made by the officer,not of his or her own volition,but to carry out the request of the defendant.
a private citizen who merely reports a crime and identifies the suspect to law enforcement authorities has not requested or directed the suspect arrest,and will not be liable for instigating a subsequent false imprisonment a citizen has a clear legal right to report criminal misconduct to authorities,and from the mere exercise of this right the law will not permit the inference to be drawn that he requested or directed the arrest,though it be conceded that but for its exercise the arrest would never have been made.this is true even when the reporting party mistakenly identifies the wrong person further,i t is not enough for instigation that the actor has given information to the police about the commission of a crime,or has accused the other of committing it,so long as he leaves to the police the decision as to what shall be done about any arrest,without persuading or influencing them.
the complaint form that filled out alleged the commission of a crime and provided information that the district attorney office could use to identify the suspect.by signing the complaint,certified that it knew the information provided could lead to an arrest.but the form contained no explicit request or direction to have any particular person arrested.ordinarily then,act of filing this complaint would not,by itself,make it liable for rodriguez subsequent detention 
but rodriguez asserts,and the court of appeals held that a party providing information to legal authorities may nevertheless be liable for false imprisonment when it fails to disclose potentially exculpatory facts in its report.rodriguez argues that a person who supplies incomplete information renders the authorities reasonable exercise of discretion impossible,so that the law may justly charge that person with directing the false imprisonment no matter who actually made the decision to arrest.thus,according to rodriguez,can be liable for his alleged false imprisonment because it failed to inform the district attorney that it knew that its check identification system could provide an erroneous driver license number in relation to a company check.
rodriguez asserts that
