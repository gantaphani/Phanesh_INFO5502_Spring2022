transclean corporation,james viken,jon lang,and donald johnson collectively transclean brought suit against bridgewood services,bridgewood,alleging that the automatic transmission fluid changing machine manufactured and sold by bridgewood,the machine,infringed transclean patent.transclean obtained a judgment in its favor,including a damages award of.the judgment and award were affirmed on appeal.transclean bridgewood,transclean i.
transclean then filed a separate patent infringement suit against jiffy lube international,jiffy lube and more than thirty other fast lube businesses,each of which had purchased one or more machines from bridgewood.that case is the subject of the present appeal.
in this case,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of jiffy lube and eight other defendants participating defendants,holding that under the doctrine of claim preclusion,the judgment against bridgewood bars transclean from bringing a separate infringement action against bridgewood customers.the district court previously had entered default judgment in favor of transclean against several other defendants defaulting defendants,none of whom had answered the complaint.because we agree with the district court that under the doctrine of claim preclusion transclean may not obtain relief against the participating defendants,we affirm that portion of the district court judgment.in light of that affirmance,we conclude that the claims against the defaulting defendants should be disposed of in the same manner accordingly,the judgment in favor of transclean and against the defaulting defendants is reversed.
background 
viken,lang,and johnson are the owners of patent the patent transclean is their exclusive licensee.the patent is directed to an apparatus for changing automatic transmission fluid.in october,transclean filed a patent infringement suit in the united states district court for the district of minnesota against bridgewood,a manufacturer and distributor of transmission service equipment.soon thereafter,bridgewood sold its assets to century manufacturing company,which took a license from transclean under the patent for machines sold on or after may.any machines manufactured before that date remained the subject of litigation between transclean and bridgewood.
this court opinion in transclean i discusses the bridgewood litigation in detail here we provide only the facts of that case that are relevant to the present appeal.with regard to liability issues,the trial court in the bridgewood litigation granted transclean motion for summary judgment that bridgewood infringed claims and of the patent,after barring bridgewood from asserting it did not infringe as a sanction for bridgewood failure to answer an interrogatory seeking the bases for its position.when the case proceeded to trial,a jury found that bridgewood infringed claim.on appeal we affirmed the judgment of infringement of claims and,but after correcting the claim construction we vacated the judgment of infringement of claim.transclean i,at.
with regard to damages,the jury in the bridgewood case awarded transclean three types of damages totaling million.id.at.the trial court granted bridgewood motion for a new trial or remittitur in the amount of,the highest amount of reasonable royalty damages that the jury could have awarded based on the evidence.id.at.transclean apparently accepted the remittitur,and neither party appealed that portion of the damages award.id.transclean alleges it has not collected on the judgment against bridgewood.
soon after this court affirmed the judgment against bridgewood,transclean filed the current infringement suit in the district of minnesota,this time against jiffy lube and more than thirty other fast lube businesses,including many small,independently owned shops that use a single machine.in this case,the subject of the present appeal,transclean alleges that the defendants infringe the patent by using machines purchased from bridgewood prior to may.thus the accused devices in this case were also the subject of the suit against bridgewood.transclean seeks a reasonable royalty of for the use of each allegedly infringing device.
several defendants failed to answer the complaint,and transclean filed a motion for default judgment against them.the trial court granted the motion in part,ordering entry of default judgment and a permanent injunction against those defendants but finding that it was premature to enter a default damages award at that time.transclean bill clark oil,order 
transclean,jiffy lube,and some of the other participating defendants filed various motions for summary judgment,most of which alleged that the judgment in the bridgewood litigation had some preclusive effect.transclean filed a motion for summary judgment in which it argued that the defendants in this case should be precluded from asserting a defense because the bridgewood litigation concluded with a judgment of infringement by the same machines.as part of its argument that issue preclusion applied,transclean asserted that the defendants were in privity with bridgewood.the trial court denied transclean motion on the ground that the issue of infringement was not actually litigated in the bridgewood litigation because the infringement determination in that case was in large part a sanction for abuse of discovery.transclean reg l car wash,wl,at.june.
in the same opinion,the trial court granted jiffy lube motion for summary judgment that transclean was precluded from bringing infringement claims against jiffy lube.the trial court concluded that the elements of claim preclusion were satisfied.first,there was no dispute that the bridgewood litigation ended in a final judgment on the merits or that the court properly exercised jurisdiction in that matter.nor did transclean dispute that jiffy lube was in privity with bridgewood,the defendant in the prior litigation.finally,transclean did not dispute that during the first litigation it was aware of jiffy lube use of machines and could have brought claims against jiffy lube.id.at.the trial court noted,however,that summary judgment based on claim preclusion was not appropriate as to other defendants until they came forward with evidence that transclean knew or should have known about them during the bridgewood litigation.id.at.
transclean later conceded it was aware that each of the participating defendants had purchased and used at least one machine while the bridgewood litigation was pending.in response thereto,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the participating defendants.transclean bill clark oil,wl,at.

discussion 
participating defendants 
transclean primary argument against the application of claim preclusion as a bar to its infringement claims against the participating defendants is that the law generally allows a patentee to sue manufacturers or sellers and users of an infringing device as joint tortfeasors,and that the law permits multiple suits,just not multiple,double recoveries.this rule has its genesis in birdsell shaliol,in which the supreme court held that a patentee who had recovered only nominal damages against the manufacturer of an infringing product could subsequently sue users of the infringing product.the court indicated that a patentee may not sue users of an infringing product for damages if he has collected actual damages from a manufacturer or seller,and those damages fully compensate the patentee for infringement by users.id.at.see also glenayre,jackson,citing birdsell and holding that a patentee could not sue users for damages because actual damages covering the use of the product had already been recovered from the manufacturer shockley arcan,each joint is liable for the full amount of damages up to a full single recovery suffered by the patentee.citing birdsell,at.
in light of birdsell and its progeny,transclean contends it is free to sue users of the machine because it has not collected on the judgment against bridgewood.that is true as far as it goes,but transclean argument fails to take into account the separate issue of claim preclusion,under which such a second suit,otherwise available,may be barred.as the trial court correctly noted,the issue in this case is not whether transclean may sue both the manufacturer and users of the machine.the issue is whether,having failed to bring infringement claims against the users in the first litigation,transclean should be barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion from bringing those claims in a second suit.a plaintiff who chooses to bring two separate actions against two tortfeasors who are jointly responsible for the same injury runs the risk that the court will find the parties sufficiently related that the second action is barred by claim preclusion.mars nippon conlux.despite transclean protestations to the contrary,birdsell and the other cases relied on by transclean involve only the doctrine of full compensation.see glenayre,at donald chisum,chisum on patents b iii.they do not address the added question of when and how claim preclusion may arise in such second suits.
we now turn to that claim preclusion principles bar transclean claims against the participating defendants in this case.as an initial matter,the parties disagree about whether the claim preclusion issues in this case should be decided under the law of the federal circuit or the applicable regional circuit,here the eighth circuit.transclean argues that the question before us is specific to patent a patentee may sue the users of an infringing device when it can not recover on a judgment awarded against the manufacturer of the same infringing device.as discussed,that question and the cases relied on by transclean do not relate to claim preclusion but instead involve the doctrine of full compensation.
rather,as we shall explain,the key question before us is whether transclean should be bound by its repeated statements that the defendants were in privity with bridgewood,against whom transclean obtained a judgment in an earlier litigation.this question is not one peculiar to patent law,and therefore we will look to eighth circuit law for guidance in deciding the issue.see mars,at looking to regional circuit law to determine whether claim preclusion may be invoked by corporate parent following patent infringement judgment against wholly owned subsidiary.
under the doctrine of claim preclusion in the eighth circuit,an earlier suit bars a party from asserting a claim in a later suit if the first suit resulted in a final judgment on the merits the prior judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction both suits involve the same cause of action and both suits involve the same parties or their privies.banks int l union,technical,salaried mach.workers,cir.two suits are based on the same cause of action if they arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts.id.the parties do not dispute that the first two elements are satisfied.
transclean argues in its briefs that its cause of action against the participating defendants is different from its cause of action in the bridgewood litigation.in the earlier case,according to transclean,bridgewood was accused of infringing the patent by making and selling machines.here,in contrast,transclean alleges that the defendants infringe by using machines.however,this case concerns the same patent and the exact same devices that were the subject of the bridgewood litigation.there is little doubt that a second suit against bridgewood itself for using the same machines that were the subject of the earlier infringement judgment would involve the same cause of action as the prior litigation under the doctrine of claim preclusion.indeed,transclean attorney conceded this point at oral argument.
in our view,the real question is whether the relationship between the defendants and bridgewood was so close that they were in privity for claim preclusion purposes.if the answer is yes,it would follow that the case before us involves the same cause of action as the bridgewood litigation,and transclean would be precluded from maintaining the claims in this suit.thus,in the context of this case,we need not decide whether infringement by making and selling a patented invention and infringement by using the patented invention generally involve the same cause of action the privity issue answers the question for us.
the issue of privity was not in dispute before the trial court because transclean admitted several times that the defendants in this case were in privity with bridgewood.in its amended complaint,transclean alleged that the defendants were bound by the infringement judgment in the bridgewood litigation.to support this claim,transclean took the position that issue preclusion principles barred the defendants from relitigating the infringement issue.accordingly,transclean asserted in an interrogatory answer that jiffy lube and bridgewood were in privity because jiffy lube purchased infringing machines manufactured by bridgewood.transclean continued to press its issue preclusion theory in a summary judgment motion,alleging again that the defendants were in privity with bridgewood.as transclean put it,bridgewood and the defendants in this case are closely related and have an identical interest in defeating transclean infringement allegations and invalidating the patent.at.
having already alleged that the defendants and bridgewood were in privity when it argued that issue preclusion barred the defendants from raising a defense,transclean apparently felt compelled to admit that the parties were also in privity for claim preclusion purposes.significantly,in its opposition to jiffy lube motion for summary judgment,transclean admitted that for purposes of claim preclusion jiffy lube and bridgewood are in privity because bridgewood was a manufacturer of the infringing product and jiffy lube is a user of the same infringing product.at.and in its appeal brief to this court,transclean expressly stated that the first,privity element of claim preclusion is met.as the district court noted,and as they admitted themselves,the participating defendants have a special relationship of privity with bridgewood.appellant br.at.only in its reply brief and at oral argument did transclean begin to retreat from its position that privity exists between bridgewood and the participating defendants,at least insofar as it would bar through claim preclusion transclean infringement claims.
the term privity is a label that expresses the conclusion that a particular nonparty in earlier litigation should be treated the same as a party to that litigation for claim preclusion purposes.mars,at.in the eighth circuit,privity exists when the parties are so closely related and their interests are so nearly identical that it is fair to treat them as the same parties for purposes of determining the preclusive effect of the first judgment.ruple city of vermillion,cir.
it is important to recognize that under this standard,a manufacturer or seller of a product who is sued for patent infringement typically is not in privity with a party,otherwise unrelated,who does no more than purchase and use th
