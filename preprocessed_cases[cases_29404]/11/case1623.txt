background 
the following facts are not disputed.agro is a producer and exporter of certain preserved mushrooms subject to an antidumping order issued on february.notice of amendment of final determination of sales at less than fair value and antidumping duty order certain preserved mushrooms from india,antidumping order.on february,commerce published a notice of opportunity to request an annual administrative review of the antidumping order.antidumping or countervailing duty order,finding,or suspended investigation opportunity to request administrative review.by a letter dated february,defendant coalition for fair preserved mushroom trade coalition requested,pursuant to,that commerce conduct an annual review of the antidumping order at issue here,and further requested,pursuant to j,that commerce determine whether antidumping duties had been absorbed by agro and several other companies subject to the antidumping order.
on march,commerce initiated the fourth administrative review of the antidumping order.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews.this review covered the period between february,and january,the por.on september,commerce stated in a memorandum placed in the administrative record that,although it had initially determined that it would not conduct a duty absorption analysis in connection with the annual review because agro and several other companies subject to the antidumping order made only export price sales to the united states it now concluded that because they also act as importer of record for certain of their sales it is appropriate to conduct a duty absorption analysis with respect to these respondents in accordance with our past practice.
commerce notified agro of this determination in a letter of september.in this letter,commerce provided agro an opportunity to place into the record,no later than january,proof that unaffiliated purchasers will ultimately pay the antidumping duties assessed during the por on those sales for which agro acted as the importer of record,and warned that commerce would deem duty absorption to have occurred in the absence of such proof.agro did not respond to the letter.
on march,commerce published the preliminary results of the fourth administrative review.certain preserved mushrooms from india preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review,preliminary results.in the preliminary results,commerce reiterated the rationale offered in the september memorandum for conducting a duty absorption inquiry under the facts presented here,with the addition of a citation to section a of the tariff act of codified at a.id.at.after noting agro failure to provide any evidence in response to the letter of september,commerce preliminarily found that agro had absorbed antidumping duties during the por on those sales for which it was the importer of record.id.
in response to the preliminary results,agro submitted a case brief on june,challenging,inter alia,commerce duty absorption finding.at this stage,agro sole contention was that there was evidence in the record that agro customers often pay the antidumping duty directly to the customs service,even though agro is the importer of record,and thus duty absorption did not take place during the por.finding this submission both untimely and insufficient,commerce confirmed its preliminary duty absorption finding on august.certain preserved mushrooms from india final results of antidumping duty administrative review,final results.
agro filed an appeal with the court of international trade on october,challenging commerce duty absorption finding,along with several other findings made in the final results.the court of international trade affirmed commerce absorption determination on the grounds noted above.agro dutch,wl,at.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the purpose of the antidumping statute is to prevent foreign goods from being sold at unfairly low prices in the united states to the injury of existing or potential united states producers.fag italia,united states.to that end,if commerce and the international trade commission itc determine that a foreign exporter or producer has been or is likely to be selling goods in the united states at less than fair value to the detriment of united states producers,commerce will issue an antidumping order assessing duties on that foreign exporter or producer.see.
once an antidumping order has been issued,the statute requires that the order be periodically reviewed.first,if requested,commerce will review the order annually to update the applicable duty.id.a b.this is referred to as the annual review.second,the order is automatically terminated after five years unless,upon review in accordance with the procedures established under,commerce determines that revocation of the duty would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping,and the itc determines that revocation would be likely to lead to material injury to the relevant united states industry.id.c.this is referred to as the sunset review.third,during the second or fourth annual review after the publication of an antidumping order,commerce,if requested,shall determine whether antidumping duties have been absorbed by a foreign producer or exporter subject to the order if the subject merchandise is sold in the united states through an importer who is affiliated with such foreign producer or exporter.id.a.this is referred to as the duty absorption inquiry.
as we have previously noted,t he purpose of a duty absorption inquiry is to ensure that foreign exporters subject to antidumping orders do not undermine the purpose of the antidumping laws by absorbing the duty rather than passing the duty on to united states purchasers in the form of higher prices.fag italia,at.a finding of duty absorption during the second or fourth annual review does not affect the duty imposed as a result of such review.see uruguay round agreements act statement of administrative action saa,doc,at,reprinted in.rather,commerce reports the findings made during the absorption inquiry to the itc for consideration during the sunset review.a see also id.a d requiring itc to consider the results of the duty absorption review during the sunset review.thus,t he consequence of a finding of duty absorption by commerce is that the order is less likely to be revoked as a result of a sunset review,as such a finding indicates that the foreign producer or exporter would be able to market more aggressively should the order by revoked as a result of a sunset review.fag italia,at quoting saa at,reprinted in at.this appeal concerns commerce authority to conduct a duty absorption inquiry under a during the second or fourth annual review when a foreign exporter or producer acts as its own importer of record.
agro sole contention on appeal is that commerce was not empowered to conduct a duty absorption inquiry during the fourth annual review of the antidumping order because agro did not sell its merchandise in the united states through an importer who is affiliated with agro,as required by a,but rather acted as its own importer of record for the relevant sales during the por before discussing the merits of this challenge,however,we must first determine whether agro appeal should be dismissed on exhaustion grounds.
it is undisputed that agro failed to raise the argument that forms the basis for the instant appeal during the proceedings before commerce.the court below nevertheless held that t o the extent agro dutch argument implicates a pure question of law,it may be addressed on appeal.in the circumstances presented here,we find that the court below did not abuse its discretion in reaching this conclusion.
as we recently reaffirmed,the application of exhaustion principles in trade cases is subject to the discretion of the judge of the court of international trade.corus staal bv united states,see also d.in the exercise of this discretion,the court of international trade has developed and refined a pure legal question exception to the exhaustion requirement in trade cases.see consol.bearings united states,d.int l trade collecting cases,rev,without passing upon the precise contours of that doctrine as articulated by the court of international trade or minimizing the importance of the exhaustion requirement,see corus staal,at,we conclude that the court below did not abuse its discretion in finding that agro argument regarding the proper interpretation of a presents a pure question of law that can be addressed on appeal despite agro failure to raise such an argument in the proceedings before commerce.unlike consolidated bearings,s tatutory construction alone is sufficient to resolve the merits of the argument raised by agro here,at,as agro has now abandoned the evidentiary arguments raised in its case brief before commerce regarding the duty absorption issue.thus,we will proceed to address the merits of agro claim 
we review de novo whether commerce interpretation of a governing statutory provision is in accordance with law,but we do so within the framework established by chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see,elkem metals united states.under chevron,a reviewing court must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting chevron,at.if congress has done so,the inquiry is at an end the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.quoting chevron,at.it is only i n the absence of clear direction from the statute,that we will then proceed to ask whether there is ambiguous statutory language that might authorize the agency to fill a statutory gap,and,in turn,whether commerce interpretation of ambiguous statutory language is based on a permissible interpretation of the statute.fag italia,at.as the supreme court has made clear,however,an agency interpretation of a statute is not entitled to deference when it goes beyond the meaning that the statute can bear.mci telecomm.v.at t,d.
the dispute between the parties focuses on the first sentence of a.that sentence reads,in full 
during any review under this subsection initiated years or years after the publication of an antidumping duty order under section a of this title,the administering authority,if requested,shall determine whether antidumping duties have been absorbed by a foreign producer or exporter subject to the order if the subject merchandise is sold in the united states through an importer who is affiliated with such foreign producer or exporter.
a emphasis added.it is not contested that the review at issue here was initiated years after the publication of the antidumping order,or that a request was made by the coalition that commerce conduct a duty absorption inquiry.the only question that must be resolved here is whether agro sold its merchandise through an affiliated importer when it acted as its own importer of,whether agro can be affiliated with itself.
in seeking the unambiguous meaning of this language,we begin with the statute definition of the term affiliated.see crawfish processors alliance united states.states 
the following persons shall be considered to be affiliated or affiliated persons 
a members of a family,including brothers and sisters whether by the whole or half blood,spouse,ancestors,and lineal descendants.
b any officer or director of an organization and such organization.
c partners.
d employer and employee.
e any person directly or indirectly owning,controlling,or holding with power to vote,percent or more of the outstanding voting stock or shares of any organization and such organization.
f two or more persons directly or indirectly controlling,controlled by,or under common control with,any person.
g any person who controls any other person and such other person.
for purposes of this paragraph,a person shall be considered to control another person if the person is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other person 
commerce does not claim that one of the definitions conclusively demonstrates that a single person or entity that plays two discrete roles during the dumping,acting both as exporter and importer,as agro did be considered affiliated with itself.commerce instead argues that generally,and g in particular,establishes that affiliation exists where there is a control relationship,and because an entity may control itself,an entity can also be considered as affiliated with itself.agro counters that the definition provided in makes plain that affiliation requires a minimum of two entities,as each of the scenarios listed in that section makes reference to two or more persons or organizations.
commerce reading of and,by extension,a fails to convince us that the term affiliated is sufficiently ambiguous to permit us to proceed to the second step of the chevron analysis,particularly as we find that agro interpretation comports with both the ordinary usage of the term affiliated and the use of that term elsewhere in the antidumping statute.first,agro view that affiliation requires the presence of two or more entities is consistent with the ordinary usage of the word as evidenced by standard dictionary definitions of affiliate as a noun and verb and affiliated.in order to ascertain the established meaning of a term,it is appropriate to consult dictionaries.pesquera mares,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also mci,at.every dictionary we have consulted defines these words such that the concept of a person or organization affiliating with itself is excluded or,at the very least,highly implausible.for example,the oxford english dictionary ed,defines affiliated as a dopted as a child or fixed in paternity.usually fig urative.united in a dependent relation,as the branches of a society to the central organization.id.at.echoing the definition of affiliated given in,black law dictionary ed,defines the noun affiliate as a corporation that is related to another corporation by shareholdings or other means of control a subsidiary,parent,or sibling corporation.id.at emphasis added.see also webster third new international dictionary defining the verb affiliate primarily as to attach as a member or branch.each of these definitions,in turn,draws on the latin antecedents of the term affiliate or affiliated,namely,filius,meaning son,and affiliare,meaning to adopt as a son.see,see also oxford latin dictionary mci,at.examining the latin root of the word modify.as these roots make clear,if we use the word affiliate in its ordinary sense,an organization can no more affiliate with itself than a man can adopt himself as his own son.in short,the ordinary definition of affiliated can not be stretched to accommodate commerce interpretation of that term as used in a,and w e find nothing in the statute to suggest that congress intended to depart from the ordinary definition of that term.pesquera mares,at.
second,as the supreme court has instructed,a term should be construed,if possible,to give it a consistent meaning throughout a particular statute.gu
