does business and professions code section permit disciplinary action against a physician license to practice medicine based solely on the physician failure to complete successfully a substance abuse diversion program we conclude it does not.
when a physician flunks out of a diversion program,the medical board of california board is authorized by statute to file an accusation charging any acts committed before,during,or after the physician participation in the diversion program.it must then prove impairment or unprofessional conduct by clear and convincing evidence.where the circumstances of the physician termination from the diversion program do not otherwise evidence unprofessional conduct or impairment by this standard,we hold that the board does not have authority to revoke or suspend a license based on the failure to complete the diversion program.
we affirm the trial court judgment vacating the administrative decision imposing discipline on lee roy liskey medical license for failure to complete diversion under circumstances not otherwise sufficient to establish unprofessional conduct.
factual and procedural background 
the board began an investigation of real party lee roy liskey liskey in,after receiving an anonymous complaint from a patient.liskey agreed to an evaluation as provided in business and professions code section the evaluating psychiatrist concluded liskey was impaired and recommended he enter the board diversion program for alcohol and substance abuse.liskey signed an agreement to enter the diversion program on january.the pending investigation was closed.in an initial phase of the program,liskey underwent a assessment.he was diagnosed as suffering from substance abuse but was determined to be safe to return to work.the assessment report recommended that he participate in outpatient treatment focusing on prevention and education,and that he be monitored for two years with random drug screens and scheduled therapy.liskey successfully completed a outpatient treatment program from june through october.
during continued monitoring in june and october of,liskey tested positive for cocaine use on two occasions.liskey consistently and adamantly denied cocaine use and argued that the results were false positives.on both occasions,liskey had himself retested by different laboratories,and both times the results were negative for cocaine.nevertheless,the board diversion committee insisted that liskey undergo a course of inpatient treatment because of the two positive test results.when liskey refused to enter the treatment,program administrators terminated him from the diversion program for reasons other than successful completion of the program.
the board thereupon reopened its investigation of liskey.initially,liskey agreed to reenter the diversion program and signed a second agreement.however,he withdrew his agreement and requested that he be reevaluated.james reich,one of the evaluators,recommended that liskey participate in a strict chemical dependency program and that the board monitor his practice.
on the basis of the reich report,the board filed an accusation on february,seeking the revocation or suspension of liskey physician and surgeon certification.the accusation charged as grounds for discipline that liskey ability to practice competently was impaired due to mental physical illness pursuant to section and he had failed to complete successfully the diversion program in which he had agreed to participate pursuant to section.
an administrative law judge heard the matter and concluded that the board failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that liskey ability to practice medicine competently was impaired due to mental or physical illness,either because of alcohol or drug abuse or for any other reason therefore,he found that liskey was not subject to discipline under section.further,the administrative law judge concluded that liskey was not subject to discipline under section because failure to complete the diversion program was not by itself a sufficient basis for discipline.
the board declined to adopt the decision and remanded the matter with directions to the administrative law judge to take further evidence relating to the legislative history of section,subd.c d.the administrative law judge again determined that the evidence was insufficient to conclude liskey was subject to discipline under section.however,in light of the legislative history materials,he reversed his interpretation of section and concluded that section did provide an independent basis for discipline for failure to complete diversion successfully.nevertheless,he concluded that no public need or interest would be served by actually disciplining liskey license for violation of section.
again,the board declined to adopt the administrative law judge decision.in its decision after nonadoption,the board interpreted section to require revocation of liskey license for his failure to complete diversion,notwithstanding the fact that the board adopted the administrative law judge finding that there was no cause for discipline under section.
based on its interpretation of section,on march,the board revoked liskey license and stayed revocation pending his satisfactory completion of two years probation,conditioned on his abstaining from the use of drugs and alcohol,submitting to random drug testing,participating in the diversion program,and having his practice monitored by an approved physician.
liskey filed a petition for administrative mandate in the trial court,seeking review of the board decision.see authorizing superior court review of any decision revoking,suspending or restricting a medical license.the trial court granted liskey petition,finding that there was no cause for disciplinary action under section and that the board lacked any authority to impose discipline against liskey for the mere failure to complete the medical board own diversion program.the court directed the board to set aside its decision.judgment was entered november.
the board then filed a petition for writ of mandate and request for stay in this court.authorizing review of superior court decision by petition for extraordinary writ leone medical board cal th,d.this court issued a temporary stay and an order to show cause directing the parties to appear in court to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted.
discussion 
standard of review 
we are called upon to construe section.the interpretation of section is a question of law,which this court examines independently.we are not bound by the trial court construction.people ex.rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,griffiths superior court th,d.
our primary objective in interpreting a statute is to determine and give effect to the underlying legislative intent.code civ.intent is determined foremost by the plain meaning of the statute language.if the language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.when the language is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,it is proper to examine a variety of extrinsic aids in an effort to discern the intended meaning.see hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d,state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.d.
ii.interpretation of section 
at the time the accusation was filed against liskey,section provided each physician and surgeon who requests participation in a diversion program shall agree to cooperate with the treatment program designed by a committee.any failure to complete successfully a treatment program or an acceptable substitute program may result in the filing of an accusation for discipline which may include any acts giving rise to the original diversion.stats,ch.
the board construes section,in particular the second sentence,as authorizing the board to discipline a physician who,after voluntarily agreeing to participate in a diversion program in lieu of administrative disciplinary proceedings,is dismissed for failing to complete successfully the diversion program.the board urges that the legislative history of section together with the history of a predecessor bill,senate bill,overwhelmingly support its interpretation.
liskey contends that the statute does not allow for physician discipline for the mere failure to complete a diversion program.liskey construes the statute as authorizing the board to file an accusation which may include the acts that gave rise to the original diversion,but not as authorizing termination from the program as an independent ground for discipline.he maintains that the statute is clear and unambiguous.
though we disagree with liskey contention that section interpretation is apparent from the face of the statute,we agree with his ultimate conclusion section does not create an independent basis for discipline and does not authorize the board to impose discipline based solely on a physician failure to complete a diversion program.we reach this conclusion after careful consideration of the due process concerns this case presents,the statutory scheme surrounding section,the apparent purposes underlying the statute,the presence or absence of instructive legislative history,and the board own regulations.see hughes board of architectural examiners,supra,cal th,d,state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals,supra,d.
due process 
whenever possible,a legislative enactment must be construed in such a way as to preserve its constitutionality.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d.t he presumption is that the legislature intended,not to violate the constitution,but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers.shealor city of lodi cal d.we must construe section if at all possible in a manner that avoids any potential due process problems.
liskey argues that neither section nor the agreements of understanding he signed before entering the diversion program provided him with sufficient notice that he could be disciplined solely for failure to complete the diversion program successfully.in his view,which the trial court adopted in its statement of decision,the board disciplinary action against his license is penal in nature.by analogy to the doctrine applied to criminal statutes,liskey contends that section should not be construed to permit discipline solely for failure to complete diversion successfully,because the statute does not state with sufficient definiteness that such a failure constitutes unprofessional conduct and a basis for imposing discipline.kolender lawson,d tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.
the board argues,correctly,that its disciplinary proceedings are intended to protect the public and are not penal in nature.hughes board of architectural examiners,supra,cal th at,d,bryce board of medical quality assurance d.due process considerations do not require that statutes and administrative proceedings for imposing discipline on a professional license be measured by standards developed in criminal law.see ford dealers department of motor vehicles cal d,fn.when an administrative regulation such as section is challenged for vagueness,the standard of constitutional vagueness is less strict than when a criminal law is attacked.ford dealers at.
the fact remains,however,that section does not state clearly that failure to complete diversion successfully is,by itself,unprofessional conduct for which discipline may be imposed.furthermore,the board printed forms of agreement signed by liskey also fail to give the physician notice that if he fails to complete the program,that failure is an independent ground for discipline.in the statements of understanding,liskey agreed only that if terminated by the diversion program for failure to comply with the diversion program requirements i may be prosecuted administratively for violations identified above.italics added.the first paragraph of these agreements sets out four specific violations,and the applicant for diversion is instructed to admit,for the limited purpose of acceptance into diversion,one or more of them by circling those applicable in his or her case.for example,in the agreements signed by liskey,the violation circled is s of alcohol or drugs per b p code section.by his signature on the agreement,the physician acknowledges that the board retains the authority to investigate or continue to investigate any unprofessional conduct committed before,during,or after participation in the diversion program.see,subd.c.these agreements not only fail to notify the physician that failure to complete diversion successfully is an independent ground for discipline,they suggest that the only consequences of failure to complete diversion successfully are those identified in the agreement.
a vagueness standard less strict than that applied to criminal statutes is not the same as no standard at all.a statute authorizing the board to impose discipline against a medical license must include some reasonably clear identification of the basis for imposing that discipline.
in addition,to justify the imposition of discipline,there must be some nexus between an act or omission and the professional fitness or competence to practice.bryce board of medical quality assurance,supra,d at.the legislature has established such a nexus with respect to certain acts or omissions even where the acts or omissions do not actually impair a physician ability to practice medicine,subd.a see griffiths superior court,supra,th at,d.in each such instance,it has done so by expressly identifying the act or omission as an instance of unprofessional conduct.see conviction for violating statutes regarding dangerous drugs,violation of statutes regarding dangerous drugs,subd.a misuse of controlled substances.
to satisfy the due process considerations that attach in disciplinary actions against a professional license,we conclude that section must provide some reasonable indication that a failure to complete diversion successfully constitutes unprofessional conduct before it may be applied to impose discipline solely on that ground.the fact that it does not,and the fact that the board printed agreements of understanding also fail to do so,strongly militate against interpreting section as creating an independent basis for discipline.
statutory scheme 
a statute must be construed in the context of the entire statutory system of which it is a part,in order to achieve harmony among the parts.citation.people woodhead cal d.a court may consider the overall scheme in which an ambiguous statute is included in order to ascertain its intended meaning.hughes board of architectural examiners,supra,cal th at,d.the organization of the division,chapters,and articles is an aid to understanding its purpose.see people hull cal th,d,division,chapter,article,and section headings may properly be considered in determining intent and are entitled to considerable weight.
chapter five,the chapter most relevant here,contains separate articles regulating enforcement article,et and diversion evaluation committees article,et.the enforcement sections of article set out provisions for taking disciplinary action against a physician for acts of unprofessional conduct.they spell out the substantive bases for imposing discipline,defining specific instances of unprofessional conduct see.for example,section,subdivision a defines as unprofessional conduct a physician of controlled substances,dangerous drugs,or alcohol,to an extent that impairs his or her ability to practice medicine safely.
section is part of article,not article.the express purpose of article is to implement a diversion program to rehabilitate physicians with impairment due to abuse of dangerous drugs or alcohol,or due to mental illness or physical illness,affecting competency so that they may be returned to the practice of medicine in a manner which will not endanger the public health and safety.in marked contrast to article,article contained no substantive discipline provisions during the time period relevant to this case.the placement of section in article supports the conclusion that it was not intended to define the mere act of failure to complete diversion successfully as a substantive basis for discipline.
instead,section was intended to clarify the procedural interplay between participation in a diversion program and immunity from discipline for the conduct that led to diversion.a physician who is accepted into and participates in a diversion program may not be disciplined for conduct that resulted in the physician and surgeon referral to the diversion program,subd.d.section makes clear that this immunity is conditional a physician who agrees to diversion may avoid discipline for the acts giving rise to the diversion only insofar as he successfully completes the diversion program.failure to complete the program will waive the immunity and allow the board to renew its accusation and seek discipline for the conduct that resulted in diversion.
we find further support for this interpretation elsewhere in section.to the extent possible,contextual analysis requires harmonizing sections relating to the same subject,fair employment housing com.cal d,rodarte orange county fire authority th,d.section provides for the establishment of criteria for acceptance into and termination from the diversion program,subd.a,as added by stats,ch.section was amended in to add subdivision e and other provisions detailing the circumstances under which disciplinary proceedings could be maintained against a physician who was participating in the diversion program.stats,ch,pp.bill,subds.b g.in,section was amended further to add a provision that the failure of a physician to comply with an order to be examined shall constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of his or her certificate,subd.j,second undesignated paragraph,as amended by stats,ch,bill.this amendment illustrates that the legislature knows how to specify clearly when conduct is a substantive basis for discipline.it did not do so when adopting section.
apparent statutory purpose 
when construing an ambiguous statute,a court may consider its apparent purpose.see hughes board of architectural examiners,supra,cal th at,d.under section,board disciplinary proceedings are intended to serve twin purposes protection of the public and rehabilitation of the physician,subds.a,b.if section is construed to authorize disciplinary action solely on the basis of a failure to complete diversion,it will in many instances fail both these goals.this is a case in point.
after liskey termination from diversion,the administrative law judge twice determined that the evidence was not sufficient to prove that his ability to practice competently was impaired and that there was no basis for imposing discipline under section,as charged in the accusation.the board adopted that finding.nevertheless,the board imposed discipline for liskey failure to complete diversion successfully under section.the board found that g iven liskey admissions and the differing opinions regarding whether and to what extent he is or has been chemically dependent,the panel can only carry out its public protection mandate business and professions code section by monitoring his practice for a period of time.this is best effectuated by means of probation and the diversion program.the problem with the board finding is that it was based on evidence not relevant to the violation for which the board imposed discipline,that is,liskey failure to complete diversion successfully.rather,it was based on evidence relating to his continuing impairment under section which,it is undisputed,was insufficient to prove that violation.there was no evidence that discipline was needed to protect the public or rehabilitate liskey for his failure to complete the diversion program.
there is yet another problem with the board interpretation of the statute.in order to take disciplinary action against a medical license,the board is obligated to base its decision on clear and convincing proof to a reasonable certainty and not a mere preponderance of the evidence.ettinger board of medical quality assurance d.liskey was terminated from the diversion program because on two occasions he tested positive for cocaine use.the board never investigated nor proved the accuracy of the tests despite liskey vigorous dispute and his contrary evidence.at the administrative hearing,shane wright,a senior investigator for the board,testified that the diversion program does not share any information with the enforcement program except that the person has been terminated from diversion.the program manager notifies the board that the physician has been terminated for reasons other than successful completion of the diversion program.
the statute can not be read to authorize the board to revoke a physician license on the basis of the program manager summary notice,without investigation into the reasons for termination,and with no finding of impairment or unprofessional conduct by clear and convincing evidence to say that section authorizes discipline for failure to complete diversion successfully whenever the failure is accompanied by some evidence of impairment would essentially permit discipline to be imposed on the basis of a lesser standard of proof.the board interpretation would allow it to evade the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that liskey ability to practice medicine was impaired due to misuse of drugs or alcohol.
in our analysis,we do not overlook the preventative functions of license discipline.the protection of the public includes the prevention of future harm.griffiths superior court,supra,th at,d three misdemeanor convictions involving the consumption of alcohol conclusive presumption of unprofessional conduct under.when misconduct poses a sufficient danger to the public,the legislature defines it as unprofessional conduct that is a basis for discipline without any showing that the misconduct actually impaired the physician ability to practice medicine.griffiths,supra,at,d.in such instances,the legislature has made such definitions unequivocally.for example,a violation or conviction of a state or federal statute regulating dangerous drugs or controlled substances,or convictions one felony or more than one misdemeanor involving the use of dangerous drugs,controlled substances,or alcohol,are all defined specifically in article as unprofessional conduct,subd.a.the disregard of the public evidenced by such illegal conduct is deemed to be sufficient evidence of danger to the public safety without further evidence of actual impairment of professional competency.griffiths superior court,supra,th at,d.here,however,there is nothing in the language,statutory context,or apparent purpose of section that shows a legislative intent to define a failure to complete an diversion successfully as unprofessional conduct requiring preventative discipline.nor does a physician failure to complete a voluntary attempt at rehabilitation,by itself,demonstrate a disregard of public safety equivalent to that shown by the commission of a criminal offense.
the board has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that there is a danger to the public or that liskey needs rehabilitation.the board interpretation and application of section in this case do not further the legislative goals underlying diversion programs and physician discipline.
legislative history 
the administrative law judge and board rested their interpretation of section on their reading of the statute legislative history.having independently reviewed that legislative history,we can not agree with the board position that the legislature intended to allow the board to impose discipline solely on the ground of a physician failure to complete successfully an diversion program.instead,we agree with the trial court conclusion that the legislative history does not provide a clear indication that the legislature intended to make a violation of section a new and separate basis for physician discipline.because the legislative history does not illuminate the intent of the final version of section,we adhere to the interpretation dictated by constitutional and contextual considerations.
we rely on the legislative history of an ambiguous statute as dispositive only when that history is itself unambiguous.jones construction superior court th,d.the members of the legislature have no opportunity to disapprove legislative history,and the governor has no chance to veto it.legislative history directly represents
