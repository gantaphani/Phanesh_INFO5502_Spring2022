home orthopedics,a medical equipment supplier based in puerto rico,sued the defendants for their alleged involvement in a scheme to help one guy collect a consulting fee home orthopedics agreed to pay him,but based on a contract it later discovered was phony.fueled by home orthopedics refusal to continue paying the fee,the defendants purportedly wielded their influence over players in the health insurance industry to jeopardize numerous contracts home orthopedics had with other clients.
the puerto rico district court dismissed home orthopedics numerous federal and commonwealth law causes of action.home orthopedics now appeals the dismissal of its primary claim,brought under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,or rico,disposed of for failure to state a claim.home orthopedics also appeals the district court denial of its motions to conduct limited discovery and amend the complaint.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court.
background 
because we are reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,we recite the facts as they are alleged in the operative complaint and rico case statement,in the light most favorable to home orthopedics ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir.
the letter of agreement 
since,home orthopedics,a home medical equipment supplier and the leading company in puerto rico for orthotics,prosthetics,and diabetic shoes,supplied medical equipment to mmm healthcare,a puerto rican health maintenance organization that we refer to as the hmo.but in mid,defendant clinical medical services,clinical medical,also a home medical equipment supplier in puerto rico,struck a deal with the hmo to be its exclusive provider of durable medical equipment,a specific category of medical equipment used by patients in the home,including,for instance,hospital beds,canes,and crutches.
in late,clinical medical president,raúl rodríguez raúl,met with home orthopedics president,jesús rodríguez jesús,claiming that in addition to the exclusivity agreement for durable medical equipment,clinical medical had entered into an additional agreement with the hmo to be its exclusive provider of orthotic and prosthetic services.raúl told jesús that clinical medical would need a subcontractor to actually provide those services,however,because clinical medical did not know anything about orthotics and prosthetics.
the complaint does say whether jesús agreed in that meeting to subcontract for clinical medical,but in february,jesús received a faxed letter of agreement from raúl.the letter,a copy of which was attached to the complaint,was an unsigned,draft agreement between home orthopedics and the hmo even though raúl sent jesús the contract and arranged for jesús to sign it,clinical medical was not actually a party to the contract.the agreement would allow home orthopedics to continue providing orthotic and prosthetic services to the hmo subscribers,but at a percent lower profit,reducing home orthopedics sales reimbursement from percent to percent.specifically,the agreement provided 
home orthopedics indicates its intent to enter into an agreement with the hmo to render orthotic and prosthetic services to patients enrolled in the hmo.by signing this agreement,home orthopedics agrees to render professional healthcare services and to accept percent reimbursement as full payment for all covered services to patients referred to home orthopedics.
the agreement was drafted in english,of which jesús functionally knew little.when jesús asked raúl for an explanation of the agreement,raúl threatened that home orthopedics was being put out of business,and told jesús to take it or leave it because another prosthetics company was also interested in the deal.
jesús opted to take it.he signed the agreement,even though as we gather from facts pleaded later in the complaint he had not spoken with anyone from the hmo about it,and no one from the hmo had signed it yet.
jesús also agreed with raúl that in exchange for choosing home orthopedics as the subcontractor,clinical medical would earn a percent consultant commission on home orthopedics sales to the hmo,to be paid directly to raúl.under the deal with clinical medical,then,home orthopedics would start receiving only percent of the sales it made to the hmo,as opposed to the percent it had been making.
raúl gets caught 
with the new deal in place,business went on as usual,and in august,home orthopedics sent the hmo an invoice.the hmo,though,sent home orthopedics a check accounting for percent of the bill.home orthopedics thought the hmo made a mistake,and,in good faith,reminded the hmo that it should have paid out only percent under the terms of the letter of agreement.but the hmo responded that it had never seen that agreement and would investigate the matter.
it not clear from the complaint what happened in the meantime,but around october,jesús found out from the hmo that clinical medical was not actually its exclusive provider of orthotics and prosthetics clinical medical and the hmo had negotiated an agreement to that extent,but clinical medical allowed the exclusivity option to expire.at that point,home orthopedics stopped paying raúl his consulting fee 
raúl was displeased.he demanded jesús pay him for the fees he earned in and,and when jesús would budge,defendants josé linares and paul pino,also executives at clinical medical,started calling and sending letters to jesús to try to collect the money owed to raúl.raúl also frequently called jesús requesting payments and threatened him with the loss of his business.
continued collection efforts 
by mid to late,raúl warned jesús that he would see him bleed drop by drop until he remain ed without a business.eventually jesús,under duress,relented and paid raúl on top of the he had already numerous payments made throughout 
raúl was satisfied,and,apparently undeterred by jesús refusal to pay more money,clinical medical filed a lawsuit against home orthopedics in puerto rico state court in april.raúl tried to get jesús to settle the case,warning that his attorneys have a great influence in the puerto rico courts.jesús did bite,and in fall,started receiving collection calls and emails from pino.he also received a written settlement demand and correspondence regarding the settlement demand from linares and pino.
other terminated contracts 
in the meantime,other companies in the health insurance field started terminating their contracts with home orthopedics,which raúl had warned jesús would happen if he did cooperate.the first was in november,shortly after home orthopedics stopped paying raúl,when medical card system,terminated its contract with home orthopedics,supposedly for lack of proper credentialing home orthopedics asserts that it had the proper credentials.after failed attempts to get medical card system to change its mind,home orthopedics hired someone to help negotiate a new services agreement with the managed care organization.during that negotiation meeting,defendant julio juliá,a friend of raúl who had recently begun working at medical card system,interrupted to falsely claim that medical card system could not negotiate directly with home orthopedics because home orthopedics had an exclusivity agreement with clinical medical.
in june,first medical,an insurance company,terminated its contract with home orthopedics without explanation so did humana health plans of puerto rico,a healthcare network,on august.
in september,home orthopedics made a deal to be the exclusive announced company of orthotics and prosthetics at medical card system convention.medical card system,however,cancelled the exclusivity deal and returned home orthopedics payment for exclusivity,instead deciding to allow other companies to advertise along with home orthopedics.
finally,in march,medical card system terminated its new services agreement with home orthopedics,but this time,without giving any reason.
this lawsuit 
convinced that the defendants some of whom worked with raúl,and others of whom worked for the companies that terminated their contracts with home orthopedics were all in cahoots to help raúl strongarm more money,home orthopedics filed suit in june in the puerto rico federal district court.the amended complaint,which is now the operative one in this case,sought relief against numerous defendants for violating numerous federal and commonwealth laws,including rico b,c,and d home orthopedics theory of the case was that the defendants conduct amounted to extortion,mail fraud,and wire fraud,all actionable under rico.
several defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to dismiss the complaint,which the district court largely adopted,dismissing all the federal claims with prejudice and the supplemental state law claims without prejudice.specifically,the district court held that home orthopedics failed to adequately allege that juliá was part of an enterprise.the court also concluded that the complaint did not sufficiently allege that raúl,linares,and pino engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity,as all of their actionable racketeering acts relate d to a single transaction the signing of the letter of agreement aimed to extort home orthopedics.the court also denied home orthopedics request to amend its complaint for a second time in lieu of dismissal.
this timely appeal followed.home orthopedics only asks us,however,to either revive its substantive rico claim,brought under c or allow it to amend its complaint to add more allegations to support it.
discussion 
motion to dismissstandard of review 
we review a district court dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b de novo.woods wells fargo bank,cir.that is,we accept the facts pleaded in the complaint as true to determine whether the plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for relief.ocasio hernández,at méndez internet mgmt,banco santander de puerto rico,cir.
the elements of a rico claim 
rico,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,is a statute that congress enacted as a tool in the federal government war against organized crime,united states turkette,d,to help combat enduring criminal conduct,libertad welch,cir.in addition to allowing the criminal prosecution of rico violators,see,the statute expansive reach also provides a generous private right of action successful plaintiffs are entitled to triple damages if they can prove they were injured in their business or property by reason of a violation of section.c.
against that backdrop,we start our analysis by laying out the building blocks of a civil rico claim.
the rico statute makes it 
unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
c.to state a civil rico claim,then,a plaintiff must allege conduct,of an enterprise,through either a pattern of racketeering activity,kenda pot money leagues,cir quotations omitted,or a single collection of an unlawful debt,united states weiner,cir.
we turn our attention to the third element specifically,whether home orthopedics has sufficiently alleged a pattern of racketeering activity.as we explain below,we agree with the district court that home orthopedics has not sufficiently alleged a rico pattern,and thus,its rico claim fails 
pattern of racketeering under rico 
rico specifically enumerates what kinds of illegal acts count as racketeering,and includes in that category of crimes extortion and mail and wire fraud.see.to establish a pattern,the statute requires a plaintiff to show that at least two acts of racketeering occurred within ten years of each other.
the supreme court has additionally required that the racketeering predicates be related,and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.giuliano fulton,cir quoting nw.bell,d.the latter requirement is called the continuity requirement.giuliano,at citing efron embassy suites,cir.
as the language of indicates,the supreme court held that a plaintiff can show continuity in one of two ways.under the closed approach,a plaintiff would have to prove a closed period of repeated conduct that amounted to continued criminal activity.at.alternatively,under the approach,a plaintiff could satisfy the continuity requirement by showing past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.id.
in the instant case,the appellant opening brief does not specify whether home orthopedics intended to show a pattern of racketeering through closed continuity,continuity,or both.the rico case statement was also of no help in illuminating which type of pattern home orthopedics intended to prove the district court specifically asked home orthopedics to d escribe in detail the pattern of racketeering activity alleged for each claim,but rather than actually describing the pattern,home orthopedics directed the court to paragraphs of the complaint.we were no more enlightened after that portion of the complaint.
as we have stated time and again,litigants must provide meat on the bones of their arguments if they expect us to seriously entertain them.see rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir.in this situation,though,we will not dwell on whether home orthopedics terse treatment of the pattern prong sufficed to preserve its appellate rights because in any case,home orthopedics pleaded allegations do not make the stuff of either closed or continuity.
closed continuity 
while home orthopedics does not address this argument,the defendants assert that closed continuity can not be established here because home orthopedics has only alleged a single narrow scheme to defraud a single victim.we agree.
because rico was intended to attack criminal conduct,a pattern sometimes can be established by examining only the number of alleged predicate acts and the duration of the alleged racketeering activity.giuliano,at see also efron,at citing,at noting that the supreme court has placed emphasis on the temporal focus of the continuity requirement.however,given that congress had a fairly flexible concept of a pattern in mind when it drafted rico,at,both the supreme court and this court have declined to spell out specifically how many predicate acts,or how long the racketeering has to endure,for a plaintiff to satisfactorily allege the pattern requirement.
but we have established some parameters.we know,from the supreme court,that when a plaintiff has only alleged a few predicate acts,sporadic activity,at,or when the acts span only a few weeks or months,closed continuity can not be established,efron,at citing,at.at the other end of the spectrum,we have also said that where the temporal duration of the alleged activity and the alleged number of predicate acts are so extensive that common sense compels a conclusion of continuity,continuity should be found.giuliano,at citation and quotations omitted see also,fleet credit sion,cir finding that racketeering acts over a year period was sufficient for closed continuity.
other cases,though,fall somewhere in the middle because the duration and extensiveness of the alleged conduct does not easily resolve the issue.giuliano,at.in those squishier cases,we look to other indicia of continuity,for instance,whether the defendants were involved in multiple schemes,as opposed to one scheme with a singular objective whether the scheme affected many people,or only a closed group of targeted victims and whether the scheme had the potential to last indefinitely,instead of having a finite nature.efron,at.while these specific factors are ones we have considered in the past,at the end of the day,we just take a natural and commonsense approach to rico pattern element,id.at citing,at,to determine whether the specific fact pattern of the case before us suggests the kind of broad or ongoing criminal behavior at which the rico statute was aimed,efron,at.
we find that home orthopedics allegations do not fit the bill.even assuming without deciding that the complaint alleges more than sporadic activity,the predicate acts alleged are certainly not so ext
