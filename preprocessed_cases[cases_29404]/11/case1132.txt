this case is a consumer protection class action masquerading as an antitrust suit.plaintiffs are a putative class of retail cable and satellite television subscribers.they brought suit against television programmers programmers and distributors distributors alleging that programmers practice of selling cable packages violates section of the sherman act.in essence,these consumers seek to compel programmers and distributors of television programming to sell each cable channel separately,thereby permitting consumers to purchase only those channels that they wish to purchase,rather than paying for bundles,as occurs under current market practice.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal with prejudice of their complaint for failure to state a claim for relief under section of the sherman act.we affirm.
the television programming industry can be divided into upstream and downstream markets.in the upstream market,programmers nbc universal and fox entertainment group own television programs such as law and order and television channels such as nbc bravo,msnbc,and fox entertainment group fox news channel and fx and sell them wholesale to distributors.in the downstream retail market,distributors such as time warner and echostar sell the programming channels to consumers 
the nucleus of plaintiffs claims regarding the nature of the programmers and distributors alleged antitrust violation has remained constant throughout the various iterations of their complaint.according to plaintiffs,programmers have two categories of programming channels,channels with a large number of viewers,and a group of less desirable,channels with low viewership.plaintiffs allege that programmers derive market power from their channels because no distributor can market and sell a programming package to consumers without those channels.distributors contend that programmers exploit this market power by bundling or tying the high and low demand channels together for sale to distributors,thereby precluding distributors from purchasing single channels and according to plaintiffs forcing distributors in turn to sell only packages to consumers.plaintiffs contend that in the absence of programmers bundling practices,distributors would offer single channels for sale often referred to as a la carte programming,and consumers could purchase only those channels that they wish to watch.accordingly,plaintiffs claim,the challenged bundling practice limits distributors method of doing business and reduces consumer choice,while raising prices.
based on these allegations,plaintiffs claim that the programmers and distributors are in violation of section of the sherman act.plaintiffs seek monetary damages under plaintiffs also seek an injunction to compel programmers to make channels available on an individual,basis.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs first complaint without prejudice on the ground that plaintiffs failed to show that their alleged injuries were caused by an injury to competition.
in their amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that programmers practice of selling bundled cable channels foreclosed independent programmers from entering and competing in the upstream market for programming channels.the district court subsequently denied defendants motion to dismiss,holding that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded both injury to competition and antitrust standing.
after preliminary discovery efforts on the question whether the programmers practices had excluded independent programmers from the upstream market,the plaintiffs decided to abandon this approach pursuant to a stipulation among the parties,plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint deleting all allegations that the programmers and distributors bundling practices foreclosed independent programmers from participating in the upstream market,along with a motion requesting the court to rule that plaintiffs did not have to allege that potential competitors were foreclosed from the market in order to defeat a motion to dismiss.the parties also agreed that programmers and distributors could file a motion to dismiss,and that if programmers and distributors prevailed,this third complaint would be dismissed with prejudice.the district court entered an order on october,granting programmers and distributors motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice because plaintiffs failed to allege any cognizable injury to competition.the district court also denied plaintiffs motion to rule on the question whether allegations of foreclosed competition are required to state a section claim.plaintiffs timely appeal.
section of the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.while the language of section could be interpreted to proscribe all contracts,see,bd.of trade of city of chicago united states,the supreme court has never taken a literal approach to its language,texaco dagher.rather,the court has repeatedly observed that section s only unreasonable restraints.state oil khan.
we generally evaluate whether a practice restrains trade in violation of section under the rule of reason.see leegin creative leather,psks.in its design and function the rule of reason distinguishes between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer best interest.id.at.the parties do not dispute that the rule of reason applies in this case.
in order to state a section claim under the rule of reason,plaintiffs must plead facts which,if true,will prove a contract,combination or conspiracy among two or more persons or distinct business entities by which the persons or entities intended to harm or restrain trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations which actually injures competition.kendall visa,cir see also oltz peter cmty,cir same.in order to establish the third element,plaintiffs must plead an injury to competition beyond the impact on the plaintiffs themselves.mcglinchy shell chem,cir.
in addition to pleading these three elements,an antitrust plaintiff must also plead facts that if taken as true would allow plaintiffs to recover for an antitrust injury,which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.big bear lodging ass snow summit,cir internal quotation omitted see also atl.richfield usa petroleum,observing that antitrust injury is distinct from injury to competition and that proof of a n antitrust violation and of antitrust injury are distinct matters that must be shown independently quoting phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,fundamentals of antitrust law c,at ed.supp.
courts have identified two scenarios constituting an injury to competition for purposes of the third element of a section claim.first,agreements between competitors to harm or exclude other competitors referred to as horizontal collusion are deemed to injure competition because they insulate the colluding parties from horizontal competition.see.fed of dentists,see also realcomp ii,ftc,cir holding that a horizontal agreement among seven associations of competing brokers relating to a web advertising policy unreasonably restrained competition in the market for the provision of residential brokerage services.horizontal collusion is not at issue here.
second,agreements that foreclose competitors from entering the market are likewise deemed to injure competition.see,allied orthopedic appliances tyco health care grp.lp,cir oltz,at.vertical restraints on trade,when a supplier imposes restrictions or limitations on a distributor such as vertical,territorial restrictions,tying the sale of two or more goods,and bundling,may constitute this sort of injury to competition under certain circumstances.a vertical restraint without more,however,does not constitute an injury to competition.austin mcnamara,cir.a plaintiff alleging that a vertical restraint results in increased prices or reduced consumer choice is still required to identify a specific injury to competition.see hirsh martindale hubbell,cir
