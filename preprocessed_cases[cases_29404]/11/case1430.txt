aaa cooper transportation accepted for shipment three pallets from motorola,each containing a number of cellular phones.these pallets disappeared before delivery,and uruguay compania de seguros,sues under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,for resulting damages.in this appeal,we clarify the evidentiary predicate necessary to prove the contents of a sealed container under the carmack amendment.we affirm the district court.
background 
the relevant facts in this case are undisputed,and we accept the district court determination of them at trial,summarized for our purposes as follows.abiatar,abiatar,an uruguayan electronics company,contracted with motorola,for the sale of cellular telephones at per phone,for a total of.motorola packaged the phones at its factory and informed abiatar chosen freight forwarder,miami international forwarders mif,that the phones were ready to be shipped.mif employed aaa cooper transportation cooper,a common carrier based in dothan,alabama,to transport the phones by ground from motorola factory in illinois to miami,florida,where they would be shipped onward to uruguay by mif.
cooper received the shipment at motorola factory on august,loaded it onto an truck,and drove it to miami,where it arrived on august.the shipment was unloaded at the cooper miami terminal and,on august,loaded onto a local delivery truck.the driver of this truck attempted delivery to mif that same day,but was turned away from mif terminal.the truck returned to cooper terminal,where the shipment was unloaded from the truck and loaded into a storage trailer for the weekend.on the following monday,august,the shipment was again loaded onto a local delivery truck,but when the truck later arrived at mif for delivery,it was discovered that the motorola shipment was not among the truck contents.to date,the disappearance of the shipment is unexplained.
abiatar insured this shipment through uruguay compania de seguros,aig,who paid abiatar claim for loss of the phones.aig,as subrogee of abiatar,sued cooper for its apparent negligence,and,following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for aig in the amount of,the full value of the lost shipment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal following a bench trial,a district court conclusions of law are reviewed de novo,and its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.mitek holdings,arce eng g,cir.the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act makes common carriers liable for actual loss of or damage to shipments in interstate commerce.a.a prima facie case is established under the carmack amendment upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the goods were delivered to the carrier in good condition,the goods arrived at the destination in damaged condition,and a specified amount of damages resulted.fine foliage of,bowman,cir.
once a prima facie case is established,the burden shifts to the carrier to prove that it was free from negligence,and that the damage to the cargo was caused by one of the five excusable factors a the act of god b the public enemy c the act of the shipper himself d public authority e or the inherent vice or nature of the goods.id.at quoting missouri pacific elmore stahl,d.
if the carrier can not meet this burden,then liability is established.the inquiry then becomes the amount of damages and,usually,whether the carrier legitimately limited its liability for the shipment to a specified value or amount.a carrier subject to the carmack amendment may only limit its liability under the released value provision of c,which states 
a carrier providing transportation or service may establish rates for the transportation of property other than household goods described in section a under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written or electronic declaration of the shipper or by written agreement between the carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.
cooper argues that the district court improperly applied this framework in two ways first,that the district court erred in allowing aig to prove its prima facie case with circumstantial evidence,and,second,that the district court erred in finding that cooper did not validly limit its liability on the shipment.we discuss each of these arguments in turn.
proof of delivery in good condition 
one of the elements in a carmack amendment case is proof that the goods were delivered to the carrier in good condition.fine foliage,at.when the shipment at issue is not a sealed container,then the carrier has the initial burden of informing itself of the condition of the goods received.offshore aviation transcon lines,cir per curiam.because the carrier has the ability before and during shipment to ascertain for itself the nature and condition of the shipment,we do not require heightened proof.in these cases,a recitation of good condition and contents on the bill of lading may suffice.see spartus yafo,cir.
when the shipment at issue is a sealed container,then the carrier has no independent ability to ascertain the contents of the shipment,and the shipper is held to a higher standard of proof.the bill of lading,by itself,is never sufficient to establish a prima facie case.offshore aviation,at.where goods are shipped under seal,the condition of the goods can not be within the carrier knowledge.a bill of lading accordingly can attest only to apparent or external good condition,and the shipper may reasonably be required to present some additional evidence of the condition of the goods at the time of delivery.pillsbury illinois cent.gulf,cir.the carrier should not have the initial burden of separating damages arising from causes prior to shipment from damages due to negligent stowage.id.internal quotations omitted.
our precedent in the eleventh circuit indicates that the type of proof necessary to meet this heightened standard depends on whether the shipment at issue was damaged or destroyed when the sealed shipment was damaged en route,and,consequently,the question is only the original condition of the shipment,then reliable,substantial circumstantial evidence of condition will suffice to prove a prima facie case.see fine foliage,at ferns damaged frosty land foods int l,refrigerated transp,cir shipment of meat damaged see also allied tube conduit southern pac.transp,cir pipes damaged pharma bio,tnt holland motor express,cir blood cells damaged by.the bill of lading,by itself,is not sufficient circumstantial evidence to show good condition at delivery to the carrier.reider thompson,cir.but a case may be made by a bill of lading that recites receipt of the sealed packages in good external condition,when coupled with damage of a kind which could not in the nature of things have occurred before the shipment.mcneely price v.the exchequer,see also reider,at.
when the shipment was lost,destroyed,or damaged to such extent that it is impossible to tell what was contained in the shipment,then the question is not only the original condition of the shipment,but also the contents of the shipment.when a sealed shipment disappears or is destroyed,we can not tell by looking at the remains of the shipment,if any,what it originally contained.therefore,we have said in these circumstances that we require direct evidence of the original contents and condition of the shipment to prove a prima facie case.it is well settled that documentary evidence alone,such as a bill of lading,is insufficient to establish proof of delivery of the contents of a sealed container.highlands ins.strachan shipping,cir.d ocuments can not suffice for prima facie proof of contents in sealed containers.offshore aviation,at.t he established rule requir es the plaintiff to supplement documentary evidence with some form of direct evidence of the contents of a sealed container.highlands,at.direct evidence,such as the testimony of an eyewitness to the loading of the container,is necessary to confirm the contents.id.at see also continental grain burlington ry,cir quantity of grain lost.a prima facie case should not rest on mere possibility.offshore aviation,at 
in highlands,a case concerning the loss of a shipment of televisions,we found that the district court did not clearly err by refusing to accept documentary evidence of an unbroken chain of custody as the necessary showing to prove the contents of a sealed container.at.in offshore aviation,a case in which a shipment of airplane parts was substantially destroyed in a fire,we declared that a similar series of documents tracing the goods from their beginnings to their arrival at the carrier could not suffice for proof,and relied instead on a letter from an actual employee involved in the shipment in finding a question of material fact that precluded summary judgment.at.the eighth circuit in continental grain,a case concerning the disappearance of a quantity of grain in transit,required direct and affirmative proof of the quantity delivered to the carrier and accepted deposition testimony concerning the weighing of the grain for this proof.at.
here,the district court found that the shipment did not constitute a sealed container,stating that the cooper driver picked up three pallets packaged in clear wrapping,and the cooper driver could have counted containers in total on the three pallets.significantly,cooper does not claim the cooper driver did not pick up three pallets at the motorola facility.at.we find that the district court erred in this determination.the three pallets shipped by motorola were in clear material.each pallet contained either or cartons,each of which in turn contained five smaller boxes,each of which allegedly contained a motorola cellular phone.a shipment is considered to be a sealed container if its contents are not visible and open to inspection at the time of delivery to the carrier.spartus,at.here,the pallet could not have been opened by the carrier for inspection in a significant way.the transparency of the outer layer of tape does not negate the fact that the actual phones were inside two more layers of boxes.the carrier may have been able to peer through the and count to cartons,but there was no way for the carrier to independently ascertain the contents and condition of the actual goods to be shipped.the heightened proof required of shippers for sealed containers turns on whether the carrier can reasonably be expected to determine the nature of the shipment through independent confirmation.where,as here,the container is packaged in such a way as to thwart independent confirmation,we require heightened proof from the shipper of the sealed container contents.
cooper argues that the district court also erred by reasoning that the shipment was not a sealed container because it was not transported by ship on the open seas.according to cooper,the district court distinguished highlands and offshore aviation as cases involving sealed,containers,and declined to apply those cases on that basis.we are not sure that the district court actually relied on that specific distinction,but we agree with cooper that the sealed container doctrine is not restricted to shipments traversing the seas.we have not been presented with any argument from the parties as to why sealed containers should be treated differently from other sealed containers,and we have never made such a distinction explicit in any of the relevant cases.all sealed containers,whether shipped by land or sea,present the same problem for carriers the contents and good condition of the contents can not be confirmed by practical visual analysis.thus,we require heightened evidence to prove these attributes for all sealed containers,not just those transported on ships.
in any event,the district court decided that the fine foliage line of cases,which require only circumstantial evidence,controlled.therefore,it found aig evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case.as we have discussed,the fine foliage cases are qualitatively different from the offshore aviation highlands line of cases.the two lines of cases are distinct and distinguishable.we explicitly pointed out the nature of the dichotomy in our consideration of fine foliage.in that case,a shipment of ferns was damaged during transit,and we held that circumstantial evidence of the ferns original condition was sufficient to meet the shipper prima facie burden.at.we distinguished the highlands line of cases,which require direct evidence,by saying that 
highlands involved a situation in which there was no proof,other than a bill of lading,that tv sets,reported stolen,had actually been placed in a sealed seagoing container.it stands only for the proposition that evidence such as the testimony of an eyewitness to the loading of the container is necessary to confirm the contents.here,there is no dispute that the ferns were loaded into the container.
at internal citation omitted.when original condition of the contents is at issue,as in the fine foliage case,reliable and substantial circumstantial evidence will suffice,but when the contents themselves are in question,as in highlands and offshore aviation,direct evidence must be presented.in this case,motorola shipped three sealed containers.the sealed containers and their contents vanished.therefore,aig was required to present direct evidence of the contents,and the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
however,we can not fault the result.the evidence presented by aig is sufficiently direct evidence of the contents of the shipment.when the particular phones to be packaged to fill the order are selected,their serial numbers are scanned into the motorola system,and that record follows the order from station to station as it proceeds toward shipment.these serial numbers appear automatically on the invoice generated before the shipment leaves the facility.this record is made contemporaneously with the sealing of the phones inside the cartons that directly and without inference identifies the contents of that carton,even though we have no testimony of the individual responsible for scanning the phones or the supervisor,if any,with responsibility over the process by which the phones are scanned.however,we would expect their testimony to be general that this is the process that occurs every day at the facility,and that they do not remember this particular shipment.
it would be easy to strain our precedent and reject this evidence as insufficiently circumstantial or documentary evidence,but doing so disregards the practicalities of largely automated modern industry.large production quantities and speedy production times are the hallmark of the efficiency sought by our nation corporations,and it is unrealistic to require eyewitness testimony to prove that a particular shipment was shipped correctly when hundreds or thousands of similar shipments may have left the factory in the interim it is also unrealistic to expect that there is an actual eyewitness to the entire process.because of specialization,no worker and no manager in modern industry could precisely describe and guarantee the contents of any particular shipment from their factory without reference to the type of documentation presented in this case.that documentation can be more reliable than eyewitness testimony,and it is an unfair and impractical burden to require a carmack amendment plaintiff to obtain eyewitness testimony to the contents of a particular shipment as a condition of bringing suit when such testimony will rarely,if ever,be available in these situations.
we have never said that eyewitness testimony is the only direct evidence that will suffice,but we have said repeatedly that documentary evidence must be supplemented by other direct evidence.however,what we mean to prevent by requiring this additional direct evidence is having the contents of a sealed container proved solely by documentation.when business records are routinely and systematically made contemporaneously with the packing and packaging of a particular shipment,and these documents clearly identify the specific contents of those shipments,then we perceive no problem in accepting that proof as the type able to meet the shipper burden it is especially so where,as here,there is no incentive for the shipper to falsify the packing lists.accordingly,we find
