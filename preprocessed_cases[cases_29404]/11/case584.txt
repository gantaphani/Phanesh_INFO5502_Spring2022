private club,hotel development texas,silver city,and green star collectively,the clubs challenge a texas statute that prevents sexually oriented businesses located in certain political subdivisions from obtaining or renewing permits to serve alcohol.the district court granted summary judgment against the clubs on their constitutional claims.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
facts and proceedings 
the clubs are private membership adult cabarets located in areas of dallas,texas.the clubs feature sexually oriented dancing and are regulated as sexually oriented businesses sobs under texas law and dallas ordinances.texas law allows political subdivisions to determine whether they will permit the sale of alcoholic beverages within their borders.see.alco.the clubs are located in political subdivisions that have elected to be dry.as such,the clubs can not sell alcoholic beverages unless they obtain a private club registration permit club permit in accordance with the texas alcoholic beverage code.the clubs currently have club permits and serve alcohol while offering sexually oriented dancing as entertainment.
section k of the texas alcoholic beverage code was enacted by the state legislature in october as house bill.it prohibits the issuance of club permits to sobs operated in dry political subdivisions and prohibits the renewal of existing club permits section k thus denies the clubs,as sobs operating in dry political subdivisions,the ability to serve alcohol.
following the texas legislature enactment of k,the clubs sued john steen and gail madden,in their respective capacities as members of the texas alcoholic beverage commission tabc and alan steen,in his capacity as administrator of the tabc,collectively,the state.the clubs complaint,brought pursuant to,sought declarations that k was unconstitutional under the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments and sought to enjoin the individual defendants from enforcing k.in particular,the clubs asserted that k violated the clubs right to free expression under the first amendment,their rights to equal protection and due process under the fourteenth amendment,and their right to be free from a taking of private property without just compensation,under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
the state moved for summary judgment on all claims,and the clubs filed a for partial summary judgment on the first amendment claim.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state on the first amendment claim,finding that the statute was and that it survived intermediate scrutiny.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of the state on the clubs fifth and fourteenth amendment claims.
the clubs timely appealed,contending that the district court grant of summary judgment on the first amendment and due process claims was erroneous.the clubs have thus abandoned their equal protection claim and their fifth amendment takings claim.see,sec recile,cir noting that issues not raised in the briefs are abandoned.on appeal,the clubs seek an entry of summary judgment in their favor on the first amendment claim or,in the alternative,a remand for a trial on the first amendment claim and the due process claim.

iii.discussion 
due process claim 
the district court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether the clubs were deprived of a property interest without due process because k was a generally applicable legislative enactment and that the legislative process had provided the clubs all process that was due.we agree.due process claims are subject to a two part analysis.courts must first determine whether a property interest exists and,if so,whether the holder of the interest received due process.see logan zimmerman brush,d.assuming that the clubs have a property interest in the club permits issued by the tabc,they can not demonstrate that they were denied due process.
w hen a legislature extinguishes a property interest via legislation that affects a general class of people,the legislative process provides all the process that is due.mcmurtray holladay,cir.the clubs argue that k affected a small number of establishments and was narrowly focused on certain sobs,notwithstanding its broad language and statewide applicability.the clubs erroneously focus on the total number of establishments ultimately affected by k.the proper focus,however,is on whether the legislature intended to single out certain individuals or establishments.see id.holding that a law extinguishing property rights of certain government employees did not violate due process where the act was intended to affect every employee first emphasis added.section k was intended to affect every club in dry political subdivisions in the entire state of texas,not any particular establishment or cadre of establishments.the clubs were not denied due process.
first amendment claim 
we first address the state contention that k does not implicate the first amendment at all.the state argues that this court should affirm the district court grant of summary judgment because k regulates no aspect of expression,does not restrict the time,place,or manner of erotic expression,and does not have even an incidental impact on first amendment freedoms because nothing about it prevents erotic dance.
the state argument is not without some force.section k regulates the clubs ability to obtain or renew club permits and,therefore,regulates the clubs ability to legally serve alcoholic beverages.what k does not do is regulate any aspect of the protected expressions included in the performances provided by the clubs k only regulates the clubs ability to couple the performances with the service of alcohol.cases applying first amendment principles to alcohol regulations similar to k,moreover,have not explicitly addressed the argument,presented here,that alcohol regulations of sobs do not implicate the first amendment.they instead proceed directly to the first amendment analysis.nonetheless,based on a review of relevant cases from the supreme court and from other circuits that have addressed the constitutionality of statutes similar to k,we must conclude that k sufficiently implicates the first amendment to warrant further analysis under the relevant first amendment jurisprudence.
the supreme court opinions support this conclusion.the court in california larue,d,considered the constitutionality of regulations promulgated by california department of alcoholic beverages cdab.the california regulations prohibited bars and nightclubs licensed to sell alcoholic beverages by the cdab from providing entertainment described as grossly sexual.see id.at.the court rejected the first amendment challenge brought by,inter alia,the establishments licensed by the cdab to serve alcohol.see id.at.in rejecting this first amendment challenge,the court did not hold that the first amendment was not implicated by california regulations instead,the court held that the regulations did not violate any part of the constitution.see id.at.the court holding relied on the fact that cdab conclusion,as embodied in the regulations,that sexual performances should not occur in the same location where intoxicating liquors were served was not an irrational one and was within california powers.see id.at.the court also relied on the added presumption in favor of the validity of the state regulation in this area that the amendment requires.see id.because the larue court held that california regulations did not violate the constitution,not that the regulations did not implicate the first amendment at all,larue suggests that alcohol regulations of sobs implicate the first amendment.
a more recent opinion,liquormart,rhode island,d,disavowed part of larue but left intact the part suggesting that alcohol regulations of sobs implicate the first amendment.liquormart concerned the constitutionality of an alcohol regulation restriction on commercial speech,namely,rhode island statutory prohibition against advertisements that provide the public with accurate information about retail prices of alcoholic beverages.id.at.the court held that such an advertising ban was an abridgement of speech protected by the first amendment and that is not shielded from constitutional scrutiny by the amendment.id.though the court disavowed larue reliance on the amendment and concluded that the amendment does not qualify the constitutional prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of speech,the court stated that even if it had not relied on the amendment,the court analysis in larue would have led to precisely the same result.id.at.
the analysis left intact is that part of larue that examined whether the constitution granted california the power to prohibit entertainment in establishments that the cadb licensed to serve alcohol.see id.at.the larue court,as noted,concluded that california did have such constitutional power and rejected the first amendment challenge to the california regulations.see larue,at.accordingly,liquormart did not undermine that part of larue that suggests that the california regulations at issue implicated the first amendment.
aside from leaving intact that part of larue that is important here,liquormart supports the notion that k implicates the first amendment for another reason.in explaining that larue was still good law,notwithstanding its reliance on the amendment,the liquormart court indicated that the states inherent police powers provide ample authority to restrict the kind of bacchanalian revelries described in the larue opinion regardless of whether alcoholic beverages are involved.liquormart,at.importantly,the court cited two first amendment cases for the proposition.see id.citing young am.mini theatres,d,and barnes glen theatre,d.
since liquormart,the third,fourth,sixth,seventh,and eleventh circuits have concluded that the court citation to american mini theatres and barnes requires that alcohol regulations of sobs be analyzed in light of the first amendment tests contained therein.see ben bar vill.of somerset,cir concluding that prohibitions on the sale of alcohol at adult entertainment establishments must be analyzed in light of american mini theatres and barnes see also south fischer,cir agreeing with the seventh circuit that prohibitions on the sale of alcohol at adult entertainment establishments must be analyzed in light of american mini theatres and barnes odle decatur county,cir agreeing with the circuit courts that have interpreted liquormart reaffirmation of larue holding to mean that the larue regulations would have survived intermediate that they would have had to survive such scrutiny to comport with the first amendment giovani carandola bason,cir noting the liquormart court reliance on first amendment cases and holding that the result reached in larue remains sound not because a state enjoys any special authority when it burdens speech by restricting the sale of alcohol,but rather because the regulation in larue complied with the first amendment sammy of mobile,city of mobile,cir reaffirming that the barnes intermediate level of scrutiny,derived from united states,d,applies to adult entertainment liquor regulations considering the foregoing authority,both from the court and our sister circuits,we must conclude that k prohibition on alcohol service at certain sobs implicates the first amendment.
the state,along with the international municipal lawyers association and the lake highlands area improvement association as amici curiae,also challenge the first amendment application to k by arguing that k merely affects the rights of observers of erotic dancers to consume alcoholic beverages and does not affect the rights of the dancers to engage in such expression or the rights of the clubs to offer it.section k does not implicate the first amendment,they argue,because there is no constitutional right to drink while watching nude dancing.sammy of mobile,at.
we disagree with this contention.the argument that k merely regulates the actions of the clubs patrons overlooks the fact that it is the clubs,not the patrons,that are denied the ability to serve alcohol,since the clubs are sobs operating in dry political subdivisions.see id.at indicating that patrons of the businesses at issue did not have a constitutional right to drink while watching nude dancing but nonetheless analyzing whether an ordinance prohibiting alcohol service violated the first amendment.also,while k does not restrict the expressions in the erotic dancing offered by the clubs,k regulates the place or manner in which the erotic dancing can occur by not allowing the clubs,which are operating as sobs in dry political subdivisions,to obtain club permits allowing the service of alcohol.see id.at in prohibiting nude dancing where liquor is sold,the ordinance restricts only the place or manner of nude dancing.city of los angeles alameda books,d analyzing a regulation preventing two adult entertainment establishments from operating in the same building under the first amendment time,place,and manner test.section k implicates the first amendment.
appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny 
courts routinely apply intermediate scrutiny to alcohol regulations of sobs,and we do so here.see,odle,at sammy of mobile,at commenting that alcohol regulations are and should be analyzed under the intermediate scrutiny test see also fantasy ranch city of arlington,cir courts routinely apply intermediate scrutiny to government regulation of sexually oriented businesses.
the statute predominant purpose determines the level of scrutiny.if k is intended to suppress expressions contained in erotic dancing,then it is subject to strict scrutiny.see alameda books,at.plurality opinion.if k has a purpose unrelated to the suppression of speech,then it is subject to intermediate scrutiny.see id.the district court concluded,notwithstanding the lack of a legislative record as to k purpose,that the statute predominant purpose was to curb the negative secondary effects that result from the combination of alcohol and erotic dancing,and that,accordingly,the statute is not subject to strict scrutiny.the court concluded that the state had demonstrated this predominant purpose by asserting that k furthers the state interest in reducing the secondary effects that result from the combination of alcohol and erotic dancing,thereby protecting the welfare,health,temperance,and safety of the people of the state.the state asserted this purpose,not at a time contemporaneous with k enactment,but during the proceedings before the district court.
the clubs contend that the district court erred in applying intermediate scrutiny and argue that k is subject to strict scrutiny because k predominant purpose is to suppress the speech included in the sexually oriented performances offered by the clubs.we disagree and conclude that k is subject to intermediate scrutiny because its predominant purpose,as exhibited by its plain text and its place within the texas alcoholic beverage code,is unrelated to the suppression of speech instead,k is intended to regulate the service of alcohol.intermediate scrutiny is proper if the statute is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.hill colorado,d.t he fact that a statute refers to the content of expression does not necessarily make it if it was enacted for a valid purpose other than suppressing the expression due to a disagreement with the message conveyed or a concern over the message direct effect on those who are exposed to it.ranch house,amerson,cir.
on its face,k concerns the regulation of alcohol,not the suppression of erotic speech.section k regulates no aspect of any protected expressions exhibited in the erotic dancing offered at the clubs even with k enforced,the clubs could nonetheless offer erotic dancing,albeit not together with the service of alcohol.section k,however,references sobs and applies to them,but that a statute references content does not alone mean that it is intended to suppress speech,even without a legislative record to suggest a purpose unrelated to speech.see see also barnes,at.plurality opinion holding that the purpose of a statute that prevented nude dancing was not to suppress protected speech despite no legislative history sammy of mobile,at noting that an ordinance prohibiting alcohol service at a topless dancing establishment was not notwithstanding the ordinance reference to content.
similar to the zoning ordinance in alameda books,k is part of a web of alcohol regulations,the purpose of which is to protect the welfare and safety of the people of the state.see at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.this suggests that k is more in the nature of a typical alcohol regulation and less in the nature of a law suppressing speech.see also barnes,at.plurality opinion discerning from an statute text and history a substantial governmental purpose and concluding that this purpose was unrelated to the suppression of speech.the state also points out that k regulates sobs,which the texas legislature has determined may be detrimental to the public health,safety,and welfare by contributing to the decline of residential and business neighborhoods and the growth of criminal activity.local gov t code.this further demonstrates a purpose unrelated to the suppression of speech.together,the text of k and its statutory context convinces us that the statute predominant purpose is with regulating the service of alcohol,not with suppressing the speech exhibited in the performances offered by the clubs.
nonetheless,the clubs assert that because k was enacted without a preamble that spells out a purpose and because the state did not introduce evidence of legislative history from which a predominant purpose can be inferred,this court must conclude that the predominant purpose is to suppress the protected speech.in support,the clubs cite language in the alameda books plurality opinion,which indicates that determining if a statute is requires courts to verify that the predominate concerns motivating the ordinance were with the secondary effects of adult speech,and not with the content of adult speech.see at.plurality opinion emphasis added.according to the clubs,the plurality use of the past tense,together with this court prior applications of intermediate scrutiny where legislative findings or the ordinance preamble revealed a secondary effects purpose,requires courts to look to the legislative record or preamble,and not to other indicators contemporaneous with the enactment,to determine the statute predominant purpose.
we disagree with the contention that a legislative record or statutory preamble is required to discern a predominant purpose.the alameda books plurality use of the past tense when describing the inquiry into a statute predominant purpose does,as the clubs suggest,support the notion that a statute predominant purpose must be determined with reference to events contemporaneous with the enactment.but the plurality did not specify that a purpose unrelated to suppressing speech can only be demonstrated with a specific type of indicator such as legislative findings or a statutory preamble.see id.at.plurality opinion.indeed,justice kennedy alameda books concurrence states that whether a statute is content neutral or content based is something that can be determined on the face of it.see id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.and a plurality of the court in barnes held that a statute without legislative history advanced a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of speech where the statute text and history revealed that it was not intended to suppress speech,but was instead concerned with morality.at.plurality opinion.referring to a statute text and to its statutory placement to discern its predominant purpose is consistent with the court first amendment jurisprudence.
also,referring to the text of k and its statutory context to determine a statute predominant purpose is not inconsistent with this court prior cases.the clubs are correct that this courts previous cases have relied on a legislative record or a preamble to reveal a predominant purpose.see,fantasy ranch,at applying intermediate scrutiny to an ordinance concerning behavior restrictions at sobs where the statute stated purpose was to combat secondary effects enters.city of houston,cir applying intermediate scrutiny to zoning ordinances where the ordinances preamble contained findings concerning secondary effects entm t,at concluding that a statute was by looking to its preambulatory clause,which indicated a secondary effects purpose sdj,city of houston,cir relying on the city of houston findings as to a secondary effects purpose to justify intermediate scrutiny.we disagree,however,with the clubs reading of this court cases as requiring a legislative record or a statutory preamble to justify treatment,to the exclusion of other indicators contemporaneous to the statute enactment,including the face of the statute itself,that equally support a predominant purpose unrelated to suppressing speech.as properly discerned from the plain text and statutory placement of k,its predominant purpose is unrelated to the suppression of speech.section k thus is subject to intermediate scrutiny 
applicable constitutional standard 
as noted,the liquormart court cited two first amendment cases that represent separate,yet similar,tests for determining whether a statute violates the first amendment.at.both cases are consistent with intermediate scrutiny.the first case cited,young american mini theatres,d,outlines the standard for determining the constitutionality of adult entertainment zoning ordinances.it has subsequently been modified by city of renton playtime theatres,d,and city of los angeles alameda books,d.under alameda books,which is applicable to ordinances restricting the time,place,and manner of adult entertainment,courts consider whether the ordinance bans sobs altogether is or and if,serves a substantial governmental interest and leaves available reasonable alternative avenues of communication.id.at.plurality opinion discussing renton.
the second case cited,barnes glen theatre,d,outlines how courts analyze public indecency statutes.it employs the test,which requires courts to determine if the regulation is within the constitutional power of the government it furthers an important governmental interest that is unrelated to the suppression of speech and the incidental restrictions on speech are no greater than is essential to further the interest.united states,d see also barnes,at.
the district court,following the seventh circuit decision in ben bar,examined k with a constitutional test that is a hybrid of the adult entertainment zoning test used in alameda books and the public indecency test outlined in.on appeal,neither party disputes the use of the hybrid test.we therefore need not decide whether to adopt it in circumstances such as the one here.we instead apply the hybrid test employed in ben bar and used by the district court,noting that the result would be the same under either alameda books or.see lleh,wichita county,cir.
applying the constitutional standard 
section k is constitutional if the state regulated pursuant to a legitimate governmental power the regulation does not completely prohibit adult entertainment the regulation is aimed not at the suppression of expression,but rather at combating negative secondary effects and the regulation is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest,is narrowly tailored,and reasonable alternative avenues of communication remain available,or,alternatively,the regulation furthers an important or substantial governmental interest and the restriction on expressive conduct is no greater than is essential in furtherance of that interest.see ben bar,at citing,inter alia,at,renton,at,and alameda books,at.because the statute is reviewed for intermediate scrutiny,the state has the burden of justifying the challenged statute.see entm t,at.
