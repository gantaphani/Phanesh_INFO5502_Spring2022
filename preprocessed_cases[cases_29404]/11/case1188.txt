granite rock company granite rock sued international brotherhood of teamsters,local local and international brotherhood of teamsters ibt under section a of the labor management relations act lmra with claims relating to a collective bargaining agreement.granite rock seeks remedies against local for breach of the collective bargaining agreement,and against ibt for tortious interference with the collective bargaining agreement between granite rock and local.the district court dismissed the claim against ibt under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.granite rock appeals that dismissal,and we affirm.
in the dispute between granite rock and local,the parties appeal and a total of five orders,but we need reach only one the district court denial of local motion to compel arbitration on the question of contract formation.we reverse that ruling and remand with instructions to compel arbitration on the entire dispute between granite rock and local.
for purposes of analyzing the district court dismissal of granite rock claims against ibt,granite rock alleged facts must be presumed true and viewed in the light most favorable to granite rock.pakootas teck cominco metals,cir.granite rock alleges granite rock is a california company engaged in supplying ready mixed concrete for commercial use,and local represents certain employees at granite rock san jose facility.between march,and april,granite rock and local were parties to a collective bargaining agreement cba.before expiration of that agreement,the parties began negotiations.throughout the negotiations,rome aloise aloise,the administrative assistant to the general president of ibt,advised local that certain provisions of the cba were inadequate.aloise also represented the interests of ibt and other local unions affiliated with ibt in the negotiations.no resolution was reached in april or may,and in early june,after the cba between granite rock and local expired,local members went on strike.negotiations resumed shortly thereafter,and the parties reached a tentative agreement new cba at on july.this tentative agreement contained a broad arbitration clause requiring the parties to arbitrate a ll disputes arising under this agreement.
at the conclusion of the successful bargaining session,george netto netto,business representative for local,told granite rock ceo bruce woolpert that netto would put the new cba to a vote among the union members,would recommend ratification,and would cease picketing.at the same time,netto raised the topic of a agreement to provide for the terms under which the parties would return to work,including liability for actions taken during the strike.however,the parties agreed to discuss preparing a agreement at a later date.
local members allegedly ratified the new cba,which contained a clause,later on the morning of july.however,on july,aloise and members of local called workers to instruct them not to return to work the next day.on july,netto demanded a agreement that would explicitly shield local,its members,and ibt from any liability arising from the strike.granite rock refused to sign such an agreement,and local continued its strike in violation of the clause.throughout the strike,aloise played an active leadership role he sent letters to other local unions and employees encouraging their support,held meetings to discuss strategy,and sought to secure financial support for the strike.ibt gave benefits to local members as long as they did not return to work.
granite rock third amended complaint alleged breach of contract against local,and tortious interference with contract against ibt.both actions were asserted under section a of the lmra,a.defendant ibt moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted that motion on the grounds that granite rock failed to state a claim against ibt under section a.granite rock timely appealed.
there is only one fact that is critical to our determination of whether the entire dispute between granite rock and local should have been submitted to arbitration,and that fact is undisputed while the parties disagree about the ratification date,they agree that the tentative new cba reached on july,contains an arbitration clause that requires arbitration for a ll disputes arising under this agreement.interpreting this clause,the district court dismissed the issues of breach and damages in favor of arbitration,but retained the question of contract ratification for the district court determination.local timely appealed the order retaining the formation question.
because we determine that the district court erred by denying local motion to compel arbitration of the entire dispute,and we remand for arbitration,we need not address the appealed orders that arose from the district court rulings in resolving on the merits the issue of contract formation by ratification.
the district court dismissal of granite rock claims against ibt presents questions of law which we review de novo.pruitt cheney,cir.
section a of lmra,a,provides 
suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter,or between any such labor organizations,may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
jurisdiction over a claim under section a requires two things first,that the claim be based on an alleged breach of contract between an employer and a labor organization,and second,that the resolution of the lawsuit be focused upon and governed by the terms of the contract.painting decorating contractors ass painters decorators joint,cir.
a party need not be a signatory to a cba to come within the purview of section a.in painters decorators,the joint committee created by the bargaining agreement to administer the terms of the not a signatory of the agreement.we held that the committee was still an appropriate defendant under section a because the cba created the committee and governed its rights and duties.id.at.
however,the second part of the painters and decorators test requires that resolution of any section a claim be governed by the terms of the relevant agreement.in carpenters cal.admin.majestic housing,cir,the defendant property was subject to a mechanic lien because a party to the collective bargaining agreement had not made required trust contributions.at.the district court found jurisdiction under section a because the lien foreclosure would require interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.we reversed,holding that mere reference to the collective bargaining agreement does not make this a case arising under federal law within the meaning of.id.
although majestic housing dealt with rights under a mechanic lien,its reasoning also applies to tort claims.the underlying agreement in majestic housing was relevant to the mechanic lien because the lien could only be foreclosed if the contract was violated,just as a tortious interference with contract claim depends on a breach.the court in majestic housing held that such a connection is inadequate to satisfy the requirements of section a.at.
applying the rule developed in majestic housing,we conclude that the district court was correct to dismiss granite rock claim against ibt because a claim for tortious interference can not be said to arise under the new cba between granite rock and local.majestic housing,at.that agreement did not mention ibt,and did not govern any rights or duties of ibt.indeed,granite rock concedes that the alleged tortious interference could only be a violation of a general tort duty,not a violation of any specific contractual duty.notwithstanding,granite rock contends that the alleged tortious interference claim still meets the requirement that the resolution of the lawsuit be focused upon and governed by the terms of the contract.painters decorators,at.granite rock theory is that because breach of the underlying contract is a necessary element of the tortious interference claim,the resolution of the tort claim is focused upon and governed by the contract.
we reject granite rock argument,because its position clashes with the plain language of section a and the majestic housing requirement that the underlying agreement must have created the rights or liabilities which the parties seek to vindicate by their suit.majestic housing,at.we made this distinction clear in majestic housing in painters and decorators,the rights and liabilities of both parties were determined by the bargaining agreement,but in majestic housing,although the amount of the mechanic lien must be determined by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,majestic has no rights or liabilities under the agreement.id.similarly,ibt has no rights or duties under the agreement,and thus granite rock tortious interference claim against ibt does not meet the requirements of section a.
granite rock makes an additional argument in its unsuccessful attempt to bridge this gap that the close relationship between ibt and local,at least when presented with ibt aim to benefit from the breach by gaining a release of liability through the proposed agreement,justifies allowing a tort claim against ibt.although granite rock argument has some emotive force,granite rock provides no persuasive case support for its position,and does not explain adequately how the concepts of close relationship and benefit bring ibt within the scope of the contractual rights and obligations created by the new cba 
the majority of our sister circuits to have considered the question have declined to find a section a cause of action against parties not governed by the relevant agreement.see int l union,united mine workers of america covenant coal,cir the majority of courts to address the issue have refused to construe section in such a way as to allow tortious interference claims against.carpenters local union,cir c ourts have almost unanimously held that a section suit may be brought for violation of a labor contract only against those who are parties to the contract at issue.although there are some variations in phrasing,the circuits are almost unanimous in rejecting lmra jurisdiction over a claim such as granite rock claim against ibt.see greenblatt delta plumbing heating,cir holding that at a minimum the defendant must have breached some duty created by a labor contract to be liable for a violation under section a covenant coal,at declining to find jurisdiction under section a for a tortious interference with contract claim,at holding,in response to plaintiffs arguments that defendants had conspired with the alleged breaching party,that the absence of a contractual relationship between the parties requires dismissal of the section claim,nursing home public employees union,local commercial prop,cir holding that a district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a to a collective bargaining agreement,where no rights or duties of the party are stated in the terms and conditions of the contract loss blankenship,cir holding that a complaint for interference with a collective bargaining agreement,against a to that agreement,is not actionable under a of the lmra united food com.workers union,local quality plus stores,cir concluding that section does not establish jurisdiction for a federal common law claim of tortious interference against an entity that is not a signatory to the contract.
the only circuit to have adopted granite rock position is the third.publishing newspaper guild local,cir.in,the court held that tortious interference claims do arise under the underlying contract because an essential element of the cause of action is a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.we rejected similar reasoning in majestic housing,where we held that mere reference to the collective bargaining agreement is inadequate to confer jurisdiction under section a.at 
granite rock attempts to distinguish cases from other circuits by arguing that they did not deal with parties who are closely related or who benefitted from the breach.as discussed above,these distinctions are unsupported by precedent and the fact remains that only the third circuit has recognized a tortious interference claim under section a.
granite rock assertion that we should create federal common law to reach ibt misinterprets our instructions from congress and the supreme court.the supreme court has said that section can be read as a congressional mandate to the federal courts to fashion a body of common law to be used to address disputes arising out of labor contracts.lueck,d.however,based on the language of section a and,we understand this as a mandate to create a federal common law of labor contract interpretation,not an independent body of tort law.accord,brazinski amoco petroleum additives,cir the common law to be made is a common law of contracts,not a source of independent rights,let alone tort rights for section is as we have said a grant of jurisdiction only to enforce contracts.
finally,granite rock invocation of legislative intent does not persuade us.congress intended to improve the enforcement of bargaining agreements via the lmra.but n othing in the legislative history of bears on the question of holding a nonsignatory to a collective bargaining agreement.carpenters local union,cir.granite rock asks us to extrapolate from congress general purpose a tort claim against ibt,despite the language of the statute,in the interests of fundamental fairness.we decline to do so.the plain language of the statute appears to require at least that rights or obligations created by a labor agreement be in contest to support a section a challenge.moreover,the persuasive array of authority in our sister circuits counsels against adopting granite rock position,and leads us instead to take the beaten path established by this precedent.
any gap that might exist in congress labor law design is for congress and not for us to fill.when congress regulates an area comprehensively,as it has done in the federal labor laws,rights and remedies can be defined and circumscribed.congress has not left parties such as granite rock altogether without recourse.it has provided for remedies in labor disputes through both section parties to the bargaining through the national labor relations act.indeed,granite rock vigorously pursued actions against local in the federal courts as well as in the national labor relations board.if congress did not provide a remedy for granite rock directly against ibt on its asserted tortious interference claim,then that is an issue to be addressed by congress,not by an extraordinary and outlier interpretation of the governing statute.
we affirm the dismissal of granite rock claims against ibt 
we review de novo the effect of the arbitration clause in the alleged new cba between granite rock and local.see nagrampa mailcoups,cir en banc.
the united states supreme court has drawn a distinction between challenges to an arbitration clause and challenges to an entire contract.the court has stated this general rule u nless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself,the issue of the contract validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d see prima paint flood conklin,d.the ninth circuit recognized this dichotomy recently in nagrampa,where we held that federal courts must refer to arbitration those claims seeking to invalidate or otherwise directly affect the entire contract,at,but may hear challenges specifically to an arbitration agreement.id.at.
consistent with this framework,a party generally may not sue in federal court under a contract that,by its terms,requires arbitration.teledyne,kone,cir.in such cases,the matter must be sent to arbitration unless there is a challenge to the arbitration provision which is separate and distinct from any challenge to the underlying contract.id.at citing prima paint,at.in teledyne,the plaintiff sued for breach of contract,and defendant argued that the draft agreement was never finalized.id.we upheld the dismissal of the claim,in favor of arbitration,to avoid the absurd result where a plaintiff simul
