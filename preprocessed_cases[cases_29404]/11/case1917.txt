facts and procedural history 
the complaint 
on july,appellant and jim moana filed a class action complaint against capital one bank capital one,and capital one financial corporation for deceptive business practices,and unfair business practices bus.
the complaint alleges the following.respondents offered credit cards or gold credit cards with a credit line up to,but actually issued unsecured personal credit agreements having a credit limit of or less.despite having only a credit limit,these cards incurred the same or greater monthly or annual charges and other fixed fees such as late and fees as the card the consumer was offered in the original solicitations.
these practices are misleading because the solicitations contain a personalized invitation using the name of the specific individual,repeatedly use the words with regard to the credit card being offered,repeatedly refer to a amount while printing the amount in large,bold face type,uses the phrase credit line up to or similar wording,offers congratulations,indicates a specific reservation number and access code for the credit card,and describes multiple uses which would be totally unrealistic for a card that only carries a credit limit.the personalized solicitation uses the word times,the word gold times,and the phrase up to five times.only once does the fact that the credit line may be as low as appear,tucked away in fine print on the back of the solicitation letters,in what appears to be a preprinted form disclosure.
as an alternative to the above described solicitations,respondents sent out solicitations personally directed to a specific individual.the solicitations repeatedly use the words with regard to the credit card being offered repeatedly emphasize that the card being offered is a preapproved gold credit card print the word gold in large,bold type indicate a specific reservation number and access code for the credit card and describe benefits such as financial flexibility and financial freedom that would be unrealistic in relation to a card that carries a credit card limit.the solicitations use the word in six places and the word gold appears no less than times.the fact that the credit line may be as low as is not mentioned.
these misleading offers are designed to deceive consumers as to the level of credit they have been approved for and are being offered induce consumers to apply for credit cards for which they would not apply if they were aware that they would receive a credit card with substantial fees and only a credit limit induce consumers to apply for credit cards for which the amount of charges and fees are unfair and disproportionately high compared to the amount of credit that is granted and generate income for respondents in the form of fees and charges which are completely disproportionate to the amount of credit advanced by respondents.
as to the first cause of action for deceptive business practices,the complaint alleged that the solicitations sent to each class member resulted in the sale of credit services to each such consumer within the meaning of the consumers legal remedies act.these solicitations constituted unfair and deceptive acts,by representing that such credit services had uses,characteristics,benefits and quantities that they did not have,subd.a by representing that such credit services were of a particular standard,quality,or grade when they were not,subd.a and by advertising for the services while intending not to sell them as advertised,subd.a.

although the complaint alleged that appellant and other members of the class suffered damages in the form of fees and charges in an amount according to proof at trial,the complaint did not seek damages under that cause of action.the complaint alleged that appellant intended to file an amended complaint under civil code section,subdivision d,seeking damages,restitution and punitive damages under civil code section,subdivision a,and.
as to the second cause of action for unfair business practices,the complaint alleged that the credit card solicitations induced appellant and plaintiff class members to enter into credit card agreements with respondents,constituting unfair,misleading and deceptive advertising bus.
