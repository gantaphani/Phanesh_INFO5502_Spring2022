appeal by plaintiff rescuecom from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue,chief judge dismissing its action against google,under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.rescuecom complaint alleges that google is liable under and of the lanham act,for infringement,false designation of origin,and dilution of rescuecom eponymous trademark.the district court believed the dismissal of the action was compelled by our holding in contacts,cir,because,according to the district court understanding of that opinion,rescuecom failed to allege that google use of its mark was a use in commerce within the meaning of of the lanham act.we believe this misunderstood the holding of.while we express no view as to whether rescuecom can prove a lanham act violation,an actionable claim is adequately alleged in its pleadings.accordingly,we vacate the judgment dismissing the action and remand for further proceedings.
background 
as this appeal follows the grant of a motion to dismiss,we must take as true the facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of rescuecom.lentell merrill lynch,cir.rescuecom is a national computer service franchising company that offers computer services and sales.rescuecom conducts a substantial amount of business over the internet and receives between to visitors to its website each month.it also advertises over the internet,using many services,including those offered by google.since,rescuecom has been a registered federal trademark,and there is no dispute as to its validity.
google operates a popular internet search engine,which users access by visiting www.google.com.using google website,a person searching for the website of a particular entity in trade or simply for information about it can enter that entity name or trademark into google search engine and launch a search.google proprietary system responds to such a search request in two ways.first,google provides a list of links to websites,ordered in what google deems to be of descending relevance to the user search terms based on its proprietary algorithms.google search engine assists the public not only in obtaining information about a provider,but also in purchasing products and services.if a prospective purchaser,looking for goods or services of a particular provider,enters the provider trademark as a search term on google website and clicks to activate a search,within seconds,the google search engine will provide on the searcher computer screen a link to the webpage maintained by that provider as well as a host of other links to sites that google program determines to be relevant to the search term entered.by clicking on the link of the provider,the searcher will be directed to the provider website,where the searcher can obtain information supplied by the provider about its products and services and can perhaps also make purchases from the provider by placing orders.
the second way google responds to a search request is by showing advertising.when a searcher uses google search engine by submitting a search term,google may place advertisements on the user screen.google will do so if an advertiser,having determined that its ad is likely to be of interest to a searcher who enters the particular term,has purchased from google the placement of its ad on the screen of the searcher who entered that search term.what google places on the searcher screen is more than simply an advertisement.it is also a link to the advertiser website,so that in response to such an ad,if the searcher clicks on the link,he will open the advertiser website,which offers not only additional information about the advertiser,but also perhaps the option to purchase the goods and services of the advertiser over the internet.google uses at least two programs to offer such links adwords and keyword suggestion tool.
adwords is google program through which advertisers purchase terms or keywords.when entered as a search term,the keyword triggers the appearance of the advertiser ad and link.an advertiser purchase of a particular term causes the advertiser ad and link to be displayed on the user screen whenever a searcher launches a google search based on the purchased search term advertisers pay google based on the number of times internet users click on the advertisement,so as to link to the advertiser website.for example,using google adwords,company y,a company engaged in the business of furnace repair,can cause google to display its advertisement and link whenever a user of google launches a search based on the search term,furnace repair.company y can also cause its ad and link to appear whenever a user searches for the term company x,a competitor of company y in the furnace repair business.thus,whenever a searcher interested in purchasing furnace repair services from company x launches a search of the term x company x trademark,an ad and link would appear on the searcher screen,inviting the searcher to the furnace repair services of x competitor,company and if the searcher clicked on company y link,company y website would open on the searcher screen,and the searcher might be able to order or purchase company y furnace repair services.
in addition to adwords,google also employs keyword suggestion tool,a program that recommends keywords to advertisers to be purchased.the program is designed to improve the effectiveness of advertising by helping advertisers identify keywords related to their area of commerce,resulting in the placement of their ads before users who are likely to be responsive to it.thus,continuing the example given above,if company y employed google keyword suggestion tool,the tool might suggest to company y that it purchase not only the term furnace repair but also the term x,its competitor brand name and trademark,so that y ad would appear on the screen of a searcher who searched company x trademark,seeking company x website.
once an advertiser buys a particular keyword,google links the keyword to that advertiser advertisement.the advertisements consist of a combination of content and a link to the advertiser webpage.google displays these advertisements on the search result page either in the right margin or in a horizontal band immediately above the column of search results.these advertisements are generally associated with a label,which says sponsored link.rescuecom alleges,however,that a user might easily be misled to believe that the advertisements which appear on the screen are in fact part of the search result and that the appearance of a competitor ad and link in response to a searcher search for rescuecom is likely to cause trademark confusion as to affiliation,origin,sponsorship,or approval of service.this can occur,according to the complaint,because google fails to label the ads in a manner which would clearly identify them as purchased ads rather than search results.the complaint alleges that when the sponsored links appear in a horizontal bar at the top of the search results,they may appear to the searcher to be the first,and therefore the most relevant,entries responding to the search,as opposed to paid advertisements.
google objective in its adwords and keyword suggestion tool programs is to sell keywords to advertisers.rescuecom alleges that google makes of its revenue from selling advertisements through its adwords program.google therefore has an economic incentive to increase the number of advertisements and links that appear for every term entered into its search engine.
many of rescuecom competitors advertise on the internet.through its keyword suggestion tool,google has recommended the rescuecom trademark to rescuecom competitors as a search term to be purchased.rescuecom competitors,some responding to google recommendation,have purchased rescuecom trademark as a keyword in google adwords program,so that whenever a user launches a search for the term rescuecom,seeking to be connected to rescuecom website,the competitors advertisement and link will appear on the searcher screen.this practice allegedly allows rescuecom competitors to deceive and divert users searching for rescuecom website.according to rescuecom allegations,when a google user launches a search for the term rescuecom because the searcher wishes to purchase rescuecom services,links to websites of its competitors will appear on the searcher screen in a manner likely to cause the searcher to believe mistakenly that a competitor advertisement and website link is sponsored by,endorsed by,approved by,or affiliated with rescuecom.
the district court granted google b motion and dismissed rescuecom claims.the court believed that our decision compels the conclusion that google allegedly infringing activity does not involve use of rescuecom mark in commerce,which is an essential element of an action under the lanham act.the district court explained its decision saying that even if google employed rescuecom mark in a manner likely to cause confusion or deceive searchers into believing that competitors are affiliated with rescuecom and its mark,so that they believe the services of rescuecom competitors are those of rescuecom,google actions are not a use in commerce under the lanham act because the competitor advertisements triggered by google programs did not exhibit rescuecom trademark.the court rejected the argument that google used rescuecom mark in recommending and selling it as a keyword to trigger competitor advertisements because the court read to compel the conclusion that this was an internal use and therefore can not be a use in commerce under the lanham act.
discussion 
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b.painewebber bybyk,cir.when reviewing a motion to dismiss,a court must accept as true all of the factual allegations set out in plaintiff complaint,draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff,and construe the complaint liberally.gregory daly,cir citations omitted.
google use of rescuecom mark was a use in commerce 
our court ruled in that a complaint fails to state a claim under the lanham act unless it alleges that the defendant has made use in commerce of the plaintiff trademark as the term use in commerce is defined in.the district court believed that this case was on all fours with,and that its dismissal was required for the same reasons as given in.we believe the cases are materially different.the allegations of rescuecom complaint adequately plead a use in commerce.
in,the plaintiff alleged that the defendant infringed the plaintiff trademark through its proprietary software,which the defendant freely distributed to computer users who would download and install the program on their computer.the program provided contextually relevant advertising to the user by generating advertisements to the user depending on the website or search term the user entered in his browser.id.at.for example,if a user typed eye care into his browser,the defendant program would randomly display a advertisement of a company engaged in the field of eye care.similarly,if the searcher launched a search for a particular company engaged in eye care,the defendant program would display the ad of a company associated with eye care.see id.at.the ad appeared in a separate browser window from the website the user accessed,and the defendant brand was displayed in the window frame surrounding the ad,so that there was no confusion as to the nature of the as an advertisement,nor as to the fact that the defendant,not the trademark owner,was responsible for displaying the ad,in response to the particular term searched.id.at.
sections and of the act,which we also refer to by their codified designations,inter alia,impose liability for unpermitted use in commerce of another mark which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive,as to the affiliation or as to the origin,sponsorship or approval of his or her goods or services by another person.a a.the opinion looked to the definition of the term use in commerce provided in of the act.that definition provides in part that a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce.our court found that the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant made a use in commerce of the plaintiff mark,within that definition.
at the outset,we note two significant aspects of our holding in,which distinguish it from the present case.a key element of our court decision in was that under the plaintiff allegations,the defendant did not use,reproduce,or display the plaintiff mark at all.the search term that was alleged to trigger the ad was the plaintiff website address.noted,notwithstanding the similarities between the website address and the mark,that the website address was not used or claimed by the plaintiff as a trademark.thus,the transactions alleged to be infringing were not transactions involving use of the plaintiff trademark.id.at suggested in dictum that is highly relevant to our case that had the defendant used the plaintiff trademark as the trigger to an advertisement,such conduct might,depending on other elements,have been actionable.at.
second,as an alternate basis for its decision,explained why the defendant program,which might randomly trigger advertisements upon a searcher input of the plaintiff website address,did not constitute a use in commerce,as defined in.id.at.in explaining why the plaintiff mark was not used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services,pointed out that,under the defendant program,advertisers could not request or purchase keywords to trigger their ads.id.at.even if an advertiser wanted to display its advertisement to a searcher using the plaintiff trademark as a search term,the defendant program did not offer this possibility.in fact,the defendant did not disclose the proprietary contents of its directory to its advertising clients id.at.in addition to not selling trademarks of others to its customers to trigger these ads,the defendant did not otherwise manipulate which advertisement will pop up in response to any particular terms on the internal directory.id.at.the display of a particular advertisement was controlled by the category associated with the website or keyword,rather than the website or keyword itself.the defendant program relied upon categorical associations such as eye care to select a ad randomly from a predefined list of ads appropriate to that category.to the extent that an advertisement for a competitor of the plaintiff was displayed when a user opened the plaintiff website,the trigger to display the ad was not based on the defendant sale or recommendation of a particular trademark.
the present case contrasts starkly with those important aspects of the decision.first,in contrast to,where we emphasized that the defendant made no use whatsoever of the plaintiff trademark,here what google is recommending and selling to its advertisers is rescuecom trademark.second,in contrast with the facts of where the defendant did not use or display,much less sell,trademarks as search terms to its advertisers,here google displays,offers,and sells rescuecom mark to google advertising customers when selling its advertising services.in addition,google encourages the purchase of rescuecom mark through its keyword suggestion tool.google utilization of rescuecom mark fits literally within the terms specified by.according to the complaint,google uses and sells rescuecom mark in the sale of google advertising services rendered in commerce.
google,supported by amici,argues that suggests that the inclusion of a trademark in an internal computer directory can not constitute trademark use.several district court decisions in this circuit appear to have reached this conclusion.see,s l vitamins,australian gold,d,holding that use of a trademark in metadata did not constitute trademark use within the meaning of the lanham act because the use is strictly internal and not communicated to the public merck,mediplan health consulting,d,holding that the internal use of a keyword to trigger advertisements did not qualify as trademark use.this the decision.first,regardless of whether google use of rescuecom mark in its internal search algorithm could constitute an actionable trademark use,google recommendation and sale of rescuecom mark to its advertising customers are not internal uses.furthermore,did not imply that use of a trademark in a software program internal directory precludes a finding of trademark use.rather,influenced by the fact that the defendant was not using the plaintiff trademark at all,much less using it as the basis of a commercial transaction,the court asserted that the particular use before it did not constitute a use in commerce.see,at.we did not imply in that an alleged infringer use of a trademark in an internal software program insulates the alleged infringer from a charge of infringement,no matter how likely the use is to cause confusion in the marketplace.if we were to adopt google and its amici argument,the operators of search engines would be free to use trademarks in ways designed to deceive and cause consumer confusion this is surely neither within the intention nor the letter of the lanham act.
google and its amici contend further that its use of the rescuecom trademark is no different from that of a retail vendor who uses product placement to allow one vender to benefit from a competitors name recognition.an example of product placement occurs when a generic product is placed next to a trademarked product to induce a customer who specifically sought out the trademarked product to consider the typically less expensive,generic brand as an alternative.see,at.google argument misses the point.from the fact that proper,product placement does not result in liability under the lanham act,it does not follow that the label product placement is a magic shield against liability,so that even a deceptive plan of product placement designed to confuse consumers would similarly escape liability.it is not by reason of absence of a use of a mark in commerce that benign product placement escapes liability it escapes liability because it is a benign practice which does not cause a likelihood of consumer confusion.in contrast,if a retail seller were to be paid by an purveyor to arrange product display and delivery in such a way that customers seeking to purchase a famous brand would receive the,believing they had gotten the brand they were seeking,we see no reason to believe the practice would escape liability merely because it could claim the mantle of product placement.the practices attributed to google by the complaint,which at this stage we must accept as true,are significantly different from benign product placement that does not violate the act.
unlike the practices discussed in,the practices here attributed to google by rescuecom complaint are that google has made use in commerce of rescuecom mark.needless to say,a defendant must do more than use another mark in commerce to violate the lanham act.the gist of a lanham act violation is an unauthorized use,which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of goods or services.see a estee lauder v.the gap,cir.we have no idea whether rescuecom can prove that google use of rescuecom trademark in its adwords program causes likelihood of confusion or mistake.rescuecom has alleged that it does,in that purchasers or explorers of its services who search for its website on google are misleadingly directed to the ads and websites of its competitors in a manner which leads them to believe mistakenly that these ads or websites are sponsored by,or affiliated with rescuecom.this is particularly so,rescuecom alleges,when the advertiser link appears in a horizontal band at the top of the list of search results in a manner which makes it appear to be the most relevant search result and not an advertisement.what rescuecom alleges is that by the manner of google display of sponsored links of competing brands in response to a search for rescuecom brand name which fails adequately to identify the sponsored link as an advertisement,rather than a relevant search result,google creates a likelihood of consumer confusion as to trademarks.if the searcher sees a different brand name as the top entry in response to the search for rescuecom,the searcher is likely to believe mistakenly that the different name which appears is affiliated with the brand name sought in the search and will not suspect,because the fact is not adequately signaled by google presentation,that this is not the most relevant response to the search.whether google actual practice is in fact benign or confusing is not for us to judge at this time.we consider at the b stage only what is alleged in the complaint.
we conclude that the district court was mistaken in believing that our precedent in requires dismissal.
conclusion 
the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
on the meaning of use in commerce in sections and of the lanham act 
in contacts,cir,our court followed the reasoning of two district court opinions from other circuits,int l,d and wells fargo,d,which dismissed suits on virtually identical claims against the same defendant.those two district courts ruled that the defendant conduct was not actionable under a of the lanham act,a,even assuming that conduct caused likelihood of trademark confusion,because the defendant had not made a use in commerce of the plaintiff mark,within the definition of that phrase set forth in of the lanham act.in quoting definitional language of that is crucial to their holdings,however,and wells fargo overlooked and omitted portions of the statutory text which make clear that the definition provided in was not intended by congress to apply in the manner that the decisions assumed.
our court ruling in that the plaintiff had failed to plead a viable claim under a was justified by numerous good reasons and was undoubtedly the correct result.in addition to the questionable ground derived from the district court opinions,which had overlooked key statutory text,our court opinion cited other highly persuasive reasons for dismissing the them that the plaintiff did not claim a trademark in the term that served as the basis for the claim of infringement nor did the defendant actions cause any likelihood of confusion,as is crucial for such a claim.
we proceed to explain how the district courts in and wells fargo adopted reasoning which overlooked crucial statutory text that was incompatible with their ultimate conclusion.section a,codified at a,imposes liability on any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device which a is likely to cause confusion emphasis added.section,codified at,similarly imposes liability on one who without the consent of the registrant a use s in commerce any reproduction or copy of a registered mark in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive emphasis added.to determine the meaning of the phrase uses in commerce,which appears in both sections,the and wells fargo courts quite understandably looked to the definition of the term use in commerce,set forth among the act definitions in,codified at.that definition,insofar as quoted by the courts,stated,with respect to services,that a mark shall be deemed to be used in commerce only when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce.wells fargo,d at internal quotations omitted,d at specifying a similar requirement with respect to goods.adhering to this portion of the definition,and determining that on the particular facts of the case,the defendant had not used or displayed a mark in the sale or advertising of services,those courts concluded that the defendant conduct was not within the scope of the act.
in quoting the definition,however,those district courts overlooked and omitted two portions of the statutory text,which we believe make clear that the definition provided in is not intended to apply to a.first,those courts,no doubt reasonably,assumed that the definition of use in commerce set forth in necessarily applies to all usages of that term throughout the act.this was,however,not quite accurate.section does not state flatly that the defined terms have the assigned meanings when used in the statute.the definition is more guarded and tentative.it states rather that the terms listed shall have the given meanings unless the contrary is plainly apparent from the context.
the second part of which those courts overlooked was the opening phrase of the definition of use in commerce,which makes it plainly apparent from the context that the full definition set forth in can not apply to the infringement sections.the definition in begins by saying,the term use in commerce means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.emphasis added.the requirement that a use be a bona fide use in the ordinary course of trade in order to be considered a use in commerce makes clear that the particular definition was not intended as a limitation on conduct of an accused infringer that might cause liability.if definition is applied to the definition of conduct giving rise to liability in and,this would mean that an accused infringer would escape liability,notwithstanding deliberate deception,precisely because he acted in bad faith.a bad faith infringer would not have made a use in commerce,and therefore a necessary element of liability would be lacking.liability would fall only on those defendants who acted in good faith.we think it inconceivable that the statute could have intended to exempt infringers from liability because they acted in bad faith.such an interpretation of the statute makes no sense whatsoever.it must be that congress intended definition of use in commerce to apply to other iterations of the term use in commerce,as we explore below and not to the specification of conduct by an alleged infringer which causes imposition of liability 
a more detailed examination of the construction of the lanham act,and its historical evolution,demonstrates how this unlikely circumstance came to be.the act employs the term use in commerce in two very different contexts.the first context sets the standards and circumstances under which the owner of a mark can qualify to register the mark and to receive the benefits and protection provided by the act.for example,provides that t he owner of a trademark used in commerce may request registration of its trademark on the principal register,thereby receiving the benefits of enhanced protection emphasis added this part of the statute describes the conduct which the statute seeks to encourage,reward,and protect.the second context in which the term use in commerce appears is at the opposite pole.as exemplified in a,the term use in commerce,as quoted above,also appears as part of the act definition of reprehensible conduct,the conduct which the act identifies as infringing of the rights of the trademark owner,and for which it imposes liability.
when one considers the entire definition of use in commerce set forth in,it becomes plainly apparent that this definition was intended to apply to the act use of that term in defining favored conduct,which qualifies to receive the protection of the act.the definition makes perfect sense in this context.in order to qualify to register one mark and receive the enhanced protections that flow from registration giving the world notice of one exclusive rights in the mark,the owner must have made bona fide use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade,and not merely to reserve a right in the mark.id.the bona fide use envisioned is,with respect to goods,when the mark is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto,and the goods are sold or transported in commerce and on services when the mark is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services rendered in commerce.id.this definition sensibly insures that one who in good faith places his mark on goods or services in commerce qualifies for the act protection.in contrast,it would make no sense whatsoever for congress to have insisted,in relation to for example,that one who without the consent of the registrant use d a counterfeit of a registered mark in connection with the sale of goods thereby caus ing confusion will be liable to the registrant only if his use of the counterfeit was a bona fide use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade.id.such a statute would perversely penalize only the fools while protecting the knaves,which was surely not what congress intended.
the question then arises how it came to pass that the sections of the statute identifying conduct giving rise to liability included the phrase use in commerce as an essential element of liability.this answer results in part from a rearrangement of this complex statute,which resulted in joining together words which,as originally written,were separated from one another.the first incidence of employment of the phrase use in commerce in occurred in as the result of a mere rearrangement of sections,not intended to have substantive significance,which brought together the phrase,in commerce with the verb use.prior to the rearrangement,the term use in commerce appeared as an essential element of a trademark owner qualification for registration and for the benefits of the act,but did not appear as an essential element of a defendant conduct necessary for liability.the act frequently employs the term in commerce for the distinct purpose of invoking congress commerce clause jurisdiction and staying within its limits the statute also frequently employs the word use,either as a noun or verb,because that word so naturally and aptly describes what one does with a trademark.not surprisingly,in the extensive elaborate course of drafting,revision,and rearrangement which the act has undergone from time to time,as explained below,the words use and in commerce came into proximity with each other in circumstances where there was no intent to invoke the specialized restrictive meaning given by.in,when congress enacted the present form of definition,which was designed to deny registration to an owner who made merely token use of his mark,the accompanying congressional report made clear that the definition was understood as applying only to the requirements of qualification for registration and other benefits of the act,and not to conduct causing liability.we briefly trace the history of this evolution below,to show that the restrictive definition of use in commerce set forth in never was intended as a restriction on the types of conduct that could result in liability.
history of the phrase use in commerce in the lanham act 
in in the cases,the supreme court struck down the existing trademark statutes passed in the because the copyright clause of the constitution was not a proper basis of congressional authority to regulate trademarks.while ruling that the copyright clause did not give congress authority to protect trademarks,the court specified that if congress wished to invoke the commerce clause to justify its assertion of the power to regulate trademarks,it needed to invoke that authority on the face of the law.id.at.two years later,congress enacted a statute to authorize the registration of and protect the same,act of march,stat,which explicitly and repeatedly invoked congress commerce clause power on the face of the law,using language virtually identical to the constitutional grant of power 
a major revision to federal trademark law came in with the passage of the lanham act.congressman fritz lanham,chairman of the subcommittee on of the house committee on patents,had first introduced his bill,hr,in.at the time,in order to qualify to register a trademark and receive the resulting protections,a trademark owner needed to affix his mark to goods in interstate commerce.see act of february,stat,stating that one of the requirements for registration is that the trademark owner must file an application that states the mode in which the trademark is applied and affixed to goods see also western stove geo.roper,stating that to obtain a common law trademark or a trademark under the act of,it is clear that the had to be affixed substantially either to the product,or the container thereof.the version of lanham bill thus defined affixation,stating that a trademark shall be deemed to be affixed to an article when it is placed in any manner in or upon either the article or its container or display or upon tags or labels or is otherwise used in the advertisement or sale thereof,cong.sess.the version presented in congress two years later in,instead of defining affixation,introduced the less complicated,more accommodating definition of use in commerce as the conduct by which an owner would qualify to register a mark.the bill included in which eventually became a definition of use in commerce,which was similar to the definition of affixation in the prior in,but more expansive,including both goods and services.
this definition provided,
for purposes of this act a mark shall be deemed to be used in commerce a on goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto and the goods are sold or transported in commerce and b on services when used or displayed in the sale of advertising of services in commerce.
cong.sess.this text of of the bill was eventually enacted in the version in substantially the same form,and in later codification became the definition set forth in.it is important to note that in the bill,in which first appeared the defined term,used in commerce,that term served as a requirement for registration,but the term nowhere appeared in the language defining conduct that would constitute infringement under.section,which defined infringement,made reference to commerce but did not employ the defined term used in commerce.
in the form in which the act was eventually passed in,the term used in commerce continued to be a prerequisite to registration,but remained generally absent,with one small exception,from the statutory language defining infringement.section,eventually codified as,at the time contained no instance of the term.section a,eventually codified as a,provided liability for infringing conduct by a ny person who shall cause or procure the trademark to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the trademark to any carrier to be transported or used.see lanham act,stat,emphasis added.thus,the act allowed the imposition of liability on any infringer under without regard to whether he used in commerce the mark,and under a on any infringer who cause d or procure d the transportation of a mark in commerce,or who deliver ed a mark to any carrier to be transported,as well as to one who cause d or procure d the mark or delivered it to a carrier to be used in commerce.regardless of whether the use in commerce language in a was intended to carry the definition in,the lanham act as passed in,on any reading,did not restrict liability for infringement to those who used in commerce,as defined in restrictive terms.such a use in commerce was simply one of several ways to satisfy one of several elements of a cause of action under a.by contrast,to justify imposition of liability on an infringer,the act required,as an element of the cause of action,that the infringer cause the infringing goods or services to enter into commerce a jurisdictional predicate for congress power to legislate in this area.see id.thus,on the question whether the definition set forth in should be understood as applying to,and thus restricting,conduct causing liability,one of the leading commentators on trademark law notes,
the lanham act narrowing definition of what constitutes use in commerce is just a relaxed remnant of trademark law affixation requirement.this statutory anachronism certainly was never intended to limit the scope of uses that would constitute infringement.
mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed updated.
the amendment of in 
a confusing change in statutory diction occurred in when congress amended.the purpose of the amendment was to broaden liability for infringement.previously,the statutory requirement of confusion,mistake,or deception applied only with respect to purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods or services.see mccarthy ed updated.congress eliminated this requirement to expand the scope of deceptive,or misleading conduct that could constitute infringement.id.noting that this amendment has been viewed as expanding the range of actions that can constitute infringement of a trademark by not limiting it to confusion of purchasers and not limiting it to confusion as to the source of goods.at the same time as making this broadening substantive change,the amendment made structural changes to the order of the language in.see,cong.at.previously,had listed a series of actions which,when taken by any person in commerce would cause liability.among the actions listed was,under clause a,a person use,without the consent of the registrant,of any reproduction lanham act,stat,emphasis added.thus,in the version,the terms use and in commerce occurred in separate clauses.one of the changes,which is not described in the house or senate reports as having any substantive significance,was a rearrangement of the order of words so that use and in commerce came to appear side by side in the amended version,rather than in separate clauses.in its amended form,it read a ny person who shall,without the consent of the registrant a use in commerce any reproduction shall be liable in a civil action.stat,emphasis added.as the result of the rearrangement,the consolidated phrase use in commerce appeared for the first time in.the house and senate reports describe these amendments as intended simply to rearrang e the language.see,cong.at,cong.at.the only change to specifically discussed in the report was the deletion of the phrase purchasers as to the source of such goods or services for the stated purpose of broadening liability.id.it would be unreasonable to construe mere rearrange ment of language in as having intended to convert the broad term,use into a restrictive,defined term,which had previously applied only to a trademark owner qualification for registration of the when congress made no mention beyond describing the change as a rearrangement.see whitman am.trucking,d congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes.
the amendment to 
if there was any doubt prior to on the question whether the narrowing definition of use in commerce set forth in,was intended to apply to the utilization of that phrase in the sections providing for the liability of infringers,the doubt was put to rest by the trademark law revision act of which inserted into the requirement that a use in commerce be a bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade and not merely made to reserve a right in a mark.this was part of a change intended to bring the federal trademark registration system into harmony with the registration system of other nations,see,stat,by providing the possibility of reserving a trademark for intended future use.previously,one could not establish exclusive rights to a mark,or eligibility to register one claim to the mark,except by using the mark in commerce.one who had a bona fide intent to use a mark in the future on a product not yet released into commerce could not be assured that,during product development preceding distribution of the product under the mark,another user might not establish a priority in the same mark.in at least one case in this circuit,an attempt to reserve priority in a mark by making token use during the product development period had been found ineffective.procter gamble johnson johnson,aff cir.the amendment provided relief by allowing applicants to file an intent to use application,by which they could reserve their priority in a mark for a limited period without making use of it in commerce.
while these amendments provided relief in the form of effective reservation of a mark for a time on the basis of a filing of intent to use,registration of a mark under continued to be limited to those who have in fact used the mark in commerce.and the definition of use in commerce set fort
