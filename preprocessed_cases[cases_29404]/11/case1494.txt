christian faith fellowship church appeals a final judgment of the trademark trial and appeal board that,in response to a petition filed by adidas ag,cancelled its trademarks for failing to use the marks in commerce before registering them.the board held that the church documented sale of two marked hats to an resident were de minimis and therefore did not constitute use of the marks in commerce under the lanham act.because the lanham act defines commerce as all activity regulable by congress,and because the church sale to an resident fell within congress power to regulate under the commerce clause,we reverse the board cancellation of the church marks on this basis and remand for further proceedings.
background 
christian faith fellowship church is located in zion,illinois,within five miles of the illinois wisconsin border.being located so close to the border,the church parishioners include both illinois and wisconsin residents.in january,the church began selling apparel,both caps and shirts,emblazoned with the phrase add a zero.the church sold the add a zero marked apparel as part of a fundraising campaign to pay off the debt on its church facility and the associated acre tract of land.icon industries supplied the church with the add a zero marked apparel,which the church sold in its bookstore 
the church sought a federal trademark for the add a zero mark at the patent and trademark office in march.the church filed two trademark applications,one for use of add a zero in standard characters and another for a stylized design of the phrase.the church applications relied on actual use of the marks in commerce,not intent to use the marks in commerce.the office granted the church applications and registered the marks as registration and.
in,adidas ag adidas sought a clothing trademark for the phrase adizero,but the office refused the application for likelihood of confusion with the church add a zero marks.adidas brought an action before the trademark trial and appeal board to cancel the church marks,arguing several grounds for cancellation the church failure to use the marks in commerce before registration the marks failure to function as trademarks and the church abandonment of the marks for nonuse.the board agreed with adidas argument and cancelled the church marks,without addressing adidas alternate cancellation grounds.the board considered the church proffered evidence over adidas hearsay and authentication objections of a cancelled check for the sale of two add a zero marked hats for in february,before the church applied for its marks.the church had kept the check in its records and it with a sales register it maintained for its bookstore.the check drawer was charlotte howard,who had a wisconsin home address on her check.
the board disagreed with the church that the sale to howard evidenced the requisite use in commerce under the lanham act.the board concluded 
t he sale of two add a zero caps at a minimal cost within the state of illinois to howard,who resides outside the state,does not affect commerce that congress can regulate such that the transaction would constitute use in commerce for purposes of registration.
this sale is de minimis and,under the circumstances shown here,is insufficient to show use that affects interstate commerce.

discussion 
the lanham act provides that t he owner of a trademark used in commerce may request registration of its trademark.a emphasis added.section a use in commerce requirement distinguishes it from b,which offers protection for a person who has a bona fide intention,under circumstances showing the good faith of such person,to use a trademark in commerce.id.b.the lanham act explains the use in commerce requirement as it relates to goods 
the term use in commerce means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.for purposes of this chapter,a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce 
on goods when 
a it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto,or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable,then on documents associated with the goods or their sale,and 
b the goods are sold or transported in commerce 
id.emphases added.further,the lanham act defines commerce as all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by congress.id.thus,to register a mark under a,one must sell or transport goods bearing the mark such that the sale or transport would be subject to congress power under the commerce clause,which includes its power to regulate interstate commerce.larry harmon pictures williams rest,fed.cir.citing,art.i,see also in re silenus wines,ccpa.
the dispute between the parties in this case is limited to whether the church,which filed its applications under a use in commerce subsection,made a sale of marked goods in commerce regulable by congress before applying for its marks.
as a threshold matter,we address whether the board erred in admitting howard check into evidence and in finding that howard resided in wisconsin.adidas argues that the board should not have admitted the check because howard address on the check constitutes inadmissible hearsay and because the check was not authenticated.we review the board admission of the check for abuse of discretion.coach,triumph learning llc,fed.cir.citing crash dummy movie,llc mattel,fed.cir.we will reverse only if the board evidentiary ruling was clearly unreasonable,arbitrary,or fanciful based on an erroneous conclusion of law premised on clearly erroneous findings of fact or the record contains no evidence on which the board could rationally base its decision.id.quoting crash dummy movie,at.
no party disputes that howard address on the check is a hearsay statement,which is typically not admissible into evidence.the federal rules of evidence provide,however,an exception to the bar on hearsay evidence for business records of regularly conducted conduct kept in the ordinary course.fed.evid.the board relied on this exception in admitting howard check.a church pastor,whose duties included church recordkeeping,testified that the check was maintained in the church records in the normal course of church bookstore sales,along with the corroborating entry in the bookstore ledger of sales.adidas argues that the address on the check had nothing to do with church business,and therefore,the check should not have been admissible under the business records exception.we disagree.
the business records exception does not require that the document actually be prepared by the business entity proffering the document.air land forwarders,united states,fed.cir.when a business relies on a document it has not itself prepared,two factors bear on the admissibility of the evidence as a business record that the incorporating business rely upon the accuracy of the document incorporated and that there are other circumstances indicating the trustworthiness of the document.id.we hold that the board did not abuse its discretion in determining that the church relied on the check,a negotiable instrument,as accurate and trustworthy.we also hold that the check is as commercial paper under federal rule of evidence.see united states pang,cir.a check is a species of commercial paper,and therefore citing fed.evid.
based on the admitted check and a church pastor testimony that many church parishioners reside in wisconsin,the board found that howard resided in wisconsin.adidas argues this factual conclusion was unsupported.we review the board factual determinations under a substantial evidence standard.in re chippendales usa,fed.cir.citing in re pacer,fed.cir.e.we conclude that the admitted check and the church pastor testimony constitute substantial evidence to support the board determination regarding howard residence.
having resolved that the board properly admitted the church evidence of an intrastate sale to an resident,we now consider whether such a sale is regulable by congress,sa
