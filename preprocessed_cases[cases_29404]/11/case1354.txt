background 
doctor john operates stores that sell,among other things,a range of adult products.john haltom is a major shareholder in doctor john parent company and is involved in the operation of doctor john roy city store.soon after doctor john came to town,the city of roy passed an ordinance requiring all sexually oriented businesses and their employees to follow various regulations to prevent the deleterious effects of those businesses.the ordinance sets forth findings supporting the need for the regulations based on case law,congressional testimony,research papers,and various studies from other cities.at.the details of the ordinance are not particularly relevant to this appeal,but briefly,the ordinance requires that these businesses and their employees obtain licenses,that they pay an application and annual renewal fees,and that they limit their operating hours to am to pm.once an application is filed,a temporary license is immediately issued,and a permanent license will follow except under certain circumstances including,for example,when an employee has convictions for specified crimes,the business has refused inspection of the premises within the last year,or the business has provided incomplete or false information.
doctor john refused to submit an application and filed a lawsuit pursuant to alleging the ordinance was an unconstitutional restriction on speech.the city counterclaimed seeking a court order requiring doctor john to comply with the ordinance.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to the city on all federal claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims.doctor john,city of roy,d doctor john i.on appeal,we affirmed summary judgment for the city on all claims except the first amendment claim,remanding because we were uncertain whether the district court considered articles doctor john submitted in its district court pleadings to cast doubt on the city rationale as required by alameda books step.doctor john ii,at.we remanded reasoning that because the parties evidence is essential to determining whether an ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a municipality interest in preventing secondary effects,it was necessary to allow the district court to thoroughly review doctor john evidence since the evidence was not mentioned in the district court order.id.
on remand,the district court first considered whether doctor john failure to disclose the articles as discoverable information or supplement previous disclosures was harmless under.a.doctor john iii,wl,at.the district court concluded the untimeliness was not harmless and the materials were inadmissible as a sanction under rule c.id.then the district court proceeded to analyze whether the articles cast doubt on the city rationale for its ordinance,assuming the articles were admissible.the district court noted that despite its briefing order requesting the parties to explain how their studies supported or cast doubt on the ordinance,doctor john only responded to the city rule and hearsay arguments and argued issues foreclosed by doctor john ii.wl,at.despite this failure,the district court still reviewed arguments in doctor john initial summary judgment pleadings from and concluded that the materials doctor john submitted had failed to cast doubt on the ordinance rationale.id.
discussion 
ordinances targeting the secondary effects of adult businesses are analyzed as time,place,and manner regulations.city of renton playtime theatres,d.these ordinances will be upheld if they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,id.at,narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and leave open reasonable alternative avenues of communication.gifts,city of aurora,cir.in doctor john ii,we previously determined that the ordinance is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech and noted that doctor john did not argue that the ordinance fails to leave open alternative avenues of communication.at.thus,the only issue left to consider is whether there is any issue of material fact precluding summary judgment with regard to whether the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.we review this issue de novo.rost ex rel.steamboat springs sch,cir.
the city bears the burden of providing evidence of secondary effects to justify its ordinance.alameda books,at.plurality.a municipality may rely on any evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.renton,at.this is not to say that a municipality can get away with shoddy data or reasoning.the municipality evidence must fairly support the municipality rationale for its ordinance.alameda books,at.the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to cast direct doubt on this rationale,either by demonstrating that the municipality evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the municipality factual findings.id.at.if the plaintiff succeeds in casting doubt on the municipality rationale,the burden shifts back to the municipality to supplement the record with evidence renewing support for a theory that justifies its ordinance.id.at.
in doctor john ii,we held that the city had satisfied its burden under step of alameda books,rejecting doctor john contention that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored because it lacks specific evidence concerning adult businesses.at.we reasoned that a municipality need not initially produce specific evidence regarding the precise type of business,but a plaintiff may challenge a municipality rationale by producing evidence that its type of adult business,is relevantly different than those types of businesses analyzed in the studies supporting the ordinance.id.at.because doctor john had produced no evidence regarding adult businesses,that argument failed to cast doubt on the city rationale.id.we ultimately remanded because the record was not clear whether the district court considered the articles doctor john submitted to cast doubt on the city rationale.therefore,the only surviving issue on appeal is whether the evidence doctor john submitted to the district court casts doubt on the city rationale for its ordinance at alameda books step.
