utah lighthouse ministry utlm appeals from a decision of the district court granting defendants motion for summary judgment on utlm claims of trademark infringement,unfair competition,and cybersquatting.
background 
jerald and sandra tanner founded utlm in to critique the church of jesus christ of saints lds church.in support of its mission,utlm sells books at both a bookstore in utah and through an online bookstore at the official utlm website,www.utlm.org.
the foundation for apologetic information and research fair is a volunteer organization that responds to criticisms of the lds church.fair website also has an online bookstore,and both fair and utlm provide online publications on the subject of the lds church.the publications in the two bookstores overlap by thirty titles.allen wyatt is the vice president and webmaster for fair.in november,wyatt created a website parodying the utlm wyatt website is similar in appearance but has different,though suggestively parallel,content.
the district court memorandum decision and order describes the design and content of the wyatt and utlm websites mem.decision order at,and appellant appendix includes screen shots of the websites.the design elements are similar,including the image of a lighthouse with black and white barbershop stripes.however,the words destroy,mislead,and deceive are written across the stripes on the wyatt website.prominent text on the wyatt website consists of a slight modification of the language located in the same position on the utlm website.for example,the utlm website states welcome to the official website of the utah lighthouse ministry,founded by jerald and sandra tanner.in comparison,the wyatt website states welcome to an official website about the utah lighthouse ministry,which was founded by jerald and sandra tanner.emphasis added.the wyatt website does not have any kind of disclaimer that it is not associated with utlm.
the wyatt website contains no advertising and offers no goods or services for sale.the wyatt website includes sixteen external hyperlinks.eleven of these hyperlinks point to the website of an organization at brigham young university.three hyperlinks point to articles on the fair website that are critical of the tanners,and another takes viewers directly to the fair homepage.the other external hyperlink is to the website of the lds church.
wyatt,through his company discovery computing,registered ten domain names,each of which directed visitors to the wyatt website.the domain names are combinations of utah lighthouse ministry,sandra tanner,gerald tanner,jerald tanner,and and.wyatt first publicized the wyatt website to fair members in april.defendants assert that prior to april only wyatt had any knowledge of or input into the website.
wyatt ceased operation of the website and began to transfer the domain names to utlm in april.
procedural history 
utlm complaint made six claims for relief trademark infringement,a unfair competition,unfair competition under utah law,utah code ann.trademark dilution,c cybersquatting,id.d and trade dress infringement,id.a.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court judge denied plaintiff motion and granted defendants motion on all six counts.utlm appeals only the district court ruling on the trademark infringement,unfair competition,and cybersquatting claims furthermore,utlm appeals with regard to only one of its trademarks,utah lighthouse.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and apply the same legal standard as the district court.medianews group,mccarthey,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we consider the factual record,together with all reasonable inferences derived therefrom,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and we do not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.jones barnhart,cir.
trademark infringement and unfair competition 
trademark infringement is a type of unfair competition the two claims have virtually identical elements and are properly addressed together as an action brought under a b,commonly known as section of the lanham act.see donchez coors brewing,cir two pesos,taco cabana,d heaton distrib.union tank car,cir trademark infringement is but part of broader law of unfair competition and facts supporting suit for infringement and one for unfair competition are substantially identical.
because utlm trademark,utah lighthouse,was not registered at the time allen wyatt created the wyatt website in november utlm must show that the mark is protectable.see two pesos,at.donchez,at.in addition,utlm must demonstrate that defendants used the trademark in connection with any goods or services.a.finally,utlm must establish that defendants use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person.id.a a.
the district court found that the mark utah lighthouse was not protectable,that the defendants use of the mark was not commercial,and that there was no likelihood of other words,that none of the three requirements for a trademark infringement claim were satisfied.
protectability 
utlm argued to the district court that the mark utah lighthouse was entitled to a presumption of protectability because it is a registered mark.appellees suppl.app.at.the district court rejected this argument on the ground that utah lighthouse was not registered at the time the lawsuit was filed,and therefore is not entitled to a presumption of validity under a mem.decision order at.second,the district court held that utlm had failed to show that any of its trademarks had acquired secondary meaning.id.
utlm contends that the district court should have applied the test for trademark distinctiveness stated in donchez coors brewing,cir.under the donchez approach,there are five categories of marks generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,and fanciful.id.at quoting lane capital,lane capital,cir.the category into which a mark falls determines both its eligibility for protection and the degree of protection accorded.id.generic and descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive and therefore require a showing of secondary is,that the consuming public has come to view these marks as distinctive.utlm argues on appeal that utah lighthouse is distinctive because it is arbitrary and therefore no showing of secondary meaning is required.however,utlm did not raise this argument below.instead it relied on the registration of utah lighthouse to argue that it was entitled to a statutory presumption of protectability.though the court of appeals has discretion to consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal,singleton wulff,d,we decline to do so in this case.see cummings norton,cir ns,comm r,cir an issue must be presented to,considered and decided by the trial court before it can be raised on appeal.
one could construe utlm arguments to the district court as asserting that utah lighthouse had acquired secondary meaning,based on the evidence that utlm presented on the prevalence of the utah lighthouse trademark on the internet.this evidence took the form of the number of hits generated by searches for utah lighthouse on the yahoo and google search engines and on the websites of other organizations associated with the lds church.see appellant app.at.a mark acquires a secondary meaning if the words have been used so long and so exclusively by one producer with reference to his goods or articles that,in that trade and to that branch of the purchasing public,the word or phrase has come to mean that the article is his product.educ.dev.econ,cir internal quotation marks omitted modification in original.the number of search engine hits,standing alone,is inadequate to demonstrate that consumers associate the mark with a particular product or producer,or perceive utah lighthouse as a distinctive mark.in a recent decision,we noted that the mere fact that ski magazine had repeatedly ranked the vail ski resort as a preeminent ski resort over the last twenty years was ineffective evidence of the secondary meaning of the descriptive term vail.vail assocs,cir.such evidence would have been more probative of consumer perceptions if the plaintiff had also presented evidence as to the circulation of ski magazine,the regard in which likely consumers of the plaintiff services hold the magazine,or the percentage of those consumers that read the magazine.id.likewise,in this case the number of search engine hits would support utlm claim of secondary meaning only if accompanied by some kind of evidence that the relevant market of consumers has visited the websites containing these hits.therefore,we conclude that utlm failed to present sufficient evidence to enable a reasonable jury to find that the utah lighthouse mark had acquired a secondary meaning.
commercial use 
to invoke the protections of the lanham act,a plaintiff must show that the alleged infringer used the plaintiff mark in connection with any goods or services.a bosley med,kremer,cir.this is commonly described as the commercial use requirement.
utlm asserts that wyatt use was commercial on three grounds.first,that the wyatt website hyperlinked to a website that sells fair website.second,that the wyatt website interferes with the ability of users to reach the goods and services offered on the utlm website.third,that the overall commercial nature of the internet renders the website itself a commercial use.
utlm first argument is that the wyatt website became commercial because it hyperlinked to the fair website,which contains an online bookstore.several circuit courts of appeals,but not the tenth circuit,have confronted the issue of when hyperlinking renders an otherwise noncommercial website subject to the lanham act.see,bosley med,finding a sequence of links to advertising too attenuated to constitute commercial use taubman webfeats,cir concluding that a site was commercial because it contained hyperlinks to two commercial websites,even though the links were extremely minimal people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir holding that a website which linked to thirty commercial operators was itself commercial see also obh,spotlight magazine,d.
the most significant and analogous of these cases is the ninth circuit decision in bosley medical institute kremer.in bosley,the defendant was dissatisfied with a hair implant procedure he had received from bosley medical and created a website with the domain name to post negative information about bosley medical.the website linked to another website also maintained by the defendant,which in turn linked to a newsgroup,which contained advertisements for bosley medical competitors.the ninth circuit affirmed the district court ruling that the defendant use was not in connection with the sale of goods or services because the link to bosley medical competitors was too roundabout and attenuated.at.
in this case,the district court held that the wyatt website was not a commercial use because it provided no goods or services,earned no revenue,and had no direct links to any commercial sites.mem.decision order at.the district court holding was consistent with the,assessment that the ninth circuit utilized in bosley,and that we believe is appropriate.
the lanham act is intended to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers,two pesos,at,not to prevent all unauthorized uses.the first and ninth circuits have emphasized that trademark rights can not be used to quash an unauthorized use of the mark by another who is communicating ideas or expressing points of view.bean,drake publishers,cir bosley,at.like in bosley,wyatt used utlm trademark not in connection with a sale of goods or services but in connection with the expression of his opinion about utlm goods and services.bosley,at.in both bosley and this case,the offending websites offered critical commentary about the trademark owner,and the use of the trademark was separated from any goods or services offered for sale.the wyatt website links to three articles on the fair website and to the fair homepage,but not directly to the fair bookstore.the fair homepage is overwhelmingly noncommercial in nature,and contains only an inconspicuous link to the fair online bookstore.appellant app.at.in a situation like this,the roundabout path to the advertising or commercial use of others is simply too attenuated.bosley,at.
utlm second argument is that the wyatt website prevents users from accessing both utlm ideological services and the books for sale through the online bookstore.the fourth circuit recognized this kind of competition in people for ethical treatment of animals peta doughney,cir,in which the defendant had created a website with the domain name that promoted carnivorous behavior an idea antithetical to the animal rights agenda promoted by peta.the defendant website contained hyperlinks to over thirty commercial operators.id.at.the fourth circuit held that these links made the defendant use of peta mark commercial.however,the court also held that the defendant need not have actually sold or advertised goods or services but need only have prevented users from obtaining or using peta goods or services.id.at.
likewise,utlm argues that the use of a trademark is within the scope of the lanham act if the use is in connection with the trademark owner sale of goods or services.such an interpretation eliminates the requirement of an economic competitor and is therefore inconsistent with the purpose of the lanham act to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers.two pesos,at.quoting park n fly dollar park fly,d.the interference theory has also been criticized on the ground that it would place most critical,otherwise protected consumer commentary under the restrictions of the lanham act.see bosley,at.in our view,the defendant in a trademark infringement and unfair competition case must use the mark in connection with the goods or services of a competing producer,not merely to make a comment on the trademark owner goods or services.the lanham act addresses the specific problem of consumer confusion about the source of goods and services created by the unauthorized use of trademarks.see prestonettes,coty.a trademark only gives the right to prohibit the use of it so far as to protect the owner good will against the sale of another product as his.unless there is a competing good or service labeled or associated with the plaintiff trademark,the concerns of the lanham act are not invoked.see lang ret.living publ g,cir t he lanham act seeks to prevent consumer confusion that enables a seller to pass off his goods as the goods of another t rademark infringement protects only against mistaken purchasing decisions and not against confusion generally.internal quotations and citations omitted.
utlm third argument is that the broad scope and wide commercial use of the internet itself makes defendants use of utlm trademark as a domain name a commercial use for purposes of the lanham act.appellant amended opening brief at.utlm notes that several district courts have adopted this view,but mischaracterizes the holdings of these courts.id.citing obh,d at planned parenthood fed of,wl,at intermatic toeppen.it is important to distinguish between the merely jurisdictional in commerce requirement,see,and the in connection with any goods and services requirement that establishes a violation of section of the lanham act.see bosley,at.all three of the district court decisions that utlm cites held that the use of a trademark on the internet satisfies only the jurisdictional requirement.these courts concluded that each defendant use of the trademark was in connection with goods and services,but based on facts other than the mere use of the internet.we agree that the internet is generally an instrumentality of interstate commerce,see united states schaefer,cir,and thus that the jurisdiction of the lanham act constitutionally extends to unauthorized uses of trademarks on the internet however,this does not mean that any use of the internet is necessarily commercial for the purposes of the lanham act,as utlm advocates.moreover,conflating these two commerce requirements would greatly expand the scope of the lanham act to encompass objectively noncommercial speech.we therefore decline to adopt utlm proposed rule that any use of a trademark on the internet is a use in connection with goods or services.
defendants use of utlm trademark,utah lighthouse,is not in connection with any goods or services,and therefore the district court properly granted summary judgment on utlm trademark infringement and unfair competition claims.
likelihood of confusion 
even if defendants use were determined to be commercial,it would only infringe upon utlm trademark rights if the use created a likelihood of confusion.a a.the party alleging infringement has the burden of proving likelihood of confusion.australian gold,hatfield,cir.though likelihood of confusion is a question of fact,it is amenable to summary judgment in that c ourts retain an important authority to monitor the outer limits of substantial similarity within which a jury is permitted to make the factual determination whether there is a likelihood of confusion.universal money ctrs.v.at t,cir quoting warner am.broad,cir.
likelihood of confusion is typically evaluated according to a test in which the court considers the degree of similarity between the marks the intent of the alleged infringer in using the mark evidence of actual confusion similarity of products and manner of marketing the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers and the strength or weakness of the marks.sally beauty,beautyco,cir.no one factor is dispositive.the district court found that there was no likelihood of confusion based on its analysis of these six factors and its determination that the wyatt website was a parody of the utlm website.mem.decision order at.parody is another factor to consider in determining the likelihood of confusion,and casts several of the six factors in a different light.for instance,defendants do not dispute that the marks are similar,and wyatt admitted that he intentionally selected the utah lighthouse domain name on the basis that it seemed like a good name to use to refute or provide criticisms about the tanners.appellant app.at wyatt dep.at.evidence that the alleged infringer chose a mark with the intent to copy,rather than randomly or by accident,typically supports an inference of likelihood of confusion.sally beauty,at see,planned parenthood fed of,wl,at finding that defendant used plaintiff trademark to intentionally divert internet traffic to his own websites jews for jesus brodsky,same.wyatt counters that the inference arises only if the defendant intended to benefit from the reputation or goodwill of the trademark owner,see jordache,hogg wyld,cir,and that he could not be intending to benefit from utlm goodwill since he was criticizing utlm.a critical parody nevertheless derive s benefit from the reputation of the owner of the mark in that no parody could be made without the initial mark.id.at citations omitted.what is critical is that the benefit arises from the humorous association,not from public confusion as to the source of the marks,so no inference of confusion can be drawn from the intentional use simply as a parody.
evidence of actual confusion is not necessary to show a likelihood of confusion,but it is the best evidence of a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace.standard oil standard oil,cir.the district court found that there was no evidence of actual confusion.mem.decision opinion at.while it appears that utlm proffered some weak evidence of actual confusion the district court did not err in finding that this factor weighs in favor of the defendants.
the fourth factor,the similarity in goods and services offered and in the manner of marketing,is difficult to apply in this case because of the attenuation between the use of the trademark and the goods offered for sale.this illustrates the problems with a more expansive interpretation of the commercial use requirement urged by utlm.it is true that utlm and fair both operate online bookstores and sell overlapping sets of book titles.however,any potential for confusion created by the similarity in goods and manner of marketing is mitigated by the lengthy path a consumer must take to reach the goods offered for sale.the fair bookstore does not use utlm trademark,and a searcher must click through a website that does not resemble the utlm website in order to reach fair bookstore.
the fifth factor is the degree of care typically exercised by purchasers of the products linked to the trademark.utlm contends that its customers would exercise a reduced degree of care because books sold online are impulse purchases.however,one could also infer that potential customers of the utlm bookstore are discerning and sophisticated about where they purchase books on controversial religious subjects.the district court concluded that the fifth factor was irrelevant to the likelihood of confusion analysis based on the difference between the wyatt website and fair bookstore.as with the fourth factor,the absence of the utlm trademark on the fair website or the fair bookstore lessens the chance that a consumer would be mislead into believing that she is visiting the utlm online bookstore.therefore,this factor does not weigh in favor of a finding of likelihood of confusion.
the final factor in determining likelihood of confusion is the strength of the mark t he stronger the mark,the greater the likelihood that encroachment on the mark will cause confusion.sally beauty,at.strength consists of both conceptual strength,which refers to the placement of the mark along the distinctiveness spectrum,and commercial strength,which refers to the marketplace recognition value of the mark.king of sports,chrysler,cir.utlm did not submit any evidence to the district court of conceptual strength,and the district court determined that utlm evidence of search engine hits did not demonstrate that the mark had significant recognition value in the marketplace.the evidence present in the record suggests that the commercial strength factor weighs against a finding of confusion.even if we consider the arguments for conceptual strength,which were made for the first time on appeal,and thereby conclude that the mark is strong,that alone is insufficient to find a likelihood of confusion.a parody,of course,could not succeed if the trademark lacked any strength.
on balance,the six sally beauty factors weigh against a finding of likelihood of confusion.although we conclude that there is no likelihood of confusion based on this conventional analysis,the fact that the wyatt website is a parody provides an even more convincing explanation of why consumers are unlikely to be confused.
the district court determined that the wyatt website was a parody because it would be immediately apparent to anyone visiting the wyatt website that it was not the utlm website due to the differences in content the district court did not commit error in making this finding,as there are sufficient differences between the content and style of the two websites to avoid the possibility of confusion.
the fact that the wyatt website is a successful parody weighs heavily against a finding of likelihood of confusion.a parody adopts some features of the original mark,but relies upon a difference from the original mark to produce its desired effect.see jordache,at an intent to parody is not an intent to confuse.cardtoons,major league baseball players ass n,cir.in contrast,an unsuccessful that creates a likelihood of not protected from an infringement suit.see cliffs notes,bantam doubleday dell publ g group,cir confusing parodies are vulnerable under trademark law bean,at confusing parodies implicate the legitimate commercial and consumer protection objectives of trademark law.
in conclusion,utlm failed to produce sufficient evidence to support a finding by a rational jury that utah lighthouse is protectable,that defendants use was in con
