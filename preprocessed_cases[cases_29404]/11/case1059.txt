the international franchise association ifa appeals the denial of a preliminary injunction which ifa sought in order to prevent the city of seattle city from enforcing a provision in its recently enacted minimum wage ordinance.the provision classifies certain franchisees as large employers,subjecting them as a result to a steeper schedule of incremental wage increases over the next five years.while we express no view as to the ultimate merits,we affirm because ifa did not,at this stage in the proceeding,show it is likely to succeed on the merits or that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.
factual and procedural background 
shortly after taking office,seattle mayor ed murray assembled an income inequality advisory committee iiac tasked with making recommendations on how best to increase the minimum wage in seattle.the iiac consisted of members and included representatives from the business community and labor unions.following a series of meetings and public engagement forums,the iiac recommended enacting staged increases in the minimum wage,with smaller businesses subject to a more gradual schedule,recognizing that they would face particular challenges in implementing a higher minimum wage.though the iiac debated whether to classify franchisees as large employers,it did not recommend doing so.
based on the iiac recommendation,the mayor office drafted a proposed ordinance that would raise the minimum wage to per hour in stages according to two schedules one for businesses with or more employees schedule one employers and the second for businesses with fewer than employees schedule two employers.the draft ordinance classified franchisees associated with a franchisor network of franchisees employing more than employees nationwide as schedule one employers,regardless of the number of persons employed by the particular franchisee or the number of persons employed in seattle.
the city council unanimously passed the ordinance on june,and the mayor signed it into law the next day.the ordinance raises the minimum wage in stages according to two schedules for large and small employers,ord,and classifies franchisees affiliated with large networks as large employers,id.t definition of large employer.the ordinance defines a franchise as 
a written agreement by which a person is granted the right to engage in the business of offering,selling,or distributing goods or services under a marketing plan prescribed or suggested in substantial part by the grantor or its affiliate the operation of the business is substantially associated with a trademark,service mark,trade name,advertising,or other commercial symbol designating,owned by,or licensed by the grantor or its affiliate and the person pays,agrees to pay,or is required to pay,directly or indirectly,a franchise fee.
the incremental increases for each schedule are as follows 
ifa filed suit in district court,seeking a preliminary injunction that would require seattle to classify certain franchisees as small employers.it did not challenge the city authority to raise the minimum wage generally or to differentiate between large and small employers,nor does it do so on appeal.ifa alleged that the franchisee classification violated the commerce clause,equal protection clause,first amendment,and the washington state constitution,and was preempted by the lanham act and erisa 
after hearing argument,the district court denied ifa motion for preliminary injunction,finding that it did not show a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of its various claims.int l franchise ass n,city of seattle,wl,at.the district court also concluded that the remaining preliminary injunction factors disfavor granting a preliminary injunction.id.at.

dormant commerce clause 
although the commerce clause is by its text an affirmative grant of power to congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce,the clause has long been recognized as a limitation on the power of the states to enact laws imposing substantial burdens on such commerce.south central timber,wunnicke,d.modern dormant commerce clause jurisprudence primarily is driven by concern about economic protectionism that is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.dep t of revenue of davis,d quoting new energy of limbach,d.
a critical requirement for proving a violation of the dormant commerce clause is that there must be a substantial burden on interstate commerce.ass of optometrists opticians harris,cir citing south central timber,at.this standard recognizes that dormant commerce clause cases often involve delicate adjustment of the conflicting state and federal claims,hood sons,du mond.black,dissenting,and that not every exercise of local power is invalid merely because it affects in some way the flow of commerce between the states,great atl.pac.tea cottrell,d recognizing states retain broad power to legislate protection for their citizens in matters of local concern.
if a statute discriminates against entities on its face,in its purpose,or in its practical effect,it is unconstitutional unless it serves a legitimate local purpose,and this purpose could not be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means.rocky mountain farmers union corey,cir quoting maine taylor,d.absent discrimination,we will uphold the law unless the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.id.at quoting pike bruce church,d the party challenging the statute bears the burden of showing discrimination.black star farms,llc oliver,cir.
facial discrimination 
the district court did not apply an improper legal standard or clearly err in determining that the ordinance does not facially discriminate against entities or interstate commerce.the ordinance does not classify employers based on the location of their headquarters,the location of their workers,or the extent to which they participate in interstate commerce.rather,it classifies based on the number of employees a classification and the business model a classification.nor does the ordinance classify based on an employer links to interstate commerce or firms,but on neutral characteristics,such as having a marketing plan,operating a business associated with a trademark,and paying a franchisee fee.ord.i.a franchisee affiliated with a network that has employees in the state of washington and a headquarters in seattle is treated just like a franchisee affiliated with a franchise that has employees in washington,in oregon,and a headquarters in boston.a franchisee that sources its inputs from washington and serves local seattle residents is treated just like a franchisee or a,for that matter that sources its inputs from oregon and serves tourists.
ifa contends the ordinance does not impose a facially neutral requirement because it expressly discriminates against franchises.based on this record,we disagree.a distinction drawn based on a firm business model a characteristic ifa contends is highly correlated with interstate commerce does not constitute facial discrimination against entities or interstate commerce.see cachia islamorada,cir ban on formula restaurants does not facially discriminate between and interests island silver spice,islamorada,cir restrictive regulation of formula retail establishments does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce.
at a minimum,the district court did not clearly err in rejecting ifa correlation.ifa did not establish that seattle franchisees the party ifa concedes bears the burden of the ordinance that pay local taxes and have local representation are entities.see state highway dep t barnwell.political restraints are absent when legislating against interests.nor did it establish that franchises have such unique links to interstate commerce relative to that the ordinance facially discriminates against interstate commerce.
discriminatory purpose 
the ninth circuit recently stated 
the party challenging a regulation bears the burden of establishing that a challenged statute has a discriminatory purpose or effect under the commerce clause.we will assume that the objectives articulated by the legislature are actual purposes of the statute,unless an examination of the circumstances forces us to conclude that they could not have been a goal of the legislation.
rocky mountain farmers union,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in the context of interpreting statutes,the supreme court has consistently held that statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.gross fbl fin,d citation omitted see also united states,d discerning congressional purpose is a hazardous matter.
ifa does not fault the district court for applying an incorrect test or considering irrelevant factors.rather,it argues that the district court erred in evaluating the evidence of motive.
while the record contains some evidence that city officials and advocates questioned the merits of the franchise business model,the district court did not clearly err in determining that the city council was not motivated by an intent to discriminate against firms or interstate commerce.the text shows the city had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory purpose.the preamble states that the ordinance general purpose is to improve public health and welfare and reduce economic inequality.see ord.pr.id.the public welfare,health,and prosperity of seattle require wages and benefits sufficient to ensure a decent and healthy life for all seattle workers and their families.
as for the distinction between large and small businesses,the ordinance explains in a finding that small businesses and organizations may have difficulty in accommodating the increased costs.id.while the preamble does not provide a rationale for the franchisee classification,the definition of franchisees as large employers,id.t read in concert with the small business finding supports an inference that the council viewed franchisees as more akin to large employers than small businesses and in their ability to accommodate increased costs.
in sum,there is strong textual evidence of the council general purpose and weaker textual evidence of its purpose with respect to the franchisee classification.yet,the ordinance context and structure indicate the purpose behind classifying franchisees as large employers is their relative ability to accommodate increased costs.further,discriminatory motives are absent from the text the ordinance does not demean franchises or describe them as an economic or social ill,nor does it euphemistically call for diversifying business ownership or leveling the playing field.in distinguishing between large and small employers,the ordinance does not use location as a factor,nor does it discuss reliance on local inputs or local customers.
in contrast,statutes struck down for their impermissible purpose have contained language promoting local industry or seeking to level the playing field.see lynn creamery,healy,d avowed purpose is to enable higher cost massachusetts dairy farmers to compete with lower cost dairy farmers in other states bacchus imports,dias,d stated reason for exempting ti root okolehao from tax was to encourage and promote the establishment of a new industry.ifa cites to no cases in which an ordinance lacking a stated discriminatory purpose was stricken for its impermissible motive 
ifa identifies the following as evidence of improper motive two emails from iiac member nick hanauer on may and may,an email from robert feldstein,a member of the mayor staff,a statement by mayor murray,a tweet by a councilmember,a statement by councilmember licata,and a statement by councilmember clark.the district court considered all of the emails and statements identified by the parties,and reproduced excerpts of many of them in its order 
of the evidence identified by ifa,hanauer emails contain the strongest language.he stated in an email sent may 
f ranchises like s ubway and mcdonalds really are not very good for our local economy.they are economically extractive,civically corrosive and culturally dilutive sic a city dominated by independent,locally owned,unique sandwich and hamburger restaurants will be more economically,civically and culturally rich than one dominated by extractive national chains.
he stated in another email sent may 
n ational franchises like mcdonalds,or burger king or kfc,or subway,simply are not that beneficial to our city.first,these organizations are consistently at the low end of the scale in terms of paying decently and offering benefits.not all small,locally owned companies take great care of their workers,but none of the national chains do o ur city has no obligation to continue policies that so obviously advantage them and disadvantage the local businesses that benefit our city and it sic citizens more.
while the emails are persuasive evidence of hanauer views,they do not show that hanauer intended to burden firms or interfere with the wheels of interstate commerce.more importantly,they also do not show that city officials wished to discriminate against entities,bolster firms,or burden interstate commerce.
thus,ifa failed to demonstrate that seattle franchisees are entities or that franchises are so interstate in character relative to that a distinction drawn on this basis interferes with interstate commerce.the district court did not clearly err in rejecting this framework.see exxon governor of,d dormant commerce clause does not protect particular structure or methods of operation in a retail market or particular interstate firms.thus,the evidence of views is insufficient to show a discriminatory motive.
even if we were to accept ifa premise,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the city did not have an impermissible motive.first,hanauer emails are not entitled to substantial weight.hanauer was not a city councilmember but one of members of the iiac.although mayor murray created and appointed the members of the iiac lending it a status ifa recognizes that the iiac did not draft any proposed legislation.and,even if the iiac is akin to a legislative committee,as ifa contends,its proposal did not contain the franchise recommendation ifa challenges citing ord.thus,at most,the emails provide insight into the motive of the body that did not recommend the provision.this is weak evidence of the city alleged impermissible purpose.
further,the time line indicates that hanauer emails came from the keystrokes of an advocate,not a iiac member,let alone a city official.see all.of auto.mfrs.gwadosky,cir statements by a law proponents can shed light on its purpose,but correspondence of a single lobbyist has little if any probative value in demonstrating the objectives of the legislative body as a whole citations omitted see also lynn creamery,at rehnquist,dissenting analysis of interest group participation in the political process may serve many useful purposes,but serving as a basis for interpreting the dormant commerce clause is not one of them.the emails were not sent until after mayor murray publicly announced the iiac proposal by may,the debate was no longer transpiring within the iiac but between the mayor,council,and advocates,hanauer included.the district court did not clearly err in assigning hanauer emails little weight.
second,while ifa provides some evidence that city officials criticized the franchise model,the statements it cited are too indirect and limited to overcome the evidence of the provision permissible purpose.for instance,a member of the mayor staff stated in an email that i f we lose franchises in seattle,i wo be sad,mayor murray stated that t here is a problem in the franchise business model,and councilmember clark stated that she was not worried about the ability of franchisees to absorb a higher minimum wage.yet,an errant remark in an email sent by a staff member is not a cipher that decodes the city council and mayor motives.and,the other two comments reflect a debate about the characteristics and resources of franchises,but are not persuasive evidence that the city was motivated by an intent to harm franchises.the district court did not clearly err in finding that this evidence fell short of demonstrating an impermissible purpose.
discriminatory effects 
the district court correctly observed that decisions interpreting the dormant commerce clause appear somewhat difficult to reconcile.int l franchise ass n,at see brown forman distillers state liquor,d recognizing that there is no clear line separating legislation with discriminatory effects from legislation with indirect effects.this is particularly the case here,where we assess an ordinance that does not resemble an established type of dormant commerce clause case rather,the measure arguably imposes costs on a class of businesses said to be highly correlated with firms or interstate commerce.
we lack supreme court authority assessing whether a regulation affecting franchises ipso facto has the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce.nor has the supreme court addressed whether franchises are instrumentalities of interstate commerce that can not be subjected to disparate regulatory burdens.while regulations that expressly classify based on business structure or impose disparate burdens on franchises present interesting questions,our review is limited to considering whether the district court applied improper legal principles or clearly erred in reviewing the record 
legal standards 
ifa contends that the district court cited and applied two improper legal standards in its discriminatory effects analysis the evidentiary burden and the standard to determine whether a statute causes discriminatory effects.
ifa argument that the district court abused its discretion by requiring a heightened evidentiary standard is unpersuasive.two recent decisions from our court establish that a plaintiff must satisfy a higher evidentiary burden when,as here,a statute is neither facially discriminatory nor motivated by an impermissible purpose.see rocky mountain farmers union,at black star farms,at.our approach is not an outlier.see cherry hill vineyard,llc baldacci,cir there must be substantial evidence of an actual discriminatory effect.it was not error to apply these precedents.
ifa raises a somewhat stronger but ultimately unsuccessful point when it contends that the district court erred in requiring evidence that the law causes local goods to constitute a larger share and goods with an source to constitute a smaller share of the market.int l franchise ass n,at.however,the district court did not err in considering this test,among others,because if the effect of a state regulation is to cause local goods to constitute a larger share,and goods with an source to constitute a smaller share,of the total sales in the market,then the regulation may have a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce.exxon,at.nevertheless,this is not the only test to determine whether a measure has discriminatory effects.while the mix of goods test is an apt one to evaluate statutes that impose tariffs on goods,this ordinance is alleged to impair the competitiveness of businesses such as hotels and restaurants.ifa does not contend that the ordinance will restrict the flow of goods.
but the district court did not limit its analysis to the mix of goods test.the district court also evaluated whether the ordinance would cause franchisees to suffer a competitive disadvantage as compared to other similarly situated small businesses,int l franchise ass n,at,increas e costs for a particular type of business model,create barriers to entry,id.at,raise labor costs in a way that will impact the flow of interstate commerce,cause franchisees to close or reduce operations,or generally affect interstate commerce,id.at.thus,the court considered measures to evaluating the effects of the ordinance.see new energy of,at lynn creamery,at.while the mix of goods test was on its own insufficient,the court did not err,as it evaluated a range of possible effects.
ii.substantial evidence of discriminatory effects 
the district court did not clearly err in finding that ifa did not provide substantial evidence showing that the ordinance will have discriminatory effects on firms or interstate commerce.ifa showing that percent of seattle franchisees are affiliated with franchisors,and that franchisees will be placed at a competitive disadvantage,does not prove that the ordinance will have a discriminatory effect on firms.ifa offering does not tend to prove that costs will be imposed on firms,firms will be at a competitive disadvantage,businesses will close,or that new firms will not enter the market.
rather,to the extent the ordinance has an effect,its primary or perhaps exclusive effect is to harm firms franchisees located in seattle.these firms will face a higher wage requirement relative to franchisees outside of seattle and see motors,at effects analysis should evaluate entities.alternatively,the ordinance can be viewed as harming one type of entity franchisees while benefitting another type of entity.neither comparison shows that economic interests are benefitted by burdening competitors.see dep t of revenue of,at.
ifa does not present evidence of the ordinance effect on firms.the record does not discuss diminished franchisor royalties or profitability,or show that future franchise development in seattle will be impaired.the only thing the affiliation rate shows is that most franchisees have relationships and are subject to a disparate minimum wage requirement.the district court did not clearly err in determining that ifa did not,at this stage in the proceeding,provide substantial evidence of discriminatory effects on firms.
nor did the district court err in finding that the ordinance does not have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce.the rate of franchise affiliation tells us very little about the ordinance effect on interstate commerce.ifa does not demonstrate how a wage requirement imposed on franchisees affects interstate commerce.the ordinance effects appear to be highly local.indeed,ifa concedes that franchisees independently pay the operating costs of their businesses including wages and that n o other party shares in these small business obligations.in other words,franchisees are burdened,not the wheels of interstate commerce.cachia,at island silver,at prohibiting national chains has the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce.
even crediting ifa contention that a disparate impact on national chains discriminates against interstate commerce,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the affiliation rate and franchisee declarations provided by ifa were insufficient.the record does not show that interstate franchise networks will face higher costs or reduce their investment and operations in seattle,nor does it show that the ordinance will discourage the flow of goods in interstate commerce.
in sum,the evidence that the ordinance will burden interstate commerce is not substantial.it does not show that interstate firms will be excluded from the market,earn less revenue or profit,lose customers,or close or reduce stores.nor does it show that new franchisees will not enter the market or that franchisors will suffer adverse effects.the district court did not clearly err 
ii.equal protection clause 
in areas of social and economic policy,a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.beach commc ns,d citations omitted.the district court properly cited the standard.int l franchise ass n,at citing,at.
the district court did not clearly err in finding a legitimate purpose in the classification and a rational relationship between franchisees and their classification as large employers.the court found that a reasonably conceivable state of facts could support the classification based on the economic benefits flowing to franchisees and franchisees ability to handle the faster schedule.id.at.the court based its determination on declarations from experts on franchises,as well as individual franchisees.
even if the relationship between the advantages enjoyed by franchisees and their ability to handle the faster schedule lacks strong support,the city determination does not require empirical data,and the classification is entitled to a strong presumption of validity,at.ifa did not negate every possible rationalization for the classification,see lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d,and the district court did not clearly err in finding that the classification survived review.
nor is the classification the result of mere animus or forbidden motive.as a threshold matter,this argument fails because the district court did not clearly err in finding a legitimate,rational basis for the city classification.romer evans,d amendment does not further a proper legislative end.it is legitimate and rational for the city to set a minimum wage based on economic factors,such as the ability of employers to pay those wages 
iii.first amendment 
ifa argues that the ordinance discriminates on the basis of protected speech because two of the three definitional criteria for franchises are based on speech and association operating under a marketing plan prescribed by a franchisor and associating with a trademark or other commercial symbol.this construction of the ordinance is unpersuasive.r estrictions on protected expression are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or,more generally,on nonexpressive conduct t he first amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech.sorrell ims health,d see also minneapolis star tribune.comm r of revenue,d.the threshold question is whether conduct with a significant expressive element drew the legal remedy or the ordinance has the inevitable effect of singling out those engaged in expressive activity.arcara cloud books,d.
seattle minimum wage ordinance is plainly an economic regulation that does not target speech or expressive conduct.the conduct at issue the decision of a franchisor and a franchisee to form a business relationship and their resulting business activities exhibits nothing that even the most vivid imagination might deem uniquely expressive.wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir discussing business activities of franchisee and franchisor.a business agreement or business dealings between a franchisor and a franchisee is not conduct with a significant expressive element.hurley irish am.gay,lesbian bisexual grp.of,d compiling instances of communicative conduct.nor does the statute singl e out those engaged in expressive activity such as newspapers or advocacy organizations.minneapolis star,at special tax that applies only to certain publications.
the ordinance,like a statute barring collusion,giboney empire storage ice,is not wholly unrelated to a communicative component,but that in itself does not trigger first amendment scrutiny.see arcara,at subjecting every incidental impact on speech to first amendment scrutiny would lead to the absurd result that any government action that had some conceivable consequences,such as the arrest of a newscaster for a traffic violation,would require analysis under the first amendment,concurring.although the franchisees are identified in part as companies associated with a trademark or brand,the ordinance applies to businesses that have adopted a particular business model,not to any message the businesses express.reed town of gilbert,d government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.it is clear that the ordinance was not motivated by a desire to suppress speech,the conduct at issue is not franchisee expression,and the ordinance does not have the effect of targeting expressive activity.the district court did not err in finding ifa did not show,on this record,a likelihood of success on this claim.
iv.lanham act preemption 
ifa preemption argument alleges that because the ordinance defines franchisees in part based on their shared use of a trademark,it frustrates the purposes and objectives of the lanham act.the district court correctly ruled that ifa did not show a likelihood of succeeding on this claim,as the ordinance does not conflict with the purposes of the act.
as the lanham act does not expressly preempt state law,mariniello shell oil,cir,and courts have said that it does not occupy the field,attrezzi,llc maytag,cir,the ordinance can only be preempted if it conflicts with the lanham act,see generally freightliner myrick,d local laws can be preempted expressly,when congress occupies the field,or when state law conflicts with or frustrates the purpose of statute.
ifa does not indicate which provision of the lanham act preempts the ordinance,apart from a general purposive statement in the act that it is designed to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by state,or territorial legislation.the act does not discuss the regulation of wages or employment conditions or establish that classifications based on trademark use are impermissible.
the value of the purpose language is limited by the absence of operative language.language in the senate report accompanying the statute clarifies congress motives 
the purpose underlying any statute is twofold.one is to protect the public so it may be confident that it will get the product which it asks for and wants to get.secondly,where the owner of a has spent energy,time,and money in presenting to the public the product,he is protected in his investment from its misappropriation by pirates and cheats.
a number of courts have cited this language in assessing whether measures affecting but not directly regulating trademarks are preempted.for instance,the third circuit affirmed a rule barring franchisors from terminating a franchise without cause,rejecting the argument that it was preempted by the lanham act because n o deception of the public is suggested and no dilution of an investment in its trademark is alleged to have occurred.mariniello,at.
similarly,the utah supreme court determined that a state criminal statute penalizing passing counterfeit goods containing federally registered trademarks does not conflict with the lanham act because it does not permit confusing or deceptive trademarks to operate,infringing on the guarantee of exclusive use to federal trademark holders.state frampton,utah quoting mariniello,at see also am.petroleum inst.cooper,cir u nder the lanham act,the mark holder has a right to maintain the quality of the goods bearing its mark,and when a state statute does not significantly interfere with that right,there is no preemption.golden door,odisho,cir similar,citing mariniello.applying this standard,the ordinance does not interfere with a franchise ability to maintain quality,compromise the public confidence in trademarks,allow misappropriation,or directly interfere with or regulate marks.thus,the ordinance is not preempted by the statute 
further,it has not been shown that congress clearly intended to preempt an ordinance of this nature.see state conference of blue cros
