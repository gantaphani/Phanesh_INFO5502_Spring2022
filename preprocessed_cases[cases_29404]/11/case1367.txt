we first hold that the district court erred in concluding that colorado visionary negligent misrepresentation claim could not be maintained under the circumstances of the case,and we reverse that ruling.because colorado visionary was entitled to a jury trial on that claim,and because any explicit findings of the jury and any necessary inferences from a general verdict would have been binding on the district court in the bench trial of the promissory estoppel claim,we vacate the judgment for medtronic on the promissory estoppel claim with directions to reconsider that claim after the jury trial of the negligent misrepresentation claim.we also vacate the district judge pretrial ruling which precluded plaintiff from presenting evidence of lost profits on its promissory estoppel claim.the remedies available,if that claim succeeds,must be determined in light of the specific facts and circumstances as they are finally determined.
the factual background 
only a very general overview of the background of this litigation is necessary for the context of our analysis of the legal issues involved in this appeal.because of our holdings in part ii and part iii,infra,the relevant facts are stated in the light most favorable to colorado visionary we need not give deference to the findings of the district court.
plaintiff colorado visionary academy is a charter school.in the spring and summer of,it needed to find a new site for the upcoming school year.although plaintiff had explored other possibilities,it was very interested in a facility owned and operated by medtronic.defendant medtronic manufactures and sells health equipment.medtronic had a large building in parker,colorado,that it used for research and manufacturing.medtronic was interested in selling the facility to colorado visionary and leasing back a portion of the space for its continued operations.
a proposal along those lines was made.negotiations were quite serious and reached the point where apparently at least some of those involved believed that a final deal would be struck.colorado visionary had begun moving some administrators into the building and was preparing to do some renovation.in the end,however,medtronic management decided against the sale,apparently over liability concerns about having schoolchildren in the same building where it was conducting its operations.this decision was communicated to colorado visionary on august.
in june,however,colorado visionary had allegedly been given assurances that the deal would close.among the statements allegedly made by representatives of medtronic was that the deal had been approved at the highest corporate level,that the deal was a friendly transaction,and that any problems would be worked out.
in reliance on these assurances,colorado visionary declined an opportunity to lease a different site and began preparations for moving into medtronic building.with medtronic consent,parents were invited to a meeting there.medtronic began moving out of the area that was to be used by the school.in early august,contractors began physical work at the facility,including some demolition.but on august,with school to begin in september,word came that medtronic would not go through with the deal.this announcement came from medtronic general counsel.about one hundred students who had been expected to enroll did not,and this of course substantially reduced colorado visionary revenues.after trying for a year to continue on a temporary campus,the school lost its charter from the local school district.
this suit by colorado visionary against medtronic and tobin real estate company was commenced on august.on june,medtronic moved for summary judgment on colorado visionary amended complaint in that action.this amended complaint had been accepted by a magistrate judge on march.in its motion for summary judgment,medtronic argued that colorado visionary promissory estoppel claim should be dismissed because colorado visionary did not rely on medtronic representations and because the proposed transactions between colorado visionary and medtronic were illegal and impossible to perform.see order and memorandum of decision at.medtronic contended that colorado visionary negligent misrepresentation claim should be dismissed because it was premised on a promise to act in the future there was no third party action to support the claim negligent misrepresentation can not properly be stated as a claim between parties to a contract and the economic loss rule barred colorado visionary negligent representation claim.
medtronic motion for summary judgment was granted in part and denied in part.summary judgment was granted with respect to colorado visionary negligent misrepresentation claim and denied with respect to colorado visionary promissory estoppel claim.order and memorandum of decision at.
the negligent misrepresentation claim 
we will first determine whether the district court was correct in deciding that under colorado law,colorado visionary negligent misrepresentation claim against medtronic could not be maintained under the circumstances of this case.this is an issue of law that we review de novo.see lampkin little,cir.
colorado has adopted the restatement second of torts definition of a claim for negligent misrepresentation.that section provides 
information negligently supplied for the guidance of others.
one who,in the course of his business,profession or employment,or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest,supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information,if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.
restatement second of torts.
the district judge characterized the heart of medtronic argument for summary judgment on the negligent misrepresentation claim as based on the contention that the economic loss rule prevents recovery because colorado visionary has not shown an independent duty of care between two parties negotiating a contract at arm length.order and memorandum of decision,at.we note this succinct definition of the economic loss rule as a general rule,no cause of action lies in tort when purely economic damage is caused by negligent breach of a contractual duty.jardel enterprises,triconsultants,quoted in town of alma azco construction,the parties devote considerable attention in their appellate briefs to discussion of the economic loss rule,disputing whether or not the district court applied the rule in its decision on colorado visionary negligent misrepresentation claim.
the district judge clearly recognized that under colorado law,the economic loss rule has no application to a valid claim for negligent misrepresentation,stating where a duty independent of contractual obligation exists however,the economic loss rule is inapplicable because the claim is not within the scope of the rule.order and memorandum of decision at.the issue is whether or not colorado visionary negligent misrepresentation claim is viable,and that in turn depends on whether medtronic was under a duty to avoid negligently misrepresenting facts on which colorado visionary might reasonably be expected to rely.
the district judge held that the negligent misrepresentation theory does not apply to negotiations for a contract,absent some special circumstances.after reviewing the colorado decisions,the judge concluded colorado caselaw indicates that section has not been used to establish an independent duty of care between contracting parties without affirmative action or expertise on the part of the party supplying information.memorandum and order of decision at.the judge later observed that t o the extent that colorado law has arguably not restricted liability for negligent misrepresentation to professional suppliers of information,a situation beyond adversarial bargaining the party making the representation had a special expertise about the information conveyed.id.at citing first nat.bank collins.most importantly,the judge said,in all cases where liability was found,the supplier of information was allegedly acting to further the recipient economic interests,not the economic interests of the supplier.order and memorandum of decision at.this type of situation differs,the judge said,from an adversarial bargaining situation in which each party acts to further its own economic interest.id.
because we find no controlling colorado authority on the issue as framed by the district court,our task is to predict how the colorado supreme court would rule if that court were faced with this issue.see fdic schuchmann,cir.in doing so,we do not limit ourselves to the technical holdings of the cases.instead,b oth the holdings and considered dicta of the state courts should be applied.hardy salt southern pac.trans,cir citing hawks hamill.see also curtis publishing cassel,cir.no deference is given to the federal district court views of state law,which we review de novo.wood eli lilly,cir citing salve regina college russell,d.
we conclude that the weight of the precedents favors the position advanced by colorado visionary as to the scope of negligent representation liability.at the outset we note tension between the restatement definition of the tort,which has been adopted in colorado,and the rule which the district court distilled from the colorado cases.section on its face applies when a person supplies false information in a transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest this contradicts the district court conclusion that the tort applies only when the supplier of information was allegedly acting to further the recipient economic interests,not the economic interests of the supplier.order and memorandum of decision at.
in keller smith harvestore products,the state highest court answered two questions certified by the tenth circuit,the first of which was whether a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation would lie against the manufacturer of a product for representations made during the course of the sale despite the execution of a fully integrated sales agreement.in answering yes,the colorado court spoke in broad terms it is thus clear that a contracting party negligent misrepresentation of material facts prior to the execution of an agreement may provide the basis for an independent tort claim at emphasis added.this broad language does not suggest that the tort is inapplicable to the ordinary adversarial bargaining circumstances prevalent in most cases.nor do the circumstances of keller necessarily support the district court holding.the plaintiffs in keller were a ranching couple who purchased two silos from the defendant manufacturer.this on its face suggests an ordinary,adversarial bargaining situation.certain provisions of the written contract are of particular interest for our present analysis.as noted,the district judge was of the opinion that in all cases where liability was found,the supplier of information was allegedly acting to further the recipient economic interests,not the economic interests of the supplier.but in keller the supplier of both the silo systems and the information at issue used an order form which required the buyers to expressly disclaim that they were relying on the seller to supply information to further their the buyers interests.thus,the order form stated that the buyers were not relying on the skill or judgment of the manufacturer or seller at.
moreover,it is instructive to examine the cases cited by the colorado supreme court in keller.the state court in that case began its analysis by citing the definition of the tort of negligent misrepresentation from the restatement as quoted supra and noting a number of cases from other jurisdictions recognizing the tort.at.the first case cited is rosales v.at t information systems.in that case,one of the plaintiffs had been an employee of one of the defendants and had also been negotiating to acquire a dealership from his employer.as the negotiations proceeded,plaintiff had been advised by authorized agents of the employer that he should resign because his employment was seen as a conflict with his application for a dealership.the plaintiff followed this advice but then his application was turned down.
in his action against his former employer,the plaintiff had pleaded a claim for negligent misrepresentation along with several other theories of relief.the defendant employer moved to dismiss that count of the complaint under.b,contending that the tort of negligent misrepresentation could not be pursued under the circumstances of that case.defendant in that case argued,more specifically,that the tort of negligent misrepresentation is limited to persons and entities engaged in the business of supplying information which their customers might rely upon in taking some additional action.at.the federal district judge in that case rejected the argument,noting that the contention was in conflict with the holding of first national bank collins,more importantly for our purposes,the supplier of information in that case was the agent of the defendant,but there is no indication that the court perceived that the tort of negligent misrepresentation required that the supplier of information purported to act in the interests of the recipient of the information,as the district judge in the instant case held.again,this case was cited with approval by the colorado supreme court and so is some indication of the state law on the issue.
in keller,the colorado supreme court also cited with apparent approval wagner cutler,and first interstate bank foutz.the dispute in wagner centered on the sale of a house,and the plaintiff alleged that the seller failed to use reasonable care in describing the condition of the house.there is no indication in the case that the negotiations were anything but the typical,arm length process.in foutz,the plaintiff was the guarantor on a loan made by the defendant bank who sued the bank alleging that the bank had misrepresented the assets of the maker of the note.again,we see no indication that this case involved the type of special relationship or special undertaking that the district judge in the instant case held was necessary to support a claim for negligent misrepresentation.
although other cases cited in keller do involve defendants who provided information as part of their profession the examples just discussed indicate rather strongly that the colorado supreme court did not consider this to be an element of the negligent misrepresentation claim.moreover,another case cited in keller reinforces this inference.following its initial discussion of negligent misrepresentation,the portion of the opinion in which the above discussed cases were cited,the colorado court addressed the defendant contention that the claim in that case was in any event precluded by an integration clause in the contract.the details of this argument are not relevant here.
what is relevant,though,is that in its analysis rejecting the argument the colorado court cited specifically a footnote in a maryland case that quite explicitly rejects the contention that the tort of negligent misrepresentation is inapplicable in a case involving adversarial,arm length negotiations.in that footnote,the maryland court noted that the defendants there had argued that the tort of negligent misrepresentation could never be applied to statements made in connection with consummation of an arm length transaction and rejected the argument categorically.martens chevrolet,seney.the footnote goes on to address the argument that the integration clause of the contract at issue there shielded the defendants from liability and also rejected that argument.
in this context,an argument could be made that the colorado court was citin
