the issue in this case is the district court grant of summary judgment against the city of los angeles on the grounds that the city ordinance for the dispersal of adult entertainment businesses violates the first amendment.we reverse.the district court erred by granting summary judgment on the issue whether the plaintiffs had presented actual and convincing evidence casting doubt on the city rationale for its ordinance.
facts and procedural history 
the facts of this resilient case are not in dispute.toward the end of the the city of los angeles city,became concerned with a perceived proliferation of businesses.acting on that concern,the city directed the los angeles police department to study the effects of concentrations of adult businesses on crime in the surrounding areas.
the police department report compared arrests between and in hollywood,an area where adult entertainment businesses are concentrated,with those in the rest of los angeles in the same period.the determined that crime rates grew at higher rates in hollywood.for instance,every part i crime including homicide,rape,aggravated assault and robbery committed against a person,not against property,increased at a higher rate in the hollywood area than in the total.in addition,p rostitution arrests increased at a rate times greater than the city average,and pandering arrests in the hollywood area increased by percent.from the data,the city concluded that concentrations of adult businesses are associated with increased rates of prostitution,robbery,assault and theft in the surrounding area.
in,the city enacted an ordinance,ordinance,adding a new section to the los angeles municipal code.section defined numerous categories of adult entertainment businesses,and required that they be geographically dispersed.specifically,no two adult entertainment businesses could be located within feet of one another.c.
of importance for this case,the ordinance defined adult arcade as an establishment where,for any form of consideration,one or more motion picture projectors or similar machines,for viewing by five or fewer persons each,are used to show films.b.an adult bookstore was defined as an establishment which has as a substantial portion of its and offers for sale any one or more of the following a print media or b adult i nstruments,devices or paraphernalia.id.b.pursuant to the ordinance,then,it was unlawful to operate an adult arcade within feet of an adult bookstore.
a problem arose for the city when it realized that the ordinance did not explicitly prohibit the operation of an adult arcade and an adult bookstore within the same establishment.therefore,in the city enacted ordinance,amending the language of the existing ordinance to remedy this oversight.specifically,c was amended to provide that no two adult entertainment businesses could operate at the same location.in addition,the amendments added b,which clarifies that each adult entertainment business as defined in the ordinance constitute s a separate adult entertainment business even if operated in conjunction with another adult entertainment business at the same establishment.thus,beginning in,the unambiguously prohibited the operation of an adult arcade within an adult bookstore.
plaintiffs alameda books and highland books opened for business in and,respectively both businesses sell adult print media and videotapes,and both feature adult arcades where customers can view videotapes for a fee.therefore,both alameda books and highland books were and are adult bookstores containing an adult arcade,as defined by the from the day they began operating as combined adult retail and arcade establishments,then,both businesses operated in violation of.this fact is uncontested.
although their businesses were unlawful,the plaintiffs operated without government interference for several years on march of,a city inspector informed both parties that they were violating the ordinance.on november,the plaintiffs filed suit in the district court for the central district of california,pursuant to.they sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that enforcing the ordinance against the plaintiffs would violate their first amendment rights.
subsequently,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.the court reasoned that,when the city amended the ordinance in,it had no basis for believing that the operation of combined as opposed to neighboring adult businesses led to harmful secondary effects.alameda books los angeles,no.cv ctx,slip op.at.may.the court further asserted that t he classification of certain adult entertainment activities as separate businesses is subject to a heightened standard of review because the city applies these definitions only to businesses that engage in protected speech.id.at.the district court determined that the ordinance failed to survive strict scrutiny,because the city had not demonstrated that the ordinance was necessary to support a compelling government interest.id.at.therefore,it was unconstitutional under the first and fourteenth amendments.id.at.
the city appealed from the grant of summary judgment,and we affirmed the district court on alternative grounds.alameda books,city of los angeles,cir.in particular,we held that the question whether c is or need not be reached,because the ordinance fails to meet even the more permissive intermediate scrutiny that would apply to a regulation.id.at.although the city had a substantial interest in reducing crime,the city had failed to show that the ordinance was designed to serve this interest.id.at.this was true because the study focused only on the effect of establishments concentrated within a particular area,and had nothing to say about the effects of businesses within the same establishment.id.at.
the supreme court reversed this decision and remanded the case in a plurality decision.city of los angeles alameda books.in doing so,the court established a new framework for reviewing ordinances aimed at reducing the secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses.
justice plurality opinion reaffirmed the framework established in city of renton playtime theatres,for determining the legality under the first amendment of restrictions on adult entertainment businesses.alameda books,at.the court then prescribed a test for determining whether a regulation meets the third of the renton test,which requires the restriction to serve a substantial government interest.the framework provides that after a municipality satisfies its burden of supplying evidence supporting its rationale for passing an ordinance,the plaintiffs may attempt to cast doubt on the municipality evidence and rationale,after which the municipality may attempt to rehabilitate its rationale.alameda books,at.
the plurality of the court further explained that contrary to our decision,it was reasonable for the city to infer from the study that a concentration of adult operations in a single establishment will lead to increased undesirable effects.id.at.the plurality concluded it was error to require the city to present evidence not only showing that the ordinance will reduce undesirable effects,but also demonstrating that such evidence does not support some other method of reducing undesirable effects.id.at.therefore,the study provided an adequate rationale for the ordinance,which satisfied the first step of the new alameda books framework.id.at.
justice kennedy wrote separately in concurrence with justice plurality opinion.because he expressed a conditional agreement with the plurality,his narrower reasoning is the only reasoning that commands the majority of the court,and has been treated as binding.see ctr.for fair pub.policy maricopa cnty,cir justice kennedy concurrence may be regarded as the controlling opinion.citing marks united states.
most important for our purposes,justice kennedy concurrence provided that a city must advance some basis to show that its regulation has the purpose and effect of suppressing secondary effects,while leaving the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact.at.put another way,a city may not assert that it will reduce secondary effects by reducing speech in the same proportion.id.justice kennedy reasoned that i t is no trick to reduce secondary effects by reducing speech or its audience.id.at.applying that principle to the present facts,the concurrence explained that,the premise underlying the ordinance must be that those that have always been under one for the most part disperse rather than shut down.id.at.taken as a whole,then,the supreme court alameda books opinion requires courts to employ the new framework when applying the traditional renton analysis,and provides that a municipality justification must not be that its regulation will reduce secondary effects simply by reducing speech proportionately.however,the application of such a principle is not as simple as might appear.
the supreme court remanded the case,and we,in turn,remanded it to the district court.cir.shortly thereafter,the parties agreed to postpone briefing and discovery until certain other ninth circuit cases interpreting the supreme court alameda books decision were decided.see alameda books,no.cv ddp ctx,dist.lexis,at.july.this agreement is responsible for the lengthy interval between the supreme court remand and the district court.
in,the district court entertained the parties crossmotions for summary judgment.the court decision thoroughly and meticulously discusses the history of the case and other relevant case law before reaching the merits.in considering the parties summary judgment motions,the district court made several threshold decisions of importance to this appeal.first,the court struck the second of declarations by the city expert witness vanita spaulding,a business valuation professional,who offered a declaration to the effect that it would be possible to split a previously joined adult arcade business and adult bookstore business while preserving the economic viability of the arcade.she arrived at this conclusion by analyzing the plaintiffs financial statements.she analyzed the profitability of their retail businesses and their arcade businesses by analyzing the existing data for each of the two kinds of businesses,as currently operated.she made no attempt to determine the extent,if any,to which the physical association of the two kinds of business contributed to the profitability of either one.
the plaintiffs argued that spaulding declaration should be stricken because it would confuse the issues and cause undue delay under,would not assist the trier of fact under.and because it lacked foundation under.
the district court found that spaulding testimony was confined only to the profitability of adult arcades which were part of adult retail establishments.but the fact that an adult arcade is profitable when physically joined to another adult business,did not,in the district court view,fairly lead to the conclusion that an adult arcade could operate profitably as a unit.the court noted that the question in this case is not whether the arcade portion of the combination business is profitable but whether the arcade as a standalone business will continue to exist once unmoored from the bookstore component.alameda books,dist.lexis,at.the court further stated that spaulding had no basis for concluding that patrons would visit a arcade business because she did not purport to have any specific knowledge of the industry and had not interviewed business owners or customers.id.at.
nevertheless,the district court did not find spaulding statistics to be incredible.rather,the court described her review of the costs and expenses of the retail and arcade components of the combined stores,as an analysis with which no one disagrees.id.at.therefore,despite striking spaulding declaration,the court accepted that the arcade components of the plaintiffs businesses as presently operated are quite profitable,accounting for approximately of the revenues of the combined businesses and the majority of the stores net income.thus,even if this evidence is not admissible for the immediate purpose intended,it may be useful in a more extended analysis.
the district court second important threshold decision was to reject the city objections to declarations by the plaintiffs two witnesses,william andrus and rick hinckley.william andrus is the of beverly books,the corporation which now owns alameda books and highland books.he testified that he has been involved in the adult entertainment retail business for twenty years.he further opined that a adult arcade would not be profitable because many current users of the arcade are retail patrons considering a purchasing decision,conveniently accommodated by a retail store in the same premises.in addition,a adult arcade would be viewed to be seedy like adult movie theaters,most of which went out of business when prerecorded adult videos became available.he testified in conclusion that,i have never seen or heard of a business that existed only as an adult arcade.
rick hinckley is the president of video simplex,a san diego company that builds and installs adult arcade systems.the company installed the adult arcade systems in both alameda books and highland books,and hinckley was personally involved in those installations.he also testified,like andrus,that the consensus of those in the adult entertainment industry was that a adult arcade would not attract a significant number of customers because many current users are retail patrons considering whether to purchase merchandise available in a retail store located in the same premises as an arcade.he repeated the observation that a adult arcade,like an adult motion picture theater,would be viewed as seedy.
both the andrus and hinckley declarations are brief and unelaborated.neither andrus nor hinckley purported to offer any empirical support for the shared position that a standalone adult arcade would not be viable.the content of the declarations is strikingly similar,and certain important passages are identical.for example,andrus and hinckley each declared,verbatim,as follows 
a adult arcade has the same image problem as do auditorium adult motion picture theatres,which have become all but extinct because of that problem or reason,namely,that they are perceived by the public as seedy and as attracting an undesirable element of customers,an image that no longer attaches to adult retail businesses,which tend to be more aesthetically attractive.footnote that explains why adult theaters,theaters nearly vanished beginning as prerecorded home adult videotapes became more widely available.although such businesses were reasonably profitable during the,as prerecorded adult videotapes became more widely available during the,nearly all of them went out of business,the few remaining being those that were annexed to adult book and video stores,as presently are all adult arcades.
the text of the footnote referenced midway through this passage and dealing with the increasingly nature of adult entertainment retail is also identical in both declarations.
the city objected to the andrus and hinckley declarations,not alleging explicitly that the declarants were potentially biased,but instead that their testimony was speculative and lacking in foundation.but the district court rejected the city arguments,observing that andrus and hinckley,with their decades of experience owning and operating the specific businesses at issue in this case and their knowledge of the industry,have sufficient foundation to testify that they are not aware of any arcade ever existing.alameda books,dist.lexis,at.because the declarants were testifying as to their understanding of the industry,and not to a scientific process of causation,their industry experience was all the foundation necessary.id.at.the district court acknowledged that both witnesses were closely associated with a party to the litigation,but did not address the obvious bias of these witnesses relating to their close association and apparent financial interest.
applying the second of the supreme court alameda books framework,the district court held that p laintiffs evidence casts the requisite doubt because the andrus and hinckley declarations suggest that the city intent in passing the ordinances was to reduce s
