i t is our law and our tradition that more speech,not less,is the governing rule under the first amendment.citizens united fec.more speech often means more money.this is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today mass society requires the expenditure of money.buckley valeo.therefore,a restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed,the depth of their exploration,and the size of the audience reached.id.that political spending is constitutionally protected speech has become a cardinal tenet of the supreme court campaign finance jurisprudence.emily list fec.
we must decide whether the long beach campaign reform act lbcra,which prohibits persons from making any independent expenditures if they receive contributions above certain amounts,is constitutional as applied to the long beach area chamber of commerce chamber and its affiliated political action committees chamber pacs.because the chamber lacks standing,and because the lbcra does not withstand scrutiny as applied to the chamber pacs,we vacate in part and reverse in part the district court judgment that the lbcra is unconstitutional as applied to the chamber but constitutional as applied to the chamber pacs.
background 
the city adopted the lbcra in.it provides that a ny person who makes independent expenditures supporting or opposing a candidate shall not accept any contribution in excess of to,depending upon the office for which the candidate is running.long beach,ordinances.person is broadly defined to include any individual,organization or political action committee whose contributions or expenditure activities are financed,maintained or controlled by any corporation,labor organization,association,political party or any other person or committee.id.d.independent expenditures are expenditure s made by any person in connection with a communication which expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate but which is not made to or at the behest of the affected candidate or committee.cal.gov t code long beach,ordinances adopting state law definition.an expenditure is not independent if it involves the control,direction,cooperation,consultation,coordination,request,or suggestion of a candidate.see cal.gov t code cal.admin.code tit,see also long beach,ordinances discussing contribution limitations.
the chamber is a mutual benefit corporation consisting of members,ninety percent of which are small businesses employing fewer than ten employees.dues for chamber members with fewer than ten employees range from to,and dues for chamber members with between ten and employees range from to.some members with greater numbers of employees pay dues in excess of.the parties stipulate that the chamber dues constitute contributions under the lbcra because some of those dues exceed the lbcra contribution limitations,the lbcra prohibits the chamber from making any independent expenditures.
the chamber bylaws,however,do not permit it to make contributions or independent expenditures.rather,the chamber participates in city politics through the chamber long beach area chamber of commerce pac,the long beach area chamber of commerce mayoral pac,and the long beach area chamber of commerce city council are separate but affiliated organizations that make independent expenditures in support of select candidates.the chamber pacs receive contributions from chamber members who choose to direct a portion of their dues to the chamber pacs.members may also contribute to the chamber pacs.
the chamber and chamber pacs plaintiffs sued to enjoin enforcement of the lbcra,arguing that its contribution and expenditure limitations violate their rights of speech and association.on april,the district court ruled that the lbcra is unconstitutional as applied to the chamber.relying on our decision in lincoln club of orange county city of irvine,cir,the district court applied strict scrutiny review because the lbcra imposed a severe burden on the chamber freedoms of speech and association.as the district court explained,following enactment of the lbcra,t he chamber is forced to alter its dues or organizational structure if it wishes to participate in elections and also wishes to continue to welcome members with more than employees.that is,absent a drastic overhaul of its membership composition or its dues schedule,the chamber would be precluded from making any independent expenditures even if its bylaws authorized it to do so.
plaintiffs and the city each provided the district court with a proposed form of judgment purportedly reciting the district court ruling.the district court rejected the chamber proposed form of judgment,which declared the lbcra unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs and other persons similarly situated emphasis added.instead,it chose the city proposed form of judgment,declaring the lbcra unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff long beach area chamber of commerce and other persons similarly situated emphasis added.neither proposed form of judgment expressly addressed the chamber pacs.
the judgment,entered on may,was timely appealed by the city.it then occurred to the parties that the district court may not have resolved the question of the lbcra constitutionality as applied to the chamber pacs.naturally,the parties disagreed on this point.the plaintiffs argued that the favorable judgment also embraced the chamber pacs,as the plaintiffs had recited in their proposed form of judgment,and the city contended otherwise.on july,upon motion by the plaintiffs,the district court clarified its april,ruling,stating that it had not resolved the constitutionality of the lbcra as applied to the chamber pacs in the earlier order.it then explicitly concluded that the long beach ordinance is constitutional as applied to the pacs.the district court applied the less demanding closely drawn level of scrutiny because it found that the chamber pacs,which lack the chamber membership or dues structures,are less burdened by the lbcra than is the chamber.therefore,the city interests in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in its political process sufficiently justified the lbcra contribution limitations and consequent prohibition on spending as applied to the chamber pacs.the chamber pacs filed their notice of appeal on july.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.humphries county of los angeles,cir.here,the parties filed for summary judgment and stipulated as to the relevant facts.we therefore review the district court legal determinations,including constitutional rulings,de novo.see bjustrom trust one mortgage,cir the parties agree that the facts are not in dispute.we review de novo pure questions of law decided on summary judgment.
discussion 
jurisdictiona.standing 
as stated in the parties stipulation,the city no longer contends that the plaintiffs lack standing or that the plaintiffs complaint does not present an actual controversy.that litigating posture,however,is insufficient to establish our jurisdiction.the role of the courts is neither to issue advisory opinions nor to declare rights in hypothetical cases,but to adjudicate live cases or controversies.maldonado morales,cir quoting thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.we therefore assess the parties standing before proceeding to the merits of their dispute.see lujan defenders of wildlife,best encina lodge suites,cir.
to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff must show that it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.sacks office of foreign assets control,cir quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc.of course,plaintiffs need not await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.blum yaretsky.instead,where a party seeks prospective relief,t he question becomes whether any perceived threat to the plaintiff is sufficiently real and immediate to show an existing controversy.see also lujan,at examining imminence of asserted injury city of los angeles lyons,examining likelihood that plaintiff would suffer future injury.
we conclude that the chamber pacs have article iii standing,while the chamber itself does not.the chamber has failed to demonstrate that it has suffered or faces a real and immediate threat of suffering an injury that is fairly traceable to the lbcra.the chamber own bylaws do not authorize it to make contributions or independent expenditures,and the factual record is devoid of any indication that the chamber either plans to modify those bylaws or even that it desires to do so.the chamber suggests that it may wish to make contributions or independent expenditures in the future,but this equivocal assertion is hardly sufficient to create a case or controversy.as the supreme court has explained,such some day any description of concrete plans,or indeed even any specification of when the some day will not support a finding of the actual or imminent injury that our cases require.lujan,at emphasis omitted.therefore,the district court did not have jurisdiction over the chamber action 
unlike the chamber,the chamber pacs do make independent expenditures.indeed,they were formed for the very purpose of engaging in political activities that support the chamber objectives.while the factual record does not detail the precise nature of the contributions that the chamber pacs receive,it is probable that they are,or will be,offered contributions in excess of the lbcra limitations,given the chamber dues structure and contribution scheme and the wide range of entities from which the chamber pacs receive contributions.because the lbcra poses a real and immediate threat to the chamber pacs ability to accept certain contributions or to make any independent expenditures,they have standing to sue.see lyons,at.
timeliness 
the city asserts that we lack jurisdiction over the chamber pacs appeal because their notice of appeal is untimely.a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days of entry of the order or judgment from which the appeal is taken.fed.a.with a few exceptions not applicable here,an appeal may be taken only from a final order or judgment.see,koller,t he final judgment rule promotes efficient judicial administration while at the same time emphasizing the deference appellate courts owe to the district judge decisions on the many questions of law and fact that arise before judgment.a judgment is final if it fully adjudicates the issues and clearly evinces the district court intention that it be that court final act in the matter.disabled rights action comm.las vegas events,cir.
the city contends that the chamber pacs are appealing the may,judgment of the district court,and that their july,notice of appeal is more than fifty days late.however,the may,judgment does not indicate that the district court ruled on,let alone denied,summary judgment to the three chamber pacs that judgment addressed the chamber only.therefore,as of may,there was no adverse final judgment from which the chamber pacs could appeal.it was not until the court filed its july,order that it expressly and finally adjudicated all of the issues related to summary judgment as to the chamber pacs,effectively denying the chamber pacs constitutional challenge.the chamber pacs timely filed their notice of appeal from that order eleven days later.
the city alternatively argues for the first time during oral argument that its own notice of appeal from the april,order divested the district court of jurisdiction to enter a subsequent order resolving the chamber pacs motion.see.a requiring district court to obtain leave of appellate court to issue clarification once a notice of appeal has been filed.however,where an appeal is taken from a judgment which does not finally determine the entire action,the appeal does not prevent the district court from proceeding with matters not involved in the appeal.britton banking group,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also griggs provident consumer discount,notice of appeal divests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.the district court entered judgment granting the motion as to the chamber on may,and the city notice of appeal was timely filed,thus vesting our court with jurisdiction over that matter.because the district court may,judgment did not deny the motion as to the chamber pacs,however,the district court retained jurisdiction over that motion and was free to clarify it or rule on it if the court had not previously done so.moreover,if we were to accept the city argument that the may,grant of summary judgment embraced the chamber pacs claim,there was no adverse judgment from which the chamber pacs could appeal.therefore,the district court acted wholly within its jurisdictional bounds when it issued the july,order.the chamber pacs notice of appeal was timely filed,and we have jurisdiction to review it.although it follows from this conclusion that the city appeal was filed prematurely,we also have jurisdiction over that appeal because orders adjudicating only some of the claims may be treated as final orders if the remaining claims have subsequently been finalized.anderson allstate ins,cir.
ii.first amendment analysis 
in buckley and subsequent cases,the supreme court has subjected restrictions on campaign expenditures to closer scrutiny than limits on campaign contributions.mcconnell fec,see also lincoln club,at discussing different levels of scrutiny.c ontribution limitations are permissible as long as the government demonstrates that the limits are closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest.randall sorrell,see also davis fec,s uch limits can not stand unless they are closely drawn to serve a sufficiently important interest.by contrast,expenditure limitations are subject to strict scrutiny,which requires narrow tailoring to meet a compelling governmental interest.see citizens united.at fec.right to life.thus,the supreme court has generally approved statutory limits on contributions to candidates and political parties,but it has rejected expenditure limits on individuals,groups,candidates,and parties.emily list,at emphasis omitted.
contribution limitations are treated differently from expenditure limitations because they generally entail only a marginal restriction upon the contributor ability to engage in free communication.buckley,at.they permit the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but do not in any way infringe the contributor freedom to discuss candidates and issues.id.at.by contrast,expenditure ceilings impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association.id.at.as the buckley court explained,being free to engage in unlimited political expression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like being free to drive an auto mobile as far and as often as one desires on a single tank of gasoline.id.at.expenditure limitations may restrict the breadth and depth of political dialogue,and they preclude most associations from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents,the original basis for the recognition of first amendment protection of the freedom of association.id.at see also nixon shrink.gov t pac,discussing application of distinction to associational rights.
since buckley was decided,governments at all levels have enacted campaign finance regulations.see,et federal election campaign act cal.gov t code et california political reform act see also citizens united.at detailing extensive regulations of pacs.but p olitical speech is so ingrained in our culture that speakers find ways to circumvent these campaign finance laws.citizens united.at.as political strategists have devised novel ways to fund electoral politics,legislative bodies have reacted in kind to the hard lesson of circumvention by enacting complicated campaign finance regulations that defy easy classification under buckley doctrinal framework.mcconnell,at.the lbcra is one such regulation.it limits the amount of contributions an entity may receive while simultaneously prohibiting independent expenditures by any entity that receives contributions exceeding those limitations.as the district court observed,this form of regulation is not subject to easy classification as a contribution limitation or an expenditure limitation.
this appeal does not turn on the lbcra technical classification as an expenditure limitation or a contribution limitation,however,because the lbcra does not withstand scrutiny under the constitutional standards applicable to either type of campaign finance regulation.though the city identifies several governmental interests that purportedly are served by the lbcra,it has not shown that any is sufficiently important to support the lbcra application to the chamber pacs in this case.
one of the lbcra stated purposes is to provide the city residents and interest groups with a fair and equal opportunity to participate in municipal elective and governmental processes.long beach,ordinances a see also id.h to reduce the excessive advantage of incumbents and thus encourage competition for elective office.however,the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.buckley,at.therefore,the court has ruled that the government can not limit campaign contributions and expenditures to achieve equalization.emily list,at.in davis,the court warned that restricting speech to level electoral opportunities has ominous implications because it would permit congress to arrogate the voters authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office.davis.at.the davis court concluded that prior decisions provide no support for the proposition that this is a legitimate government objective.id.the supreme court recently reaffirmed these views,stating that it is unlawful for the government to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear.citizens united.at.
in its briefs and at oral argument,the city argued that these principles could be set aside under austin.state chamber of commerce,in which the court upheld restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations,noting that the government had a compelling interest in combating the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form.id.at.however,the supreme court has overruled austin and explicitly rejected the rationale upon which it rested political speech is indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy,and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual this protection for speech is inconsistent with austin rationale.citizens united.at internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at noting that austin was not well reasoned,is undermined by experience,and does not implicate any serious reliance interests.therefore,we find unavailing the city rationale for the lbcra application to the chamber pacs.
time protection rationale 
the city also states that the lbcra is intended to limit overall expenditures in campaigns,thereby reducing the pressure on candidates to raise large campaign war chests for defensive purposes.long beach,ordinances d see also id.i to allow candidates and officeholders to spend a lesser proportion of their time on fund raising and a greater proportion of their time dealing with issues of importance to their constituents.however,in buckley,the supreme court explained that t he first amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one political views is wasteful,excessive,or unwise.buckley,at.more recently,the supreme court explicitly rejected what it described as the time protection rationale for campaign finance regulations,finding unpersuasive the argument that government may restrict campaign finance activity to protect candidates from spending too much time raising money rather than devoting that time to campaigning among ordinary voters.randall,at.therefore,the city interest in reducing political fundraising efforts can not support the lbcra application to the chamber pacs.
finally,the city advances an rationale to support the lbcra application to the chamber pacs.one of the lbcra stated purposes is t o reduce the influence of large contributors with a specific financial stake in matters before the city council,thus countering the perception that decisions are influenced more by the size of contributions than the best interests of the people of the city.long beach,ordinances b see also id.k to help restore public trust in local governmental and electoral institutions.in its brief,the city asserts that the lbcra prevent s corruption or the appearance of corruption and that the large amount of money spent on city elections has caused a public perception that votes are being improperly influenced by monetary contributions.the supreme court has concluded that preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances.fec conservative political action,ncpac see also davis.at randall,at.this interest was sometimes broadly construed in the expenditures context before the supreme court recent decision in citizens united,in which it stated when buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption,that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption.citizens united.at the fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt,and t he appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.id.at.
supreme court precedent forecloses the city argument that independent expenditures by independent expenditure committees iecs,like the chamber pacs,raise the specter of corruption or the appearance thereof.moreover,the city broadly based rationale for restricting contributions to iecs is lacking in legal and factual support because the city has not offered sufficient evidence of corruption to support its asserted governmental interest in restricting contributions to iecs.
expenditure limitations 
by definition,an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.citizens united.at.an expenditure that is made with the control,direction,cooperation,consultation,coordination,request,or suggestion of a candidate is a contribution,not an independent expenditure.cal.gov t code cal.admin.code tit.for instance,the chamber pacs could be subject to criminal liability if they made payments in coordination with candidates or their campaigns but failed to disclose the payments as contributions.see cal.gov t code.it is t he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent that alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.citizens united.at quoting buckley,at see also fec.republican fed.campaign,colorado ii distinguishing between independent and coordinated expenditures.in short,independent expenditures do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.citizens united.at see also ncpac,at there is no tendency in such expenditures,uncoordinated with the candidate or his campaign,to corrupt or to give the appearance of corruption.
it necessarily follows that the city may not impose financial limits on the chamber pacs independent expenditures.this conclusion is compelled by the long and growing line of supreme court cases concluding that limitations on independent expenditures are unconstitutional.see buckley,at we find that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequ
