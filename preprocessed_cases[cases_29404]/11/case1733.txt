ii.the application of section 
plaintiffs central contention is that the puc proceedings related to the san bruno explosion do not encompass any consideration of whether pg e should recompense its customers for its past misappropriation of monies received in natural gas rates.according to plaintiffs,the limited scope of those proceedings is and includes no consideration of whether ratepayers should be afforded a remedy for pg e past misappropriation.therefore,they maintain,the judgment should be reversed because the trial court was wrong to apply section,subdivision a.
section,subdivision a provides that no court of this state,except the supreme court and the court of appeal,to the extent specified in this article,shall have jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof,or to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties,as provided by law and the rules of court.moreover,direct challenges to any decision or order of the puc may only be brought on grounds specified in the public utilities act.see 
notwithstanding these limitations,trial courts have authority under section to entertain a private action for damages arising out of any unlawful act by a regulated utility,including the violation of any puc order or decision.our high court has addressed the apparent tension between these two sections of the public utilities act in several decisions.waters pacific telephone company cal d san diego gas electric superior court cal th covalt hartwell superior court cal th.
the covalt decision has emerged as the leading case guiding the determination whether a private action runs afoul of section.in covalt,the court declared the primacy of section,and made clear that a private right of action under section is limited to those situations where an award would not hinder or frustrate the commission declared supervisory and regulatory policies.covalt,supra,cal th at pp.under covalt,the court considers whether the commission has the authority to adopt a regulatory policy whether the commission has exercised that authority and whether the superior court action would hinder or interfere with the commission exercise of regulatory authority.id.at,sarale pacific gas electric th.under covalt,therefore,the determination here turns on whether the puc had policymaking authority to set and review pg e natural gas rates chargeable to consumers,whether it exercised its authority over rates,and whether the plaintiffs action would interfere with the puc exercise of its authority.
