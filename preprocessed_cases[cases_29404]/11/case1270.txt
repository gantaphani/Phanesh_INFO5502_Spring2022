this case concerns whether payments for product design services made by ahaza systems,to stratos product development llc shortly before ahaza filed for bankruptcy were preferential payments that must be returned to the bankruptcy estate.plaintiff edmund wood,trustee of ahaza estate for the bankruptcy proceedings,seeks to recover two payments made to stratos,maintaining that they were preferential and therefore voidable under the bankruptcy code.see c.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for defendant stratos.determining that the payments fell within the ordinary course of business exception to the prohibition on preferential transfers,the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit bap affirmed,holding that repayment of a debt can be within the ordinary course of business exception to the prohibition on preferential transfers even if both the underlying debt and any restructuring agreement are the first such transactions between the parties.
we agree with the bap basic holding.although we normally decide whether a debt is ordinary by comparing it to the parties past practice with each other,we conclude that when the transaction at issue is the parties first,ordinary can be determined in reference to the parties practice with others.because the standard we announce today was not available to the parties at the time of the bankruptcy court proceedings,and because summary judgment is not otherwise justified,we remand for further development of the summary judgment record,or,in the alternative,for trial.
background 
stratos agreed to help develop products for ahaza as part of a relationship that eventually soured.alleging that ahaza owed it money for work performed,stratos threatened to sue ahaza for breach of contract and other causes of action.instead of heading to court,stratos and ahaza in entered into a settlement agreement and release agreement.the agreement provided that ahaza would pay to stratos immediately,and per month for the following year.payments were due on the fifteenth day of each month.if ahaza failed to pay within ten days of receiving notice of payment due,the entire remaining balance would immediately become due.the agreement also provided that if ahaza became subject to bankruptcy proceedings,the entire remaining balance would immediately become due,without notice or opportunity to cure.
both any underlying contract for services and the agreement were the first such transactions between ahaza and stratos,as far as the record shows.there is no evidence in the record of ahaza and stratos interactions prior to the agreement it is undisputed,however,that pursuant to the agreement,ahaza made the following payments by check to stratos 
after ahaza filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition on april,wood,the trustee of ahaza estate,filed a complaint on january,to recover under b the last two payments that ahaza had made to stratos.section b allows trustees of bankrupt estates to avoid certain transfers made to creditors within ninety days of the filing of a bankruptcy petition.stratos filed for summary judgment on may,and wood for summary judgment shortly thereafter.
in support of its motion,stratos submitted two declarations describing its business practices generally.one,from michael curneen,a principal owner and chief operating officer of stratos,states that a large percentage of the company business is with companies whose cash positions are typically restricted,and that stratos has often entered into agreements with that require payment on predetermined calendar dates or at specific milestones.curneen declared that such agreements often must be revised and that stratos revised of the client agreements it entered into during and in various ways,including restructuring the debt,assuming an ownership interest in the client company,or instigating or threatening litigation.
although the term is not defined in curneen declaration,the other declaration filed by stratos on summary judgment,from myles mutnick,an officer of a national trade association of companies,explains that companies are companies dependent on venture capital to sustain ongoing operations.he further reports that such companies often face two uncertainties the ability to raise venture capital and the time over which any such raised capital will be burned.
the mutnick declaration goes on to state that because i n the ordinary course of many of the relationships,of the will be tight for a variety of well recognized reasons,vendors typically resort to a variety of financial relationship strategies,including debt restructuring.the reason such debt restructuring or forgiveness is done in the ordinary course of relationships is in recognition that forceful collection action can jeopardize any potential for a future relationship and,depending on timing,sufficiently diminish cash reserves so as to imperil the viability of the.
based on these declarations and the evidence of ahaza payments under the agreement,the bankruptcy court granted stratos motion for summary judgment and denied wood.on appeal,the bap affirmed the summary judgment.this timely appeal followed.

discussion 
stratos,the creditor,does not dispute that the last two payments satisfied the definition of preferential transfers under b,as in effect at the time stratos filed for bankruptcy it maintains however,that the transfers should not be voided because they fell under the ordinary course of business exception to the preferential transfers prohibition.
at the time of the litigation in the bankruptcy court,the ordinary course of business exception,c,provided that the trustee may not avoid a transfer under b 
to the extent that such transfer was 
a in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee 
b made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee and 
c made according to ordinary business terms 
the parties agree that the challenged payments fulfill the third requirement,c c,which requires that payments be made according to ordinary business terms to qualify for the exemption.see generally in re kaypro,at concluding that payments made pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement are not per se outside the ordinary business terms of an industry.they dispute,however,whether the transfers were in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee,c a,or made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee,id.at c b.
although the statutory language does not specifically so provide,we have held previously in cases in which parties have an established course of dealing that c a and c b require that the debt and its payment are ordinary in relation to past practices between the debtor and this particular creditor.mordy chemcarb,in re food catering,cir see also sulmeyer suzuki in re grand chevrolet,cir quoting in re food catering,inc in other words,to determine what is ordinary among parties who have interacted repeatedly,we inquire into the pattern of interactions between the actual creditor and the actual debtor in question,not about what transactions would have been ordinary for either party with other debtors or creditors 
as a consequence,with regard to c b,we evaluate the challenged transfers in light of ahaza prior transfers to stratos.our task is more difficult with regard to c a,however,for two reasons as far as appears in the present record,the debt for services in question is the result of the first transaction between stratos and ahaza,and the agreement between stratos and ahaza revised the terms of repayment of the debt.we address today,as a matter of first impression in this circuit,what ordinary in c a means if the debt in question is a transaction between the parties,and what debt means when the original agreement between two parties is revised.
section c a ordinary course of business for a debt 
although we have never addressed how c a applies when the debt in question is a transaction between the parties the two circuits that have considered the issue,the sixth and seventh circuits,have held that issuance of debt can be in the ordinary course of financial affairs even if it is the first such transaction undertaken by the parties.gosch burns in re finn,cir see also kleven household bank,cir o ther courts have addressed the issue with mixed results,although most side with the view that a transaction is not per se ineligible for protection from avoidance under c.citing in re finn and several bankruptcy and district courts.
we agree that transactions may satisfy the requirements of c a.obviously every borrower who does something in the ordinary course of her affairs must,at some point,have done it for the first time.in re finn,at.with the ordinary course of business exception,congress aimed not to protect financial relations,but rather to leave undisturbed normal financial relations,because the exception does not detract from the general policy of the preference section to discourage unusual action by either the debtor or his creditors during the debtor slide into bankruptcy.union bank wolas,d quoting,at emphasis added.together with the rule against preferential transfers,the ordinary course of business exception deter s the race to the courthouse and enabl es the struggling debtor to continue operating its business.id.at.this animating policy concern is not erased simply because a debt is the parties first transaction.thus,as the bap observed,i t would be inconsistent with the purpose of the section for stratos to be prevented from receiving the benefit of the ordinary course of business exception for otherwise routine transactions simply because stratos never previously entered into a transaction with ahaza.
having held debts eligible for the exception,we now must determine the criteria for deciding when a debt is incurred in the ordinary course of business,albeit for the first time between the parties.other courts decisions point to several options.through citation to huffman new jersey steel in re valley steel,which relied upon finn,the bap in this case adopted the sixth circuit position when applied to new transactions,c a requires an inquiry into whether the transaction would be out of the ordinary for a person in the borrower position.in re finn,at.discussing a debt and its related transfers,the seventh circuit concluded that i n some instances the ordinary course of business may be established by the terms of the parties agreement regarding issuance of debt,until that agreement is somehow or other modified by actual performance.kleven,at regarding tax refund anticipation loans.regarding transfers under c b,one bankruptcy court listed several additional relevant factors.the court concluded,
when there are no prior transactions with which to compare,the court may analyze other indicia,including whether the transaction is out of the ordinary for a person in the debtor position,or whether the debtor complied with the terms of the contractual arrangement,generally looking to the conduct of the parties,or to the parties ordinary course of dealing in other business transactions.
meeks harrah tunica in re armstrong,citations omitted.the factors listed by the arkansas bankruptcy court are similar to those we have used to evaluate transfers under c b.see in re grand chevrolet,at.
we agree with the thrust of all three analyses that,when we have no past debt between the parties with which to compare the challenged one,the instant debt should be compared to the debt agreements into which we would expect the debtor and creditor to enter as part of their ordinary business operations.consistent with food catering,however,this analysis should be as specific to the actual parties as possible.thus,we hold that to fulfill c a,a debt must be ordinary in relation to this debtor and this creditor past practices when dealing with other,similarly situated parties.only if a party has never engaged in similar transactions would we consider more generally whether the debt is similar to what we would expect of similarly situated parties,where the debtor is not sliding into bankruptcy.see union bank,at.distinguishing the normal financial relations protected by c from unusual action by either the debtor or his creditors during the debtor slide into bankruptcy.in this latter instance,the fact that a debt is the first of its kind for a party will be relevant but not dispositive.
wood maintains that referencing similar,in their absence,expected practice of similarly situated c a into c c,under which we always assess ordinary by reference to prevailing business standards,in re food catering,at,in the relevant industry,see in re kaypro,at.we disagree.although the inquiries may overlap in the case of transactions,they remain distinct.as we apply it today,c a still reflects the actual parties practices insofar as that is possible and focuses on the issuance of debt itself,while c c focuses on the terms of the challenged transfers and reflects the broad range of terms that encompasses the practices employed by similarly situated debtors and creditors,including terms that are ordinary for those under financial distress.ganis credit anderson in re jan weilert rv,cir,amended by cir citing in re kaypro,at.
ii.section c a relevant debt when a revision of an original agreement is involved 
underlying the parties dispute in this case is a second legal question when the payment agreement between two parties has been revised or restructured,what is the debt to be considered under c a in awarding summary judgment to stratos,the bap addressed both the agreement and the original transaction between stratos and ahaza.wood represented at oral argument on appeal,however,that the only relevant debt was the agreement.we believe the bap approach makes more sense,insofar as the original transaction that gave rise to the agreement would otherwise be defined as debt.
in two separate contexts,we have found that both restructuring agreements and debts are relevant to the prohibition on preferential transfers.on the one hand,in considering whether a challenged transfer satisfied c c,we have treated a restructuring agreement as relevant to the ordinariness of the terms of the disputed transfers.in re kaypro,at.on the other hand,when we have considered whether a debt is antecedent to challenged contributing to the prima facie case for a preferential have linked transfers to the original agreement between the parties,rather than to any later transaction that changes or nullifies that agreement.futoran rush in re futoran,cir,considered a husband transfer in exchange for cancellation of a marital support agreement.we concluded that the transfer was made pursuant to the original marital support agreement by analogizing to the installment loan context,in which debt is incurred when the loan is made and not when the payments become due.id.at.in discussing whether a debt is antecedent to challenged payments,the fifth circuit has concluded even more explicitly that payments made as part of a settlement agreement were made pursuant to the arrangement,rather than pursuant to the settlement agreement itself.see baker hughes oilfield operations,cage in re ramba,cir concluding that the relevant debt for a payment made to stave off an involuntary bankruptcy petition was created by the receipt of goods,not the later settlement agreement southmark schulte roth zabel in re southmark,cir concluding that a debt for costs and attorneys fees associated with a legal dispute arose when demand was made,not when a settlement agreement was reached.
a broad understanding of debt,encompassing both the original and the revised agreement,is consistent with the bankruptcy code,which defines debt as a liability on a claim,and defines claim broadly to include right s to payment,whether or not reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,or undisputed,id.a.moreover,it would be inconsistent with the purpo
