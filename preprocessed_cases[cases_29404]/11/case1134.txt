this appeal presents the question,inter alia,as to whether the word sue,as used in the credit repair organization act croa,means arbitrate.or,perhaps the question is,as alice put it whether you can make words mean so many different things we conclude that congress meant what it said in using the term sue,and that it did not mean arbitrate.we affirm the order of the district court denying the credit providers motion to compel arbitration.

consumers brought this action in federal district court,and the credit providers moved to compel arbitration of consumers croa claims.the district court held the arbitration clause in the credit providers aspire visa credit card agreements was invalid and void under the croa prohibition of the waiver of a consumer right to sue in court,and denied the motion to compel arbitration.the district court also denied the credit providers motion for leave to file motion for reconsideration.the credit providers filed a timely interlocutory appeal challenging the denial of the motion to compel arbitration.
we review the denial of a motion to compel arbitration de novo.balen holland am.line,cir lozano v.at t wireless,cir whether a federal statute permits adjudication by binding arbitration is a question of law that we review de novo.
the district court correctly concluded that the arbitration agreement was void because the croa specifically prohibits provisions disallowing any waiver of a consumer right to sue in court for croa violations.
we employ our usual methodology in statutory construction.as always,our starting point is the plain language of the statute.children hosp.health ctr.belshe,cir.w e examine not only the specific provision at issue,but also the structure of the statute as a whole,including its object and policy.id.if the plain meaning of the statute is unambiguous,that meaning is controlling and we need not examine legislative history as an aid to interpretation unless the legislative history clearly indicates that congress meant something other than what it said.carson harbor village,unocal,cir en banc.if the statutory language is ambiguous,we consult legislative history.united states daas,cir.
in this context,we also note that congress has manifested a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.gilmer lane,internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,the federal arbitration act declares that a written provision in a contract evincing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
the supreme court has held that h aving made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.mitsubishi motors soler.i f congress intended the substantive protection afforded by a given statute to include protection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum,that intention would be deducible from text or legislative history.id.more recently,the supreme court has reiterated that the congressional intent to preclude waiver will be discoverable in the text of the statute,its legislative history,or an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes.gilmer,at.the burden is on the party opposing arbitration to show that congress intended to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.id.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the credit reporting organization act.the croa expressly identifies four rights,which appear in the disclosures section of the statute.the first two rights concern rights that consumers have in relation to credit bureaus,which are not implicated by this suit.the third and fourth rights specifically concern rights that consumers have in relation to credit repair organizations the third right directly addresses the consumers argument you have the right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the credit repair organization act.a.in addition,each credit repair organization is required to inform the consumer of his or her right to sue,provide such information to the consumer in a separate document containing a verbatim copy of an eightparagraph text specified by congress,which enumerates the right to sue,obtain from the consumer a signature confirming receipt of such information,and keep such signed confirmations on file for two years from the date of signing.a c.the disclosure document must be provided to every consumer before any contract or agreement between the consumer and the credit repair organization is executed.id.a.
the croa also contains a provision,phrased in unusually comprehensive and precise language any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of the consumer under this subchapter shall be treated as void and may not be enforced by any federal or state court or any other person.a.
thus,the plain language of the croa provides consumers with the right to sue.the right to sue means what it says.the statute does not provide a right to some form of dispute resolution,but instead specifies the right to sue.the act of suing in a court of law is distinctly different from arbitration.see eljer,kowin dev,cir arbitration is a private system of justice distinct from state and federal courts.the right to sue protected by the croa can not be satisfied by replacing it with an opportunity to submit a dispute to arbitration.
where terms are not defined within a statute,they are accorded their plain and ordinary meaning.mchugh united serv.auto.ass n,cir.the plain and ordinary meaning of terms can be deduced through reference sources,including black law dictionary and general usage dictionaries.see satterfield simon schuster,cir determining the plain meaning of a contract term by referencing black and webster dictionary.

by contrast,arbitration is a method of dispute resolution involving one or more neutral third parties who are usu ally agreed to by the disputing parties and whose decision is binding.black law dictionary.arbitration is one of several mechanisms of alternative dispute resolution,which is a procedure for settling a dispute by means other than litigation,such as arbitration or mediation.id.at emphasis added.the corpus juris secondum underscores that a rbitration is not a judicial proceeding either at common law or under statutes.it is a proceeding separate from litigation based upon its underlying purpose of encouraging dispute resolution without result to the courts,and may be characterized as an alternative to litigation.arbitration june emphasis added citations omitted see also wolsey,foodmaker,cir arbitration is a creature of contract,a device of the parties rather than the judicial process.citation omitted becker davis,cir a rbitration is a contractual right that is generally predicated on an express decision to waive the right to a trial in a judicial forum.morrison.permanente med.group,c ases and statutes discuss consistently the terms arbitration and civil action in a manner that leaves no doubt that arbitration is a creature separate from,and not just a form of,a civil action.
as a matter of parlance,reference,and common sense,we can not conclude that when congress used the word sue,it really meant arbitrate.the district court correctly read the statute,and determined that the consumer statutory right to sue could not be waived.
the credit providers raise a number of,none of which is persuasive.
credit providers first argue that,by placing the right to sue in the mandatory disclosures section of the statute,thus requiring it be explicitly stated to all consumers,does not actually create a right to sue as the terms are ordinarily understood.under such a reading,congress,whose purpose in enacting the statute included protecting consumers from misinformation,see b,drafted a statute which requires credit repair organizations to misinform consumers about a fictional right.under defendant interpretation,congress was requiring that consumers be told a lie that they possessed a right.we should avoid,if possible,a statutory interpretation that would produce an absurd and unjust result which congress could not have intended.united states middleton,cir quoting clinton city of new york.we do not believe congress was playing humpty dumpty with the statute,and we decline to accept the credit providers invitation to go down that particular rabbit hole.
the credit providers characterize the language stating you have the right to sue in section as merely a simplified shorthand for the more complicated right to bring a claim under section.this is actually a argument.first,credit providers argue the right to sue language should not be examined independently because it is merely a simplified restatement for consumers of the substantive rights embodied in the rest of the statute,particularly section,which sets out the punishments available for violations of the act.second,credit providers argue the more general language of section does not preclude arbitration.
we disagree.we must,if possible,interpret a statute such that all its language is given effect,and none of it is rendered superfluous.trw andrews.under credit providers interpretation,the right to sue language,indeed,the entire disclosures section,becomes superfluous and insignificant,merely a restatement of other sections of the statute that expand upon the rights set out in section.we decline to adopt such a reading.
in addition,credit providers argue the language right to sue was used in the section because it is more understandable to the average consumer than a broader phrase such as the right to bring a claim.this is despite the fact that,according to credit providers,congress meant to give consumers that latter right,rather than the former.if the purpose of the disclosures was to communicate to consumers their right to sue or to proceed using some form of alternative dispute resolution,the phrase right to sue is a phrase particularly likely to cause confusion,and lead consumers to misunderstand their rights under the croa.we see no reason to interpret the language in a way that goes against the purpose even credit providers have ascribed to it.the language actually chosen by congress should be given effect because it is plain and clear on its face,and we presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bedroc,llc united states,citing.bank germain.
the extremely broad provision in the croa protects the enumerated right to sue,by treating as void a ny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of the consumer under this subchapter a emphasis added.the act further provides that a ny attempt by any person to obtain a waiver from any consumer of any protection provided or any right of the consumer under this subchapter shall be treated as a violation of this subchapter.b.the plain language of the statute demonstrates that the waiver provision applies to the previously enumerated right to sue.first,the use of the word any to describe which rights are covered is expansive language that offers no indication whatever that congress intended to limit a statute reach.harrison ppg.thus,we read the term any right of the consumer to apply to all the rights in the statute,including the right to sue.second,congress consistent use of the word right indicates the waiver prohibition applies to the right to sue,as identical words in a statute should be given a consistent and identical meaning throughout the statute.see powerex corp reliant energy.therefore,we conclude that congress meant what it said.accordingly,the provision invalidates any waiver of the right to sue.
we are also not convinced by credit providers argument regarding the language in a.the section states a consumer waiver of any right or protection may not be enforced by any federal or state court or any other person.a.credit providers argue the any other person language demonstrates congress intended arbitrators to be able to decide croa claims.first,we do not think this language leads to such a clear and unilateral conclusion.for example,it is foreseeable that a credit repair organization would institute arbitration proceedings against a consumer for collection of the organization fees under its contract with the consumer.the croa creates various consumer rights and protections other than the right to sue.in an arbitration collection proceeding,one of the other consumer rights or protections could arise.the any other person language of section a assures that these rights and protections would be preserved in an arbitration instituted by a credit repair organization or debt collection agency.it is consistent with a consumer explicitly stated right to sue.given the plain language creating such a right,we do not find this language requires a different conclusion.
in addition,the statutory language underscores the central role of courts in enforcement of the statute in.this section,which sets out available damages for violations of the croa,repeatedly refers only to courts as the enforcement mechanism.for example,punitive damages may be assessed in such additional amount as the court may allow and lays out factors that the court shall consider.a a,b emphasis added.thus,the language in the remainder of the statute supports the plain reading of the text creating the right to sue,rather than requiring a different outcome.
we agree with other courts that the croa of rights provisions,combined with its proclamation of a consumer right to sue,represent precisely the expression of congressional intent required by the supreme court to find that a waiver of judicial remedies is precluded.alexander credit management,d.congress did not intend to void all waivers of rights under the act,and require consumers to sign a congressionally mandated enumeration of their rights under the act,only to permit those very same rights to waived mere moments later upon the signing an agreement such as the one in question here.id.at.we agree with the district court that t o recognize that croa voids all waivers of any right of the consumer and mandates that any waiver of the right to sue is void strikes the court as embracing an unhealthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.dkt,at citation omitted.thus,we hold the plain language of the croa prohibits enforcement of the arbitration agreement 
we realize this decision is in conflict with that of two of our sister circuits,but we are unpersuaded by the reasoning of those cases.see gay creditinform,cir picard credit solutions,cir.both gay and picard give surprisingly little regard to the right to sue language in the statute,and rely upon reasoning in supreme court cases that are distinguishable from the situation here.as picard essentially follows and adopts the reasoning in gay,we will not deal with the two cases separately.
gay dispatches with the explicit language creating a consumer right to sue in a mere footnote.the court states that since the section does not specify the forum for resolution of the dispute,it does not support the argument that it provides a judicial,rather than an arbitral,forum for croa violations.gay,at.as discussed in more detail above,this ignores the plain meaning of the word sue.the third circuit continues that even if sue implies the availability of a judicial forum which we believe it does,use of the word would not mean that the organization could not assert defenses that it had to such an action including the right to invoke a contractual arbitration provision to change the forum.id.this ignores completely the clause of the statute.the clause explicitly states that any waiver of any right by the consumer shall be treated as void and may not be enforced by any federal or state court a.thus,the organization might assert the defense of the contractual arbitration provision,but the court is explicitly forbidden from enforcing this waiver of the right to sue.
gay also relies upon analogies to several supreme court arbitration cases that we find unavailing.the third circuit first analogized the issue to the one the supreme court considered in.express,mcmahon,when it determined whether section a of the exchange act prohibited arbitration agreements.section of the act provides,the district courts of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder,and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.section a of the act declares void a ny condition,stipulation,or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of the act.id.a.the plaintiffs in mcmahon argued that section a prohibited waiver of the section right to bring suit in a federal district court.
as pointed out by the court in mcmahon,the exchange act provision,a,
forbids enforcement of agreements to waive compliance with the provisions of the statute.but itself does not impose any duty with which persons trading in securities must comply.by its terms,a only prohibits waiver of the substantive obligations imposed by the exchange act.because does not impose any statutory duties,its waiver does not constitute a waiver of compliance with any provision of the exchange act under a.
mcmahon,at.in summary,because the exchange act only prohibits waivers of compliance with its substantive obligations and the mandate of a judicial forum is not a substantive obligation,the exchange act does not preclude arbitration agreements.
applying mcmahon,the third circuit observed that the section of the croa in which this provision appears is entitled noncompliance with this subchapter.gay,at.the third circuit reasoned that the croa provision only extend s to rights premised on the imposition of statutory duties.id.because the right to sue in a judicial forum is not a statutory duty under the croa,the court concluded that the provision did not apply to it.id.however,the plain text of encompasses waivers of any protection or any right under the which are much broader than mere noncompliance.h eadings and titles are not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text,and where the plain text of the statute is unambiguous,the heading of a section can not limit the plain meaning of the text.of trainmen balt.ohio.dep t of corr.yeskey,t he title of a statute can not limit the plain meaning of the text.for interpretive purposes,it is of use only when it sheds light on some ambiguous word or phrase.here,because the text of a is not ambiguous,we need not turn to the title of the section to clarify its meaning.further,the distinction has no application to the croa.unlike the exchange act,the croa grants consumers the right to sue.vesting jurisdiction to hear a claim in a particular court is quantitatively different from a statute that expressly provides for a right to sue.thus,prohibition on waivers may not be limited to compliance with the croa,and mcmahon does not apply 
we are also not persuaded that the other supreme court cases regarding the availability of arbitration require allowing arbitration in this case.for instance,in mitsubishi motors soler,the supreme court considered whether the language in a rendered antitrust claims in the context of an international commercial dispute.in relevant part,a provides that any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the united states.the court held that this section did not evidence a congressional intent to preclude sherman act claims from being arbitrable,emphasizing that the federal arbitration act and the convention on the recognition of enforcement of foreign arbitral aw
