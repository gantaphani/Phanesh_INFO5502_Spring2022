appellants challenge the city of arlington recently enacted sexually oriented business ordinance as an unconstitutional restriction of their expressive liberties.we affirm the trial court judgment sustaining the ordinance.
facts and proceedings below 
fantasy ranch,fantasy ranch,and intervenor,cowtown exposition,tazz man,and harry freeman,are sexually oriented businesses sobs that feature topless dancing and operate under renewable licenses granted by the city of arlington,texas the city.theron bowman is the city chief of police as such,he is charged with enforcing the ordinances that the arlington sobs claim violate the constitution.in october,bowman,acting pursuant to the city sexually oriented business ordinance the sob ordinance as it,notified fantasy ranch by letter of his intent to suspend its license to operate as a sob for three days.according to the letter,fantasy ranch license was subject to a temporary suspension under of the sob ordinance,which at that time required suspension of a sob license if the city chief of police determine d that a sob licensee,operator or an employee ha d on five or more occasions within any one year period of time,violated the city prohibition on touching between topless dancers and patrons and ha d been convicted or placed on deferred adjudication or probation for the violations.although fantasy ranch requested and received a hearing on the proposed suspension,its objections failed,and in december the deputy chief of police before whom the hearing was conducted ordered that the license suspension go forward beginning january.before the suspension took effect,fantasy ranch filed this lawsuit in the northern district of texas.
b.the city sexually oriented business ordinance 
like many cities,arlington maintains a series of ordinances that regulate sobs through a combination of zoning restrictions,licensing requirements,and criminal laws.the appellants claims focus on two groups of provisions in the city current sob ordinance the proximity provisions,which consist of a a buffer zone and stage height provision,b a floor demarcation provision,and c a tipping provision and the licensing provisions,which define the procedure and substance governing suspension and revocation of a sob business license.
the proximity provisions 
first among the proximity provisions are buffer zone and stage height requirements,which prohibit a licensee,operator or employee of a sob from 
knowingly allow ing,in a sexually oriented business another to appear in a state of nudity,unless the person is an employee of the sob who,while in a state of nudity,is on a stage on which no customer is present at least eighteen inches above the floor,and is at least six feet from any customer or physically separated from customers by a solid clear transparent unbreakable glass or plexiglass wall with no openings that would permit physical contact with customers.
arlington,ordinance,b april.second is the sob ordinance demarcation provision,which mandates that a licensee,operator or employee of a sob prominently and continuously display a two inches wide line on the floor of the sob marking a distance of six feet from each unenclosed stage on which an employee in a state of nudity may appear.id.b.third,the sob ordinance regulates the tipping of nude dancers by prohibiting customers or patrons from tipping a nude sob employee directly but permitting tipping of a nude sob employee through either a tip receptacle,located more than six feet from the nearest point of the performance stage where the sob employee is in a state of nudity,or an employee that is not in a state of nudity,as part of the customer bill.id.c.
the city contends that the proximity provisions are designed to alleviate the negative secondary effects that flow from violations of its ordinance,which has long prohibited touching between nude sob employees and sob customers.according to the city findings listed in the ordinance enacting the proximity provisions,the provision,standing alone,did not effectively prevent touching between nude sob employees and their customers.the city explains that the proximity provisions were intended to address the provision inadequacy by further limiting activities that allow and often result in a close proximity between nude sob employees and their customers.in support of the proximity provisions,the city amassed the following evidentiary record which included references respecting the proximity provisions to a judicial decisions addressing similar ordinances from other cities and discussing the adverse secondary effects addressed by those ordinances,and b studies conducted in other jurisdictions on the adverse secondary effects of sobs reports of numerous violations at sobs within the city testimony regarding the effectiveness of stage height requirements in enforcing a rule and a report prepared by the city expert witness,goldsteen,concluding that the proximity provisions would effectively prevent touching between nude employees and patrons.
the licensing provisions 
the licensing provisions set out the procedural and substantive scheme governing suspension and revocation of a sob license to do business.see arlington,sexually oriented business ordinance.it is the alleged procedural and substantive invalidity of these provisions that originally prompted this lawsuit.since initiation of this case,however,the city has amended the licensing provisions significantly.because of these amendments,the district court concluded that all of fantasy ranch challenges to the previous licensing provisions are moot.to review the district court judgment on this point,then,requires an understanding of how the version of the licensing provisions compares with the version.
a.the licensing provisions 
prior to their amendment by the city,and at the time that fantasy ranch originally filed this suit,the licensing provisions required that a sob license be temporarily suspended 
if the city chief of police determine d that a licensee s,operator s,or employee s of a licensee ha d o n five or more occasions within any one year period of time,violated the provisions of the sob ordinance and ha d been convicted or placed on deferred adjudication or probation for the violations.
arlington,sexually oriented business ordinance a,amended by arlington.ordinance,a april.following the fourth such temporary suspension,the licensing provisions required that the city revoke the sob license.id.a.once a sob received notice that the chief of police had determined that its license was subject to a temporary suspension for five violations,the licensing provisions granted the sob the right to challenge that notice of suspension either in writing to the city chief of police or by requesting a hearing before the chief of police a term that the licensing provisions defined to include,inter alia,the deputy chief of police.id.the licensing provisions did not define the procedural or substantive rules and standards according to which the chief of police or his deputy was to render his decision.if the chief of police ordered a temporary suspension of the sob license to proceed,the licensing provisions permitted that sob to appeal the suspension to a texas state court,and the suspension would not go into effect until after the conclusion of that appeal.id.a.
b.the licensing provisions 
on april,after fantasy ranch filed this lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the sob ordinance licensing provisions,the city enacted ordinance,which significantly amended the licensing provisions to incorporate more substantive and procedural protections for sobs.specifically,under the licensing provisions,the chief of police could suspend a sob license because of that sob employees having been convicted of five violations within any one year of the or proximity provisions only if the sob had been given notice of the citations for those violations within three business days following the issuance of the citation.arlington,ordinance,a.in addition,the amended licensing provisions created an affirmative defense for sobs faced with such a possible license suspension it shall be an affirmative offense sic to a suspension arising out of five violations of the or proximity provisions if the sob shows by a preponderance of the evidence that it was powerless to prevent the or proximity violation s.id.b.moreover,the licensing provisions more clearly delineate the procedural and substantive rules governing the chief of police resolution of a sob challenge to a notice of suspension.specifically,the amended licensing provisions provide for an evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge rather than before the chief of police or his deputy and grant that judge the responsibility of ruling on procedural and evidentiary questions that arise during the hearing and define what evidence the chief of police may consider when deciding whether to suspend the sob license.id.finally,certain aspects of the licensing provisions were unaffected by ordinance.namely,the licensing provisions continue to permit an aggrieved sob to appeal its license suspension to state court,and the provisions still provide that the license suspension is stayed pending the outcome of that appeal.id.in addition,under the licensing provisions,four temporary license suspensions still result in revocation of a sob license on the fifth violation.id.a.
procedural history 
in january,after fantasy ranch administrative challenge to the city proposed suspension of its license failed,but before the suspension ordered by chief bowman was to go into effect,fantasy ranch filed suit in the northern district of texas seeking declaratory judgment that the license suspension and revocation scheme created by the licensing provisions violated the first amendment by a operating as a prior restraint,and b failing to satisfy the requirements for regulations set forth in united states,d and violated the procedural component of the due process clause.two months later,in march,fantasy ranch moved for summary judgment on all of these claims.
on april,before the city responded to fantasy ranch motion for summary judgment,the city enacted the first of four amendments to the sob ordinance that directly impact this case.the city first enacted ordinance,which,as explained supra,amended the licensing provisions by enhancing the procedural and substantive protections afforded to sobs during the license suspension and revocation process.based on these enhanced protections,the city filed its first amended answer to fantasy ranch original complaint,asserting that ordinance changes to the licensing provisions rendered all of fantasy ranch claims challenging the licensing provisions moot.in addition,the city first amended answer asserted that it would not ever enforce the temporary suspension of fantasy ranch license that it had ordered under the licensing provisions 
on april,just two weeks after enacting ordinance,the city again amended its sob ordinance by enacting ordinance.that amendment established the above described proximity provisions of which the arlington sobs now complain.prior to the enactment of the ordinance,the city sob ordinance only prohibited touching between nude dancers and their customers,and required that signs be placed at the entrances to sobs informing customers of the rule.arlington,ordinance,b c,b.as discussed supra,the city found the additional proximity provisions to be necessary because the existing and signage rules did not effectively prevent touching between nude dancers and patrons.specifically,the city,in enacting these additional provisions,expressly found that sobs have not complied with the no touch provisions,and have flagrantly disregarded them encouraged employees and customers to violate the no touch provision.id.moreover,according to these formal findings of the city,c ompelling signage at the entrances of sobs has not been effective in halting no touch violations.id.
on may,in response to the amendment of the licensing provisions and the addition of the proximity provisions,fantasy ranch filed an amended complaint in which it disputed the city assertion that all of its claims attacking the licensing provisions were moot,and asserted new claims challenging the licensing provisions,arguing essentially that those provisions suffer from the same constitutional infirmities as the licensing provisions.the next month,on june,fantasy ranch filed a supplemental complaint in which it again asserted new claims,this time challenging the proximity provisions,arguing that those provisions violate the first amendment.
with the enactment of the proximity provisions,other sobs became interested in the litigation and,on june,the district court granted intervenor tazz man,cowtown exposition,and harry freeman leave to intervene.the intervenor sobs limited their challenges to the constitutionality of the proximity provisions and,therefore,are not parties to fantasy ranch due process and related first amendment challenges to the licensing provisions.
when the dust settled,the district court had before it constitutional claims challenging the pre and licensing provisions and the proximity provisions fantasy ranch alone challenged the licensing provisions,arguing that those provisions a effected a prior restraint in violation of the first amendment,and b prior to fantasy ranch license being temporarily suspended,failed to provide fantasy ranch with the process it was constitutionally due and that its claims were not mooted by either the city amendment of the licensing provisions or the city pledge not to enforce its temporary suspension of fantasy ranch license.also alone,fantasy ranch challenged the licensing provisions,essentially arguing that those provisions failed for the same reasons as the licensing provisions.finally,all of the arlington sobs challenged the proximity provisions,arguing that those provisions are unconstitutional restrictions on symbolic speech.
in february,the arlington sobs moved for summary judgment on all of their claims,and in march the city for summary judgment.five months later,in august,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting summary judgment to the city,denying the arlington sobs motion for summary judgment,and holding the proximity provisions constitutional.the district court august opinion did not,however,address fantasy ranch constitutional claims directed at the pre and versions of the licensing provisions rather,the district court waited until its final judgment,which was issued in september,to resolve those claims.in that judgment,the court held without further elaboration that i n regards to fantasy ranch causes of action attacking the constitutionality of and the licensing provisions,as set forth in its pleadings,the claims are moot and the statutory provisions at issue are constitutional.
discussion 
i.the proximity provisions 
we first address the appellants first amendment challenge to the ordinance proximity provisions,and hold that those provisions satisfy the test set forth in for restrictions on symbolic speech.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.vela city of houston,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,when viewed in the light most favorable to the,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.tig ins.sedgwick james of washington,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
while it is now beyond question that nonobscene nude dancing is protected by the first amendment,even if only marginally so,it is also clear that the government can regulate such activity.lleh,wichita county,texas,cir citations omitted.indeed,nude dancing falls only within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection.city of erie pap,d plurality opinion see also barnes glen theatre,d plurality opinion.
strict or intermediate scrutiny 
we must first determine,then,what level of scrutiny applies,a question that depends on whether the government predominate purpose in enacting the regulation is related to the suppression of expression itself.pap.at plurality opinion.if the government interest is indeed related to the suppression of content,then that regulation of symbolic speech is subject to strict scrutiny.see texas johnson,d.if,however,the government predominate purpose is unrelated to the suppression of expression,such that the regulation can be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,then intermediate scrutiny applies.clark community for creative,d see also.
the city of arlington contends that its ordinance is content neutral,arguing that it targets only negative secondary effects of speech,not content.the appellants counter that the ordinance is content based,arguing that the ordinance predominate interest is,in fact,the suppression of their erotic message,a message which,they further contend,has never been shown by the city to produce any negative secondary effects.
courts routinely apply intermediate scrutiny to government regulation of sexually oriented businesses,and we again do so today.see pap.at government restrictions on public nudity should be evaluated under the framework set forth in for restrictions on symbolic speech.see also enterprises city of houston,cir lleh wichita county,cir encore videos,city of san antonio,cir.in lleh wichita county,for example,this court applied intermediate scrutiny to a public lewdness ordinance that was nearly identical to the one at issue here,reversing the district court judgment in favor of a sexually oriented business,and holding that a buffer requirement,an stage height requirement,and a demarcation requirement were all constitutional under and,in pap,a divided supreme court upheld an ordinance that banned all public nudity and,as a consequence,required the city erstwhile nude dancers to wear pasties and during their performances.at.in deciding to apply intermediate scrutiny,the court reasoned that the ordinance was on its face a general prohibition on public nudity,and noted that the city of erie asserted interest in combating the negative secondary effects associated with adult entertainment establishments is unrelated to the suppression of the erotic message conveyed by nude dancing.id.at.
we acknowledge that in pap the court was persuaded of the ordinance content neutrality by two related considerations,only one of which is present here.first,the court noted that the ordinance is aimed at combating crime and other negative secondary effects caused by the presence of adult entertainment establishments and not at suppressing the erotic message conveyed by this type of nude dancing,a consideration which is also present here,since,as we discuss below,the city of arlington ordinance is also aimed predominately at secondary effects.the second consideration relied upon in pap,however,was that the city of erie ordinance banned all public nudity,and that the ordinance was therefore content neutral because it was facially neutral.pap.at the ordinance here is on its face a general prohibition on public nudity it does not target nudity that contains an erotic message.see also barnes glen theatre,d indiana public indecency statute predates barroom nude dancing and was enacted as a general prohibition.by this second consideration,facial neutrality,the city of arlington ordinance is not content neutral,because it targets only sexually oriented businesses.
we understand,of course,that the city of arlington targeted ordinance might simply reflect the fact that arlington had recently been having a public nudity problem not with streakers,sunbathers or hot dog vendors but with lap dancers.pap.at scalia,concurring.indeed,it would seem mere pretext if the city of arlington,in the name of facial neutrality,also required buffer zones,thereby invoking and eradicating a public nuisance.
we therefore hold that an ordinance such as the one before us is content neutral so as long as the ordinances predominate concern is for secondary effects,a holding supported by our sister circuits and a careful reading of a fractured court the sixth and ninth circuits,for example,while upholding and requirements similar to the one here,have classified such provisions as content neutral.in deja vu,nashville,the sixth circuit held that a buffer zone and an requirement were subject to intermediate scrutiny,explaining that w e have previously recognized that ordinances aimed at regulating adult entertainment businesses constitute regulations,but that a distinction may be drawn between adult businesses and other kinds of businesses without violating the government paramount obligation of neutrality when the government seeks to regulate only the secondary effects of erotic speech,and not the speech itself,cir citations omitted.likewise,in kev,kitsap county,the ninth circuit held that a buffer zone,a requirement,and a no tipping rule were all subject to intermediate scrutiny,explaining that t he stated purpose of the county ordinance is to alleviate undesirable social problems that accompany erotic dance studios,not to curtail the protected,the dancing thus,we conclude that the ordinance is because it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,cir.
indeed,pap itself provides support for this approach.for although the court there emphasized that erie ordinance is on its face a restriction on conduct,the plurality also remarked,even if the city thought that nude dancing constituted a particularly problematic instance of public nudity,the regulation is still properly evaluated as a restriction because the interest in combating the secondary effects associated with those clubs is unrelated to the suppression of the erotic message conveyed by nude dancing.pap.at.emphasis added.and,in a separate concurrence,justice scalia,joined by justice thomas,made a similar point,noting that even were i to conclude that the city of erie had specifically singled out the activity of nude dancing,i still would not find that this regulation violated the first amendment unless i could be persuaded that is was the communicative character of nude dancing that prompted the ban.pap.at scalia,concurring.finally,while discussing the secondary effects doctrine in the context of zoning ordinances,justice kennedy has explained,the ordinance may identify the speech based on content,but only as a shorthand for identifying the secondary effects city of los angeles alameda books,d.see also city of paul,d noting that a valid basis for according differential treatment to even a subclass of proscribable speech is that the subclass happens to be associated with secondary effects of the speech,so that the regulation is justified without reference to the content of the speech.
applying this result to our case,we agree with the district court ruling that because the city of arlington sob ordinance is predominately targeted to the prevention of secondary effects,not to the suppression of symbolic expression,it is entitled to intermediate scrutiny.the purpose of ordinance,even as the appellant sees it is to better enforce the city previously enacted no touch rule,a rule that itself targeted the very same secondary effects that continue to trouble the city,assault,drug dealing,and even the touching itself.the content of the erotic speech affected by this ordinance that message which is allegedly conveyed by dancing nude within six feet of a person is,according to the appellant expert,a message of,friendliness,trust,inclusion,immediacy,humanity,play,affection,sensuality,desirability,and love.it is easy to imagine a regulation that might directly target such a message,especially when it is communicated between strangers for a fee however,this particular ordinance stated purpose is to eradicate certain negative secondary effects that flow from this particular form of symbolic speech particularly the physical contact between dancer and patron that we have already held to be unprotected by the first amendment,see hang on,city of arlington,cir,and the crimes which that touching encourages and facilitates.as the pap plurality explained,if states are to be able to regulate secondary effects,then de minimis intrusions on expression such as those at issue here can not be sufficient to render the ordinance content based.pap.at.here,the ordinance attempts to control secondary effects while leaving the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact.alameda books.at 
the appellants urge,however,that because the alleged secondary effects result only from actual physical contact,not from mere proximity,the city could not realistically hope to eradicate them by going,literally,above and beyond the rule and enacting buffer zone and requirements.
the appellants argument is flawed.this stage of the there is content simply the wrong place to dispute either the existence of the secondary effects or the efficacy of the challenged ordinance.presently,we are concerned only with the ordinance stated purpose if the government interest is unrelated to expression,then intermediate scrutiny applies.see pap.at,of course,required no evidentiary showing at all that the threatened harm was real.application of intermediate scrutiny,however,gives those challenging the ordinance an opportunity to convince the court that the ordinance does not actually further any substantial government interests,or,relatedly,that no substantial government interests exist.see enterprises,at t he constitutional standard of review depends only upon the city predominate legislative concern,not its proof that the ordinance would work.
because we conclude that ordinance is content neutral,it is a constitutional restriction on symbolic speech if it satisfies the four factor test from.applying the standard here,we conclude that the city of arlington ordinance passes the test.a public nudity ordinance that incidentally impacts protected expression should be upheld if it is within the constitutional power of the government it furthers an important or substantial government interest the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the incidental restriction on first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.
the first prong of,which is unchallenged by appellants,is whether the ordinance is within the constitutional power of the arlington city council.even if challenged,this prong would easily be satisfied,since ordinances aimed at protecting the health and safety of citizens are squarely within the city police powers.pap.at.the second prong of is whether the regulation furthers an important or substantial government interest.the court has identified two distinct questions packaged within this second prong.see pap.at describing the two questions as,first,whether there is a substantial government interest whether the threatened harm is real,and,second,whether the regulation furthers that interest.the appellants challenge the ordinance on both grounds,arguing first that a question of material fact exists as to whether prostitution transactions,narcotics transactions,and assault result from proximity between dancer and patron during performances,and second that,even if these do exist,a question of material fact exists as to whether ordinance will ameliorate the problem.
both of these challenges raise questions of evidence that we evaluate using the standard described in city of renton playtime theatres,d,as modified by alameda books.see pap.at t he evidentiary standard described in renton controls here alameda books,d we granted certiorari to clarify the standard for determining whether an ordinance serves a substantial government interest under renton.citations omitted.the renton evidentiary standard,as reaffirmed in alameda books,provides that a municipality may rely on any evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant for demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial,independent government interest.alameda books.at quoting renton.at see also enterprises city of houston,cir.justice kennedy concurrence noted that t he first amendment does not require a city,before enacting such an ordinance,to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities alameda books.at quoting renton.at however,the plurality cautioned that the government can not rely on shoddy data or reasoning,explaining that 
the municipality evidence must fairly support the municipality rationale if plaintiffs fail to cast direct doubt on this rationale,either by demonstrating that the municipality evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the municipality factual findings,the municipality meets the standards set forth in renton.if plaintiffs succeed in casting doubt on a municipality rationale in either manner,the burden shifts back to the municipality to supplement the record with evidence renewing support for a theory that justifies its ordinance.
alameda books.at plurality opinion citing pap.at see also alameda books.at kennedy,concurring.
the city of arlington evidence fairly supports its rationale by demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial,independent government interest.the record before us includes a report by the city expert,joel goldsteen several studies,conducted both within the city of arlington and in other communities as well as data cited in numerous courts opinions,all of which demonstrate a connection between touching and unsavory secondary effects.also in the record are findings that the city prior no touch ordinance had been consistently flouted and that attempts to enforce it had been costly and not adequately effective.
faced with the no touch ordinance failure to achieve its purpose,the city enacted the current version of the ordinance,including proximity provisions,demarcation requirements,and a no tipping rule,which the city believes are necessary to insure compliance with the no touch rule and to thereby eliminate the secondary effects that it targets.the city supports this belief with a los angeles police department study of criminal acts that are associated with close proximity between dancer and patron.indeed,the appellants own expert,hanna,admits the very fact upon which the city inference rests,noting that c loseness and interaction between a performer and an individual patron permit the dancer to show special interest in the patron this occurs through eye contact,pupil dilation and incidental touch emphasis added.
the appellants respond,however,that the ordinance record contains no empirical support for the city alleged link between proximity and the targeted secondary effects.they point to their deposition of the city expert,goldsteen,who conceded that,he was unaware of any empirical studies which gauge the level of secondary effects which occur inside a gentlemen club which is correlated to the distance between dancer and patron,and that he had not read any report of that nature prior to his report to the city council further,appellants note that their own expert,bruce mclaughlin,concluded that n othing in goldsteen report or in the materials which he could have examined establishes a correlation between proximity,let alone a causal relationship between such proximity,and adverse secondary effects.echoing the appellant concern for justification,mclaughlin concluded,the arlington city council had before it nothing whatsoever with respect to proximity of dancers and patrons other than goldsteen conjecture and speculation.
the appellant focus on the city council rationale is misplaced,since o ur appropriate focus is not an empirical enquiry into the actual intent of the enacting legislature,but rather the existence or not of a current governmental interest in the service of which the challenged application of the statute may be constitutional.lleh,at emphasis added quoting barnes glen theatre,d souter,concurring see also enterprises,at t he city need not demonstrate that the city council actually relied upon evidence of negative secondary effects a local government can justify a challenged ordinance based both on evidence developed prior to the ordinance enactment and that adduced at trial.
the appellants further argue,in the alternative,that the rationale offered by the city is shoddy,and contend that even if the city has met its burden of demonstrating a rationale for regulating proximity,they cast sufficient doubt upon that rationale,as described in alameda books,to shift the burden back to the city to supplement the record and thereby preclude summary judgment.see,lounge manatee county,cir reversing a summary judgment in favor of the county because the lounge had successfully cast doubt on the county rationale by placing into the record substantial and unanswered factual challenges.in support of this claim,the appellants point to an affidavit by their expert,joe morris,who,after collecting data from open records requests to the arlington police department and the municipal court,reported that there were no arrests,citations,or police calls for prostitution,solicitation,assault,or narcotics at any of the city of arlington adult cabarets from july,through july.
we find this evidence,even when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,plainly insufficient to preclude summary judgment.indeed,a lthough this evidence shows that the city might have reached a different and equally reasonable conclusion regarding the relationship between adverse secondary effects and sexually oriented businesses,it is not sufficient to vitiate the result reached in the city legislative process.enterprises,town of joseph,cir affirming summary judgment in favor of the town buffer and requirement despite meaningful countervailing evidence presented by the plaintiffs.at best,joe morris report suggests that no arrests at strip clubs had occurred for prostitution,drugs,or assault,a fact that is likely of little comfort to the city of arlington,which passed this ordinance at least in part because proximity in a room made such crimes difficult to police.ultimately,we are not empowered by alameda to the empirical assessments of a legislative body,nor are we expected to submit such assessments to a jury for instead,the relevant material fact that must be placed at issue is whether the ordinance is supported by evidence that can be reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem.see renton.at emphasis added see also enterprises,at alameda books.at kennedy,concurring t he los angeles city council knows the streets of los angeles better than we do.because no such issue of material fact exists,we hold that ordinance satisfies the second prong of.
the ordinance also satisfies the third prong of because,as discussed supra,the city interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression.see pap.at.
the fourth and final prong of is also satisfied here,since the restriction on expressive conduct is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the city interest.in reaching this conclusion,we are largely bound by and in any event agree with our prior opinion in lleh,in which we held that an ordinance with identical,and demarcation requirements satisfied fourth prong.the lleh court explained that such regulations are not invalid simply because there is some imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on speech so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.lleh,at quoting united states albertini,d emphasis omitted.the only relevant difference between this ordinance and the one at issue in lleh is that the arlington ordinance also contains a tipping restriction.this restriction also satisfies prong four,however,because it is simply a manifestation of the buffer provision it furthers the same substantial interests i t imposes no further restriction on speech.lleh,at discussing the demarcation requirement.
appellants respond,first,that lleh standard was overruled by justice kennedy concurrence in alameda books,and,second,that under either standard the ordinance is unconstitutional,since it completely bans a unique form of expression,proximate nude dancing.
we disagree with the appellants contention that lleh is no longer good law.the question of narrow tailoring was not before the court in alameda books rather,the court granted certiorari to clarify the standard for determining whether an ordinance serves a substantial government interest under renton.alameda books.at citations omitted.that question is relevant only to issues discussed above respecting prongs two and three.
but even if justice kennedy concurrence has tightened the narrow tailoring standard of renton it is not clear that this purportedly new standard,which was formulated for zoning cases,would apply here,in a case.indeed,only two years before alameda books,in a case,a plurality that included justice kennedy applied the very same loose requirement that we do today,holding t he fourth factor is that the restriction is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest,and concluding since this is a restriction,least restrictive means analysis is not required.pap.at.in any event,the ordinance before us satisfies even the more strict standard proposed by appellants.
thus we also disagree with the appellants second argument,presented through their expert witness,hanna,that the ordinance enacts a complete ban on proximate nude dancing the supreme court rejected a very similar argument when it was made by the dissenters in pap,who argued that a pasties and requirement completely silenced the erotic message associated with fully nude dancing.the plurality responded,s imply to define what is being banned as the message is to assume the conclusion any effect on the overall expression is de minimis.pap.at.moreover,in colacurcio,the ninth circuit rejected an identical argument,made through the very same hanna,while holding that a buffer zone,a requirement,and a tipping ban were all sufficiently.colacurcio city of kent,cir,cert.denied,d.
here too we hold that the effect on the overall expression is de minimis,as the city of arlington has muted only that portion of the expression that occurs when the line is crossed,while leaving the erotic message largely intact.indeed,in barnes,all nine members of the supreme court agreed that a buffer zone would meet narrow tailoring requirements.writing for the dissent,justice white argued that the ordinance at issue,which banned all public nudity,was not narrowly drawn.barnes glen theatre,d.the dissenters continued,if the state is genuinely concerned with prostitution and associated evils it can adopt restrictions that do not interfere with the expressiveness of nonobscene nude dancing performances.for instance,the state could perhaps require that,while performing,nude performers remain at all times a certain minimum distance from spectators id.emphasis added.accordingly,we hold that the proximity provisions of the challenged ordinances satisfy all four prongs of,and thus are a constitutional regulation of symbolic speech.
ii.prior restraint 
fantasy ranch also contends that the ordinance provision is incompatible with the first amendment because it imposes a prior restraint on symbolic speech.in universal amusement,vance,this court held that a texas nuisance statute,which authorized the revocation of an adult theater license on the basis of a prior finding of obscenity,constituted an impermissible prior restraint,since the state would be enjoin ing the future operation of a business which disseminates presumptively first amendment protected materials solely on the basis of the nature of the materials which were sold in the past,cir en banc internal quotations omitted 
the license revocation provision in this case differs from a prior restraint in two respects.first,the revocation would impose no restraint at all on the dissemination of particular materials,since respondents are free to carry on their business at another location,even if such locations are difficult to find,and,second,the closure order sought would not be imposed on the basis of an advance determination that the distribution of particular materials is,the imposition of the closure order has nothing to do with any expressive conduct at all.arcara cloud books,d.
unlike the provision in vance,which prohibited the showing of any film for one year,fantasy ranch is not prohibited from obtaining another sob license for another location during the pendency of any license suspension or revocation.this is because fantasy ranch license revocation would have
