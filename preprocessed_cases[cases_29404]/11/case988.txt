about nonresidents hunted in north dakota in,roughly percent of its hunters that year.during,nonresident waterfowl hunters took approximately trips to north dakota,spending an estimated days there.while in north dakota for the season,nonresident waterfowl hunters spent around million in direct expenditures such as food,lodging,and equipment.nonresident hunters also generated an estimated jobs,nearly million in north dakota tax collections,million in gross business volume,and million in secondary economic effects.
in april,an issue arose in the north dakota legislative assembly between resident hunters who wanted restrictions on the hunting of waterfowl by nonresidents and business people who profit from the patronage of nonresident hunters.the assembly directed the legislative council to study this issue.the assigned committee reported that the number of nonresident waterfowl hunters had grown from about hunters in to hunters in.the committee further reported that resident hunters primarily complained about competition they faced from nonresidents in access to hunting land.t here is only so much good hunting land that is available to be acquired for hunting access.appellants at.the committee recommended restricting nonresident hunting of waterfowl within north dakota.
several restrictions on nonresident hunting followed the study,particularly in the hunting of waterfowl.first,north dakota excluded nonresidents from hunting during the opening week of waterfowl season in amendment one to the small proclamation,which has the force of law.see.second,north dakota excluded nonresidents from all hunting,including of waterfowl,during the first week of pheasant season on land owned by the north dakota game and fish department,private land regulated by the department for hunting purposes,and land for which the department provides in lieu of tax payments.see effective august,amendment one to the small proclamation.third,north dakota raised its license fees for nonresidents who must now pay for a waterfowl license up from and another for a small game license up from if they also wish to hunt pheasants and grouse.see amended in.by contrast,residents do not have to buy a separate license to hunt waterfowl together with pheasants and grouse,but must only purchase one small game license costing.see.finally,even before,north dakota exempted residents and any member of the resident family residing with the resident to hunt in season without a license on land they own or lease.see.
minnesota filed this action seeking declaratory judgment and to enjoin these hunting laws to the extent they favor north dakota residents.minnesota amended complaint,filed april,alleged among other things that each of these laws violates the commerce clause,art.i,of the united states constitution.further,minnesota alleged that,permitting residents and any member of the resident family residing with the resident to hunt in season without a license on land they own or lease,violates the privileges and immunities clause,art.iv,of the united states constitution.
on january,minnesota filed a motion seeking summary judgment on its commerce clause claim.on february,north dakota filed a seeking summary judgment on the merits of minnesota claims under the commerce clause and privileges and immunities clause.
further,on may,north dakota filed a motion to dismiss minnesota commerce clause claim as moot based on the reaffirmation of state regulation of resident and nonresident hunting and fishing act of,section of house bill,approved by the united states congress and signed into law on may.
on june,the district court denied minnesota motion for summary judgment,granted north dakota for summary judgment,and denied north dakota motion to dismiss.minnesota ex rel.hatch hoeven,d.on minnesota commerce clause claims,the court reasoned that north dakota does not regulate persons in commerce or activity substantially affect ing interstate commerce.id.at.the court considered it unnecessary to address the merits of north dakota motion to dismiss other than to note that congressional interpretation of what is and is not interstate commerce is not controlling on the judicial branch.id.at citing united states lopez,d.

on july,minnesota filed a notice of appeal from the final judgment granting defendants motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.
minnesota on its appeal raises two issues that north dakota waterfowl hunting restrictions violate the dormant commerce clause,art.i,of the united states constitution appellants op.br.at,and north dakota authorizing residents to hunt in season on land they own or lease without a license denies nonresident landowners the same use and enjoyment of their property in violation of the privileges and immunities clause,art.iv,of the united states constitution appellants op.br.at.
north dakota in response rejects the dormant commerce clause contentions and separately denies the privileges and immunities clause claim.north dakota asserts that an enactment by the united states congress,house bill,in may,renders the dormant commerce clause claim constitutionally moot.north dakota in this appeal also asserts that minnesota has waived the privileges and immunities clause claim,and alternatively that minnesota claim does not impinge on a privilege or immunity protected by article iv,section of the united states constitution.
in this opinion,we briefly discuss the dormant commerce clause issue and determine that united states congressional action has made minnesota contention constitutionally moot.we reach and discuss the privileges and immunities clause and determine its provisions do not provide minnesota any relief.thus,we will affirm the judgment of dismissal.

we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.donovan harrah.heights,cir.summary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
commerce clause,art.i,
minnesota claims that north dakota preference for residents over nonresidents in its hunting laws violates the commerce clause,art.i,of the united states constitution.the commerce clause provides,congress shall have power t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i.
although the commerce clause reads as an affirmative grant of regulatory power to congress,the supreme court has read into this language a negative or dormant component that grants courts the power to invalidate state laws that discriminate against interstate commerce.see camps,town of harrison,d.a dormant commerce clause analysis asks whether the state law discriminates against interstate commerce and whether sufficient justification exists for the burden imposed.see smithfield foods,miller,cir.
the record in this case clearly shows nonresident hunting means big business for north dakota and its residents.however,we need not reach the merits of minnesota claim that north dakota restrictions on nonresident hunting violate the dormant commerce clause.
on may,the president signed into law house bill,the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense,the global war on terror,and tsunami relief.although seemingly unrelated to the general thrust of the legislation,section of house bill specifically addresses the issue raised in this appeal,providing

b declaration of policy and construction of congressional silence 
in is the policy of congress that it is in the public interest for each state to continue to regulate the taking for any purpose of fish and wildlife within its boundaries,including by means of laws or regulations that differentiate between residents and nonresidents of such state with respect to the availability of licenses or permits for taking of particular species of fish or wildlife,the kind and numbers of fish and wildlife that may be taken,or the fees charged in connection with issuance of licenses or permits for hunting or fishing.
construction of congressional on the part of congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier under clause of section of article i of the constitution commonly referred to as the commerce clause to the regulation of hunting or fishing by a state or indian tribe.
in schutz thorne,cir,the tenth circuit considered the effect of section on a dormant commerce clause challenge to wyoming giving residents preferred access to recreational hunting.the court concluded section made the claim constitutionally moot,which results when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.id.at quoting county of los angeles davis,d.the court explained that t he essential element of a successful dormant commerce clause claim is congressional inaction,so when congress does act,the dormancy ends,thus leaving the courts obliged to follow congressional will.id.thus,when congress acted to confirm the rights of states to regulate these activities,schutz claim ended.id.

the district court misread united states lopez,d,reasoning congressional interpretation of what is and is not interstate commerce is not controlling on the judicial branch.see hoeven,d at.lopez did not challenge state law under the dormant commerce clause.rather,lopez presented a positive commerce clause challenge,asking whether congress regulated beyond the scope of its authority in passing the school zones act of.see at.on that question,the supreme court reasoned that congress could not decide the outer limits of its power to regulate interstate commerce.see id.at.
with respect to the dormant commerce clause,the supreme court has held,
our decisions do not,however,limit the authority of congress to regulate commerce among the several states as it sees fit.in the exercise of this plenary authority,congress may confe r upon the states an ability to restrict the flow of interstate commerce that they would not otherwise enjoy.if congress ordains that the states may freely regulate an aspect of interstate commerce,any action taken by a state within the scope of the congressional authorization is rendered invulnerable to commerce clause challenge.

minnesota also contends that section does not apply to migratory waterfowl passing through north dakota.this argument contradicts the plain meaning of section,which states,it is the policy of congress that it is in the public interest for each state to continue to regulate the taking for any purpose of fish and wildlife within its boundaries further,minnesota did not develop this argument and define boundaries in a way that excludes migratory wildlife located by hunters in north dakota.instead,minnesota simply commented that north dakota does not own or possess migratory waterfowl.
finally,minnesota argues congress did not follow the regular authorization process by attaching section to an important appropriations bill.as part of an appropriations bill,minnesota argues that section provided a temporary measure that lasted for one fiscal year,at most.this argument loses force where,as here,the disputed section does not relate to appropriations and spending,which generally occurs in a fiscal cycle.constr.trades dep t,martin,a provision contained in an appropriations bill operates only in the applicable fiscal year,unless its language clearly indicates that it is intended to be permanent.united states int l bus.machines.
to bolster its argument,minnesota observes that section has not been codified in the united states code and the conference report on house bill expressed a need for expedient action,stating state fish and wildlife agencies will soon be considering regulations for coming seasons,and it is important that questions about their authority be resolved without unnecessary delay.cong.rec,at.however,we need not decide today whether section will forever preclude challenges to restrictions on nonresident hunting under the dormant commerce clause.it is sufficient for this court to determine its application to this litigation.
we have no doubt congress intended section to apply here.section arose in response to conservation force,manning,cir.see cong.rec,at.the committee report expressed concern that the ninth circuit decision could have an effect on the thinking of federal courts across the country.id.
as the district court observed,minnesota modeled its dormant commerce clause claim after conservation force.see d at.then,while the parties had motions for summary judgment on the issue pending before the district court,the president signed section into law as part of house bill.in this context,the language of futurity contained in section certainly applies.see b it is the policy of congress that it is in the public interest for each state to continue to regulate the taking for any purpose of fish and wildlife within its boundaries,including by means of laws or regulations that differentiate between residents and nonresidents of such state emphasis added b silence on the part of congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier under clause of section of article i of the constitution commonly referred to as the commerce clause to the regulation of hunting or fishing by a state or indian tribe.emphasis added.
privileges and immunities clause,art.iv,
minnesota also claims that north dakota statutes authorizing residents to hunt without a license on land they own or lease violates the privileges and immunities clause,art.iv,of the united states constitution,which states,the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.
