in this case,ace seguros,ace sued werner enterprises,werner to recover the full value of a shipment of lost cell phones under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,carmack amendment.the district court,in a summary judgment ruling in favor of werner,sustained werner limitation of its liability.ace appeals.
communicaciones nextel de mexico,de nextel had the cell phones manufactured,and arranged through intermediaries to have werner,a common carrier,transport them.nextel insured the full value of its shipments through ace,its insurance company.the cell phones were stolen during transit.ace paid nextel claim for the loss,and was subrogated to the interests of nextel.
the primary issue in this case involves the validity of werner limitation of its liability to.that issue in turn depends on whether this case is distinguishable from the supreme court decision in norfolk southern railway kirby,d.we determine that kirby is not distinguishable.ace also argues that werner did not take the steps necessary under the carmack amendment to limit its liability.we conclude that the contractual limitation of liability here complied with the applicable statutory requirements.finally,ace argues that the district court applied an incorrect rate of prejudgment interest.we find no error.accordingly,for the reasons set forth in greater detail below,we affirm.
background 
in or,nextel began using westwind maritime international,and westwind international,collectively westwind to arrange for the transportation of cell phones from a motorola plant in plantation,florida to a customs broker in texas.westwind brokered approximately one shipment a week of motorola cell phones for nextel from florida to texas.
the invoice for westwind services invoice,the only contract between nextel and westwind,notified nextel that third party carriers might limit their liability for loss.paragraph of the invoice stated 
declaring higher value to third parties.third parties to whom the goods are entrusted may limit liability for loss or damage the company will request excess valuation coverage only upon specific written instructions from the customer,which must agree to pay any charges therefore in the absence of written instructions or the refusal of the third party to agree to a higher declared value,at company discretion,the goods may be tendered to the third party,subject to the terms of the third party limitations of liability terms and conditions of service.
nextel received this standard shipping invoice approximately times prior to the loss at issue.
beginning around,westwind periodically arranged for carriage of the motorola cell phones through transpro logistics transpro.in november of,transpro entered into a broker transportation agreement bta with werner.the bta governed the general business relationship between the parties.paragraph contained the following limitation of liability clause 
carrier liability for loss,damage or injury to cargo occurring while in the possession or under the control of carrier hereunder,and resulting from carrier performance of the services provided for in this agreement,shall be the same standard of liability imposed by section and applicable common law.provided,that the carrier maximum liability for loss or damage to cargo shall not in any event exceed two hundred thousand dollars per truckload shipment unless a higher degree of liability is specifically assumed in writing by an authorized representative of carrier.
paragraph of the bta also incorporated werner tariff,and item of the tariff includes the following provision 
on domestic shipments within the united states of america and canada,shippers may,at their option,select liability coverage for loss or damage to cargo as set forth in carmack liability as provided in item.if carmack liability is not selected,carrier liability for loss or damages to shipments within the united states and canada is limited to the lesser of the actual value of the cargo so lost or damaged,or a maximum of two hundred thousand dollars per truckload shipment.
item of the tariff states 
title provides for full value liability and other liability terms for the carrier and shipper regarding loss and damage to cargo.in order for the full liability terms of the provision to apply to any shipment transported by carrier the shipper must comply with all of the following requirements 
the shipper must notify carrier no less than hours prior to pickup of the shipment for transportation that the shipper chooses carmack liability protection.
the shipper must have prepaid the carmack liability rate which is computed as a the rate quoted to shipper in writing,or in the absence of a specific written quotation,the rate contained in carrier standard rate matrix,plus b two hundred fifty percent of said rate.
the shipping instructions on the bill of lading or shipping document must specifically note a that the shipment is moving under full liability terms,and b that the shipment is subject to carmack liability rates.
emphasis in original.nextel never requested full liability coverage from westwind for any shipment.thus,westwind never requested full liability coverage from transpro,which never invoked the provisions of item in werner tariff.nextel insured the full value of all its shipments through ace.
on october,a shipment of cell phones valued at approximately was stolen from one of werner trucks.at nextel request,the lost shipment was carried under a motorola manifest signed by the werner driver.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ace as to liability for the lost shipment.however,the district court also granted werner motion for summary judgment as to limitation of liability and entered a judgment in the amount of ace appeals the latter ruling.
ii.discussion 
two supreme court precedents go a long way toward resolving this dispute.first,we will discuss these decisions and the manner in which they foreclose many of ace arguments.we then turn to the requirements under the carmack amendment to limit liability.finally,we discuss the appropriate rate of prejudgment interest 
cargo owners are bound by liability limitations negotiated between an intermediary and a carrier 
in norfolk southern railway kirby,the supreme court set an efficient default rule for liability limitations in carriage contracts when an intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport goods,the cargo owner recovery against the carrier is limited by the liability limitation to which the intermediary and carrier agreed,d.kirby hired international cargo control icc to arrange for the shipment of machinery from australia to huntsville,alabama.kirby accepted a contractual liability limitation in icc bill of lading.id.at.at.then,icc hired hamburg sud to transport the cargo from australia to savannah and on to huntsville,and accepted an even greater limitation of liability in hamburg sud bill of lading.next,hamburg sud hired norfolk railway to transport the machinery from savannah to huntsville.a himalaya clause extended the limited liability in hamburg sud bill of lading to norfolk maritime law governed all the contracts.the norfolk train derailed causing extensive damage to the cargo.kirby sued norfolk for the full value of its loss.norfolk invoked the limitation of liability in hamburg sud bill of lading.id.at.at.applying its default rule,the court held that the limitation of liability in hamburg sud bill of lading bound kirby.id.at.at.in doing so,the court sought to eliminate the need for carriers to commit time and effort investigating long chains of parties and agreements,thereby potentially causing higher shipping rates.id.at.at.furthermore,the court found the rule equitable.id.at.at.kirby retained the option to sue icc under the terms it negotiated in icc bill of lading.id.
the supreme court expressly derived its holding from great northern railway.see kirby,at.at.employed the boyd transfer company to arrange for the shipment of some of her personal effects from minnesota to oregon.the boyd company used great northern to transport the cargo.great northern tariff stated that household goods with a value not to exceed per hundredweight were shipped at a rate of per hundredweight.the railroad bill of lading,signed by the boyd company,indicated that cargo was shipped on the rate and released at a value of per hundredweight.the goods were lost en route and sued great northern to recover their full value.great northern invoked the limitation of liability in its tariff and bill of lading.great northern,at.at.the court held that the carrier had the right to assume that the transfer company could agree upon the terms of the shipment.id.at.at.the plaintiff remedy for loss beyond the amount of the limitation was against the boyd company.id.
these cases guide us to dispose of and foreclose several of ace arguments,as follows.first,kirby teaching is not limited to maritime law.kirby expressly derived its holding from great northern,a case furthermore,the principles of fairness and efficiency animating the kirby rule are not unique to the maritime context.as evidenced by the circumstances of this case,contracts for carriage on land as well as sea may involve extended chains of parties and agreements.thus,the benefits of allowing carriers to rely on limitations of liability negotiated by intermediaries are equally as great here as under maritime law.
second,westwind failure to negotiate a liability limitation with transpro does not affect the application of the kirby rule.in kirby,each intermediary negotiated a limitation of liability with the party immediately downstream.see kirby,at.at.here,transpro and westwind did not negotiate a limitation of liability.as a consequence,ace argues that contracts downstream from this gap can not be imputed back to nextel.however,the holding in kirby did not depend on each party negotiation of a liability limitation.in fact,the rule expressly made such interactions irrelevant.carriers do not need to investigate upstream contracts.they are entitled to assume that the party entrusted with goods may negotiate a limitation of liability.to hold otherwise would defeat the principle of efficiency that motivated the kirby holding.moreover,this again produces an equitable result.the cargo owner retains the option to sue the intermediary who failed to protect itself by negotiating a liability limitation.
ace relies heavily on atkins machinery ch powell,d,to bolster its argument.however,atkins provides no support for ace position in atkins,the plaintiff contracted with a freight forwarder to make arrangements for the transportation of some of its machinery.the freight forwarder contracted with consol line dml to charter space on an american president lines apl vessel.apl hired cooper,cooper to perform stevedore services.cooper negligently damaged the machinery.the plaintiff sued cooper to recover damages.cooper sought to limit its liability under the terms of apl standard bill of lading.id.at.the district court rejected this argument because cooper failed to show that dml and apl intended apl standard bill of lading to apply to the handling of the particular machinery that was damaged.id.at.in fact,the district court found that there was no evidence dml and apl negotiated any limitation of liability with respect to this particular machinery.thus,atkins stands for the unremarkable proposition that cooper could not limit its liability under a contract none of the parties ever agreed would govern the handling of the cargo at issue.in other words,cooper was entitled to no limitation of liability where cooper had no contract nor was a beneficiary of any contract entitling it to do so.
ace makes a strained attempt to argue that this opinion,decided after kirby,supports the assertion that each intermediary must negotiate a limitation of liability.just as dml and apl failed to negotiate a limitation of liability,ace argues that westwind and transpro also failed to negotiate for a limitation.according to ace,because transpro failed to negotiate a limitation of liability with westwind,transpro was no longer empowered under traditional agency principles to negotiate a limitation of liability with werner.atkins does not stand for such a sweeping proposition,which,as discussed above,would be squarely inconsistent with the holding and rationale of kirby.atkins merely states the common sense rule that in order to limit a cargo owner recovery the intermediary and the carrier must agree to some limitation of liability.
b.a carrier must give a cargo owner or its intermediary a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability 
under the carmack amendment,a carrier of property in interstate commerce is liable for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by the carrier.a.however,a carrier may limit its liability to a value established by written or electronic declaration of the shipper or by written agreement between the carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.id.c a.the eleventh circuit uses a inquiry to determine whether a carrier has effectively limited its liability under the carmack amendment.a carrier must maintain a tariff within the prescribed guidelines of the interstate commerce commission,give the shipper a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability,obtain the shipper agreement as to the choice of liability,and issue a receipt or bill of lading prior to moving the shipment.sassy doll creations,watkins motor lines,cir ace claims that werner did not meet the second element of this test.we disagree.
in sassy doll,the reasonable opportunity to choose was also in dispute there,the shipper brought an action against the carrier to recover damages for the full value of a lost shipment of perfume.id.at.the carrier tariff required the shipper to indicate in writing on the bill of lading the total dollar amount of excess liability coverage requested.the bill of lading contained a declared value box,where the shipper filled in the actual value of the perfume however,the bill of lading did not contain a section for the shipper to insert a request for additional coverage.id.at.accordingly,this court found forcing the shipper to express a choice where there is no proper place to do so is not providing the shipper with a reasonable opportunity to choose.id.at.
relying on this authority,ace argues to the requirement of sassy doll that the shipper must have an opportunity to choose a higher level of bta gave the carrier,rather than the shipper,the power to assume a higher amount of coverage.according to ace,this is the same type of illusory choice seen in sassy doll.ace relies on paragraph of the bta,which states carrier maximum liability for loss or damage to cargo shall not in any event exceed two hundred thousand dollars per truckload shipment unless a higher degree of liability is specifically assumed in writing by an authorized representative of carrier.however,we do not read the bta as ace urges.paragraph must be read in conjunction with paragraph,which incorporates the terms of werner tariff.the tariff states that shippers may,at their option,select liability coverage for loss or damage to cargo as set forth in carmack liability as provided in item.these terms can be readily reconciled.thus,under the bta,the shipper is given the opportunity to elect full liability coverage by completing the steps listed in item of the tariff,paying the increased freight rate and obtaining the carrier authorization in writing.contrary to ace argument,in this case it is the shipper or transpro,the shipper agent to select limited liability pursuant to kirby who ultimately has the power to elect higher coverage the carrier simply has the right to approve the request and charge a correspondingly higher rate.
we also disagree with ace assertion that the shipping document itself must include the choice of rates in order for the shipper to have a reasonable opportunity to choose between them.our decision in siren,estes express lines,cir,forecloses this argument.in siren,the shipper sued the carrier for the full value of a lost shipment of razor blades.the shipper prepared the bill of lading.it indicated that the shipment would travel under class,a designation com
