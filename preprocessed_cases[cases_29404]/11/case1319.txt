the supreme court vacated our prior decision in this antitrust case,metronet serv u s west communications,cir,and remanded for further consideration in light of its recent decision in verizon communications law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d.qwest metronet serv,d.qwest,formerly u s west communications,is the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec serving the state of washington after qwest offered volume discounts on phone services to businesses with more than phone lines,metronet services and metronet telemanagement collectively metronet began purchasing those services from qwest and reselling them to small businesses with or fewer phone lines.metronet received the volume discounts by aggregating the phone lines of these small businesses.in,in order to eliminate resale of its services,qwest changed the pricing structure of its calling features and required that customers have at least lines at each location in order to receive the volume discount.
in,metronet filed suit alleging that qwest violated section of the sherman act by illegally maintaining a monopoly over the market for small business local telephone services in the area,and by denying metronet access to an essential facility after metronet and qwest engaged in settlement discussions,metronet moved to enforce a written,unsigned settlement agreement.the district court denied the motion and subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of qwest on the remaining antitrust claims.in our original decision,we reversed the grant of summary judgment and affirmed the denial of metronet motion to enforce its settlement agreement with qwest.
in light of verizon,we now affirm summary judgment in favor of qwest.metronet can not prove an essential facilities claim,because the telecommunications act of,stat,et.act,provides the means for metronet to obtain access to qwest local exchange network.in addition,qwest change in pricing in order to eliminate arbitrage does not amount to exclusionary conduct under the supreme court refusal to deal precedents as interpreted by verizon.finally,we decline to expand antitrust liability to encompass metronet claims because of their novel nature,the existence of a regulatory structure designed to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm and the record of the regulatory agency attentiveness to the anticompetitive conduct alleged in this antitrust suit.
factual and procedural background 
qwest sells two types of business phone services relevant to this antitrust suit local exchange called and centrex.centrex consists of two components multiple telephone line access that allows a company employees to make internal calls using a extension and external calls via the qwest central office switch the access component,and calling features such as call forwarding,call waiting and call hold the features component although each component is priced separately,qwest sells them as one bundled service,requiring customers who buy one component to buy the other as well 
qwest originally developed centrex for the large business market as an alternative to private branch exchange pbx,a switch owned by large businesses and located on their property qwest initially offered volume discounts to large businesses with more than phone lines.small businesses with or fewer lines could purchase centrex without the discount,or purchase lines from qwest as well as features for an additional fee 
qwest priced centrex on a per system basis,based on the number of phone lines included in the centrex package,regardless of whether those lines ran to a single location or multiple,separate locations.this system pricing scheme allowed resellers to receive the volume discounts by aggregating the telephone lines of several variously located small businesses.as early as,metronet and other resellers began purchasing volume discounted centrex lines from qwest and reselling them to aggregations of small businesses,each with lines or fewer.metronet sold centrex at a price above what it cost metronet to purchase centrex from qwest but below what metronet customers would have had to pay for lines plus features.
by,qwest had taken note of the significant resale market for centrex created by the differential pricing of centrex and lines.qwest sought to introduce a new version of centrex,centrex plus,with a pricing structure designed to eliminate or reduce the arbitrage between centrex and lines.under the new per location pricing structure,qwest required customers to have more than lines at each location in order to receive a volume discount for the service to that location.because the resellers customers have or fewer lines,qwest shift to per location pricing eliminated the resellers ability to obtain the centrex volume discounts.
the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc is authorized to regulate the rates,services,facilities and practices of telecommunications companies in the state of washington.qwest filed tariff changes with the wutc for the new per location pricing structure,which would apply not only to the features component of centrex,but also to the access component the wutc conditionally approved per location pricing of centrex plus on november,and finally approved it on november.however,a year and a half later,on april,the wutc abolished per location pricing and ordered that system pricing be reinstated.qwest viewed the wutc order as exasperating dramatically the existing revenue arbitrage situation and appealed.the washington supreme court upheld the wutc order.u s west communications.utils.transp.comm n.
in december,with system pricing back in place,qwest concluded that 
the current washington tariff structure for centrex plus,and features offers a profitable,relatively low risk opportunity for centrex resellers to win significant market share of customers mainly small business in washington.in essence,it appears that resellers can operate with positive margins while reselling centrex at anywhere from to percent discounts to lines,not including features.
qwest estimated that it was losing more than in revenues per month to metronet and other resellers,and that the revenue loss was having a significantly negative impact on profitability.in addition to these financial concerns,qwest was greatly troubled that the loss of its direct relationship with customers due to resale would deprive it of the opportunity to additional products and services.qwest concluded that no existing or forthcoming product effectively addresses centrex resale competition,and set about developing strategies to win back market share.on april,qwest filed a price list with the wutc reinstating per location pricing for the features component of centrex.this later imposition of per location pricing is the subject of the present suit.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.balint carson city,cir en banc.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there exist any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.id.we may not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter rather,we may determine only whether there is a genuine issue for trial.id.at.
iii.essential facilities 
metronet claims that qwest denied resellers like metronet access to its local exchange network,an essential facility,by eliminating opportunities for centrex resale.the essential facilities doctrine imposes on the owner of a facility that can not reasonably be duplicated and which is essential to competition in a given market a duty to make that facility available to its competitors on a nondiscriminatory basis.ferguson greater pocatello chamber of commerce,cir.in order to prevail on its essential facilities claim,metronet must prove that qwest is a monopolist in control of an essential facility,that metronet,as qwest competitor,is unable reasonably or practically to duplicate the facility that qwest has refused to provide metronet access to the facility and that it is feasible for qwest to provide such access see city of anaheim cal.edison,cir.
even though the essential facilities doctrine is followed in this and other circuits,the supreme court has never recognized such a doctrine.verizon.at.in verizon,the court found no need either to recognize the doctrine or to repudiate it because the court concluded that the plaintiff could not state a claim under the doctrine.id.the court reasoned the indispensable requirement for invoking the doctrine is the unavailability of access to the essential facilities where access exists,the doctrine serves no purpose.id.thus,essential facility claims should be denied where a state or federal agency has effective power to compel sharing and to regulate its scope and terms.id.quoting areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,at supp.
the court reasoning in verizon compels affirmance of the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to metronet essential facilities claim.metronet can not establish the first element of its claim,because the act provides the wutc with the effective power to compel qwest to share its local exchange network with competitors.specifically,under the act,a requesting competitive local exchange carrier clec can obtain access to an incumbent carrier network in three ways i t can purchase local telephone services at wholesale rates for resale to end users it can lease elements of the ilec network on an unbundled basis and it can interconnect its own facilities with the ilec network.at t iowa utils,d see c.the incumbent carrier can negotiate an agreement with the competitive carrier without regard to the duties it would otherwise have under c,but if private negotiations fail,either party can petition the relevant state commission to arbitrate unresolved issues.see at t,at.thus,t he act extensive provision for access makes it unnecessary to impose a judicial doctrine of forced access.verizon.at see covad communications bellsouth,cir where a state or federal agency is authorized to compel access to a competitor infrastructure,as under the act,verizon states that an essential facilities claim should be denied.
metronet contends that the compelled sharing provisions of the act are irrelevant here because they have no effect on metronet resale business.this argument misapprehends the purpose of the essential facilities doctrine.the doctrine makes a facility that is essential to competition in a given market available to competitors so that they may compete in that market.a facility is essential only if it is otherwise unavailable and can not be reasonably or practically replicated.city of anaheim,at emphasis added.the doctrine does not guarantee competitors access to the essential facility in the most profitable manner.even assuming that metronet can no longer profitably buy centrex in the retail market and resell it to small businesses,metronet can still obtain access to qwest local exchange network through the compelled sharing provisions of the act.see c.because reasonable access to the essential facility if not in a way that is conducive to metronet existing business can not establish an essential facilities claim.
metronet also argues that the wutc has no effective power to compel sharing due to the realities of the regulatory scheme.metronet relies on testimony by its expert that qwest has considerable latitude in setting prices because of the wutc limited statutory authority,limited resources and other constraints of the regulatory process.even were we to credit this testimony and find that the wutc is unable to regulate prices,this would not show that the wutc lacks effective power to compel sharing.the wutc statutory authority to compel sharing stems from the same act provisions that the court relied upon in verizon to reject the plaintiff essential facilities argument.see verizon.at.moreover,the record shows that qwest has entered into an interconnection agreement with metronet and that other telecommunications carriers have successfully petitioned the wutc to arbitrate and approve interconnection agreements with qwest.thus,we conclude that the wutc has the effective power to compel sharing under the act.
iv.monopolization 
we must also consider the impact of verizon on metronet monopolization claim under section of the sherman act.see making it illegal to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states.to prevail on this claim,metronet must prove that qwest possessed monopoly power in the relevant market,wilfully acquired or maintained that power through exclusionary conduct and caused antitrust injury.see am.prof l testing,harcourt brace jovanovich legal prof l publ ns,cir.verizon does not address the meaning of monopoly power or antitrust injury,but does examine the element of exclusionary conduct see verizon.at.
refusal to deal 
the court in verizon stated that as a general matter there is no duty to aid competitors.id.at.it articulated three reasons for this general proposition.first,c ompelling firms to share the source of their advantage is in some tension with the underlying purpose of antitrust law,since it may lessen the incentive for the monopolist,the rival,or both to invest in those economically beneficial facilities.id.at.second,e nforced sharing also requires antitrust courts to act as central planners,identifying the proper price,quantity,and other terms of role for which they are illsuited.id.third,compelling negotiation between competitors may facilitate the supreme evil of antitrust collusion.id.
although recognizing that u nder certain circumstances,a refusal to cooperate with rivals can constitute anticompetitive conduct and violate,the court noted that it has been very cautious in recognizing such exceptions.id.the court concluded that verizon did not fit within the existing exceptions carved out by aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d,or otter tail power united states,d.
in aspen skiing,the defendant owned three of the four mountains in the aspen,colorado ski area,and the plaintiff owned the fourth mountain.they had jointly offered for many years a,ticket that gave skiers admission to all of the mountains the joint ticket.aspen skiing,at.the joint ticket was often cheaper than purchasing multiple tickets.id.at.revenues from the joint ticket were divided between the parties according to the relative percentage that buyers with the joint ticket used each mountain.id.the defendant decided to discontinue the joint ticket by giving the plaintiff an offer that it could not accept the defendant would continue participating in the joint ticket only if the plaintiff agreed to receive a fixed percentage of joint ticket revenues that was considerably lower than the historical average based on actual usage of the fourth mountain.id.at.after the plaintiff rejected the offer,the defendant sold a joint ticket featuring only its three mountains.id.at.the plaintiff attempted to market its own,package by offering ski passes to the fourth mountain along with vouchers,each equal to the retail price of a ticket to one of the defendant mountains.id.at.the defendant refused to accept these vouchers and to sell any lift tickets to the plaintiff at retail price.the supreme court upheld a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff on its claim that the defendant had monopolized the market for downhill skiing services in aspen.id.at.
in verizon,the court explained aspen skiing in this way 
the court found significance in the defendant decision to cease participation in a cooperative venture.the unilateral termination of a voluntary and thus presumably profitable course of dealing suggested a willingness to forsake profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.similarly,the defendant unwillingness to renew the ticket even if compensated at retail price revealed a distinctly anticompetitive bent.
verizon.at citations omitted.the court then distinguished verizon from aspen skiing.because there were no allegations that verizon had voluntarily engaged in a course of dealing with its rivals,or would ever have done so absent statutory compulsion,verizon prior conduct shed no light upon the motivation of its refusal to whether its regulatory lapses were prompted not by competitive zeal but by anticompetitive malice.id.at.the court also observed that i n aspen skiing,what the defendant refused to provide to its competitor was a product that it already sold at retail,whereas in verizon,the services allegedly withheld are not otherwise marketed or available to the public.id.thus,the court conclude d that verizon alleged insufficient assistance in the provision of service to rivals is not a recognized antitrust claim under this court existing precedents.see also covad,at.
metronet attempts to fit the present case into aspen skiing exception to the general no duty to deal rule.although this case is similar in certain respects,it does not fit comfortably in the aspen skiing mold.the circumstances that verizon found significant for creating antitrust liability are not present here.
the first fact found relevant in verizon was the unilateral termination of a voluntary and profitable course of dealing.verizon.at.in the court view,this fact suggested a willingness to forsake profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.id.here,although qwest voluntarily sold centrex to its customers,including resellers like metronet,on a per system price from to,qwest attempted to change this prior course of dealing after it realized that the resale of centrex by metronet and others was having a significantly negative impact on its own profitability.hence,qwest was not forsaking profits by switching from system pricing to per location pricing,but rather was attempting to increase its profits.qwest termination of its prior course of dealing therefore sheds no light upon whether qwest was prompted not by competitive zeal but by anticompetitive malice.id.
the second fact in aspen skiing to which verizon attached significance was the defendant refusal to sell tickets to the plaintiff even if compensated at retail price,thus suggesting a calculation that its future monopoly retail price would be higher.id.similar to the unilateral termination of a prior profitable course of dealing,the defendant refusal to sell to the plaintiff at the prevailing retail price,in the court view,indicated a willingness to sacrifice benefits in order to obtain higher profits in the long run from the exclusion of competition.see aspen skiing,at.here,qwest has been willing to sell and has sold centrex to metronet at its retail price.however,qwest has set its retail price in a way that has made it unprofitable for metronet to buy and resell centrex thus,qwest per location pricing is analogous to the offer that the defendant in aspen skiing made to the offer that the defendant anticipated would not be profitable for the plaintiff to accept.an offer to deal with a competitor only on unreasonable terms and conditions can amount to a practical refusal to deal.hudson ry.consol.rail,cir holding that even if there is no outright refusal to deal,a denial of an essential facility can occur if the terms of the offer to deal are unreasonable.
nonetheless,qwest choice to switch to per location pricing does not have the same economic significance as the defendant refusal to sell to the plaintiff at the retail price in aspen skiing.qwest switch to per location pricing does not entail a sacrifice of benefits.rather,it enables qwest to maintain a price discrimination structure established before resellers entered the market for local telephone services because qwest voluntarily implemented the volume discount pricing structure before centrex resale began to undercut its sales to small businesses,that pricing structure was presumably maximizing qwest profits.therefore,by price discriminating through per location pricing,qwest has not set its retail price at an unprofitable level in the short run merely to exclude competition in the long run.
the third fact the court emphasized in verizon was that the defendants in aspen skiing and otter tail refused to provide to their competitors products that were already sold in a retail market to other customers.verizon.at.the importance of this fact relates to the court concern about the administrability of a judicial remedy.one of the reasons for a general no duty to deal rule is that enforced sharing requires antitrust courts to act as central planners,identifying the proper price,quantity,and other terms of role for which they are.id.at.if the defendant already sells the product in an existing market to certain customers but merely refuses to sell to its competitors,the court can impose a judicial remedy that does not require the court to assume the controls characteristic of a regulatory agency.id.at quoting areeda,essential facilities an epithet in need of limiting principles,antitrust.the court can simply order the defendant to deal with its competitors on the same terms that it already deals with others in the existing retail market,without setting the terms of dealing.in contrast,if the defendant does not already provide the product in an existing market or otherwise make it available to the public,the court will have to delineate the defendant sharing obligations,and a n antitrust court is unlikely to be an effective enforcer of these detailed sharing obligations.id.
in this case,centrex is a service already sold in a retail market.qwest,however,has not refused to sell this retail service to metronet,but has sold it to metronet on the same terms that it sells to direct consumers like direct consumers,metronet must have more than lines at the same location in order to receive a volume discount on centrex features.thus,metronet is essentially asking this court to identify the proper price that qwest should charge in the retail role the supreme court has deemed courts ill suited to perform.id.at.
in sum,metronet does not fall within the aspen skiing exception to the general no duty to deal rule,because qwest switch to per location pricing does not entail a sacrifice of profits for gain from the exclusion of competition and because qwest has not refused to deal with metronet on the same terms that it deals with direct consumers.therefore,metronet does not have an actionable antitrust claim under the supreme court existing refusal to deal precedents as explained and limited by verizon.
elimination of arbitrage 
in our previous decision,we did not rely on the existing refusal to deal doctrine to conclude that qwest could be liable under the sherman act for monopolization.metronet,at.instead,analogizing to cases which had condemned collaborative efforts to eliminate discounters,we extended antitrust liability to qwest unilateral attempt to eliminate discount resellers like metronet.id.at.verizon teaches,however,thatthe regulatory context is an important consideration in deciding whether to recognize an expansion of the contours of.verizon.at to determine whether we should expand the contours of section liability in a regulated industry,we must weigh the benefits of antitrust intervention against a realistic assessment of its costs.id.at.
with regard to the benefits of antitrust intervention,we recognize that imposing antitrust liability on sellers who unilaterally attempt to eliminate resellers can deter attempts to eliminate arbitrage that is beneficial to consumer welfare.a reseller can engage in arbitrage when a seller price discriminates among its consumers.in particular,if a seller charges a higher price to some consumers the disfavored consumers and a lower price to others the favored consumers,a reseller can take advantage of this price differential by buying the product or service at the lower price intended for the favored consumers and reselling it to the disfavored consumers at a price below the price the seller charges the disfavored consumers.see areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed.
prohibiting sellers from eliminating arbitrage thus can enhance consumer welfare under certain conditions.for instance,if the seller increase in profits from a greater number of sales due to the discounted price outweighs the loss in profits from the decrease in sales at the higher price due to customers switching to the reseller,the seller would find it profitable to continue to offer the product or service at a discounted price despite the presence of arbitrage and an inability to eliminate it.consequently,favored consumers wou
