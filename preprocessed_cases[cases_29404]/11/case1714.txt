a person receiving medical treatment at a hospital emergency room who pays for it out of pocket can be charged substantially more for that care than one who is covered by a either a program or private insurance.this case concerns whether one can maintain an action challenging this variable pricing practice under the unfair competition law ucl bus.code,the consumer legal remedies act clra civ.code,et,or for declaratory relief code civ.while most of the claims asserted by plaintiff gene moran lack merit,we conclude he has sufficiently alleged facts supporting a conclusion he has standing to claim the amount of the charges defendants hospital bills patients is unconscionable.therefore,we reverse the trial court judgment of dismissal in this case.
background 
on three occasions in october,plaintiff,a patient,went to the emergency room of a hospital owned and operated by defendants prime healthcare management,prime healthcare services,prime healthcare foundation,and prime healthcare huntington beach,llc.each time,he signed a preprinted conditions of admission agreement contract and received medical treatment.subsequently,plaintiff received bills from the hospital for the treatment provided during the three visits that exceeded 
in november,plaintiff filed this putative class action against defendants.the initial complaint stated causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violation of the ucl,restitutionary relief under the clra,and declaratory relief.plaintiff subsequently dropped the first and second counts.his first amended complaint also expanded the scope of the clra cause of action to include a request for damages by alleging that he complied with the statutory requirement of giving defendants notice of the purportedly unlawful practice and a demand for correction of it.although verbose,confusing,containing contradictory allegations,and contentions of law,each iteration of the complaint is based on allegations the rates defendants charge patients are discriminatory,exceed the reasonable value of the treatment,and are artificially inflated and grossly excessive.
defendants demurred to the first and the second amended complaints,arguing the counts in each pleading failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action.the trial court sustained both demurrers with leave to amend.plaintiff filed a third amended complaint tac,again stating causes of action for violations of the ucl,clra,and declaratory relief.
attached to the tac was one of the contracts plaintiff signed.the contract contains several paragraphs relevant to a patient financial obligation for medical treatment and services.however,the tac primarily focuses on only two of these clauses.paragraph states in part i understand that i am responsible to the hospital and physician s for all reasonable charges,listed in the hospital charge description master and if applicable the hospital charity care and discount payment policies and state and federal law incurred by me and not paid by third party benefits.paragraph provides you may be eligible for the charity care and discounted payment program.please contact the business office.copies of the hospital charity care and discounted payment policies manual and forms are attached to the tac.the tac alleges n othing in the contract requires a patient apply for financial assistance and mentions several reasons why a person would not want to do so.
although not mentioned in his prior pleadings,the tac also alleges that,before receiving bills,plaintiff sent correspondence to the hospital,informing it that he was currently unemployed and uninsured and asking that the hospital take into consideration my financial status of being unemployed and not having insurance in addressing the bill,and expressing his desire to take care of this immediately with what he had available right now,not knowing what his future monetary situation will be during this recession.according to the tac,the hospital never responded to plaintiff correspondence.
defendants demurred to the tac,again arguing each of its counts failed to state a cause of action.this time,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,primarily concluding plaintiff had failed to allege sufficient facts to establish his standing to maintain the action.

this case involves an appeal from a judgment for defendants entered after the trial court sustained their demurrer to plaintiff tac without leave to amend.
our scope of review is well established.in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.blank kirwan cal d.

background 
plaintiff first cause of action seeks restitutionary and injunctive relief under the ucl.
the tac alleges defendants contract violates the ucl on several grounds.it alleges the charges billed to patients seeking emergency care are discriminatory because emergency care patients signing the contract reasonably expected and relied on the reasonable belief that they would be billed at the same rates as those applicable to other patients signing the same contract and receiving similar emergency.the tac also asserts patients reasonably expected to be billed at rates which reflected no more than the reasonable value of the treatment and services,and were not expecting to be billed at the artificial and grossly excessive rates for which they were subsequently billed.another claim is that defendants fail to inform conceal from patients the uniform policy of charging them the higher rates.
business and professions code section declares unfair competition includes any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.cases have recognized the unfair competition law scope is broad,covering anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th.in addition,b ecause business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair competition acts or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.ibid.
however,c ourts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor,supra,cal th at.thus,i n any unfair competition case,requires us to engage in a process.first,we determine whether the legislature has provided a safe harbor for the defendant alleged conduct.if not,we determine whether that conduct is unfair.mccann lucky money,th,supra,cal th at.
a further constraint on ucl actions limits an action by a private party to one who meets the standing requirements.bus.code.thus,to maintain a private enforcement action under the ucl,a plaintiff must be a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.bus.code.
the safe harbor defense 
defendants contend plaintiff can not maintain his ucl cause of action because the hospital variable pricing regimen has been legislatively endorsed.we conclude this argument has only partial merit.
in,supra,cal th,the supreme court recognized the safe harbor doctrine,does not prohibit an action under the unfair competition law merely because some other statute on the subject does not,itself,provide for the action or prohibit the challenged conduct.to forestall an action under the unfair competition law,another provision must actually bar the action or clearly permit the conduct.there is a difference between not making an activity unlawful,and making that activity lawful.id.at.
as for plaintiff discriminatory pricing claim,we conclude the safe harbor defense applies.business and professions code section,subdivision f,states t he legislature finds and declares that the public interest in ensuring that citizens of this state receive health care coverage in the most efficient and manner possible is furthered by permitting negotiations for alternative rate contracts between purchasers or payers of health care services,and institutional and professional providers,or through a person or entity acting for,or on behalf of,a purchaser,payer,or provider.also business and professions code section,subdivision c states,a differential in price for any article or product as between any customers in different functional classifications is not prohibited by the unfair practices act.these statutes permit the use of variable pricing.thus,to the extent plaintiff alleges defendants violated the ucl by discriminatorily charging patients more than patients covered by government programs or private insurance,his argument fails.
however,as noted above,plaintiff further argues he expected to pay either the same amount for the medical services provided as other patients receiving the same treatment or only the reasonable value of those services,but was billed at what he describes as artificial and grossly excessive rates.defendants claim the hospital fair pricing act health saf.code,et defeats this latter allegation.
the hospital fair pricing act requires licensed hospitals to maintain and administer an understandable written policy regarding discount payments for financially qualified patients as well as an understandable written charity care policy and details mandatory requirements for the policy.health saf.code,subd.a a.the act further provides it shall not be construed to prohibit a hospital from uniformly imposing charges from its established charge schedule or published rates,nor shall this article preclude the recognition of a hospital established charge schedule or published rates for purposes of applying any payment limit.health saf.code.but it also declares t he rights,remedies,and penalties established by this article are cumulative,and shall not supersede the rights,remedies,or penalties established under other laws.health saf.code.
thus,the hospital fair pricing act imposes on licensed hospitals the requirement that they establish,give notice of,and administer financial aid and charity care policies,and allows a hospital to bill for treatment and services based on its own schedule of fees.however,it does not preclude claims based on what a patient allegedly expected to pay or authorize costs that are allegedly exorbitant.consequently,the act neither bar s an action under the ucl,nor does it clearly permit a hospital to charge emergency care patients artificial and grossly excessive rates,supra,cal th at.
unlawful acts or practices 
plaintiff ucl cause of action sought recovery on all three grounds listed in business and professions code section.the applicability of each variety of unfair competition is governed by different legal standards.we consider each ground separately.
under the unlawful prong,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and makes those unlawful practices actionable under the ucl.citation.thus,a violation of another law is a predicate for stating a cause of action under the ucl unlawful prong.berryman merit property management,th.
to support the unlawful prong plaintiff alleges,defendants billing and collection practices violate d the clra as set forth in the tac second cause of action.the latter count is based on four grounds defendants acts and practices constitute misrepresentations that the services supplies in question had characteristics uses benefits which they did not have civ.code,subd.a defendants acts and practices constitute misleading statements of fact concerning reasons for,existence of,or amounts of price reductions civ.code,subd.a defendants represent ed that a transaction involves obligations which it does not have or involve,or which are prohibited by law civ.code,subd.a and defendants insert ed an unconscionable provision into their contracts civ.code,subd.a.
as noted,to support a private action under the ucl,plaintiff needs to allege standing.bus.code.to satisfy the narrower standing requirements imposed by the enactment of business and professions code section,a party must now establish a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact,economic injury,and show that that economic injury was the result of,caused by,the unfair business practice or false advertising that is the gravamen of the claim.kwikset superior court cal th,sarun dignity health th,sarun.
plaintiff argues he satisfied the standing requirement because he received a bill from defendants,paid a portion of that bill,and until defendants later unilaterally returned his payment and eliminated all charges,remained liable on the balance.this allegation supports plaintiff claim that he suffered the requisite economic injury required to maintain a private enforcement action under the ucl.although defendants had not begun any collection activity,the existence of an enforceable obligation,without more,ordinarily constitutes actual injury or injury in fact.sarun dignity health,supra,th at see kwikset superior court,supra,cal th at recognizing a monetary payment in response to an unlawful debt collection demand constitutes economic injury.
but the first three grounds cited in the tac supporting the unlawful prong of the ucl cause of action involve allegations of misrepresentation.to satisfy the causation element under the unlawful prong of the ucl,in which the predicate unlawful conduct is based on misrepresentations,a plaintiff must show actual reliance on the alleged misrepresentation,rather than a mere factual nexus between the business conduct and the consumer injury.durell sharp healthcare th,hale sharp healthcare th,hale.
the decision in durell presents an analogous situation.that case also involved a patient lacking health insurance coverage who went to the defendants hospital emergency room on several occasions,each time signing an admissions agreement that obligated him to pay the usual and customary charges for services.durell sharp healthcare,supra,th at.after being billed for the hospital full standard rates,durell sued.in part,he alleged the hospital disparate billing practices that required uninsured patients to pay its full standard rate for medical care while patients covered by government programs and private insurance paid a lesser amount constituted an unlawful business practice.to support this claim,durell alleged the defendants pricing policy violated provisions of clra all of which involved making a false or misleading representation.
the court of appeal affirmed a judgment dismissing the action after sustaining the defendants demurrer to the second amended complaint.the appellate court held,a consumer burden of pleading causation in a ucl action should hinge on the nature of the alleged wrongdoing rather than the specific prong of the ucl the consumer invokes.durell sharp healthcare,supra,th at.it cited the california supreme court decision in in re tobacco ii cases cal th,which held business and professions code section as a result of requirement imposes an actual reliance requirement on plaintiffs prosecuting a private enforcement action under the ucl fraud prong in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th at.relying on that decision,durell held where as here,the predicate unlawfulness is misrepresentation and deception,the concept of reliance unequivocally applies.durell sharp healthcare,supra,th at.since durell d id not allege he relied on either the hospital web site representations or on the language in the agreement for services in going to the hospital or in seeking or accepting services once he was transported there,or that he ever visited the hospital web site or even ever read the agreement for services ibid,his amended complaint failed to state a cause of action under the ucl unlawful prong.durell sharp healthcare,supra,at.
in the present case,plaintiff alleged he signed defendants contract each time he visited the emergency room.while plaintiff tac asserts that he reasonably expected to be billed and to pay at the same rates as other emergency care patients signing the same contract and receiving similar emergency care,or would not be required to pay more than the reasonable value of the received,plaintiff never alleged that he actually read or relied on the contracts.nor does plaintiff allege that he relied on other oral or written representations made by defendants or any of their employees concerning how much he would be charged for the medical treatment provided to him.
plaintiff relies on the related opinion issued by the same appellate court in hale sharp healthcare,supra,th,to support his argument,plus sarun dignity health,supra,th.sarun does not help plaintiff in this context.it did not involve allegations that defendant misrepresented the nature of its medical charges.rather,sarun addressed whether an uninsured patient who had paid a portion of his bill and remained obligated to pay the balance of it had adequately alleged he suffered damage under the ucl and clra even though he failed to seek financial assistance,under the hospital discounted billing policy.sarun dignity health,supra,at.
however,hale is similar to durell and the present case.in hale,the plaintiff was admitted to the defendants hospital after signing an admission agreement obligating her to pay the hospital in accordance with its regular rates and terms.hale sharp healthcare,supra,th at.the appellate court reversed a judgment dismissing the action as to hale ucl and clra causes of action.citing the amended complaint allegation that hale signed the admission agreement,and at the time of signing the contract,she was expecting to be charged regular rates,the appellate court concluded,to the extent she is bringing a claim under the ucl,she has reasonably pled reliance.hale sharp healthcare,supra,at.in reaching this conclusion,hale rejected the defendants assertion hale would not have seen the admission agreement until after she arrived at the hospital noting i t is possible,however,for a person who has arrived at the hospital to rely on the admission agreement in deciding whether to proceed with treatment.id.at.
plaintiff tac also alleges his expectations concerning payment for the emergency medical services provided to him.but we conclude hale is distinguishable from this case and,in any event,plaintiff allegations concerning what he expected to pay for defendants medical treatment are contradicted by the agreements he signed.
first,in hale the language of the hospital admissions contract at issue in hale referred to payment at regular rates.hale sharp healthcare,supra,th at.the plaintiff challenged the hospital billing on the ground that rather than the regular rates she was expecting to pay,the hospital sent a bill for grossly excessive rates.id.at.plaintiff signed admission agreements obligating him to pay all reasonable charges,listed in the hospital charge description master and if applicable defendants charity care and discount payment policies or state and federal law incurred by me and not paid by third party benefits.it is not clear whether the phrase all reasonable charges refers to the fairness of the cost of the treatment or to the scope of that treatment.but even assuming it is the former,this paragraph is not consistent with plaintiff allegation that he reasonably expected that he would be billed at either the same rates as those applicable to other patients signing the same contract and receiving similar emergency treatment or at rates which reflected no more than the reasonable value of the treatment.
first,even assuming plaintiff actually read the contract,he can not prevail on a theory that he expected to pay the same amount as other patients covered by government programs or private insurance.as noted,plaintiff attached a copy of one of the contracts to the tac and relied on the terms of the agreement to support his expectation theories.while the allegations of a complaint must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer,the facts appearing in exhibits attached to the complaint will also be accepted as true and,if contrary to the allegations in the pleading,will be given precedence.brakke economic concepts,th,alphonzo bell bell.synd.d,conclusions of the pleader contrary to the express terms of an instrument made a part of the complaint are treated as surplusage.
in this case,plaintiff bases his claims for relief on the terms of an express contract.when interpreting a contract,a court must consider the clear and explicit language of a contract civ.code,generally construing t he words in their ordinary and popular sense unless used by the parties in a technical sense civ.code,and taking t he whole of the contract together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other civ.code.
plaintiff assertion that he expected to pay no more than patients covered by government programs or private insurance is contradicted by the language of the contracts he signed.the agreements included paragraphs requiring an insured patient to irrevocably assign his or her insurance benefits for the services and treatment rendered by the hospital and physicians,and advised an insured patient that he or she will personally responsible for payment of charges if the insurance does not cover them.another paragraph informed patients that some procedures may not be covered and authorized the hospital to release certain medical information about the patient to the social security administration for this or a related medicare claim.
paragraph itself also conflicts with plaintiff interpretation of the contract.it states a patient is obligated to pay all reasonable charges,listed in the hospital charge description master and if applicable the hospital charity care and discount payment policies and state and federal law incurred by me and not paid by third party benefits.the latter clause modifies the phrase all reasonable charges,reflecting patients covered by government programs,or receiving third party benefits,or who are eligible for either the hospital charity care or discount programs would differ from the amounts listed in the hospital charge description master.
second,as for plaintiff reasonable value claim,in the case of an express contract reasonable value applies only when the agreement does not determine the amount of consideration,nor provide the method by which it is to be ascertained.civ.code.i t is well settled that there is no equitable basis for an promise to pay reasonable value when the parties have an actual agreement covering compensation.hedging concepts,first alliance mortgage th.the actual amount plaintiff would be obligated to pay for the hospital medical treatment is not listed in the contract.but the agreements provided a means by which a patient can ascertain the amount due for the treatment and services reasonably provided.because this case involves an express contract containing a means of determining what plaintiff would have to pay for his medical care,his reliance on the reasonable value discussion in children hospital central california blue cross of california th,lacks merit.that case concerned reimbursement for services during a period when the parties did not have a contractual relationship.thus,plaintiff reliance on a reasonable value theory lacks merit.
finally,we note the tac acknowledges plaintiff did not have a reasonable expectation that he would pay no more than other patients.paragraph of the tac alleges p atients covered by insurance,including governmental and private insurance reimburse defendants based on governmentally regulated or privately negotiated rate structures rather than chargemaster rates.the tac further states,defendants chargemaster rates are not amounts which defendants expect to be paid by any category of patient.
thus,to the extent plaintiff relies on purported violations of the clra premised on misrepresentation,his claim that defendants business practice is unlawful fails because he does not allege facts supporting a finding he actually relied on or could reasonably rely on any misrepresentation in seeking medical treatment at defendants hospital.
the remaining basis cited by plaintiff for the unlawful prong of his ucl cause of action is that the contract financial liability provision is unconscionable.the tac alleged in part,plaintiff was not expecting to be billed at the artificial and grossly excessive rates for which he was subsequently billed.to support this assertion,the tac stated defendants charges for medical treatment are not tethered to their actual costs,but are four to six times those costs and far beyond any reasonable profit margin.further,it is claimed defendants charges are intended to boost hospital reimbursement rates,as well as reflect a higher level of charity contribution and financial assistance given to the local community.thus,defendants pricing,billing and collection practices have a significant detrimental impact on the large population of emergency care patients.
the unconscionability doctrine ensures that contracts,particularly contracts of adhesion,do not impose terms that have been variously described as overly harsh citation,unduly oppressive citation,so as to shock the conscience citations,or unfairly.all of these formulations point to the central idea that unconscionability doctrine is concerned not with a simple bad bargain citation,but with terms that are unreasonably favorable to the more powerful party.sanchez valencia holding,llc cal th.a claim of contractual unconscionability,has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.id.at.the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.a,moreno cal th.substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.ibid.
the contracts plaintiff signed were preprinted documents and the tac alleged all emergency room patients must sign the same document before being treated.these averments support a finding of procedural unconscionability.
as for substantive unconscionability,the price term of a contract can be the basis for relief.perdue crocker national bank cal d,morris redwood empire bancorp th.but a llegations that the price exceeds cost or fair value,standing alone,do not state a cause of action.perdue crocker national bank,supra,cal d at.the courts look to the basis and justification for the price citation,including the price actually being paid by other similarly situated consumers in a similar transaction.id.at.in addition,courts consider not only the market price,but also the cost of the goods or services to the seller citations,the inconvenience imposed on the seller citation,and the true value of the product or service.id.at morris redwood empire bancorp,supra,th at.
this case concerns the cost of medical care provided to uninsured patients visiting a defendants hospital emergency room.plaintiff has alleged that defendants charge description master rates not only far exceed the actual cost of care and provide for a large profit margin,he further maintains the purpose of defendants charging excessive costs to patients is to increase the hospital reimbursement for medical care by dramatically increasing its profit margin for treatment to persons particularly vulnerable because they are in need of emergency medical care.generally,u nconscionability is a question of law for the court,but factual issues may bear on that question.wayne staples,th,baker osborne development th.also,the legislature has mandated that w hen it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting,purpose,and effect to aid the court in making the determination.civ.code,subd.b.
to the extent plaintiff alleges the financial liability provision of defendants contract is unconscionable,we conclude he has sufficiently stated a cause of action under the unlawful prong of the ucl.
fraudulent acts or practices 
the tac enumerates several grounds supporting the fraud prong of plaintiff ucl cause of action.it alleges defendants fail ed to inform conceal ed from patients their uniform policy to bill and require payment from patients at rates higher than rates paid by other patients signing the same c ontract.other claims are the contract misrepresent ed the charge description master rates constitute reasonable charges,and attending physician s list their charges in the hospital charge description master,and that the contract contains confusing,conflicting,and unintelligible provisions.as for the contract financial aid provision,the tac avers it requires an uninsured patient,as a prerequisite to challenging the amount of a bill,to first apply for charity and financial aid programs,obligates an uninsured patient provide total strangers with extensive personal and financial information as a prerequisite for challenging a bill,but nevertheless compute s and send s out bills to such patients at the hospital charge description master rates.finally,the tac maintains defendants bill uninsured patients at charge description master rates,when the c ontract does not permit billing at such rates,and seek to collect from uninsured patients billed charges that are so excessive and unreasonable as to be unconscionable.
many of the alleged bases for plaintiff fraud theory do not involve conduct that is likely to deceive a consumer or contradict the language of the contracts he signed.also,as discussed above,the ucl fraud prong generally require s a showing that members of the public are likely to be deceived.lueras bac home loans servicing,lp th.to establish a private party standing to maintain a ucl cause of action under the fraud prong in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th,held the phrase as a result of appearing in business and professions code section imposes an actual reliance requirement on plaintiffs prosecuting a private enforcement action under the ucl fraud prong.in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th at.given our prior discussion of this issue,no basis exists to conclude plaintiff complaint supports recovery under the ucl fraud prong.
unfair acts or practices 
to support his claim under the unfair prong of the ucl,plaintiff alleges defendants fail ed to charge emergency room patients reasonable rates as required by the terms of the contract,and instead interpret ed the contracts to collect exorbitant amounts expressly prohibited under the federal tax code,and in violation of the clra,and which offend established public policies,are immoral,unethical,oppressive,and unscrupulous.
cases have employed three different criterion to determine whether a business practice is unfair under the ucl.one states an
