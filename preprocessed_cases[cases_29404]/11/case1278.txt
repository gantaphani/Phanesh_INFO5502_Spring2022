is a summary judgment determination of abandonment appropriate when the record supports an inference that the trademark small,troubled to transport and sell trademarked goods in the ordinary course of trade as part of a good faith effort to deplete inventory the answer is no,because the trademark law requires both discontinuance of all bona fide trademark use in the ordinary course of trade and an intent not to resume such use.legitimate commercial transport or sales of trademarked goods,even for a failing business,are sufficient to defeat a claim of abandonment.
ronald mallett owned federal trademark the pelican mark,consisting of the word pelican below an outline of a flying pelican in a circle,for a backpack luggage line.his business had enjoyed some modest success but later was set back by dwindling prospects.nonetheless,mallett kept plugging,selling a few backpacks and promoting them at trade shows for several years until he assigned the pelican mark to electro source,llc electro source.because he continued to transport and sell his trademarked goods in commerce,he never ceased using the pelican mark.the district court concluded,however,that mallet use of the mark while depleting his inventory was neither bona fide nor in the ordinary course of trade,and that he therefore abandoned the mark.in reaching its decision,the district court improperly weighed evidence at the summary judgment stage and applied a mistaken legal standard.we reverse the district court cancellation of the mark and its determination that mallett abandoned the pelican mark before assigning it and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,mallett began selling goods under the pelican mark.the mark was primarily designed by mallett friend tom robbins,who lived in thailand and had access to manufacturing facilities.after working out an unwritten handshake agreement,robbins agreed to manufacture pelican mark products overseas,while mallett agreed to design,market,and sell the goods in the united states.
on november,mallett filed an application to register the pelican mark with the united states patent and trademark office.in,the pelican mark issued as trademark,covering wallets,backpacks,totebags,and luggage.
mallett transported and sold goods branded with the pelican mark from through.at first,sales were promising.according to mallett,his business was building up a reputation for making quality goods,including the best backpack in the business.mallett employed sales representatives to sell his products in and.
in response to this promising trend,mallett placed a very large order with robbins in.unfortunately,sales did not meet expectations,and the inventory order was not depleted until.sales dropped sharply in and.disappointed with the sales,robbins parted ways with mallett in.
mallett suffered another setback in,undergoing multiple surgeries that spanned the entire calendar year.during this time,mallett business took a sharp turn for the worse.his flagging sales required him to fire his sales representatives,and he no longer used invoices or letterhead with the pelican mark.instead,he began making on the spot sales for cash,only some of which he documented.also,because his business failed to show a profit,he ceased to segregate the business income on his tax returns.by late,mallett was selling backpacks at a steep discount.
in,mallett took a job selling products as a commissioned salesman for various manufacturers,including no fear,billabong,and koko island.although his arrangement with koko island was subject to a agreement,mallett continued to market his remaining pelican mark inventory on the assumption that his products backpacks and totes did not compete with the koko island goods shorts,hats and shirts.
from to,mallett tried to sell pelican mark products out of the trunk of his car to koko island customers.mallett also went to a florida trade show twice a year as he had been doing since to market his products.documented sales of pelican mark goods were made during this time mallett also claims that many other undocumented cash transactions were made as well although mallett enterprise was not as successful as he had hoped,his goods always bore the pelican mark and,according to mallett,his business continued to enjoy the reputation of having the backpack.
mallett testified that he continued to sell products out of his car and travel to the florida trade show until he assigned the pelican mark,along with all the goodwill of the business,to electro source on august.in return for the assignment,electro source paid mallett and a license to use the pelican mark on certain goods,subject to maintenance of product quality.at the time of the assignment,mallett had at least ten boxes of inventory bearing the pelican mark.using his license,mallett continued to market pelican mark goods until finally,in december,he sold his remaining inventory to electro source.
pelican products,and group,collectively ppi manufacture,market,and distribute a variety of products under the trademarks pelican products,pelican,and peli products.ppi also registered the mark.electro source commenced suit against ppi in,setting forth a variety of claims,including trademark infringement of its pelican mark.ppi responded with various counterclaims and defenses alleging,among other things,that mallett had abandoned the pelican mark prior to the assignment to electro source.ppi moved for summary judgment.the district court agreed with ppi that the pelican mark had been abandoned,thus rendering the subsequent assignment to electro source ineffective.the court ordered cancellation of the pelican mark but denied ppi application for attorneys fees.electro source appeals the determination of abandonment and the cancellation order,and ppi the denial of attorneys fees.
this appeal focuses on a single legal question does the lanham act mandate a finding of trademark abandonment where the record on summary judgment supports an inference that the trademark holder persisted in exhausting excess inventory of trademarked goods at reduced prices through good faith marketing and sales,despite the decline of his business to answer this question,we begin with of the lanham act,giving its words their plain and ordinary meaning.see united states trw rifle caliber,one model serial,cir.
section of the lanham act defines trademark abandonment as requiring discontinuance of trademark use and intent not to resume such use 
the lanham act defines abandonment as discontinuance of trademark use and intent not to resume such use 
a mark shall be deemed to be abandoned if the following occurs 
when its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances.nonuse for consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment.use of a mark means the bona fide use of such mark made in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.
emphasis added.
neither bona fide use nor ordinary course of trade is defined in the statute.both phrases,however,also appear in the statute definition of use in commerce,which provides 
the term use in commerce means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.for purposes of this chapter,a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce 
on goods when 
a it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto and 
b the goods are sold or transported in commerce 
id.emphasis added.because trademark is defined under the statute in part by the bona fide intention to use it in commerce,and because both use in commerce and use for the purposes of abandonment mean bona fide use in the course of ordinary trade,the meaning of use for the purposes of abandonment necessarily signifies use in commerce and thus includes the placement of a mark on goods sold or transported.see money store harriscorp,cir construing use in the definition of abandonment in an earlier,but similar,version of the lanham act as meaning use in commerce.
section thus provides that use of a trademark defeats an allegation of abandonment when the use includes placement on goods sold or transported in commerce is bona fide is made in the ordinary course of trade and is not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.critically,for present purposes,nothing in the plain meaning of excludes from the protections of the statute use of a trademark by a struggling or even a failing business that meets these requirements.
ppi does not challenge the fact that good faith sales of goods bearing the pelican mark were made during the critical time period from,when mallett business was clearly suffering,until the pelican mark was assigned to electro source in.instead,ppi argues that those transactions were not made and could not have been bona fide trademark uses because they were not made by or in connection with any business to which goodwill accrued in light of mallett alleged intent to abandon his business after his inventory was depleted.
the district court implicitly adopted ppi formulation,which is predicated on prospective abandonment.in its summary judgment order,the district court correctly recited the elements of abandonment,but went on to weigh the evidence and find,as a matter of law,that mallett abandoned the pelican mark because mallett sales,characterized as attempts to merely rid oneself of inventory,were not bona fide uses in the ordinary course of trade.
this summary judgment conclusion was erroneous for two reasons.although it acknowledged that abandonment is generally a factual issue,see rivard linville,in resolving the issue the court weighed evidence and drew inferences against mallett as to his intent and as to what constituted sales in the ordinary course of trade.this approach contravenes the rule on summary judgment that all reasonable inferences are to be made in favor of the party.see mclaughlin liu,cir in addition,the district court did not hew to the strict statutory standard for abandonment,which requires complete discontinuance of use,even for a business on its way out.if there is continued use,a prospective intent to abandon the mark or business does not decide the issue of abandonment.
ii.section requires intent not to resume trademark use 
abandonment under requires an intent not to resume trademark use,as opposed to a prospective intent to abandon the mark in the future.this distinction is not merely semantic.an intent not to resume use presupposes that the use has already first prong of the abandonment statute.in contrast,a prospective intent to abandon says nothing about whether use of the mark has been discontinued.see exxon humble exploration,cir distinguishing intent to abandon from intent not to resume use keycorp key bank trust,d,while intent to abandon was the touchstone of legal abandonment in early common law cases,the lanham act requires a showing of intent not to resume,rather than intent to abandon.
of course,we recognize that n othing in the statute entitles a registrant who has formerly used a mark to overcome a presumption of abandonment arising from subsequent by simply averring a subjective affirmative intent not to abandon.imperial tobacco philip morris.however,a prospective declaration of intent to cease use in the future,made during a period of legitimate trademark use,does not meet the intent not to resume standard.thus,the district court collapsing of the standards was at odds with the statute.
consequently,unless the trademark use is actually terminated,the intent not to resume use prong of abandonment does not come into play.see money store,at.in money store,a trademark holder decided to stop using its trademark,yet continued to make some good faith use of the mark on billboard displays until it sold and assigned the mark.id.at.the court held t he statutory definition makes clear that abandonment requires discontinuance of use although united use of the mark may have declined by the date of the assignment,any use of the mark was in commerce and defeats abandonment.id.at.the question,then,is whether mallett ceased use of the mark before assignment,not whether mallett harbored an intent to cease use in the future.
iii.legitimate trademark use defeats abandonment 
the district court erred in failing to recognize that,as a threshold matter,abandonment requires complete cessation or discontinuance of trademark use.see see also doeblers.hybrids,at holding that a trademark was not abandoned because t he simple fact is that the use of the trademark never ceased.
our decision in,procter gamble offers a bright line rule even a single instance of use is sufficient against a claim of abandonment of a mark if such use is made in good faith,cir.in,the trademark holder made nominal sales over a period of four years in order to maintain the mark while the trademark rights were litigated in court 
during the period of the above litigation and thereafter defendant sold deodorant products with the mark sure,albeit in small quantities.defendant has not advertised or promoted sure deodorant other than by listing the product in trade directories.defendant sales of sure deodorant were not made for profit but for the purpose of continuing the business so that the sure mark would be available for use on a major advertised product when the legal problems were resolved.
we rejected the argument that the trademark had been abandoned because only nominal sales were made with the sole intent of sustaining the mark.id.at.rather,we held that the mark had not been abandoned because the trademark holder proferred sic legitimate business reasons for its action in waiting for the trademark ownership issues to be fully litigated and resolved id.at citing mendes new england duplicating,aff,cir see also drop dead johnson son,cir holding that the transport of a single trademarked product is sufficient to constitute a use in commerce.
good faith nominal or limited commercial sales of trademarked goods are sufficient,we held,to avoid abandonment,where the circumstances legitimately explained the paucity of the sales.see also anvil brand consol.foods,recognizing that circumstances may justify a proponent limited use of a mark and still permit the registrant to maintain its trademark rights,citing 
the district court did not follow principle that a single legitimate sale satisfies the use criteria of.instead the court assumed that declining sales,discounted sales,depletion of inventory,and the decision not to sue potential infringers were factors that,in combination,were tantamount to discontinuance of bona fide use in the ordinary course of trade.the court made that determination as a matter of law in the face of obvious factual disputes.
this approach suffers from two difficulties it is at odds with and reflects a rather cramped view of bona fide and the ordinary course of trade.the district court assumed,and ppi argues,that once mallett decided to discontinue his business,a fact which he disputes,and liquidate his goods bearing the pelican mark,any sales or transport of the trademarked goods were not a bona fide trademark use.the notion underlying this assumption is that goodwill can not legitimately attach to a business that may be discontinued at a later date because trademark law requires an existing business to which goodwill could attach.but that is not so.trademark use does indeed require an existing business,see siegel chicken delight,cir a does not confer upon its owner the right to prohibit a competitor use of the mark unless the owner himself uses the mark in connection with an existing business,but it does not follow that a failing,yet ongoing,business automatically abandons its mark although it is still in business even a declining business retains,may benefit from,or may continue to build its goodwill until it shuts its doors or ceases use of its marks.
alternatively,ppi argument assumes that when the decision is made to liquidate inventory and close out a trademarked line,any use beyond that point is not in the ordinary course of trade.we disagree.although the facts here do not unambiguously show that mallett decided to abandon his business,even assuming that he did,the pelican mark was not abandoned until he act
