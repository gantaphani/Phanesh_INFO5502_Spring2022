backgrounda.factual context 
carmax advertises and sells cars as certified used vehicles.brooks was searching for a used vehicle and,on november,she bought the jeep,which was a certified used vehicle,from carmax.she would not have purchased the jeep had it not been a certified vehicle.
carmax performs a certified quality inspection cqi on every vehicle it sells to consumers,and performed that inspection on the jeep.carmax expended at least man hours and over in conducting the cqi for the jeep,not including the additional time spent on repairs it sublet to other shops.when carmax technicians conduct a cqi,the technicians use a document the checklist that lists components and observations concerning the vehicle,and information from the checklist is entered into carmax vehicle repair order history database,but the physical checklist is not retained by carmax.upon completion of the cqi,a signed cqi certificate is placed into the glove box of the inspected vehicle.the signed cqi certificate for the jeep,which listed the jeep stock number,was placed in its glove box at the time the inspection was completed and remained in the glove box until after brooks purchased the jeep.
brooks drove the jeep for over miles without any problems.however,on february,she drove it through a to deep puddle and the engine seized.she used a third party repair shop to replace the engine,but the jeep thereafter had occasional problems with the starter and with warning light activations.
brooks demanded among other things that carmax rescind the purchase agreement and buy the jeep back.when it rejected her demands,she filed this action alleging carmax violated section in connection with her purchase of the jeep,because neither the content of the cqi certificate nor its method of delivery to her complied with carmax obligations under section.
contentions and ruling below 
brooks argued carmax violated the mandates of section the content of the cqi certificate was inadequate because it failed to indicat e all components inspected,and the placement of the cqi certificate in the jeep glove compartment did not comply with carmax duty to provide it prior to sale.she asserted those violations of section were adequate to support her claims under the clra and ucl.the court concluded that,even assuming the content or mode of delivery of the cqi certificate did not strictly comply with section,brooks did not have standing to pursue claims under the clra and ucl for noncompliance unless she also showed she suffered some tangible injury from noncompliance,and there was no evidence she was actually damaged by either the content of carmax cqi certificate or by the mode it was delivered to her.the court noted it was undisputed the jeep was actually inspected pursuant to the terms of carmax used vehicle certification program,and a certificate memorializing its compliance with the terms of that program was issued by carmax.the court reasoned that because this was the product brooks wanted to purchase and actually received on november,the fact the paperwork memorializing carmax certification the cqi certificate was provided to her in her glove box rather than in some other fashion caused no actual injury to her.

analysisa.brooks claims under kwikset 
b.a violation of section is not per se actionable under the clra or the ucl 
brooks first claims a violation of section is per se actionable under the clra and ucl,regardless of any injury.section,subdivision b,provides that a violation of section is actionable under the clra,the ucl or any other applicable state or federal law.the rights and remedies provided by section are cumulative and shall not be construed as restricting any right or remedy that is otherwise available.brooks contends the trial court conclusion she lacked standing to pursue her claims under the clra and ucl was error because the text of section shows it was intended to make actionable any violation of that section without any showing the plaintiff was actually injured from the alleged violation.
ordinarily,under the clra,relief is limited to consumers who have suffered,in fact,damage as a result of an illegal practice.davis miller automobile club of southern california th.similarly,although the ucl did not predicate standing on a showing of injury or damage prior to the enactment of proposition,that lacuna rendered the ucl subject to abuse by attorneys who used it as the basis for legal shakedown schemes buckland threshold enterprises,th,disapproved on other grounds in kwikset,supra,cal th at and frivolous lawsuits californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th.to address this problem,proposition amended the ucl to accord standing only to certain specified public officials and to any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.peterson cellco partnership th,quoting buckland,at.thus,in the aftermath of proposition,only plaintiffs who have suffered actual damage may pursue a private ucl action.ibid.
brooks argues that section,subdivision b,by providing that a violation of section is actionable under the clra or the ucl,was intended to exempt her from showing the actual injury predicate ordinarily necessary to making a claim actionable under the clra and the ucl.she cites no pertinent authority for this reading of section,subdivision b,and instead relies solely on rojas platinum auto group,th rojas.although rojas did conclude a specific remedy provided under the rees levering act,et could be invoked even if the plaintiff suffered no actual harm rojas,at,it did not hold the clra and ucl claims asserted by the plaintiff in that action id.at could also be pursued without actual injury moreover,rojas conclusion rested on two important factors not present here.first,rojas examined a statutory scheme that included an express additional statutory remedy for its violation and no similar additional remedy is expressly appended to section.county of san diego san diego norml th,where statutes involving similar issues contain language demonstrating the legislature knows how to express its intent,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different legislative intent existed with reference to the different statutes.moreover,rojas conclusion as to the intent of the express statutory remedy was confirmed by the clear legislative history declaring the legislature intended the remedy provided by the rees levering act to be available regardless of the nature of the disclosure violation or any consumer harm rojas,supra,th at,and no similar language can be found in the legislative history accompanying section.
there is no basis for concluding section,subdivision b,by providing that a violation of section is actionable under the clra or the ucl,was intended to dispense with the actual injury predicate ordinarily necessary before a claim for a violation of that section can be actionable by a private party under the clra and the ucl.we must evaluate whether brooks claims were viable under principles generally applicable to claims under the clra and the ucl.
c.the content of the cqi certificate claim 
brooks principal contentions seek to bring her action under the ambit of kwikset.her first contention is that section,subdivision a,requires a completed inspection report indicating all the components inspected in order to label the vehicle as certified,and she claims that document effectively was never provided because the cqi certificate provided by carmax to brooks does not satisfy this statutory requirement and was therefore a nullity.because this violation of section,subdivision a,precluded carmax from promoting or selling the jeep as a certified vehicle,brooks argues her action falls within the ambit of kwikset.
we agree with brooks that the legislative scheme contemplates certain minimal standards must be met before a dealer may promote or sell a vehicle as certified,among which is that a dealer must provide a completed inspection report indicating all the components inspected to the buyer.we also agree that,if those standards are not satisfied,a vehicle marketed and sold as certified has been mislabeled,and a buyer who establishes they would not have purchased the vehicle absent that certified label has standing to pursue claims for violation of the clra and ucl under the rationale of kwikset,regardless of whether the particular vehicle purchased might be as mechanically sound or intrinsically valuable as a certified vehicle.
however,we conclude the trial court correctly entered judgment against brooks rappleyea campbell,supra,cal th at because we reject brooks claim that the cqi certificate was deficient in its content.the plain language of the statute requires only a report indicating all the components inspected,and we conclude carmax cqi certificate does satisfy the minimal obligations imposed by section,subdivision a.we begin by noting that our role in statutory construction starts with the words of the statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.hsu abbara cal th.a court may not provide words or language which are not found in a statute in order to accommodate a litigant mocek alfa leisure,th,and our own views concerning the theoretical desirability or value of such language is beside the point.in construing this,or any,statute,our office is simply to ascertain and declare what the statute contains,not to change its scope by reading into it language it does not contain or by reading out of it language it does.we may not rewrite the statute to conform to an assumed intention that does not appear in its language.vasquez state of california cal th.
we find it significant that the statutory language employed by section,subdivision a,imposes no minimum amount of inspection a dealer must perform before a vehicle may be labeled as a certified vehicle other than perhaps such inspection as can be implied from subdivisions a through a,thus leaving to each dealer the election of conducting either a more rigorous inspection or a less rigorous inspection.we construe the requirement imposed by section,subdivision a of providing a buyer with a report listing all the components inspected as intended to provide the buyer with a report illuminating the relative rigorousness of the inspection the dealer has elected to conduct,and nothing more.we believe carmax cqi certificate satisfies that obligation,because it indicates the scope of the inspection program carmax has elected to perform by stating the program check s over points including but not limited to the items listed on carmax cqi certificate and certifies the vehicle passed the inspection program used by carmax.
we are unpersuaded by brooks arguments that section,subdivision a,requires something more than is provided by carmax cqi certificate.for example,brooks contended below that the actual results of the inspection,such as the checklist used by carmax technicians that lists the order in which the various parts and systems are to be inspected and notates their observations concerning the specific vehicle,would be necessary to satisfy the report requirement imposed by section,subdivision a.although the checklist certainly would satisfy the report requirement,we can not conclude the checklist is the minimum required to satisfy section,subdivision a.
although the legislative history provides little insight into the precise claims asserted by brooks,we have taken judicial notice of documents see fn,ante showing that,as originally written,section,subdivision a provided p rior to sale,the dealer provides the buyer with a completed inspection report indicating all the components inspected pursuant to the vehicle certification program and certifies that all of the inspected components meet the express written standards of the vehicle certification program.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.however,both the pursuant to the vehicle certification program language and the certifies that all the inspected components meet the express written standards of the vehicle certification program language was deleted from the enactment,which deletion is persuasive that the enactment should not be interpreted to include what was left out.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th.thus,the legislature originally contemplated requiring more than a report indicating all components inspected,both by language that would have tied that report to the entirety of the dealer inspection program by requiring the report to indicate all the components inspected pursuant to the vehicle c
