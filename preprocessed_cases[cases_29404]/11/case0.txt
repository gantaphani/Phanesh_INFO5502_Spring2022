the red river compact or compact is a congressionally sanctioned agreement that allocates water rights within the red river basin among the states of oklahoma,texas,arkansas,and louisiana.the area it governs is divided into five separate subdivisions called reaches,each of which is further divided into smaller subbasins.at issue here are rights under the compact to water located in oklahoma portion of reach ii,subbasin.in reach ii,the compact recognizing that louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store water during high flow periods and that the upstream states texas,oklahoma,and arkansas were unwilling to release their own stored water for the benefit of a downstream state granted control over the water in four upstream subbasins subbasins through to the states in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a fifth subbasin,subbasin,be allowed to flow to louisiana at certain minimum levels.section b of the compact gives the states equal rights to the use of subbasin waters when the flow is cubic feet per second cfs or more,provided no state is entitled to more than percent of the water in excess of cfs.under the compact,states are also entitled to continue with their intrastate water administration.
petitioner tarrant regional water district tarrant is a texas state agency responsible for providing water to texas and its rapidly growing population.after unsuccessfully attempting to purchase water from oklahoma and others,tarrant sought a water resource permit from the oklahoma water resources board owrb,respondents here,to take surface water from a tributary of the red river at a point located in oklahoma portion of subbasin of reach ii.knowing that the owrb would likely deny its permit application because of oklahoma water laws that effectively prevent applicants from taking or diverting water from within oklahoma borders,tarrant filed suit in federal court simultaneously with its permit application,seeking to enjoin the owrb enforcement of the state statutes on grounds that they were by federal law in the form of the compact and violated the commerce clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water.the district court granted summary judgment for the owrb,and the tenth circuit affirmed.
the compact does not the oklahoma water statutes.
a tarrant claims that b creates a borderless common in subbasin in which each of the signatory states may cross each other boundaries to access a shared pool of water.tarrant observes that b equal rights language grants each state an equal entitlement to subbasin waters,subject to a percent cap,and argues that its silence concerning state lines indicates that the compact drafters did not intend the provision to allocate water according to state borders.the owrb counters that b equal rights afford each state an equal opportunity to use subbasin excess water within each state own borders,but that its silence on rights indicates that the compact drafters had no intention to create any such rights in the signatory states.
b because interstate compacts are construed under principles,see texas new mexico,the court begins by examining the compact express terms as the best indication of the parties intent.however,b silence is,at the very least,ambiguous regarding rights under the compact,so the court turns to other interpretive tools to shed light on the drafters intent.three things persuade the court that the compact did not grant rights the principle that states do not easily cede their sovereign powers the fact that other interstate water compacts have treated rights explicitly and the parties course of dealing.
the sovereign states possess an absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common use.martin lessee of waddell,pet.so,for example,a court deciding a question of title to a bed of navigable water within a state boundaries must begin with a strong presumption against defeat of a state title.united states alaska.it follows,then,that i f any inference at all is to be drawn from silence in compacts touching on the states authority to control their waters,it is that each state was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.virginia maryland.tarrant contends that b silence infers that the signatory states dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water within its borders.but since states rarely relinquish their sovereign powers,the better understanding is that there would be a clear indication of such devolution,not inscrutable silence.tarrant counters that its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of oklahoma,which would retain its authority to regulate the water within its borders.but adopting tarrant reading would necessarily entail assuming that oklahoma and three other states silently surrendered substantial control over their waters when they agreed to the compact.
looking to the customary practices employed in other interstate compacts also helps in ascertaining the parties intent.see,alabama north carolina.many compacts feature unambiguous language permitting signatory states to cross each other borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts,and many provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships will operate.the absence of comparable provisions in the red river compact strongly suggests that rights were never intended to be part of the agreement.tarrant claims that not all interstate compacts have such explicit language,but cites only one such compact,and even it sets out a detailed scheme that would apply to any contemplated diversions.similarly,even if d of the compact,which gives e ach signatory state the right to u se the bed and banks of the red river and its tributaries to convey stored water,imported or exported water,and water apportioned according to this compact,is read to establish diversions,it does so through express language,not through an inference from silence.
the parties conduct under the compact also undermines tarrant position.see alabama north carolina,at.once the compact was approved in,no signatory state pressed for a diversion until tarrant filed suit in.and tarrant earlier offer to purchase water from oklahoma was a strange decision if tarrant believed the compact entitled it to demand water without payment.nor is there any indication that tarrant,any other texas agency,or texas itself previously made any mention of rights within the compact and none of the other signatory states has ever made such a claim.
tarrant remaining arguments that its interpretation is necessary to realize the structure and purpose of reach ii and that b percent cap on each state access to subbasin water implies that if a state can not access sufficient water within its borders to meet the cap,it must be able to cross borders to reach that water are unpersuasive.
the oklahoma water statutes also do not run afoul of the commerce clause.tarrant claims that the statutes discriminate against interstate commerce by preventing water left unallocated under the compact from being distributed out of state.but tarrant assumption that some water is left unallocated is incorrect.the interpretive comment for article v of the compact makes clear that when the flow is above cfs,all states are free to use whatever amount of water they can put to beneficial use,subject to the requirement that if the amount of available water can not satisfy all of those uses,each state will honor the other right to of the excess flow.if more than percent of subbasin water is located in oklahoma,that water is not unallocated rather,it is allocated to oklahoma unless and until another state calls for an accounting and oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.

justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the red river compact,or compact,stat,allocates water rights among the states within the red river basin as it winds through texas,oklahoma,arkansas,and louisiana.petitioner tarrant regional water district tarrant,a texas agency,claims that it is entitled to acquire water under the compact from within oklahoma and that therefore the compact several oklahoma statutes that restrict diversions of water.in the alternative,tarrant argues that the oklahoma laws are unconstitutional restrictions on interstate commerce.we hold that tarrant claims lack merit.
the red river or river begins in the llano estacado mesa on the border between new mexico and texas.from this broad plain,it first runs through the texas panhandle and then marks the border between texas and oklahoma.it continues in an easterly direction until it reaches the shared border with arkansas.once the river enters arkansas,it turns southward and flows into louisiana,where it empties into the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers.
as an important geographic feature of this region,the red river has lent its name to a valley,a civil war campaign,and a famed college football rivalry between the longhorns of texas and the sooners of oklahoma.but college pride has not been the only source of controversy between texas and oklahoma regarding the red river.the river has been the cause of numerous historical conflicts between the two states,leading to a mobilization of their militias at one time,oklahoma texas,and the declaration of martial law along a stretch of the river by oklahoma governor alfalfa bill murray at another,see.res,legislature,sess.resolution commemorating alfalfa bill murray actions during the red river bridge war such disputes over the river and its waters are a natural result of the river distribution of water flows.the river course means that upstream states like oklahoma and texas may appropriate substantial amounts of water from both the river and its tributaries to the disadvantage of downstream states like arkansas and especially,which lacks sufficiently large reservoirs to store water.
absent an agreement among the states,disputes over the allocation of water are subject to equitable apportionment by the courts,arizona california,which often results in protracted and costly legal proceedings.thus in,to forestall future disputes over the river and its water,congress authorized the states of arkansas,louisiana,oklahoma,and texas to negotiate a compact to apportion the water of the red river basin among themselves.see act of,pub,stat.these negotiations lasted over years and finally culminated in the signing of the red river compact in.congress approved the compact in,transforming it into federal law.see act of,stat.compact,app.
one of the compact principal purposes was t o provide an equitable apportionment among the signatory states of the water of the red river and its tributaries.b,at.the compact governs the allocation of water along the red river and its tributaries from the new mexico and texas border to its terminus in louisiana.a e,at.this stretch is divided into five separate subdivisions called reach es,each of which is further divided into smaller subbasins,see,at describing subbasins through of reach ii.see appendix a,infra,for a map.
at issue in this case are rights under the compact to water located in oklahoma portion of subbasin of reach ii,which occupies that portion of the red river,together with its tributaries,from denison dam down to the state boundary,excluding all tributaries included in the other four subbasins of reach ii.a,app.see appendix b,infra,for a map.the compact interpretive explain that during negotiations,reach ii posed the greatest difficulty to the parties efforts to reach agreement.comment on art.v,app.the problem was that louisiana,the farthest downstream state,lacks suitable reservoir sites and therefore can not store water during high flow periods to meet its future needs.the upstream states texas,oklahoma,and arkansas,which control the river flow,were unwilling to release water stored within their own reservoirs for the benefit of any downstream states,like louisiana.without any such release,there would be no guaranteed flow of water to louisiana.
the provisions of the compact relating to reach ii were crafted to address this problem.to this end,reach ii was divided into five subbasins.the upstream subbasins,numbered through,were drawn to end at existing,authorized or proposed last downstream major damsites,see,a,at,on the tributaries leading to the red river before reaching the main stem of the river.these dams allow the parties managing them to control water along the tributaries before it travels farther downstream and joins the flow of the main stem of the river.for the most part,the compact granted control over the water in these subbasins to the states in which each subbasin is located the remaining subbasin,subbasin,instead requires that water be allowed to flow to louisiana through the main stem of the river at certain minimum levels,assuring louisiana an allocation of the river waters and solving its flowthrough problem.
the provision of the compact central to the present dispute is b,which sets the following allocation during times of normal flow 
the signatory states shall have equal rights to the use of runoff originating in subbasin and undesignated water flowing into subbasin,so long as the flow of the red river at the state boundary is cubic feet per second hereinafter cfs or more,provided no state is entitled to more than percent of the water in excess of cfs.at.
in these normal circumstances,when flows at the border are above cfs,this provision and its interpretive comment make clear that all states are free to use whatever amount of water they can put to beneficial use.comment on art.v,at.but if the amount of water above cfs can not satisfy all such uses,then each state will honor the other right to of the excess flow.ibid.however,when the flow of the river diminishes at the border,the upstream states must permit more water to reach louisiana subbasin allocation scheme allows upstream states to keep the water that they have stored,but also ensures that louisiana will receive a steady supply of water from the red river,with each upstream state contributing during times of low flow.
to ensure that its apportionments are honored,the compact includes an accounting provision,but an accounting is not mandatory until one or more affected states deem the accounting necessary.at see comment on art.ii,at.this is because the extensive gaging and record keeping required to carry out such an accounting would impose a significant financial burden on the involved states.at.given these costs,the signatory states did not envisio n that it w ould be undertaken as a routine matter.ibid.indeed,it appears that no state has ever asked for such an accounting in the compact history.see brief for respondents reply brief.
while the compact allocates water rights among its signatories,it also provides that it should not be deemed to i nterfere with or impair the right or power of any signatory state to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation,use,and control of water,or quality of water,not inconsistent with its obligations under this compact.app.rather,s ubject to the general constraints of water availability and the apportionment of the compact,each state remains free to continue its existing internal water administration.comment on art.ii,at.even during periods of water shortage,no attempt is made to specify the steps that will be taken by states to ensure water deliveries it is left to the state internal water administration.ibid.
in the years since the red river compact was ratified by congress,the region population has increased dramatically.in particular,the population of the worth metropolitan area in north texas has grown from roughly million inhabitants in to almost million in,a jump of over percent and among the largest in the united states during this period.see of commerce,census bureau,mackun wilson,population distribution and change to.this growth has strained regional water supplies,and north texas need for water has been exacerbated in recent years by a long and costly drought.see generally galbraith,a drought more than,international herald tribune.
against this backdrop,petitioner tarrant,a texas state agency responsible for providing water to texas including the cities of fort worth,arlington,and mansfield,has endeavored to secure new sources of water for the area it serves.from to,tarrant,along with several other texas water districts,offered to purchase water from oklahoma and the choctaw and chickasaw nations.see app.but these negotiations were unsuccessful and tarrant eventually abandoned these efforts.
because texas need for water only continued to grow,tarrant settled on a new course of action.in,tarrant sought a water resource permit from the oklahoma water resources board owrb respondents here,to take acre per year of surface water from the kiamichi river,a tributary of the red river located in oklahoma.tarrant proposed to divert the kiamichi river,at a point located in subbasin of reach ii,before it discharges into the red river and,according to tarrant,becomes too saline for potable use.
tarrant knew,however,that oklahoma would likely deny its permits because various state laws collectively,the oklahoma water statutes effectively prevent applicants from taking or diverting water from within oklahoma borders.these statutes include a requirement that the owrb consider,when evaluating an application to take water out of state,whether that water could feasibly be transported to alleviate water shortages in the state of oklahoma.tit,a west.the statutes also require that no permit issued by the owrb to use water outside of the state shall i mpair the ability of the state of oklahoma to meet its obligations under any interstate stream compact.a b.a separate provision creates a permitting review process that applies only to water users.f.oklahoma also requires legislative approval for permits,a d,and further provides that w ater use within oklahoma be developed to the maximum extent feasible for the benefit of oklahoma so that downstream users will not acquire vested rights therein to the detriment of the citizens of this state,a.interpreting these laws,oklahoma attorney general has concluded that we consider the proposition unrealistic that an user is a proper permit applicant before the owrb because w e can find no intention to create the possibility that such a valuable resource as water may become bound,without compensation,to use by an user.app.
when tarrant filed its permit application,it also filed suit against respondents in federal district court.as relevant here,tarrant sought to enjoin enforcement of the oklahoma water statutes by the owrb.tarrant argued that the statutes,and the interpretation of them adopted by oklahoma attorney general,were by federal law and violated the commerce clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water.
the district court granted summary judgment for the owrb on both of tarrant claims.see no,wl,wd,july,no.wd,app.to pet.for cert,wl.the tenth circuit affirmed,
we granted tarrant petition for a writ of certiorari,and now affirm the judgment of the tenth circuit.
tarrant claims that under b of the compact,it has the right to cross state lines and divert water from oklahoma located in subbasin of reach ii and that the oklahoma water statutes interfere with its ability to exercise that right.section b provides 
the signatory states shall have equal rights to the use of runoff originating in subbasin and undesignated water following into subbasin,so long as the flow of the red river at the state boundary is cfs or more,provided no state is entitled to more than percent of the water in excess of cfs.app.
in tarrant view,this provision essentially creates a borderless common in which each of the four signatory states may cross each other boundaries to access a shared pool of water.tarrant reaches this interpretation in two steps.first,it observes that b equal rights language grants each state an equal entitlement to the waters of subbasin,subject to a percent cap.second,tarrant argues b silence concerning state lines indicates that the compact drafters did not intend to allocate water according to state borders in this section.according to tarrant,the percent language of b makes clear that,in exercising its equal rights to the common pool of water,no state may take more than a share,reply brief,but any of the signatory states may cross state lines to obtain its shar e of subbasin waters,brief for petitioner.
the owrb disputes this reading.in its view,the equal rights promised by b afford each state an equal opportunity to make use of the excess water within subbasin of reach ii but only within each state own borders.this is because the owrb reads b silence differently from tarrant.the owrb interprets that provision absence of language granting any rights to indicate that the compact drafters had no intention to create any such rights in the signatory states.
unraveling the meaning of b silence with respect to state lines is the key to resolving whether the compact the oklahoma water statutes if b silence means that state borders are irrelevant to the allocation of water in subbasin of reach ii,then the oklahoma water laws at issue conflict with the rights created by federal law in the form of the compact and must be.but if b silence instead reflects a background understanding on the part of the compact drafters that state borders were to be respected within the compact allocation,then the oklahoma statutes do not conflict with the compact allocation of water.
interstate compacts are construed as contracts under the principles of contract law.texas new mexico.so,as with any contract,we begin by examining the express terms of the compact as the best indication of the intent of the parties,see also montana wyoming,and,slip,at,and,restatement second of contracts b.
tarrant argues that because other provisions of the compact reference state borders,b silence with respect to state lines must mean that the compact drafters intended to permit diversions.for example,b,which governs subbasin of reach ii,provides that 
t he states of oklahoma and arkansas shall have free and unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin within their respective states,subject,however,to the limitation that oklahoma shall allow a quantity of water equal to percent of the total runoff originating below the following existing,authorized or proposed last major downstream damsites in oklahoma to flow into arkansas.app.emphasis added.
section b,which covers subbasin of reach iii,similarly provides that texas and louisiana within their respective boundaries shall each have the unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin subject to the following conditions.at emphasis added.thus,b and b mimic b in allocating water rights within a subbasin,but differ in that they make explicit to water use within state boundaries.relying on the expressio unius canon of construction,tarrant finds that b silence regarding borders is significant because w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.brief for petitioner quoting russello united states.
but tarrant argument fails to account for other sections of the compact that cut against its reading.for example,b,which governs the waters of subbasin in reach ii when flows are below cfs,requires that during such periods,arkansas,texas,and oklahoma allow water within their respective states to flow into the red river as required to maintain a cfs flow at the state boundary.app.emphasis added.obviously none of the upstream states can redirect water that lies outside of their borders,so the phrase within their respective states is superfluous in b.in contrast,b,which governs when the river flow at the border is above cfs but below cfs,requires that upstream states allow a flow to louisiana equivalent to percent of total weekly runoff originating within the subbasin and percent of undesignated water flowing into subbasin of reach ii,at.this language can only refer to water within each state borders because otherwise each state would have to contribute percent to the total water flow,which would add up to more than percent.read together and to avoid absurd results,b and suggest that each upstream state is individually responsible for ensuring that sufficient subbasin water located within its respective borders flows down to louisiana,even though b lacks any explicit reference to state lines.
applying tarrant understanding of b silence regarding state lines to other of the compact provisions would produce further anomalous results.consider b.that provision states that texas is apportioned sixty percent of the runoff of subbasin of reach iii and shall have unrestricted use thereof arkansas is entitled to forty percent of the runoff of this subbasin.at.because texas is upstream from arkansas,water flows from texas to arkansas.given this situation,the commonsense reason for b allocation is to prevent texas from barring the flow of water to arkansas.while there is no reference to state boundaries in the section text,the unstated assumption underlying this provision is that arkansas must wait for its percent share to go through texas before it can claim it.but applying tarrant understanding of silence regarding state borders to this section would imply that arkansas could enter into texas without having to wait for the water that will inevitably reach it.this counterintuitive outcome would thwart the purposes of the compact.further,other provisions of the compact share this structure of allocating a proportion of water that will flow from an upstream state to a downstream one accepting tarrant reading would upset the balance struck by all these sections.
at the very least,the problems that arise from tarrant proposed reading suggest that b silence is ambiguous regarding rights under the compact.we therefore turn to other interpretive tools to shed light on the intent of the compact drafters.see oklahoma new mexico,three things persuade us that rights were not granted by the compact the principle that states do not easily cede their sovereign powers,including their control over waters within their own territories the fact that other interstate water compacts have treated rights explicitly and the parties course of dealing.
the background notion that a state does not easily cede its sovereignty has informed our interpretation of interstate compacts.we have long understood that as sovereign entities in our federal system,the states possess an absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common use.martin lessee of waddell,pet.drawing on this principle,we have held that ownership of submerged lands,and the accompanying power to control navigation,fishing,and other public uses of water,is an essential attribute of sovereignty,united states alaska.consequently,a court deciding a question of title to a bed of navigable water within a state boundaries must begin with a strong presumption against defeat of a state title.at quoting montana united states.see also solid waste agency of northern cook cty.army corps of engineers,utah div.of state lands united states.
given these principles,when confronted with silence in compacts touching on the states authority to control their waters,we have concluded that i f any inference at all is to be drawn from such silence on the subject of regulatory authority,we think it is that each state was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.virginia maryland.new jersey new york,t he silence of the compact was on the subject of settled law governing avulsion,which the parties silence showed no intent to modify 
tarrant asks us to infer from b silence regarding state borders that the signatory states have dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water within their own boundaries but as the above demonstrates,states rarely relinquish their sovereign powers,so when they do we would expect a clear indication of such devolution,not inscrutable silence.we think that the better understanding of b silence is that the parties drafted the compact with this legal background in mind,and therefore did not intend to grant each other rights under the compact.
in response,tarrant contends that its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of oklahoma because that state would retain its authority to regulate the water within its borders.because anyone seeking water from oklahoma would still have to apply to the owrb,receive a permit,and abide by its conditions,tarrant argues that oklahoma sovereign authority remains untouched by its interpretation.but tarrant can not have it both ways.adopting tarrant reading would necessarily entail assuming that oklahoma and three other states silently surrendered substantial control over the water within their borders when they agreed to the compact.given the background principles we have described above,we find this unlikely to have been the intent of the compact signatories.
looking to the customary practices employed in other interstate compacts also helps us to ascertain the intent of the parties to this compact.see alabama north carolina,slip,at oklahoma,at,texas new mexico.see also restatement second of contracts b explaining that usage of trade may be relevant in interpreting a contract.many of these other compacts feature language that unambiguously permits signatory states to cross each other borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts.see,amended bear river compact,art.viii a,stat.n o state shall deny the right of another signatory state to acquire rights to the use of water in one state for use of water in another the absence of comparable language in the red river compact counts heavily against tarrant reading of it.
tellingly,many of these compacts provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships will operate,including who can assert such rights,see,big blue river compact,art.vii,stat,who should bear the costs of any diversions,see,belle fourche river compact,art.vi,stat,and how such diversions should be administered,arkansas river basin compact,art.vii a,stat.see also brief for professors of law and political science as amici curiae giving more examples.
provisions like these are critical for managing the complexities that ensue from diversions.consider the mechanics of a diversion or taking of water in this case.if tarrant were correct,then applicants from arkansas,texas,and louisiana could all apply to the owrb for permits to take water from oklahoma.the owrb would then be obligated to determine the total amount of water in oklahoma beyond the percent cap created in b,given that the compact would only obligate oklahoma to deliver water beyond its quarter share.this alone would be a herculean task because the compact does not require ongoing monitoring or accounting,see compact,app,and not all of the water in subbasin is located or originates in oklahoma.moreover,the owrb would be tasked with determining the priority under the compact of applicants from other states.this would almost certainly require the owrb to not only determine whether oklahoma had received more or less than its percent allotment,but whether other states had as well.put plainly,the end result would be a jurisdictional and administrative quagmire.the in the other interstate water compacts resolve these complications.the absence of comparable provisions in the red river compact strongly suggests that rights were never intended to be part of the states agreement.
tarrant counters that not all interstate compacts that permit diversions have explicit language to this effect.on this front,tarrant manages to identify one interstate compact that it contends permits diversions without express language to that effect,the upper niobrara river compact,pub,stat.tarrant observes that this compact,which deals with a river mostly locate
