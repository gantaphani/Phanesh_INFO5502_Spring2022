factual and procedural background 
the complaint 
salazar,individually and doing business as los angeles technology,sued respondents hostpro,hostpro and interland,interland for breach of contract and fraud.he alleged that he was an agent of at t at t authorized to market internet and services to small and businesses the web services.in,he advised hostpro,which also provided web services to small and medium businesses,that at t no longer wished to provide these web services.hostpro expressed an interest in acquiring at t small and medium business clients.
on february,salazar entered into a written contract with hostpro to market hostpro web services to small and medium business customers and to arrange the acquisition of at t small and medium business customers.hostpro represented to salazar that he would receive a percent commission on all monthly recurring fees received by hostpro up to,a percent commission on monthly recurring fees over and a percent commission payment as a setup fee for each customer acquired due to his efforts.
based on the contract and representations,salazar initiated and participated in meetings between hostpro and at hostpro merged its operations with interland,which later acquired approximately at t customers.interland refused to pay salazar his commission on the monthly recurring fees and his setup fees for the acquired at t customers.salazar sued for damages in excess of million.
prior federal court proceedings 
salazar originally filed a complaint in in federal district court,which was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.salazar refiled the complaint in los angeles superior court,but that case was removed to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.in support of its removal,interland,a minnesota corporation,and hostpro,originally a california corporation,represented that d efendant hostpro has no existence separate or apart from defendant interland.the district court eventually granted interland summary judgment motion as to the fraud but not the breach of contract cause of action.in march,interland again represented that interland and hostpro were not separate entities.but after further briefing,the district court ruled that hostpro did have a separate corporate identity and had its principal place of business in los angeles,obviating diversity jurisdiction and requiring remand to the superior court.
superior court proceedings 
upon remand,the parties briefed the issue of the effect in superior court of the prior federal court proceedings.in its briefing,interland argued for the first time that salazar could not recover under his contract because his lack of a business opportunity license rendered his contract for commissions illegal.
the trial court ruled that the district court rulings on the previous summary judgment motions were void and ordered a further hearing on those motions based on the pleadings filed in federal court.the court granted leave to interland to file an additional motion for summary judgment on the illegality issue.after a hearing,the trial court adopted as its own the order of the federal court granting summary judgment on the fraud claim and denying it as to the breach of contract claim.later,the court granted summary adjudication on the breach of contract claim based on salazar lack of a broker license.the minute order stated after the subject transaction was completed,at t retained no assets,in the form of customer contracts,equipment,or otherwise,to continue with its small and medium sized business.the court finds that the subject transaction constitutes a sale of a business opportunity the court entered judgment in favor of respondents from which salazar has appealed.
discussion

ii.salazar was required to have a business opportunity license 
business opportunity license 
in,the legislature merged the statute requiring a person acting as a business opportunity broker to be licensed with the section requiring a real estate broker to be licensed.see all points,supra,d at.as a result,the definition of real estate broker in section,subdivision a was expanded to include a person who,for a compensation or in expectation of a compensation does or negotiates to do one or more of the following acts for another or others a sells or offers to sell,buys or offers to buy,solicits prospective sellers or purchasers of,solicits or obtains listings of,or negotiates the purchase,sale or exchange of a business opportunity.section requires a real estate broker to have a license.sections and prohibit an unlicensed real estate broker from collecting compensation earned in the capacity of a broker.all points,supra,at.to be licensed,a broker must meet training and experience qualifications.the purpose of these licensing requirements is to protect the public from incompetent or untrustworthy practitioners.citation.all points,supra,at.
definition of business opportunity 
business opportunity is defined as including the sale or lease of the business and goodwill of an existing business enterprise or opportunity.
salazar argues that the transaction between interland and at t did not constitute a business opportunity because it did not involve the purchase and sale of all of the assets of at t,or one of its subsidiaries or divisions.he relies on a holding in all points that the sale or purchase of a business opportunity encompasses any transfer of the ownership of an entire ongoing business in corporate form whether by transfer of all the stock or all the assets.all points,supra,d at.but salazar reliance on all points is misplaced because that case did not consider whether the transfer of less than all of a corporation stock or assets can constitute the sale of a business opportunity.see ginns savage cal d,fn,an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.
