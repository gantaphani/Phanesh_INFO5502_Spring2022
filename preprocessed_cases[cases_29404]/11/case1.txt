virginia freedom of information act foia grants virginia citizens access to all public records,but grants no such right to.petitioners mcburney and hurlbert,citizens of states other than virginia,filed records requests under the act.after each petitioner request was denied,they filed a suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the privileges and immunities clause and,in hurlbert case,the dormant commerce clause.the district court granted virginia motion for summary judgment,and the fourth circuit affirmed.
virginia foia does not violate the privileges and immunities clause,which protects only those privileges and immunities that are fundamental.see baldwin fish and game comm of.
a hurlbert alleges that virginia foia abridges his fundamental right to earn a living in his chosen profession obtaining property records on behalf of his clients.while the privileges and immunities clause protects the right of citizens to ply their trade,practice their occupation,or pursue a common calling,hicklin orbeck,the court has struck down laws as violating this privilege only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening citizens.see,toomer witsell.the virginia foia distinction has a nonprotectionist aim.virginia foia exists to provide a mechanism for virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public officials noncitizens have no comparable need.moreover,the distinction between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the commonwealth.any effect the act has of preventing citizens of other states from making a profit by trading on information contained in state records is incidental.
b hurlbert also alleges that virginia foia abridges the right to own and transfer property in the commonwealth.the right to take,hold,and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the privileges of citizenship.see,paul virginia,wall.however,virginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining documents necessary to the transfer of property.records like title and mortgage documents maintained by the clerk of each circuit court are available to inspection by any person.real estate tax assessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted online,a practice followed by the county from which hurlbert sought records.requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerk office or on the internet,instead of through a burdensome foia process,can not be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to own or transfer property in virginia.
c mcburney alleges that virginia foia impermissibly burdens his access to public proceedings.the privileges and immunities clause secures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts of another,equally with the citizens of the latter state,missouri pacific clarendon boat oar,but that requirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access upon terms which are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have,even though they may not be the same in extent as those accorded to resident citizens,canadian northern eggen.virginia foia clearly does not deprive noncitizens of reasonable and adequate access to commonwealth courts.virginia court rules provide noncitizens access to nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation,and virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to records pertaining directly to them.for example,mcburney utilized virginia government data collection and dissemination practices act to receive much of the information he had sought in his foia request.
d petitioners sweeping claim that the virginia foia violates the privileges and immunities clause because it denies them the right to access public information on equal terms with commonwealth citizens is rejected because the right to access public information is not a fundamental privilege or immunity of citizenship.the court has repeatedly stated that the constitution does not guarantee the existence of foia laws.see,los angeles police united reporting publishing.moreover,no such right was recognized at common law or in the early republic.nor is such a sweeping right basic to the maintenance or of the union.baldwin,supra,at.
virginia foia does not violate the dormant commerce clause.the common thread among this court dormant commerce clause cases is that the state interfered with the natural functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome regulation.hughes alexandria scrap.virginia foia,by contrast,neither prohibits access to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.accordingly,this is not properly viewed as a dormant commerce clause case.even shoehorned into the court dormant commerce clause framework,however,hurlbert claim would fail.insofar as there is a market for public documents in virginia,it is a market for a product that the commonwealth has created and of which the commonwealth is the sole manufacturer.a state does not violate the dormant commerce clause when,having created a market through a state program,it limits benefits generated by that state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the state was created to serve.reeves,stake.

justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
in this case,we must decide whether the virginia freedom of information act.code ann.et,violates either the privileges and immunities clause of article iv of the constitution or the dormant commerce clause.the virginia freedom of information act foia,provides that all public records shall be open to inspection and copying by any citizens of the commonwealth,but it grants no such right to.a lexis.
petitioners,who are citizens of other states,unsuccessfully sought information under the act and then brought this constitutional challenge.we hold,however,that petitioners constitutional rights were not violated.by means other than the state foia,virginia made available to petitioners most of the information that they sought,and the commonwealth refusal to furnish the additional information did not abridge any constitutionally protected privilege or immunity.nor did virginia violate the dormant commerce clause.the state freedom of information act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful sense,but instead provides a service that is related to state citizenship.for these reasons,we affirm the decision of the court of appeals rejecting petitioners constitutional claims.
petitioners mark mcburney and roger hurlbert are citizens of rhode island and california respectively.mcburney and hurlbert each requested documents under the virginia foia,but their requests were denied because of their citizenship.
mcburney is a former resident of virginia whose is a virginia citizen.after his defaulted on her child support obligations,mcburney asked the commonwealth division of child support enforcement to file a petition for child support on his behalf.the agency complied,but only after a delay.mcburney attributes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him nine months of child support.to ascertain the reason for the agency delay,mcburney filed a virginia foia request seeking all emails,notes,files,memos,reports,letters,policies,and opinions pertaining to his family,along with all documents regarding his application for child support and all documents pertaining to the handling of child support claims like his.app.in.the agency denied mcburney request on the ground that he was not a virginia citizen.mcburney later requested the same documents under virginia government data collection and dissemination practices act.code ann.et,and through that request he received most of the information he had sought that pertained specifically to his own case.he did not,however,receive any general policy information about how the agency handled claims like his.

petitioners allege that virginia foia provision violates four different fundamental privileges or immunities the opportunity to pursue a common calling,the ability to own and transfer property,access to the virginia courts,and access to public information.the first three items on that list,however,are not abridged by the virginia foia,and the fourth framed broadly is not protected by the privileges and immunities clause.
hurlbert argues that virginia foia provision abridges his ability to earn a living in his chosen profession,namely,obtaining property records from state and local governments on behalf of clients.he is correct that the privileges and immunities clause protects the right of citizens to ply their trade,practice their occupation,or pursue a common calling.hicklin orbeck,supreme court of piper,o ne of the privileges which the clause guarantees to citizens of state a is that of doing business in state b on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that state but the virginia foia does not abridge hulbert ability to engage in a common calling in the sense prohibited by the privileges and immunities clause.rather,the court has struck laws down as violating the privilege of pursuing a common calling only when those laws were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening citizens.see,hicklin,supra,striking down as a violation of noncitizens privileges and immunities an alaska hire statute containing a resident hiring preference for all employment related to the development of the state oil and gas resources toomer witsell,striking down a south carolina statute imposing a license fee on shrimping boats and only a fee on shrimping boats where petitioners alleged that the purpose and effect of this statute was not to conserve shrimp,but to exclude and thereby create a commercial monopoly for south carolina residents,and the record cas t some doubt on the state counterassertion that the statute obvious purpose was to conserve its shrimp supply united building constr.trades council of camden cty.mayor and council of camden,new jersey municipal ordinance requiring that at least of employees of contractors and subcontractors working on city construction projects be city residents facially burdened citizens ability to pursue a common calling.in each case,the clear aim of the statute at issue was to advantage workers and commercial interests at the expense of their counterparts.
virginia foia differs sharply from those statutes.by its own terms,virginia foia was enacted to ensur e the people of the commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public body or its officers and employees,and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is being conducted.code ann.b lexis.hurlbert does not allege and has offered no proof that the challenged provision of the virginia foia was enacted in order to provide a competitive economic advantage for virginia citizens.hillside dairy lyons,piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute to find economic protectionism.rather,it seems clear that the distinction that the statute makes between citizens and noncitizens has a distinctly nonprotectionist aim.the state foia essentially represents a mechanism by which those who ultimately hold sovereign power,the citizens of the commonwealth may obtain an accounting from the public officials to whom they delegate the exercise of that power.see,art.i.code ann.b.in addition,the provision limiting the use of the state foia to virginia citizens recognizes that virginia taxpayers foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the commonwealth.tr.of oral arg.the challenged provision of the state foia does not violate the privileges and immunities clause simply because it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens of other states from making a profit by trading on information contained in state records.while the clause forbids a state from intentionally giving its own citizens a competitive advantage in business or employment,the clause does not require that a state tailor its every action to avoid any incidental effect on tradesmen.
hurlbert next alleges that the challenged provision of the virginia foia abridges the right to own and transfer property in the commonwealth.like the right to pursue a common calling,the right to take,hold and dispose of property,either real or personal,has long been seen as one of the privileges of citizenship.see corfield coryell,cas,cced see also paul,supra,at listing the acquisition and enjoyment of property among the privileges of citizenship.thus,if a state prevented citizens from accessing records like title documents and mortgage records that are necessary to the transfer of property,the state might well run afoul of the privileges and immunities clause.state grimes,caveat emptor being the rule with us in the absence of a special agreement,it is just and essential to the protection of persons intending to purchase or take incumbrances that they be allowed the right of inspection jackson ex dem.center campbell,johns,the plain intention of the state property records system was to give notice,through the medium of the county records,to persons about to purchase 
virginia,however,does not prevent citizens of other states from obtaining such documents.under virginia law,any records and papers of every circuit court that are maintained by the clerk of the circuit court shall be open to inspection by any person and the clerk shall,when requested,furnish copies thereof.code ann.lexis.such records and papers include records of property transfers,like title documents
