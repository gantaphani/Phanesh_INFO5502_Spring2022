discussion 
federal preemption 
section requires compensation for the loss of goodwill by the owner of a business conducted on property taken by condemnation.however,section,subdivision a,of the pmpa provides no state or political subdivision of a state may adopt,enforce,or continue in effect any provision of law that requires a payment for the goodwill of a franchisee on the termination of a franchise or nonrenewal of a franchise relationship authorized by this subchapter.
caltrans contends section is preempted by section of the pmpa whenever the business at issue is a petroleum franchisee such as acosta.caltrans further argues that,under the pmpa,only a franchisor may claim a loss of goodwill in a condemnation proceeding,with the franchisee restricted to seeking an apportionment of goodwill damages from the franchisor.
acosta counters that the pmpa imposes restrictions only as to the relationship and does not prohibit the recovery of compensation from a condemner for the loss of goodwill by a franchisee,to the extent such recovery is authorized by state law.
acosta has the better argument.
the doctrine of federal preemption derives from the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which declares that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.under the supremacy clause,federal laws preempt state laws whenever congress so intends.fidelity federal de la cuesta,d.
federal preemption has been recognized in three general areas where the federal law expressly so states,where the federal law is so comprehensive that it leaves no room for supplementary state regulation,or where the federal and state laws actually conflict.california federal guerra,d.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d.as to the latter,an actual conflict arises when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,citation,or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress fidelity federal de la cuesta,supra,at.at,d at.a party claiming a state statute is preempted by federal law bears the burden of so proving.bronco wine jolly cal th,d.
section of the pmpa reads to the extent that any provision of this subchapter applies to the termination of any franchise,or to the nonrenewal of any franchise relationship,no state or any political subdivision thereof may adopt,enforce,or continue in effect any provision of any law or regulation with respect to termination of any such franchise or to the nonrenewal of any such franchise relationship unless such provision or such law or regulation is the same as the applicable provision of this subchapter,subd.a.
in addition,as previously noted,the pmpa specifically prohibits a state from enforcing any law that requires a payment for the goodwill of a franchisee on the termination of a franchise or nonrenewal of a franchise relationship,subd.a.read literally,this latter provision would appear to preempt any state law that requires the payment of goodwill damages to a franchisee by any party in a condemnation proceeding.however,as we shall explain,this clearly was not congress intent.
congress enacted the pmpa in order to regulate the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.as explained by the seventh circuit court of appeals congress enacted the pmpa in an effort to protect franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or of their franchises.citation.the franchise relationship in the petroleum industry is unique in that the franchisor commonly not only grants a trademark license and supplies the products but also leases the service station premises to the franchisee.as congress noted,t his relationship is,therefore,often complex and characterized by at times competing interests.citation.congress designed the pmpa to allay three specific concerns that franchisee independence may be undermined by the use of actual or threatened termination or nonrenewal to compel compliance with franchisor marketing policies that gross disparity of bargaining power may result in franchise agreements that amount to contracts of adhesion and that termination or nonrenewal may disrupt the reasonable expectations of the parties that the franchise relationship will be a continuing one.citation.brach amoco oil cir,see also simmons mobil oil cir,california arco distributors,atlantic richfield d.
in addition to protecting franchisees,the pmpa was designed to provide adequate flexibility so that franchisors may initiate changes in their marketing activities to respond to changing marketing conditions and consumer preferences.arbabian bp america,see also california arco distributors,atlantic richfield,supra,d at.
congress included in the pmpa a preemption provision in order to provide national uniformity of petroleum franchise termination law.in re herbert cir.f ranchisors and franchisees must bear the consequences of potential preemption in mind when conducting business,and must minimize the risks associated with preemption by channeling their behavior so that it conforms to the provisions of the pmpa.arbabian bp america,supra.at.
consistent with the foregoing,section of the pmpa regulates the termination or nonrenewal of petroleum franchises.it specifies the permissible grounds for termination or nonrenewal,including failure to comply with the terms of the franchise,subd.b a and t he occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship is reasonable,subd.b c.within the meaning of the latter is the condemnation or other taking,in whole or in part,of the marketing premises pursuant to the power of eminent domain,subd.c.
in the event of termination of a franchise due to condemnation of the marketing premises,section,subdivision d,of the pmpa provides that the franchisor shall fairly apportion between the franchisor and the franchisee compensation,if any,received by the franchisor based upon any loss of business opportunity or good will,subd.d.
caltrans argues the foregoing provision specifies that only a motor oil franchisor can make a claim for goodwill in a condemnation case,with the franchisee restricted to an equitable share of any award of goodwill to the franchisor.caltrans cites as support bajwa sunoco,d,bajwa,where the court said the pmpa does not entitle a franchisee to compensation from the owner for his leasehold in the event of a condemnation the act only requires that the franchisor shall fairly apportion between the franchisor and the franchisee compensation,if any,received by the franchisor based upon any loss of business opportunity or good will.citation.virginia law does not compensate the property owners for loss of business opportunity or good will.citation.the sale price received by sunoco,therefore,could not have contained compensation for business opportunity or good will.accordingly,the pmpa does not require that sunoco share the sale price with bajwa.no other provision of the pmpa provides for compensation to bajwa.
bajwa is inapposite.the federal court indicated only that the pmpa itself does not provide an independent ground for the recovery of goodwill by a franchisee except where a franchisor has recovered goodwill damages.however,the court did not say state law can not provide for the recovery of such damages by a franchisee.in bajwa,virginia law did not provide for the recovery of such damages.however,california law does.
consistent with the underlying purposes of the pmpa to regulate the relationship between franchisors and franchisees,the pmpa establishes no limit on the payment of compensation by condemners.section,subdivision d,of the pmpa provides only that,in the event the franchisor recovers goodwill damages in connection with a condemnation proceeding,such damages must be fairly apportion ed between the franchisor and franchisee.it says nothing about whether a franchisee may recover a separate award from a condemner.
of course,to the extent a condemner pays compensation to a franchisor that is intended to include the loss of goodwill by a franchisee,the condemner could defend against a duplicate award to the franchisee on that basis.however,this would be a matter of state condemnation law,not federal preemption.we conclude the trial court properly determined acosta is entitled to recover goodwill damages under section,notwithstanding the pmpa.
in light of our conclusion in this regard,we need not consider acosta challenge to the two earlier rulings of judge saiers.
litigation expenses 
acosta submitted a final demand in the amount of and caltrans submitted a final offer in the amount of.following entry of the stipulated judgment,acosta moved for an award of litigation expenses in the amount of plus expert witness fees of.the trial court granted the motion and awarded total litigation expenses and expert fees in the amount of.
in its order,the court concluded the final offer of caltrans had been unreasonable,whereas the final demand of acosta had been reasonable.in particular,the court found the caltrans offer unreasonable in that a the purported final offer is only percent of the sic awarded pursuant to the stipulated judgment b the purported final offer is percent lower than acosta final demand c the purported final offer is less than acosta final demand and less than the award pursuant to the stipulated judgment and d that the purported final offer is only percent of the appraisal figure arrived at by caltrans appraiser and sic that caltrans failed to proceed with good faith,care and accuracy in making its purported offer.
caltrans contends the trial court erred in concluding the offer was unreasonable,inasmuch as the offer was made at a time after the court had ruled acosta goodwill claim was preempted by the pmpa and before the court reversed directions and denied caltrans motion in limine to exclude goodwill evidence.caltrans further contends the court improperly relied solely on the numeric difference between the offer and the final judgment in reaching its decision.
an award of litigation expenses in an eminent domain proceeding is governed by section.it reads,in relevant part 
a at least days prior to the date of the trial on issues relating to compensation,the plaintiff shall file with the court and serve on the defendant its final offer of compensation in the proceeding and the defendant shall file and serve on the plaintiff its final demand for compensation in the proceeding.the offer and the demand shall include all compensation required pursuant to this title,including compensation for loss of goodwill,if any,and shall state whether interest and costs are included.these offers and demands shall be the only offers and demands considered by the court in determining the entitlement,if any,to litigation expenses 
b if the court,on motion of the defendant made within days after entry of judgment,finds that the offer of the plaintiff was unreasonable and that the demand of the defendant was rea
