this case assesses the constitutionality of a texas statute making it a crime to promote or sell sexual devices.the district court upheld the statute constitutionality and granted the state motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.we reverse the judgment and hold that the statute has provisions that violate the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.
i.the statute 
the forerunner of texas obscenity statute was enacted in and had the modest goal of prohibiting obscene material.six years later,the legislature redefined obscene material so that it would track the supreme court definition of obscenity detailed in miller california that same year,the legislature also expanded the scope of the statute so that it would prohibit the promotion and wholesale promotion of obscene devices,which includes selling,giving,lending,distributing,or advertising for them the legislature chose to broadly define obscene device,not using the miller test,but as any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs.in,the texas court of criminal appeals held that the statute did not violate an individual right to privacy,concluding that there was no constitutional right to stimulate another genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose.later,in,a narrow affirmative defense was added to protect those who promoted obscene devices for a bona fide medical,psychiatric,judicial,legislative,or law enforcement purpose.violating the statute can result in punishment of up to two years in jail 
in essence,the statute criminalizes the selling,advertising,giving,or lending of a device designed or marketed for sexual stimulation unless the defendant can prove that the device was sold,advertised,given,or lent for a purpose.the statute,however,does not prohibit the use or possession of sexual devices for any purpose.
besides texas,only three states have a similar statute mississippi alabama and virginia the mississippi supreme court has upheld its state statute against first and fourteenth amendment challenges neither the alabama nor virginia supreme court has entertained a challenge to its state statute,but the eleventh circuit has rejected a fourteenth amendment challenge to alabama statute on the other hand,while the legislatures of louisiana,kansas,and colorado had enacted statutes,each of their respective state supreme courts struck down its law on fourteenth amendment grounds likewise,while the georgia legislature had passed an statute,the eleventh circuit recently struck it down 
ii.this proceeding 
reliable consultants,dreamer and le rouge boutique operates four retail stores in texas that carry a stock of sexual devices.the sexual devices are for,private use.phe,adam eve,is also engaged in the retail distribution of sexual devices.it operates no public facilities in texas,but rather sells sexual devices by internet and mail,and it distributes sexual devices ordered in texas by mail and common carrier.reliable and phe desire to increase their sale of,and advertising for,sexual devices in texas,and they fear prosecution under the statute if they do so.
reliable filed this declaratory action to challenge the constitutionality and enjoin the enforcement of the statutory provisions criminalizing the promotion of sexual devices.the complaint alleged that these provisions violate the substantive liberty rights protected by the fourteenth amendment and the commercial speech rights protected by the first amendment.later,phe intervened as a plaintiff and sought similar relief.
reliable and phe contend that many people in texas,both married and unmarried,use sexual devices as an aspect of their sexual experiences.for some couples in which one partner may be physically unable to engage in intercourse,or in which a contagious disease,such as hiv,precludes intercourse,these devices may be one of the only ways to engage in a safe,sexual relationship.others use sexual devices to treat a variety of therapeutic needs,such as erectile dysfunction.courts scrutinizing bans in other states have explained that an extensive review of the medical necessity for sexual devices shows that it is common for trained experts in the field of human sexual behavior to use sexual aids in the treatment of their male and female patients sexual problems.still other individuals use sexual devices for personal reasons,such as a desire to refrain from premarital intercourse 
the district court held,inter alia,that the statute does not violate the fourteenth amendment because there is no constitutionally protected right to publicly promote obscene devices.plaintiffs appeal the judgment granting the motion to dismiss.we review the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo the court accepts all facts as true,viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,the plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.
with those standards in mind,we hold that the statute violates the fourteenth amendment.
iii.the fourteenth amendment 
the plaintiffs claim is predicated upon the individual right under the fourteenth amendment to engage in private intimate conduct in the home without government intrusion.because the asserted governmental interests for the law do not meet the applicable constitutional standard announced in lawrence texas the statute can not be constitutionally enforced.
the state argues that plaintiffs,who distribute sexual devices for profit,can not assert the individual rights of their customers.this argument fails under the supreme court precedent holding that bans on commercial transactions involving a product can unconstitutionally burden individual substantive due process rights and lawsuits making this claim may be brought by providers of the product.in the landmark case of griswold connecticut,which invalidated a ban on the use of contraceptives,the court recognized that the plaintiff pharmacists have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the married people with whom they had a professional relationship.other supreme court cases hold that businesses can assert the rights of their customers and that restricting the ability to purchase an item is tantamount to restricting that item use in line with these cases,the statute must be scrutinized for impermissible burdens on the constitutional rights of those who wish to use sexual devices.
to determine the constitutional standard applicable to this claim,we must address what right is at stake.plaintiffs claim that the right at stake is the individual substantive due process right to engage in private intimate conduct free from government intrusion.the state proposes a different right for the plaintiffs the right to stimulate one genitals for purposes unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship.the court in it overruled its decision in bowers and struck down texas sodomy our decision 
to say that the issue in bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward,just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse.the laws involved in bowers and here are,to be sure,statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act.their penalties and purposes,though,have more consequences,touching upon the most private human conduct,sexual behavior,and in the most private of places,the home 
the right the court recognized was not simply a right to engage in the sexual act itself,but instead a right to be free from governmental intrusion regarding the most private human contact,sexual behavior.that lawrence recognized this as a constitutional right is the only way to make sense of the fact that the court explicitly chose to answer the following question in the affirmative we granted certiorari to resolve whether petitioners criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violate their vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the state also argues that lawrence does not apply because the court there was concerned with how the statute targeted a specific class of people.justice concurred in the majority decision in lawrence because she would have struck down the law on equal protection,not substantive due process,grounds but the court explicitly rested its holding on substantive due process,not equal protection as discussed,the court concluded that the sodomy law violated the substantive due process right to engage in consensual intimate conduct in the home free from government intrusion.once lawrence is properly understood to explain the contours of the substantive due process right to sexual intimacy,the case plainly applies.
because of lawrence,the issue before us is whether the texas statute impermissibly burdens the individual substantive due process right to engage in private intimate conduct of his or her choosing.contrary to the district court conclusion,we hold that the texas law burdens this constitutional right.an individual who wants to legally use a safe sexual device during private intimate moments alone or with another is unable to legally purchase a device in texas,which heavily burdens a constitutional right.this conclusion is consistent with the decisions in carey and griswold,where the court held that restricting commercial transactions unconstitutionally burdened the exercise of individual rights.indeed,under this statute it is even illegal to lend or give a sexual device to another person this further restricts the exercise of the constitutional right to engage in private intimate conduct in the home free from government intrusion.it also undercuts any argument that the statute only affects public conduct.
the dissent relegates the burden on this right to rational basis review.the state says we have two alternatives strict scrutiny if lawrence established this right as a fundamental right or rational basis review if lawrence did not.there has been debate about this and the eleventh circuit concluded that lawrence did not establish a fundamental right 
the supreme court did not address the classification,nor do we need to do so,because the court expressly held that individual decisions by married persons,concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship,even when not intended to produce offspring,are a form of liberty protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.moreover,this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.the court also carefully delineated the types of governmental interests that are constitutionally insufficient to sustain a law that infringes on this substantive due process right.therefore,our responsibility as an inferior federal court is mandatory and straightforward.we must apply lawrence to the texas statute 
the state primary justifications for the statute are morality based.the asserted interests include discouraging prurient interests in autonomous sex and the pursuit of sexual gratification unrelated to procreation and prohibiting the commercial sale of sex.
these interests in public morality can not constitutionally sustain the statute after lawrence to uphold the statute would be to ignore the holding in lawrence and allow the government to burden consensual private intimate conduct simply by deeming it morally offensive.in lawrence,texas only argument was that the law reflected the moral judgment of the legislature the court expressly rejected the state rationale by adopting justice stevens view in bowers as controlling and quoting justice stevens statement that the fact that the governing majority in a state has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.thus,if in lawrence public morality was an insufficient justification for a law that restricted adult consensual intimacy in the home,then public morality also can not serve as a rational basis for texas statute,which also regulates private sexual intimacy 
perhaps recognizing that public morality is an insufficient justification for the statute after lawrence,the state asserts that an interest the statute serves is the protection of minors and unwilling adults from exposure to sexual devices and their advertisement.it is undeniable that the government has a compelling interest in protecting children from improper sexual expression however,the state generalized concern for children does not justify such a restriction on the exercise of a constitutionally protected individual right ultimately,because we can divine no rational connection between the statute and the protection of children,and because the state offers none,we can not sustain the law under this justification.
the alleged governmental interest in protecting unwilling adults from exposure to sexual devices is even less convincing.the court has consistently refused to burden individual rights out of concern for the protection of unwilling recipients.furthermore,this asserted interest bears no rational relation to the restriction on sales of sexual devices because an adult can not buy a sexual device without making the affirmative decision to visit a store and make the purchase.
the state argues that if this statute,which proscribes the distribution of sexual devices,is struck down,it is equivalent to extending substantive due process protection to the commercial sale of sex.not so.the sale of a device that an individual may choose to use during intimate conduct with a partner in the home is not the sale of sex prostitution.following the state logic,the sale of contraceptives would be equivalent to the sale of sex because contraceptives are intended to be used for the pursuit of sexual gratification unrelated to procreation.this argument can not be accepted as a justification to limit the sale of contraceptives.the comparison highlights why the focus of our analysis is on the burden the statute puts on the individual right to make private decisions about consensual intimate conduct.furthermore,there are justifications for criminalizing prostitution other than public morality,including promoting public safety and preventing injury and coercion 
just as in lawrence,the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct.the case is not about public sex.it is not about controlling commerce in sex.it is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct.this is an insufficient justification for the statute after lawrence.
it follows that the texas statute can not define sexual devices themselves as obscene and prohibit their sale nothing here said or held protects the public display of material that is obscene as defined by the supreme,the language in section a of this statute,excluding the words in the provision defining as obscene any device designed or marketed for sexual stimulation.whatever one might think or believe about the use of these devices,government interference with their personal and private use violates the constitution.
appellants urge us to sustain their first amendment claim to protect the advertisement of these devices.we decline to explore this claim because if it is necessary,it may be premature.advertisements of the devices could be prohibited if they are obscene as defined by the supreme court or by the bulk of section a.but the state may not prohibit the promotion or sale of a bed,even one specially designed or marketed for sexual purposes,by merely defining it as obscene.we have held here that the state may not burden the use of these devices by prohibiting their sale.if other issues need to be pursued,the parties are free to do so on remand in proceedings consistent with this decision.
judgment reversed and the case remanded.
concerning federalism and comity,few actions are more than holding a state statute unconstitutional.to make matters worse,it is indeed rare to do so while,as here,reviewing a federal rule of civil procedure b dismissal of challenges to the statute.notwithstanding the best of intentions,the esteemed majority goes astray in both regards for the fourteenth amendment claim.
for the texas statute at issue,i concur in vacating the dismissal of the first amendment claim advertising and remanding it for further proceedings,if any.on the other hand,the invalidation of the statute is legally incorrect for the fourteenth amendment claim sale.the dismissal of that claim should be affirmed.accordingly,regarding that claim,i must respectfully dissent.
the statute prohibits,inter alia,the sale or other promotion,such as advertising,of obscene devices those designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs.penal code ann.a id.see also id.a b ii.such devices include,but are not limited to,a dildo or artificial vagina.id.at a.the statute provides an affirmative defense for persons who possess or promote obscene devices for a bona fide medical,psychiatric,judicial,legislative,or law enforcement purpose.id.at f.
plaintiffs complaints claim the statute unconstitutionally restricts commercial speech advertising under the first amendment,as incorporated by the fourteenth amendment.the complaints also claim the sale portion of the statute violates substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment because it impinges upon the right to engage in private intimate conduct without governmental intrusion.see lawrence texas,d.reliable consultants,also presents an additional claim under a parallel provision in the texas constitution.that claim is subsumed within the following discussion of the federal constitutional claim.
the complaints,however,do not include plaintiffs advertisements,if any,or describe with any specificity the sexual devices they seek to sell.the complaints were dismissed for failure to state a claim under rule b.
for starters,and contrary to the majority position,opn.at,the proscribed conduct is not private sexual conduct.instead,for obscene devices,the statute proscribes only the sale or other promotion such as advertising of those devices,including,but not limited to,a dildo or artificial vagina.
for our de novo review of a rule b dismissal,we,needless to say,accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and examine whether the allegations state a claim sufficient to avoid dismissal,grisham united states,cir citation omitted.to avoid such dismissal,the complaint must provide enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.factual allegations in the complaint must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.id.at quotation marks,citations,and footnote omitted.in other words,with some exceptions,our review is limited to the complaint,including any attachments.see hogan city of houston,cir fin.acquisition partners lp blackwell,cir allowing review of documents in the public record citation omitted.
as the majority properly holds,the claim advertising may be premature.opn.at.this is especially true for an challenge,which may be the only basis for seeking to have the statute held unconstitutional for that claim.see board of trustees of suny fox,d quoting ohralik ohio state bar ass n,d see also richard fallon,and facial challenges and standing,harv.revv,discussing challenges as the only basis for attacking statute on commercial speech grounds.
for example,as noted supra,the complaints neither include nor describe the advertising,if any,plaintiffs seek to utilize.on the other hand,pursuant to rule,only notice pleadings are required.on that basis,plaintiffs have perhaps stated a claim sufficient to withstand a rule b dismissal.
as the majority holds,that issue should not be decided today.no authority need be cited for another bedrock principle underlying federalism and comity federal courts,if possible,should avoid ruling on constitutional issues.the delicate power of pronouncing a statute unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.united states raines,d.remanding the claim avoids the premature interpretation of a statute in an area where its constitutional application is cloudy.id.
accordingly,i concur in the majority vacating the dismissal of the claim and remanding it for further proceedings,if any.
my disagreement with the majority analysis of the fourteenth amendment claim is fundamental.in my view,the district court correctly ruled plaintiffs fail to state such a claim.
the majority avoids determining what level of scrutiny to apply to the claim,stating only 
the supreme court did not address the classification of the level of scrutiny,nor do we need to do so,because the court expressly held that individual decisions by married persons,concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship,even when not intended to produce offspring,are a form of liberty protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.moreover,this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.
opn.at quoting lawrence,at.i believe,however,that the level of scrutiny to be employed is of critical importance to our review.
for the reasons stated by the eleventh circuit in its analysis of a statute materially identical to the one in issue,i conclude lawrence declined to employ a analysis,choosing instead to apply review.see williams attorney of,cir citation omitted see also lawrence,at.the texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.emphasis added lawrence,at.scalia,dissenting not once does the court describe homosexual sodomy as a fundamental right or a fundamental liberty interest,nor does it subject the texas statute to strict scrutiny.instead,having failed to establish that the right to homosexual sodomy is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,the court concludes that the application of texas statute to petitioners conduct fails the test.
furthermore,as also held by the eleventh circuit,i agree that,t o the extent lawrence rejects public morality as a legitimate government interest,it invalidates only those laws that target conduct that is both private and.williams morgan,cir.emphasis added,cert.denied,williams king,d.the texas statute regulates,inter alia,the sale of what it defines as obscene devices.obviously,such conduct is both public and commercial.
therefore,i would hold pursuant to the standard of review,plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the fourteenth amendment.
for the foregoing reasons,i concur in vacating the dismissal of the first amendment claim advertising the dismissal,however,of the fourteenth amendment claim sale should be upheld.therefore,i must respectfully dissent from my brothers invalidation of the statute on that basis.
