addendum to brief for appellant at defendant exhibit fiscal year oracle americas compensation plan,license sales terms and conditions.it is undisputed that the plan was a binding contract between oracle and brozo for the period of brozo employment.
brozo was hired by oracle in october,four months into the fiscal year.at the time of his hire,oracle was pursuing a sale of application software to fingerhut corporation fingerhut.brozo was hired with the understanding that he would work on the fingerhut deal,which he did.on may,oracle and fingerhut closed the deal,a dollar application software agreement.brozo was initially given a quota credit for the fingerhut transaction in excess of million.that quota credit would have generated a commission of nearly million.to address that matter,oracle subsequently decided to cap brozo total quota credits for the fiscal year at of his annual quota,which in effect capped his commissions.consequently,his commissions for fiscal year were approximately less than they would have been with the quota credit.brozo resigned on november.his total compensation for the eight months of his employment in fiscal year totaled approximately in salary and commissions.
brozo brought the present action alleging breach of contract and related claims.in his complaint,brozo claimed that oracle owed him substantial commissions,based upon the commission he allegedly earned,but was not fully paid,for the fingerhut deal.appellant appendix at complaint.brozo also alleged in the complaint that,when his supervisor,reed olson,told him that his commission for the fingerhut transaction was being capped,olson gave the following reasons he had not been on board long enough at oracle he allegedly had not worked hard enough on the final approval of the contract wording with oracle internal legal and revenue recognition departments and oracle allegedly had the right to cap a commission previously earned by a salesperson.id.
the parties filed for summary judgment,asserting entitlement to judgment as a matter of law based upon terms of the plan which they argued unambiguously supported their respective positions.the district court denied the parties summary judgment motions.the district court explained the documents relied upon by the parties in support of their respective summary judgment motions are ambiguous that is,they are susceptible of more than one meaning.brozo oracle,july,order.
at trial,brozo presented evidence to show that,before he was hired by oracle,he was a highly successful salesperson with over thirty years of experience that he was specifically hired to work on the fingerhut deal and that he became the lead person on the fingerhut transaction,which required of him hundreds of hours over a period of many months.brief for appellee at.he earned a quota credit for the fingerhut deal and accordingly earned a commission of approximately million under the terms of the plan.however,after the fingerhut transaction closed,a personal conflict arose between him and olson.according to brozo,he had played a practical joke on olson while they were on a fishing trip,which caused olson some embarrassment.phil ward,another oracle salesperson who had been involved in the practical joke,testified that olson said that he was going to teach brozo a lesson by reducing brozo commission on the fingerhut deal.a few days after the fishing trip,olson sent an message to his supervisor,mike rosser,in which he recommended that brozo commission for the fingerhut deal be reduced.thereafter,oracle made a retroactive manual adjustment and reduced brozo earned commissions by for fiscal year.
oracle introduced evidence to show that brozo did not do as much work on the fingerhut transaction as he claimed.because the fingerhut deal was a single transaction that clearly had generated a quota credit greater than brozo annual quota,senior vice president mary anne gillespie flagged it as requiring review.based on her observations of brozo contribution and on recommendations she received from brozo supervisors,gillespie decided that the appropriate treatment was to cap brozo total quota credits for fiscal year at of his annual quota,thereby still allowing him to earn almost for his eight months of employment with oracle during fiscal year.
prior to the submission of the case to the jury,oracle requested that the district court include the following jury instructions w hether or not commissions have in fact been earned depends upon the particular,unique requirements of the employer policy and w here a contract provides that an employer retains discretion to determine amounts payable under a compensation plan,that term is valid and enforceable.the district court declined to submit these proposed instructions to the jury.the jury returned a special verdict finding that oracle had committed a breach of contract resulting in damages to brozo in the amount of.
oracle moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial.in support of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,oracle again maintained that the plan unambiguously gave oracle the discretion to implement a cap on brozo commissions for fiscal year.oracle further argued that,under vigoro,crisp,cir vigoro,this discretionary business decision was beyond judicial review.brozo moved for prejudgment interest,a statutory penalty,attorneys fees and costs.the district court held a hearing on the pending motions on november.thereafter,the district court entered a memorandum,opinion,and order denying oracle motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial and granting brozo request for prejudgment interest,a statutory penalty,attorneys fees,and costs.brozo oracle,memorandum opinion and order hereinafter slip op.
in denying oracle motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court first rejected oracle renewed argument that the plan unambiguously granted oracle the discretion to review and revise brozo commissions.
the district court reasoned 
the applicable language is ambiguous it does not give to oracle unfettered discretion to deduct or limit amounts otherwise payable under oracle incentive compensation plan.oracle points to language giving it the right to change the plan at any time,sec.ii,terms and conditions,and the right to determine the appropriate treatment of the transaction under the plan.individualized compensation plan,passage in isolation,these may appear unambiguous,but in the context of the individualized compensation plan and the terms and conditions,the urged interpretation simply makes no sense.without regard to the trial testimony which clearly contradicted oracle interpretation,oracle construction would convert what is clearly an employment contract into nothing more than a we pay you whatever we want and we let you know our decision whenever we at the end of the fiscal year when performed up to expectations arrangement.
the district court further rejected oracle argument based on vigoro,commenting that oracle seem ed to be now guided really misguided by the language in vigoro when a contract term leaves a decision to the discretion of one party,that decision is virtually unreviewable.id.at.the district court continued 
the present case is not,however,one in which the contract terms leave to the discretion of one party the how,when and under what circumstances to pay an employee for performance.in vigoro,the incentive compensation plan permitted the employer to deduct amounts management deems appropriate as a penalty for mismanagement in exercising its rights under this provision,management decided that the employee deserved no incentive bonus in a year in which he breached his duty of loyalty by soliciting employees and customers to join him in a competing venture.that type of employee misconduct will be penalized almost anywhere.clearly the facts of vigoro render the holding there inapplicable here.the documents here have no standards to be employed and are not limited to misconduct such as occurred in vigoro.
id.at emphasis original internal citations omitted.
following the district court entry of final judgment in favor of brozo,oracle appealed.
discussion 
oracle argues that the district court erred in holding that the plan is ambiguous.we review de novo the question of whether or not contract language is ambiguous.see,barry barry,cir.a contract is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation,considering the context in which the words are used and giving them their plain and ordinary meaning.see id.at this stage,we must decide whether or not the plan is ambiguous without considering extrinsic evidence,the jury decision,or our own views of how the contract could have been written or performed more fairly.see,federal deposit insur.hartford accid.indem,cir a court must not impose its own concept of fairness under the guise of construing a contract.
brozo argues that the lack of specificity in the plan as to when a commission is earned and whether the plan allows for capping commissions renders the plan ambiguous.for example,brozo argues,the phrase appropriate treatment of the transaction under the plan in part.of the plan is never defined and,therefore,it is unclear whether capping a commission can be such appropriate when the plan expressly allows capping of a milestone bonus.as to the reference to a company vice president authority to review a single transaction for which the quota credits exceed the salesperson annual quota,brozo argues that this does not unambiguously give the officer the authority to change the amount of the commission but,rather,could also simply mean that the vice president may review an earned commission to ensure that all the i are dotted and t are crossed before the commission is paid.brief for appellee at.brozo also contends that the plan interpretation urged by oracle is draconian,would render almost the entire agreement superfluous,and simply does not make sense.under rules of contract interpretation,brozo continues,a contract will not be read so as to lead to a harsh or absurd result.brozo also emphasizes that oracle asked him to sign an amended version of the plan for fiscal year which would have expressly capped his commissions at of his annual goal.then,in fiscal year,oracle amended the plan documents to cap every salesperson total annual commissions at of his or her annual goal.neither of these actions would have been necessary,brozo suggests,if the language in the original plan did indeed clearly and unambiguously give oracle the right to retroactively impose such a cap on any salesperson commissions at any time prior to payment.
there is no dispute that the plan represents an agreement between oracle and brozo regarding the terms and conditions by which brozo incentive compensation would be determined.as noted above,part.of the plan sets forth the following language 
the company shall make the final and binding determination of any amount payable under the plan and reserves the right to change the plan at any time,during or after the close of the fiscal year.changes may be to salaries,bonuses,commissions,commission rates,quotas,territories or any other terms and conditions.changes to the plan are valid only if approved at the vice president level or higher in accordance with sales planning practices.entitlement to commissions and bonuses does not vest until the company makes any and all final changes as authorized by the plan.
addendum to brief for appellant at defendant exhibit fiscal year oracle americas compensation plan,license sales terms and conditions.
part.of the plan adds 
for any single transaction that generates quota credit equal to or greater than the salesperson annual quota,management at the vice president level or higher will review the transaction and determine the appropriate treatment of the transaction under the plan.
at the hearing on the parties motions,the district court indicated its view that the phrase appropriate treatment in part.in the plan was ambiguous.see appellant appendix at transcript of hearing on,referring to the phrase appropriate treatment,the district court stated i do know what that means.i really do.to me it could mean a lot of things i do read that to say you can then,basically after the fact,do anything you want with a commission.and as long as you are doing it for some business reason or at least not fraudulently that it okay.in the written order that followed,the district court reasoned that,while it might appear that this and other language in the plan unambiguously permitted oracle to make the challenged adjustment to brozo commissions,that interpretation makes no sense in the context of the overall contract because it would convert what is clearly an employment contract into nothing more than a we pay you whatever we want and we let you know our decision whenever we want at the end of the fiscal year when performed up to expectations arrangement.slip op.at.we disagree.
in the present case,the plan unambiguously delegated to oracle,acting through its officers at the vice president level and higher,the discretionary authority to decide upon appropriate treatment under the plan whenever a single transaction generated for brozo a quota credit equal to or greater than his annual quota.therefore,the need for a precise definition of words appropriate treatment under the plan was plainly obviated by the fact that the determination of what that might be was left to oracle sole discretion.the plan need not nor could not specify every possible form of appropriate treatment for every qualifying situation.moreover,the delegation of discretionary authority is no less clear because the plan expressly mentions some,but not all,possible forms of appropriate treatment,a cap on bonus or because oracle subsequently attempted to add an express cap on commissions to the plan.
when a contract term leaves a decision to the discretion of one party,that decision is virtually unreviewable.at most,courts will step in when the party who would assume the role of sole arbiter is charged with fraud,bad faith,or a grossly mistaken exercise of judgment.vigoro,at emphasis added citing amant kidde,cir per curiam,and quoting golden kentile floors,cir.under our precedents,therefore,the district court was constrained from intervening in oracle business decision absent sufficient evidence of fraud,bad faith,or gross mistake of judgment.this is not to suggest that oracle had a completely unfettered right to pay brozo whatever it wanted,whenever it wanted,regardless of brozo performance it is to say,however,that,although oracle decision might have been unfair,it may nevertheless be out of our reach.moreover,while it is clear that the facts in the present case are different from the facts in,for example,the plaintiff in vigoro had engaged in employee factual differences do not diminish the applicability of vigoro rule generally precluding judicial review of a discretionary business decision made pursuant to an unambiguous contractual delegation of discretionary authority.rather,such factual considerations weigh into the analysis of whether or not the business decision involved bad faith,fraud,or a gross mistake of judgment.see vigoro,in this case,vigoro management decided that crisp deserved no incentive bonus in a year in which he breached his duty of loyalty this can not be called a bad faith or grossly mistaken exercise of judgment.
in the district court,in response to oracle motion for judgment as a matter of law,brozo distinguished the present case from vigoro and argued that vigoro therefore does not apply.brozo did not argue,however,that oracle had engaged in fraud,bad faith,or a grossly mistaken exercise of judgment within the meaning of vigoro.brozo argues for the first time on appeal that oracle actions amounted to a fraud,bad faith,or a gross mistake of judgment.he argues 
oracle claims that under the vigoro standard,brozo can not show that it acted fraudulently,in bad faith,or committed any gross ly mistaken exercise in judgment.oracle argument conveniently ignores evidence presented at trial suggesting otherwise,including the fact that reed olson recommended that brozo commission be capped to punish him and teach him a lesson or that brozo was the only sales representative at oracle to be capped.
brief for appellee at.
we consider a newly raised argument only if it is purely legal and requires no additional factual development,or if a manifest injustice would otherwise result.orr stores,cir.brozo argument is not a purely legal one because it requires a factual finding that oracle did engage in fraud,bad faith,or a grossly mistaken exercise of judgment.moreover,no manifest injustice would result from our treating it as waived because brozo only viable argument is that oracle acted in bad faith,and minnesota does not recognize an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in employment contracts.see hunt ibm mid.am.employees fed.credit union,w e have not read an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing into employment contracts.singleton christ the servant evangelical lutheran church.minnesota law does not recognize implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing in employment contracts,cert.denied,d.
in sum,we hold that the plan unambiguously gave oracle the discretion to reduce brozo commissions for fiscal year and that,under vigoro,judicial review of oracle discretionary decision is not warranted.the district court erred in denying oracle motion for judgment as a matter of law.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we reverse the district court denial of oracle motion for judgment as a matter of law.we vacate the jury verdict and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
i dissent to point out the blatant error in the majority interpretation of the contract.the test of whether a contract is ambiguous,thus allowing extrinsic evidence to be admitted before a jury as the trial court did here,or whether the contract is unambiguous as the majority finds,turns on whether reasonable minds might differ as to the meaning of the terms of the contract.in the present case,the district court was privy to all of the evidence and heard the arguments of both sides whether the contract was ambiguous.to urge that the district court acted unreasonably ignores the express language of the entire contract as well as the district court comments and findings.in interpreting the contract,the majority has substituted a twisted version of what the contract means without considering the plain wording embodied within the contract.although the majority gives lip service to the fact that the contract expressly provides that only bonuses may be capped,it gives little meaning to this significant language.there is no language in the contract that says a commission,after it has been earned,may be capped.the fact that the contract provides only for bonuses to be capped and not commissions is given little or no weight by the majority.this in itself is significant error.the majority has found a way to cap brozo commission by taking language in the contract completely out of context.
there are other legal concerns surrounding the construction of the contract by the majority.first,the majority failed to take into consideration all of the facts and circumstances,including the conduct of the parties,surrounding the contract and the reliance that the parties have placed upon it.see restatement second of contracts see also richard lord,williston on contracts,at ed.second,the majority has failed to give a coherent and consistent meaning to all terms in the contract.see lord,supra,at,at.third,the majority overlooks that the ultimate interpretation of the contract should be reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious and should reflect a just result.see id.at stating interpretations which render the contract fair and reasonable are preferred to those which render the contract harsh or unreasonable to one party.in the present case,the majority has ignored these principles.the majority opinion states that an employer can change an employee compensation after the employee work is completed and the compensation is earned.i challenge the majority to find any contract that has ever been interpreted in such a nonsensical way.as the district court observed,oracle interpretation of the contract now adopted by the majority makes no sense.even if we assume the contract is not ambiguous,the majority overlooks that when brozo was hired,he was presented a copy of a standard individual compensation plan which reflected a cap on bonuses but not on commissions.the majority ignores the terms of compensation within the contract as to when an employee earns a commission the contract provides that brozo compensation expressly depended upon the credits that were earned and there is a specific provision of the contract that states the credits are earned upon booking or revenue recognition.the majority overlooks section iv of the contract which provides that certain revenues,such as license revenues,would be earned percent upon revenue recognition and when this occurred,oracle revenue recognition department recognized the revenue as a guaranteed receivable.the contr
