we granted review in the present case to determine whether,in order to state a claim under civil code section,subdivision a,the relevant remedial provision of the unruh civil rights act,et also hereinafter sometimes referred to as the act,plaintiffs must demonstrate that they affirmatively requested nondiscriminatory treatment and were refused 
as we shall explain,we conclude that the text of the act does not support defendant and the court of appeal assertion that,in order to recover under the act,plaintiffs who are discriminated against when they present themselves at a business establishment and pay the price of admission also must demand equal treatment and be refused.nor do we believe it would be consistent with the policy of the act,or with our case law,to read such a requirement into the language of the act.accordingly,the judgment rendered by the court of appeal is reversed.
plaintiffs marc angelucci,edgar pacas,elton campbell,and jeff kent filed a complaint against century supper club the club for violation of the unruh civil rights act and the gender tax repeal act of the complaint alleged that plaintiffs patronized the club on several occasions in june and july,and were charged an admission fee higher than that charged to women.specifically,the complaint alleged that two of the plaintiffs were charged for admission on june,although the admission fee for women was,that they again were charged for admission two days later,although women were admitted free,and that the other plaintiffs patronized the club on several occasions and experienced similar treatment.plaintiffs alleged they were charged higher prices because they are men they sought statutory damages under section,subdivision a section a,the relevant portion of the remedy provision of the unruh civil rights act and the related gender tax repeal act.
the club moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that plaintiffs could not recover under section a for violations of the unruh civil rights act or the gender tax repeal act,because they had not alleged they had asked the club to be charged at the same rate as female patrons defendant claimed that without having made such requests,plaintiffs could not prevail.the trial court agreed with defendant and entered judgment in its favor.
plaintiffs appealed and the court of appeal affirmed,holding that section a provides a remedy only to those plaintiffs who request nondiscriminatory treatment and are refused.the appellate court relied principally upon language in this court decision in koire metro car wash cal d,koire and characterized that case as holding that there must be an affirmative assertion of the right to equal treatment based on the fact that there can not be a discrimination or a denial of services unless services are requested.the principle is consistent with california law which holds that a plaintiff can not sue for discrimination in the abstract,but must actually suffer the discriminatory conduct.the court of appeal added that the requirement that the plaintiff demand equal treatment ensures that the statutes will be used to redress genuine grievances and to punish genuine misconduct,not by those who seek to exploit the law for financial gain,citing reese stores,th,d reese.the court of appeal concluded that its analysis would apply equally to plaintiffs claims under the unruh civil rights act and the gender tax repeal act,observing that the parties had not separately addressed the gender tax repeal act

in pertinent part,the act provides that a ll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,subd.b.
the act includes an enforcement provision that authorizes individual actions.section a provides that w hoever denies,aids or incites a denial,or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to section,or the gender tax repeal act,is liable for each and every offense for the actual damages,and any amount that may be determined by a jury,or a court sitting without a jury,up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars,and any attorney fees that may be determined by the court in addition thereto,suffered by any person denied the rights provided in section,or.
as we have declared in past cases,the act must be construed liberally in order to carry out its purpose.koire,supra,cal d at.the act expresses a state and national policy against discrimination on arbitrary grounds.burks poppy construction.cal d.its provisions were intended as an active measure that would create and preserve a nondiscriminatory environment in california business establishments by banishing or eradicating arbitrary,invidious discrimination by such establishments.isbister boys club of santa cruz,cal d,isbister referring to a legislative desire to banish such discriminatory practices from california community life koire,supra,cal d at,observing that the purpose expressed by the act and other enactments is the eradication of discrimination based upon sex in re cox cal d,speaking of a patent legislative purpose to interdict the arbitrary discrimination targeted by the act.
the act stands as a bulwark protecting each person inherent right to full and equal access to all business establishments,subd.b isbister,supra,cal d at.the act,like the common law principles upon which it was partially based,imposes a compulsory duty upon business establishments to serve all persons without arbitrary discrimination.marina point,wolfson cal d,see also warfield peninsula golf country club cal th,d.the act serves as a preventive measure,without which it is recognized that businesses might fall into discriminatory practices.isbister,supra,cal d at.
in interpreting a statute,we first consider its words,giving them their ordinary meaning and construing them in a manner consistent with their context and the apparent purpose of the legislation.fitch select products cal th,d.
as can be seen from the statutory language quoted above,the act does not contain express language requiring that before a legal action may be filed,the victim of the asserted discrimination must have demanded equal treatment and have been refused.unlike some other remedy statutes,the act,and specifically section a,does not establish as a condition of instituting a lawsuit that the defendant have been given notice and an opportunity to correct the asserted violation.compare,subd.f under the gender tax repeal act,a notice is required prior to filing suit premised upon the failure of a business establishment of a specified type to post notice of its prices and of its nondiscriminatory pricing policy see also,subd.a specifically requiring that one seeking damages for unfair or deceptive practices under the consumer legal remedies act et notify the person responsible for the violation and demand rectification days prior to filing suit health,subd.d requiring that private persons seeking damages for violation of the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act health,et provide notice to certain public entities and the alleged violator days prior to filing suit.
according to the court of appeal,however,plaintiffs were not denied their rights within the meaning of the act,because they did not suffer refusal of an express demand that defendant accord them equal treatment.the court of appeal pointed to statutory language it believed supported its conclusion.section a provides for a civil action against w hoever denies,aids or incites a denial,or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to the unruh civil rights act or the gender tax repeal act.according to the appellate court,there can not be a discrimination or denial of services unless services are requested.in essence,the court of appeal posited that the word denies as used in section a connotes only a responsive business establishment response to a demand for equal accommodation.
this linguistic argument is unpersuasive.dictionaries define the term deny as commonly meaning to withhold ballentine law dict.ed or to deprive.garner dict.of modern legal usage ed complaining that,although this usage is common,it is inaccurate.we note that the federal constitution uses the term deny in the equal protection clause and other provisions,but we are unaware of any authority supporting the startling proposition that a right acknowledged by these provisions is not denied if the victim is a passive sufferer of discrimination rather than a person who expressly demands his or her rights and is refused.see,amend.nor shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws see also,amend.the right of citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race,color,or previous condition of servitude,amend.the right of citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex,amend.the right of citizens who are eighteen years of age or older to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of age.and the language of section a permitting a private action against any business establishment that makes any discrimination or distinction in violation of the act,contains no implication whatsoever that a business establishment violates the act only if it refuses an express demand for equal treatment.
the interpretation offered by the court of appeal and endorsed by defendant also would be inconsistent with the purpose of the act to eradicate or eliminate arbitrary,invidious discrimination in places of public accommodation.as we have explained,the act imposes a duty upon business establishments to refrain from arbitrary discrimination.if businesses are held not to violate the act or inflict injury unless they are challenged by a patron,their ordinary practice may revert to discrimination,with special exceptions being made for individuals who happen to challenge the practice.contrary to the purpose of the act to eradicate discrimination,the court of appeal interpretation leaves business establishments free to advertise and provide discounts and,presumably,to engage in other forms of discrimination that violate the act,so long as these establishments agree to provide equal treatment to those customers knowledgeable and assertive enough to demand it.
it is instructive to consider early examples of unequal treatment on the basis of race that we found to constitute violations of the act predecessor civil rights statutes.in these cases,instances of racial segregation in the provision of accommodations were held to violate california antidiscrimination laws.violations occurred when ticket holders were admitted to a movie theater or racetrack clubhouse or gained access to a soda fountain,but,because of their race,were restricted to a segregated or otherwise substandard area.see suttles hollywood turf club d,hutson v.the owl drug,jones kehrlein.it would be absurd to conclude that such civil rights act violations occurred only when the patrons expressly demanded that their treatment be equivalent to that accorded the white patrons in those situations.actionable discrimination obviously occurred in these early such conduct would constitute discrimination under the current act.
the court of appeal interpretation also would leave without redress those persons who discover only after the fact that they have suffered discrimination in violation of the act.for example,an family seeking to purchase a home may not realize that the real estate agency they employed has discriminated against them on the basis of race by failing to disclose to them eligible homes in a neighborhood until after the agency has concluded its services.at that point a demand for equal treatment and a refusal on the part of the agency would be pointless.also denied redress under the foregoing interpretation would be persons discriminated against on an occasion when there was no one present to receive and answer a demand for equal treatment for example,persons encountering,as they did in past decades,racially segregated drinking fountains or restroom facilities at an unattended structure.
in support of its argument that relief under section a is limited to persons who demand equal treatment and are refused,defendant relies upon certain early decisions that also formed the basis for the court of appeal holding.these decisions are of no assistance to defendant.they arose in the context of a business establishment asserted discriminatory exclusion of patrons and stand at most for the proposition that persons who were not patrons of a business establishment or who did not present themselves for service or access as a patron and tender the price of admission did not adequately allege injury under the predecessor to the act.
in weaver pasadena tournament of roses cal d,the plaintiff alleged that he waited in line to purchase a ticket to the rose bowl football game but was unable to obtain one,because fewer tickets were available for sale than had been promised.the plaintiff sought to bring an action on behalf of all persons who stood in line for tickets but were unable to purchase them because of the shortfall.this court concluded the case was not actionable as a representative suit because the question,as to each individual plaintiff,was whether he or she presented himself or herself,demanded admittance to the game,and tendered the price of a ticket.id.at.thus the issue in weaver was whether the plaintiff,who properly had presented himself,sought admittance,and tendered the price of the ticket,could represent a class of persons who may not have done so.by contrast,in the present case,each plaintiff presented himself for admittance,paid the price of admission,and entered the establishment.see also bartlett hawaiian village,d,fn.denying class certification in litigation under the act because individual issues would such as whether each individual presented himself or herself for admission at the defendant nightclub.
in orloff hollywood turf club d,the plaintiff was ejected from a racetrack and was told he would not be admitted in the future.he sued under a predecessor to the act,seeking damages for his nonadmission on each day the track was open,claiming he was entitled to damages for the days he did not seek admission.the court rejected his claim for damages for days on which he had not presented himself for admission and tendered the price of a ticket,commenting that the defendant had no duty to the plaintiff under the act until the plaintiff tendered either an admission ticket or the price of admission.id.at.by contrast,again,in the present case plaintiffs did present themselves for admission and paid the price charged by defendant.it can not be said that defendant had no duty to refrain from discriminating under these circumstances.
defendant also claims its interpretation of the act is consistent with crowell isaacs d.crowell and hales ojai valley inn country club d.hales.in crowell,plaintiffs,white persons,filed suit against their real estate agent,under the predecessor to the act,for failing to seek out qualified purchasers for their home.the court held that the agent mere failure to seek out purchasers did not constitute discrimination against the plaintiff sellers.the court also observed that circumstances might exist in which mere quiescent inaction could constitute discrimination,providing the example of an agent failure to show a home to potential purchasers who contact the agent seeking a purchase in the style and price range of the home.crowell,at.
from this example of a situation not actually presented by the crowell case,defendant derives the rule that the plaintiffs must seek the very rights or access he or she claims was denied.but plaintiffs did seek access to defendant club.they do not accuse defendant in the present case of mere inaction,and the crowell decision does not support defendant view that a plaintiff must demand expressly that his or her rights be honored.the court example in crowell of potentially actionable conduct posited purchasers who desired a certain type of home,but did not suggest such purchasers would be required to demand that they be shown homes on the same basis as white potential purchasers.in addition,the court announced in crowell that the more significant ground for its decision was that the reason the plaintiffs were not entitled to a remedy was that it was not they who had been denied the rights guaranteed by the civil rights act,and that they did not purport to sue as representatives of other aggrieved persons.crowell,supra,d at.the white sellers in crowell were not the victims of any discrimination against persons,whereas in the present case plaintiffs were the persons who were disadvantaged by defendant discriminatory pricing.
defendant citation to hales,supra,d,is equally unhelpful.there the court determined that the plaintiff could state a claim under the act by alleging that when he entered a restaurant seeking food and drink,he was told he could not be served unless he wore a tie,but that at the same time the restaurant permitted female patrons to be served in less formal attire.nothing in the decision indicates that the plaintiff demanded that he receive the same treatment as female patrons,nor does the decision in any way establish such a requirement.d at.
according to the court of appeal,the requirement that a plaintiff request equal treatment and suffer denial ensures that the statutes will be used to redress genuine grievances and to punish genuine misconduct,not to assist those who seek to exploit the law for financial gain.in support of this conclusion,the court of appeal cited reese,supra,th,d.
in reese,supra,th,d,the plaintiff filed a motion for class certification in an action alleging violations of the unruh civil rights act and the gender tax repeal act,based upon practice of offering a ladies day discount at facilities that offered automotive oil changes.moved for summary judgment in the underlying action on the ground that the plaintiff deliberately had refrained from requesting to receive the discount,but the trial court denied the motion for summary judgment reese at,d,and the issue was not reached on appeal.rather,the issue on appeal was the propriety of the trial court order denying the plaintiff motion to certify the class.the court of appeal held that the trial court appropriately determined the plaintiff had not demonstrated that substantial benefits would accrue to the litigants or the courts from class treatment.the trial court appropriately could doubt that class certification was necessary to avoid multiple lawsuits.a multiplicity of claims was unlikely,because no other aggrieved party had brought suit over the years the discount had been offered and the plaintiff himself had generated his own injury by patronizing for the purpose of being denied the ladies day discount.stating it would not express an opinion on the propriety of the plaintiff substantive claim,the court of appeal concluded the trial court could reasonably conclude that it would likely not have to adjudicate a multiplicity of actions if the class was not certified.id.at,d.
as our description of the case makes plain,the decision in reese did not suggest that a plaintiff must demand equal treatment and be refused in order to be able to state a claim under the act.moreover,the court discussion in reese demonstrates that the safeguard proposed by the court of appeal in the present case might not meet its salutary goal.as the court in reese pointed out,the plaintiff in that case consulted his lawyer for the purpose of finding a lawsuit,and only subsequently presented himself to for service on ladies day.reese,supra,th at,d whereas most litigants consult with a lawyer after an injury to seek judicial redress,this client went to his lawyer to seek an injury for which he could claim judicial redress.it is precisely such a professional plaintiff,in contrast to the untutored victim of discrimination,who would possess the information necessary to enable him or her to comply with the court of appeal suggestion that plaintiffs be required to demand equal treatment and secure a refusal.
according to the court of appeal,under the circumstances alleged in the complaint,plaintiffs did not suffer an injury.but our decision in koire,supra,cal d,held that a business establishment policy of affording price discounts to female patrons purely on the basis of gender ordinarily constitutes unlawful discrimination against male patrons within the meaning of the act,and we concluded the plaintiffs in that case were injured within the meaning of the act when they presented themselves for admission and were charged the nondiscounted price 
in koire,supra,cal d,the plaintiff,a male,alleged that he had visited several car wash establishments on ladies day and requested services at the discounted rate offered to female customers.the businesses refused.the plaintiff also alleged that he visited bars that offered discounted admission prices to female patrons and that on one occasion,he visited a bar and asked for the free admission that was being accorded to female patrons,but was refused.the trial court granted judgment in favor of the defendant business owners after trial on the plaintiff unruh civil rights act claims,concluding that the discounts did not violate the act.
this court reversed the judgment rendered in favor of the defendants.we concluded that the language of the statute encompasses not solely access to business establishments,but also treatment of patrons.we also set forth the examples noted above of cases in which courts identified racial segregation within theaters and eating establishments as violative of the predecessor to the act.our opinion concluded the act proscription is broad enough to include within its scope discrimination in the form of price discounts.koire,supra,cal d at.
we rejected the defendants claim that price discounts do not constitute arbitrary discrimination within the meaning of the act.acknowledging the existence of circumstances in which either the patron conduct or the nature of the business establishment might warrant an exception to the act koire,supra,cal d at,we declined to extend such exceptions to price discounts of the type challenged in the case.id.at.
in response to the koire defendants claim that their price discounts did not injure either men or women and,specifically,did not injure the plaintiff,we commented that the act renders arbitrary sex discrimination by businesses per se injurious.koire,supra,cal d at.as we stated,section provides that all patrons are entitled to equal treatment.section provides for minimum statutory damages for every violation of section,regardless of the plaintiff actual damages.ibid.
moreover,we explained,the plaintiff suffered actual damage.referring to circumstances that also occurred in the present case,we observed the plaintiff was adversely affected by the price discount.his female peers were admitted to the bar free,while he had to pay.on the days he visited the car washes,he had to pay more than any woman customer,based solely on his sex.koire,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
finally,we predicted that our holding would not put an end to proper,non discriminatory promotional price discounts,and we described policies permitting,for example,discounts based upon age for children or older persons.koire,supra,cal d at,the fact that discounts are not permissible does not have an impact on the validity of discounts see also pizarro lamb players theatre th,d.we also acknowledged there might be public policies warranting differential treatment of male and female patrons under some circumstances,but t he plain language of the unruh act mandates equal provision of advantages,privileges and services in business establishments of this state.absent a compelling social policy supporting price differentials,such discounts violate the act.koire,supra,cal d at.
in sum,koire interpreted the act as broadly condemning any business establishment policy of price discounts.further,koire determined that injury occurs when the discriminatory policy is applied to the is,at the time the plaintiff patronizes the business establishment,tendering the nondiscounted price of admission.
even in light of the koire decision broad definition of injury,of course,a plaintiff must have standing to bring an action under the act.we do not dispute the court of appeal admonition that a plaintiff can not sue for discrimination in the abstract,but must actually suffer the discriminatory conduct.
in general terms,in order to have standing,the plaintiff must be able to allege is,some invasion of the plaintiff legally protected interests.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,see code civ,every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,except as otherwise provided by statute.
standing rules for actions based upon statute may vary according to the intent of the legislature and the purpose of the enactment.midpeninsula citizens for fair housing westwood investors d.see also librers black th,d.in essence,an individual plaintiff has standing under the act if he or she has been the victim of the defendant discriminatory act.midpeninsula citizens for fair housing westwood investors,supra,d at.standing under the act extends to persons actually denied full and equal treatment by a business establishment that is,to victims of the discriminatory practices.
plaintiffs adequately alleged they had suffered an invasion of legally protected interests witkin,cal.procedure,supra,pleading,sufficient to afford them an interest in pursuing their action vigorously.according to their allegations,each of the plaintiffs was subjected to,and paid,defendant price differential.accepting plaintiffs factual allegations as true,as we are required to do in reviewing a judgment entered on the pleadings,plaintiffs must be considered person s denied the rights provided in section.a.
the court of appeal and defendant assert that in koire,supra,cal d,we actually adopted their view of the nature of an injury under the act.in support,they rely upon a single sentence contained in a footnote appearing in the koire decision statement of facts.this reliance is unwarranted not only is it unreasonable to suppose that such a reference in a footnote in our statement of facts was intended to establish a new and essential element of a cause of action under the act,the conclusion advanced by a violation or injury occurs only after a demand for equal treatment has been contrary to our legal analysis in koire and to the purpose of the act.
our statement of facts in koire recounted that the plaintiff visited several car wash establishments on ladies day and was refused when he asked to be charged the same price as women customers.the plaintiff in that case also asked to be charged the same night club admission fee as women patrons and was refused.we footnoted the circumstance that in the instance of one of the car wash establishments,it was clear the plaintiff asked for equal treatment,but there was a factual dispute as to whether the defendant explicitly refused.the dispute was inconsequential,we explained,because whether or not defendant refused a request,it was undisputed that the car wash advertised a ladies day policy that forced male customers who sought the discount to ask for it affirmatively.we employed the following language there was conflicting testimony at trial about whether defendant state college car wash refused to wash plaintiff car for the reduced ladies day price.the trial court did not resolve the factual dispute,since it held as a matter of law that ladies day discounts do not violate the unruh civil rights act.state college car wash does not deny that it advertises special ladies day prices.at a minimum,men who wish to be charged the same price as women on ladies day must affirmatively assert their right to equal treatment.koire,supra,cal d at,fn.
the court of appeal declared the supreme court made the statement in a footnote,and the footnote appended to the sentence that tells us that most of the car washes refused plaintiff request for the discounted price.the supreme court reversed the judgment in favor of the defendants and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.the court thus directed the trial court to resolve the factual dispute in light of the holding that price discounts violate the unruh civil rights act.by so doing,it implicitly held that a denial of services is necessary to state a claim for price discrimination under the unruh civil rights act.further,the at a minimum language,following as it does the statement that defendant does not deny that it advertises special ladies day prices,establishes that mere ly advertising a price discount does not violate the unruh civil rights act.
the court of appeal misread our footnote in several ways.the quoted footnote can not be construed as a holding,implicit or otherwise,on any point of law.the footnote appears in a statement of facts,not in the context of any legal analysis.moreover,our point was not that a violation or injury would not occur under the act unless the defendant refused the plaintiff request to grant a discount.we found that the factual dispute concerning whether a particular defendant refused to grant the plaintiff a discount was of no consequence,because it was undisputed that the defendant had a discriminatory policy that would force men to ask for the discount if they wanted to receive it.the words a t a minimum noted that a man would be required to request to be treated equally if he was to have any chance of avoiding discriminatory treatment,the implication being that even such a request might not secure equal treatment.koire,supra,cal d at,fn.our remand order responded to the circumstance that the trial court apparently sitting as the trier of fact had granted judgment for the defendants primarily upon a legal is,its belief that price discounts do not violate the act.the trial court legal error in concluding that the act did not apply to price discounts undermined the entire judgment it rendered.our reversal signified that the entire matter could be retried.we did not direct the trier of fact to resolve any particular factual dispute.
most significantly,in the present case the court of appeal interpretation of the act is fundamentally inconsistent with the legal analysis contained in our koire decision.as noted,our actual discussion and analysis of the applicable legal principles concluded that price discounts,such as were alleged in that case,violated the act,that arbitrary gender discrimination is per se injurious,and that the particular plaintiff suffered actual injury because he paid more for admission or services than female patrons.koire,supra,cal d at.nothing in our discussion of the legal issues suggested the act is not violated and an injury does not occur unless the victim of discrimination not only tenders the price of admission but also demands equal treatment and is refused.
the trial court and the court of appeal interpretation of section a reflects in part defendant assertion that angelucci and the other men involved in the present case are professional plaintiffs who shake down business entities on the basis of assertedly technical violations of civil rights laws and similar enactments,and that they and their attorneys engage in this practice simply to make a by any desire to eliminate discrimination or to redress any actual injury.defendant claims that plaintiffs made repeated unannounced visits to defendant business establishment in order to increase the statutory damages they could seek for multiple violations of the act,and defendant accuses plaintiffs and their attorneys of being bounty
