introduction.
these consolidated appeals arise from fourteen plaintiffs negligence claims under california common law against various airlines collectively the airlines or for failing to warn about the danger of developing deep vein thrombosis and for providing an unsafe seating configuration on domestic flights.
this case presents the question of whether and to what extent the federal aviation act of the faa,and its corresponding regulations promulgated by the federal aviation administration regarding aviation safety,preempt state law standards of care,including any duty to warn about the risks of deep vein thrombosis dvt.we also address whether plaintiffs may recover for injuries sustained due to an allegedly unsafe seating configuration or whether such claims are preempted by the airline deregulation act of the ada,an economic measure designed by congress to prevent states from regulating airline prices,routes,and services.see b previously codified at app.a.
the district court found federal preemption in both instances.it held that the faa impliedly preempts the field of preflight warnings,and the court dismissed plaintiffs failure to warn claim as a matter of law.in re deep vein thrombosis,wl,at.march.it observed that congress intent in passing the faa was to preempt the entire field of air safety.it also rested its dismissal on the conflict between federal safety standards governing passenger warnings and any duty to warn.the district court further held that the ada preempts plaintiffs unsafe seating configuration claim,because any seating reconfiguration would impermissibly affect airline prices.id.
we affirm the district court dismissal of the failure to warn claim,but remand the seating configuration claim for further factual development.the faa and the relevant federal regulations preempt plaintiffs failure to warn claim,because the faa preempts the entire field of aviation safety through implied field preemption.the faa and regulations promulgated pursuant to it establish complete and thorough safety standards for air travel,which are not subject to supplementation by,or variation among,state laws.some circuits have considered whether federal law preempts discrete aspects of air safety.see,french pan am express,cir holding that the faa governs issues of pilot suitability,including submission to drug testing.the third circuit has gone one step further.see abdullah american airlines,cir.we adopt the third circuit broad,historical approach to hold that federal law generally establishes the applicable standards of care in the field of aviation safety.witty delta airlines,cir.because the faa preempts the entire field of aviation safety from state and territorial regulation,the airlines are under no obligation to warn of the risk of developing dvt,absent a federal mandate to do so.because there are no federal regulations requiring the airlines to warn about the risks of dvt,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs failure to warn claim.
the airlines preemption argument on the seating configuration claim presents a closer question.the airlines argue that any reconfiguration of airplane seating would decrease the number of seats and thus require a significant increase in ticket prices to offset the loss in revenue.they assert that triggering this increase would amount to an indirect regulation of airline fares,which is precluded by the ada.while the airlines may ultimately be correct,we remand this claim to the district court for further development,because on the basis of the record before us,there is an insufficient factual basis on which to conclude that any seat reconfiguration would have what the supreme court has described as the forbidden significant effect on airline ticket prices.see morales trans world airlines,d.
ii.background.
plaintiffs filed this suit on april,in state court against spirit airlines,northwest airlines,el al limited,american airlines,continental airlines,america west airlines,airways,and jetblue airlines.the facts underlying each of plaintiffs claims are largely identical.each plaintiff allegedly developed dvt after taking a transcontinental or flight.each also claims that prolonged,cramped seating during flight was the proximate cause of his dvt.dvt is a medical condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein,usually in the leg.it can cause serious complications if the clot breaks off and travels to an organ,most commonly to the lungs or brain.see witty,at.some of the plaintiffs in this litigation are in fact deceased as a result of the clots spreading to a vital organ.
in their initial complaint,plaintiffs raised common law personal injury claims against the airlines,as well as breach of warranty claims against various airplane manufacturers the.they claimed that the failed to warn about the risk of developing dvt,and that the airlines failed to inform passengers about steps they could have taken during flight to mitigate any risk.plaintiffs argued that at the time they took the flights on which they developed dvt,the airlines were aware or reasonably should have been aware that air travel can cause dvt and that resulting blood clots can sometimes result in serious injury or death.plaintiffs asserted that the airlines were aware of several measures that could prevent passengers from incurring dvt,such as walking around the cabin,exercising the legs while seated,or wearing special stockings.despite this alleged knowledge,the airlines gave no warnings regarding dvt.
in addition to the failure to warn claim,plaintiffs alleged that the airlines provided an unsafe seating configuration by limiting each passenger legroom.apart from the claims against the airlines,plaintiffs also brought suit against the,claiming they provided a seat design that was defective for the same reason.
defendants collectively removed the actions to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction in july.on june,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred all actions to judge vaughn walker of the northern district of california for coordinated proceedings.in re deep vein thrombosis,d.
the moved for summary judgment on the defective seat design claim,and the district court granted the motion.deep vein thrombosis,wl.with respect to the remaining state law claims,the filed a joint report and case management statement arguing that federal law preempts the failure to warn and unsafe seating configuration claims.the district court treated the report as a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b and requested briefing from the parties.after considering the arguments,the district court entered judgment for the airlines under federal rule of civil procedure b.id.it held that the airline deregulation act expressly preempts the unsafe seating configuration claim,because any required reconfiguration of seats would impermissibly affect prices.id.at.it also held that the federal aviation act impliedly preempts the failure to warn claim,because congress intended to occupy exclusively the field of passenger warnings.id.at.
plaintiffs pursue on appeal only the district court dismissal of their failure to warn claim and their unsafe seating configuration claim.they do not appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the for the defective seat design claim.
iii.preemption of the failure to warn claim.
it is that congress has the power to preempt state law.const.art.vi,cl.cipollone liggett group,d.it may do so expressly or impliedly.cipollone,at.congress intent may be explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.quoting jones rath packing,d id.nothing in the faa expressly preempts state regulation of air safety,so preemption,if any,must be implied.
there are two types of implied preemption conflict preemption and field preemption.courts may find conflict preemption when a state law actually conflicts with federal law or when a state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress in enacting the federal law.see shaw delta air lines,d holding that a state law was preempted by erisa insofar as the state law prohibited practices that were lawful under erisa crosby foreign trade council,d.implied preemption exists when federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.cipollone,at.citing fidelity fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.thus,field preemption occurs when congress indicates in some manner an intent to occupy a given field to the exclusion of state law.cipollone,at.in this case,we conclude that congress has indicated its intent to occupy the field of aviation safety.
while the comprehensiveness of a statute is one indication of preemptive intent,it alone is generally not sufficient to find that congress intended to occupy the entire field.skysign int l,honolulu,cir citing geier american honda motor,d.we may,however,also look to the pervasiveness of the regulations enacted pursuant to the relevant statute to find preemptive intent.fidelity fed.sav.loan ass n,at federal regulations have no less preemptive effect than statutes.this is because w here congress has entrusted an agency with the task of promulgating regulations to carry out the purposes of a statute,as part of the preemption analysis we must consider whether the regulations evidence a desire to occupy a field completely.reynolds tobacco durham county,d citation omitted.as a result,a regulation preemptive force does not depend on express congressional authorization to displace state law.id.instead,when an agency administrator promulgates pervasive regulations pursuant to his congressional authority,we may infer a preemptive intent unless it appears from the underlying statute or its legislative history that congress would not have sanctioned the preemption.id.
here,the regulations enacted by the federal aviation administration,read in conjunction with the faa itself,sufficiently demonstrate an intent to occupy exclusively the entire field of aviation safety and carry out congress intent to preempt all state law in this field.
we begin with congress intent,because our analysis of the scope of the statute preemption is guided by the comment that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.cipollone,at.the congressional purpose must be clear,for we are mindful of the adage that congress does not cavalierly preempt state law causes of action.medtronic,lohr,d.in this case,however,we are addressing an area of the law that has long been dominated by federal interests.as we have observed,regulation of this country airspace has a history of significant federal presence.skysign int l,at fidelity fed.sav.loan ass n,at.holding that preemptive intent is more readily inferred when the statute governs an area of the law where the federal interest is dominant.
the purpose,history,and language of the faa lead us to conclude that congress intended to have a single,uniform system for regulating aviation safety.the catalytic events leading to the enactment of the faa helped generate this intent.the faa was drafted in response to a series of fatal air crashes between civil and military aircraft operating under separate flight rules.see united states christensen,cir.to avoid future disasters and,as we have expressed it,to promote safety in aviation and thereby protect the lives of persons who travel on board aircraft,in re mexico city aircrash of october,cir,congress enacted the faa,the whole tenor of which was to create and enforce one unified system of flight rules.christensen,at see also world airways,int l brotherhood of teamsters,airline,cir.in discussing the impetus for the faa,the supreme court has also noted that regulating the aviation industry requires a delicate balance between safety and efficiency.it is precisely because of the interdependence of these factors that congress enacted a uniform and exclusive system of federal regulation.city of burbank lockheed air terminal,d citations omitted see also id.at.rehnquist,dissenting the paramount substantive concerns of congress in enacting the faa were to regulate federally all aspects of air safety,and,once aircraft were in flight,management northwest airlines,minnesota.jackson,concurring planes do not wander about in the sky like vagrant clouds.they move only by federal permission,subject to federal inspection,in the hands of federally certified personnel and under an intricate system of federal commands.
the legislative history of the faa further illustrates congress intent to make the federal aviation administration the sole arbiter of air safety.the house report for the faa explained in a section entitled purpose of legislation,that the administrator of the new federal aviation agency would be given full responsibility and authority for the promulgation and enforcement of safety regulations,reprinted in.in a letter to the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce,included as part of the house report,a representative of the executive branch wrote 
it is essential that one agency of government,and one agency alone,be responsible for issuing safety regulations if we are to have timely and effective guidelines for safety in aviation.
id.at.congress thus intended to ensure that the agency alone would have the power,if it chose to exercise it,to frame the rules for the safe and efficient use of the nation airspace.air line pilots ass n,int l quesada,cir.
the language of the act itself also illustrates that congress left open the door for the administrator to choose to preempt subfields of air commerce,including but not limited to aviation safety,through the use of its authority to develop regulations skysign int l,at citing b.the faa not only authorizes but affirmatively directs the administrator of the federal aviation administration to promulgate regulations for the safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce.congress also wrote into the faa a provision,which directs the administrator to regulate any other practices,methods,and procedure the administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce and national security.id.
thus,when we look to the historical impetus for the faa,its legislative history,and the language of the act,it is clear that congress intended to invest the administrator of the federal aviation administration with the authority to enact exclusive air safety standards.moreover,the administrator has chosen to exercise this authority by issuing such pervasive regulations that we can infer a preemptive intent to displace all state law on the subject of air safety.see fidelity fed.sav.loan ass n,at.these regulations codified in title of the code of federal regulations,cover,inter alia,airworthiness standards,crew certification and medical standards,and aircraft operating requirements.the regulations also include a general federal standard of care for aircraft operators,requiring that no person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another.a.most pertinently,a number of specific federal regulations govern the warnings and instructions which must be given to airline passengers.see pt.pt.these regulations require,for example,that no smoking placards be placed in lavatories,id.d,that no smoking signs be illuminated during the entire flight on flights,id.c,and that the fasten seat belt sign shall be turned on during any movement on the surface,for each takeoff,for each landing,and at any other time considered necessary by the pilot in command,id.b.in addition,the federal aviation administration has published regulations,id,and an advisory circular setting out in detail the oral briefings,familiar to all domestic air travelers,which flight attendants or other flight personnel must give passengers,as well as the information that must be included in passenger safety briefing cards.these briefings include warnings for passenger safety,such as seat backs must be in an upright position before takeoff and l
