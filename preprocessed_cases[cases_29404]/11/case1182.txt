this case of first impression in the ninth circuit requires us to consider whether congress has the authority under the commerce clause of the united states constitution,art.i,cl,to criminalize the possession by a felon of body armor that has been sold or offered for sale in interstate commerce.and a.put another way,the issue is whether the sale of body armor in interstate commerce creates a sufficient nexus between possession of the body armor and commerce to allow for federal regulation under congress commerce clause authority.
in recent years,the supreme court has significantly altered the landscape of congressional power under the commerce clause.see,united states morrison,d striking down statute that provided a federal civil remedy for victims of violence united states lopez,d striking down federal statute regulating possession of guns in school zones.nonetheless,the resolution to this case is found in supreme court and ninth circuit precedent that addresses a jurisdictional element nearly identical to the one that applies to.see scarborough united states,d concluding that,in the context of title vii of the omnibus crime control act,proof that a firearm traveled in interstate commerce satisfies the required nexus between possession of the firearm and commerce united states cortes,cir upholding carjacking statute and stating that the vitality of scarborough engenders significant debate,but u ntil the supreme court tells us otherwise we follow scarborough unwaveringly.we conclude that we are bound by this the supreme court or our en banc court telling us that the of body armor statute passes muster.
background 
cedrick alderman was arrested in during a sting operation involving an attempted controlled purchase of cocaine.officers were aware that alderman had been previously convicted of felony robbery see ser.the arresting officer discovered that alderman was wearing a bulletproof vest.ser.alderman was booked for possession of the vest and for violating the conditions of his supervision.see dkt.
because washington state law does not criminalize felon possession of body armor,the matter was referred to the federal authorities.alderman was indicted under a,which makes it unlawful for a person convicted of a felony involving a crime of violence to possess body armor.see james guelff and chris mccurley body armor act of,e a,criminalizing the possession of body armor by felons as of.
alderman filed a motion to suppress certain evidence he also sought dismissal of the indictment on various grounds,including that the statute was unconstitutional because its enactment exceeded congress authority under the commerce clause.see er.the district court denied all of alderman motions.alderman entered a conditional guilty plea.er.under the plea agreement,alderman preserved for appeal the disputed constitutionality of.see er as part of the factual basis for the plea,the plea agreement included alderman admission that the vest had crossed state lines.specifically,the vest was sold by the manufacturer in california to a distributor in washington state.the distributor then sold the vest to the washington state department of corrections.nothing in the record reveals how the vest left the department of corrections,but it is undisputed that the vest subsequently came into alderman possession.dkt.the stipulation and factual recitation were designed to ensure that the jurisdictional element of the statute was met.see a limiting the applicability of to vests that have been sold or offered for sale,in interstate or foreign commerce.
i.the statute 
we review a district court denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on constitutional grounds de novo.united states latu,cir.under,it is a crime for a person who has been convicted of a violent felony to purchase,own,or possess body armor.unlike the statutes at issue in lopez and morrison,is limited by an express jurisdictional jurisdictional hook limits the reach of to body armor that has been sold or offered for sale,in interstate or foreign commerce a.
congress enacted in response to a spate of violent clashes involving heavily armored assailants and comparatively unprotected police officers.the congressional findings cite as examples 
the murder of san francisco police officer james guelff by an assailant wearing layers of body armor,a bank shoot out in north hollywood,california,between police and heavily armed suspects outfitted in body armor,and the murder of captain chris mccurley of the etowah county,alabama drug task force by a drug dealer shielded by protective body armor.
confronted with the reality that nationally,police officers and ordinary citizens are facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry,body armor,and other sophisticated assault gear,congress concluded that a serious threat to community safety is posed by criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a violent crime.id.congress further found that crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear and existing federal controls over interstate traffic in body armor do not adequately enable the states to control this traffic within their own borders.id.in other words,as with guns and domestic strife,congress determined that felons and body armor are a potentially deadly combination nationwide.hayes,d.to address this threat,congress elected to forbid violent felons from possessing body armor that had been sold through interstate channels.
alderman argues that congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause when it enacted this legislation.we disagree.the supreme court has cautioned us that d ue respect for the decisions of a coordinate branch of government demands that we invalidate a congressional enactment only upon a plain showing that congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds.morrison,at.no such showing has been made here.we opt to follow the supreme court lead in scarborough.
ii.united states scarborough and related circuit cases 
we are guided in our analysis first and foremost by the supreme court decision in scarborough.in scarborough,the court addressed a jurisdictional element that is nearly identical to the one that limits.scarborough,at.quoting.as we outlined in cortes,the supreme court in scarborough considered whether proof that an illegally possessed firearm previously traveled in interstate commerce was sufficient to satisfy the nexus between possession of the firearm and commerce.at.the court answered affirmatively if the government proved that scarborough firearms had at some time traveled in interstate commerce,a sufficiently close nexus between possession of the firearms and commerce was established.id.as the supreme court explained it t here is no question that congress intended no more than a minimal nexus requirement.scarborough,at.thus,although the court did not address the statute from a constitutional perspective,it implicitly assumed the constitutionality of the in commerce requirement.it is difficult to distinguish our case from scarborough.
in considering the continuing vitality of scarborough,we have consistently upheld similar statutes.see,united states jones,cir upholding statute criminalizing felon possession of a firearm because the jurisdictional hook in the statute insures on a basis that the defendant actions implicate interstate commerce to a constitutionally adequate degree.quoting united states polanco,cir united states hanna,cir quoting scarborough,at,and stating that scarborough requires only the minimal nexus that the firearm have been,at some time,in interstate commerce.see also cortes,at upholding federal carjacking statute because,taken together,the context of the statute,congressional findings,and the requirement that the car affected have been transported in interstate commerce ensure that carjackings covered by substantially affect interstate commerce.
we are not alone in adhering to scarborough.in united states patton,the tenth circuit recently considered in light of scarborough and the supreme court commerce clause jurisprudence.cir.after conducting an exhaustive review of supreme court and circuit precedent,the tenth circuit pointed out that o ther circuits have similarly continued to follow scarborough and concluded that a lthough the body armor statute does not fit within any of the lopez categories,it is supported by the precedent of scarborough united states.id.at.the court emphasized that in scarborough,the supreme court assumed that congress could constitutionally regulate the possession of firearms solely because they had previously moved across state lines.id.thus,b ecause patton bulletproof vest moved across state lines at some point in its existence,congress may regulate it under scarborough id.two district courts that have addressed the body armor statute are in accord.see united states marler,d united states kitsch,d.
other circuits have similarly endorsed the continuing vitality of scarborough,albeit sometimes with skepticism,in decisions dealing with a variety of felon firearm statutes.see,united states lemons,cir noting that because scarborough suggested that prior movement of the firearm in interstate commerce would suffice to meet the jurisdictional element,we have,in the wake of lopez,repeatedly rejected commerce clause challenges to application of the statute as to any conflict with lopez,it is for the supreme court to so hold.united states smith,cir deciding that scarborough,rather than lopez,applied because of the jurisdictional hook in the statute united states chesney,cir adhering to scarborough.although these decisions dealt with the possession of firearms rather than body armor,we agree with the tenth circuit that the prohibition on possessing body armor can not be distinguished from the prohibitions on possessing firearms that we have upheld.patton,at.
we decline to create a circuit split on this issue or to deviate from binding precedent.the congressional findings,the nature of the body armor statute,and the express requirement of a sale in interstate commerce,considered in combination,provide a sufficient nexus to and effect on interstate commerce to uphold.
iii.recent commerce clause jurisprudence 
although we consider scarborough as the defining case,we can not ignore the supreme court shifting emphasis in its commerce clause jurisprudence over the past decade.alderman posits that scarborough has been overruled by the court recent commerce clause cases.our review of those authorities does not support this has not been discarded.see hanna,at noting that scarborough continues to be viable after lopez.
in lopez and its progeny,the supreme court delineated three general categories of regulation in which congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power.gonzales raich,d.these categories include the use of the channels of interstate commerce the instrumentalities of interstate commerce and activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.jones,at quoting lopez,at.internal quotes and alterations omitted see also raich,at.scalia,concurring noting that for over thirty years,our cases have mechanically recited that the commerce clause permits congressional regulation of three categories.
the categories have never been deemed exclusive or mandatory.united states clark,cir.the categories are a guide,not a straitjacket.id.hence,while we generally analyze cases in the framework of these three categories,we are not obligated to jam a square peg into a round hole especially when that peg has already had a suitable spot of its own carved out by the court.id.at.
to be sure,the first two categories are not particularly applicable here the third category described in lopez define s the extent of congress power over purely intra state activities that nonetheless have substantial inter state effects.united states robertson,d emphasis in original.in morrison,the supreme court established what is now the controlling test for determining whether a regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce.united states mccoy,cir.one of these considerations is whether the statute contains any express jurisdictional element.morrison,at.the purpose of a jurisdictional hook is to limit the reach of a particular statute to a discrete set of cases that substantially affect interstate commerce.mccoy,at.such a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of congress regulation of interstate commerce.morrison,at.
unlike the statutes at issue in lopez and morrison,is limited by an express jurisdictional provision.specifically,the statute regulates body armor sold or offered for sale,in interstate or foreign commerce.cortes,at concluding that a carjacking statute contained an express jurisdictional hook because it was limited to vehicles transported,shipped,or received in interstate or foreign commerce.
significantly,the jurisdictional hook in this statute is substantially different from the provision we rejected as essentially meaningless in mccoy,at.in mccoy,we examined a child pornography statute with a jurisdictional provision that allowed the statute to be applied to all child pornography which was produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.id.at emphasis in original,some emphasis omitted.we noted that the limiting jurisdictional factor was almost useless because all but the most child pornographers will rely on film,cameras,or chemicals that traveled in interstate commerce and will therefore fall within the sweep of the statute.id.at quoting united states rodia,cir.
by contrast,only affects body armor that is itself sold or offered for sale in interstate commerce.a.thus,for example,homemade body armor or body armor produced would not be caught within the sweep of the statute.polanco,at holding that a jurisdictional element requiring the government to prove that the defendant shipped,transported,or possessed a firearm in interstate commerce,or received a firearm that had been shipped or transported in interstate commerce insures,on a basis,that a defendant actions implicate interstate commerce to a constitutionally adequate degree.
we recognize that a jurisdictional hook is not always a talisman that wards off constitutional challenges.patton,at.as we have explained,
t he supreme court decisions in lopez and morrison,reject the view that a jurisdictional element,standing alone,serves to shield a statute from constitutional infirmities under the commerce clause.at most,the court has noted that such an element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of congress regulation of interstate commerce,or that it may lend support to this conclusion.
mccoy,at quoting morrison,at.consequently,when traveling in uncharted waters,we must consider the jurisdictional hook together with additional factors,such as congressional findings.see also united states kirk,cir evenly divided court en banc upholding machine gun ban under third prong of lopez rather than under a predecessor case to scarborough.here,we are confronted by the unique situation where a nearly identical jurisdictional hook has been blessed by the supreme court.therefore,we need not engage in the careful parsing of case law that would otherwise be required.rather,we recognize that this determination is controlled by the court analysis in scarborough,and that u ntil the supreme court tells us otherwise we must follow scarborough unwaveringly.cortes,at.
conclusion 
any doctrinal inconsistency between scarborough and the supreme court more recent decisions is not for this court to remedy.patton,at citing agostini felton,d.nor do we think it prudent to create a circuit split on this important statutory issue that congress views as having nationwide implications.because we are bound by scarborough and our own jurisprudence,we decline to embrace alderman challenge to.
i respectfully dissent.
in my view,of body armor does not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce its prohibition under neither regulates commerce or any sort of economic enterprise nor regulates intrastate,activity that is essential to a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme.we should not overlook these substantial failings and nevertheless affirm alderman conviction under by enlarging the states lopez precedent of scarborough united states,d,merely because a jurisdictional element is present.the majority approach,in my view,effectively renders the supreme court commerce clause analysis superfluous and permits congress,through the use of a jurisdictional element of any stripe,to convert congressional authority under the commerce clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the states.lopez,at.
because my decision to part company with the majority is guided by the court recent commerce clause jurisprudence and its treatment of jurisdictional elements,i turn first to the court recent commerce clause cases.i then address the court decision in scarborough,ultimately concluding that scarborough does not foreclose alderman challenge to congress authority to regulate possession of body armor.and,because is not a valid exercise of congress power,i would reverse alderman conviction.
in lopez,the court set forth the three broad categories of activity that congress may constitutionally regulate 
first,congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.second,congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.finally,congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
id.at.citations omitted gonzales raich,d scalia,concurring noting that for over thirty years,our cases have mechanically recited that the commerce clause permits congressional regulation of three categories.as the majority acknowledges,the parties do not seriously argue that can be justified under either of the first two categories and i agree.therefore,if intrastate possession of an object can be regulated at all,it must be done within the third category of congress commerce clause authority.
the supreme court developed the third category of authority to define the extent of congress power over purely intrastate commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial interstate effects.united states robertson,d.a substantial effect is required because t he regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities,channels,or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the states.united states morrison,d.accordingly,whether congress had a rational basis to find that the regulated activity,taken in the aggregate,would substantially affect interstate commerce should be the primary focus of our inquiry.raich,at.
in morrison,the supreme court held that the violence against women act,was an invalid exercise of federal power under the commerce clause.at.as the majority notes,the supreme court established a test for making that determination whether the statute regulates activity that substantially affect s interstate commerce or any sort of economic enterprise whether the statute contains any express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of cases that have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce whether the statute or its legislative history contains express congressional findings regarding the effects of the regulated activity upon interstate commerce and whether the link between the regulated activity and a substantial effect on interstate commerce is attenuated.morrison,at.quotation marks and brackets omitted see also united states mccoy,cir.we have since applied that test to a number of criminal statutes,including those with jurisdictional elements such as the one in.see,united states cortes,cir mccoy,at.because we view the first and fourth factors of the morrison the statute regulates commerce or economic enterprise,and whether the link between the regulated activity and commerce is too the most important,i turn to those factors first.see mccoy,at.
the possession prong of does not regulate commerce or economic activity,and any link between possession and commerce is highly attenuated.
although these factors are considered together,i first consider whether the statute regulates commerce or any sort of economic enterprise.in my view,it does not.like the statute struck down in lopez,is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms.lopez,at.we have never found that mere possession is,itself,an economic activity.see united states stewart stewart ii,cir stating that possession of machine guns is not an economic activity mccoy,at simple intrastate possession of child pornography is not,by itself,either commercial or economic in nature.nor is mere possession of an object consistent with activities the supreme court has found to be commercial.see,perez united states,d loansharking hodel.surface mining reclamation ass n,d industrial mining.
even where the regulated activity is not commercial,however,the regulation can still be justified as having a substantial and effect on commerce in two as a means of regulating the interstate market for body armor,as in,see raich,at,or as controlling uses of that body armor that might affect interstate commerce,see morrison,at.turning first to whether regulation of felon possession succeeds as a regulation of the interstate market for body armor,i conclude that it does not.
the supreme court recent decision in raich established that congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself commercial,in that it is not produced for sale,if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.at.citing wickard filburn.emphasis added.in raich,the court contrasted the statute struck down in lopez,which prohibited possession of a gun in a school zone,with the comprehensive regulatory scheme of the controlled substances act csa,which the court described as a lengthy and detailed statute creating a comprehensive framework for regulating the production,distribution,and possession of five classes of controlled substances.at.even though the respondents in raich possessed marijuana that was produced intrastate and for no commercial purpose,the court determined that the activities regulated by the production,distribution,and consumption of controlled indeed economic.id.at.further,in light of the established,and lucrative,interstate market for controlled substances,prohibiting intrastate possession was a rational means of regulating that market.id.at.united states adams,cir the statute criminalizing possession of commercial child pornography is part of the larger congressional scheme to eradicate the market for child pornography.
accordingly,when a federal statute criminalizes mere intrastate possession,we have considered whether that statute is part of a broader regulatory scheme.indeed,we have held that congress could criminalize possession of machine guns where those guns are regulated by a detailed and comprehensive statutory regime.stewart ii,at.we have also determined that congress could stamp out the market for child pornography by criminalizing the possession of such pornography where the production,distribution,and receipt was also regulated.adams,at.
here,however,there is no evidence that prohibition of felon possession of body armor was either itself a general regulatory statute that bears a substantial relation to commerce,or an essential part of some other regulatory scheme.lopez,at.quotation marks and emphasis omitted.to the contrary,is like the statute struck down in lopez a brief,statute making it a crime for a felon to possess body armor.raich,at.see also id.at.quoting lopez,at.section q is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity it can not,therefore,be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction,which viewed in the aggregate,substantially affects interstate commerce.further,it is unrelated to any broader attempt to control or suppress the market in body armor.congress has not regulated the manufacture,distribution,sale,possession,or use of body armor.moreover,the statute does not control any aspect of the commercial marketplace for body armor it is perfectly legal,for example,to sell body armor to a felon or to buy body armor from a felon.the prohibits felon possession,ownership,and certain conduct by felons rather than regulating interstate commerce in body armor.where it is perfectly legal to sell body armor to felons,and the entire legitimate market in body,distribution,and untouched by or any related legislation,there is no rational basis for concluding that criminalizing felon possession would have a discernable,let alone substantial,effect on interstate commerce.significantly,congress itself estimated that the statute would effect fewer than ten cases per year.see,pt,at.
whereas the statute in wickard was enacted primarily to control the market price of wheat,at,and the statutes regulating machine guns in stewart ii and child pornography in adams were part of broad regulatory frameworks whose objectives were comprehensive market suppression,is a statute that is designed only to keep felons from possessing body armor.accordingly,there is no rational basis here on which congress could have concluded that federal regulation of intrastate felon possession of body armor is an essential part of effective federal control of the broader,interstate market.
whether congress may have been regulating felon possession as a means of controlling uses of body armor that might affect interstate commerce in a way that is significant,and not attenuated,must also be considered.see morrison,at.i recognize and am sensitive to congress concerns that possession of body armor by felons may facilitate criminal acts and that crime can have a substantial impact on the national economy.however,arguments about these possession of firearms near schools and violence,respectively,could and did have significant effects on economic patently rejected by a majority of the court over forceful dissents in both morrison and lopez.in morrison,the court emphasized that it reject ed the argument that congress may regulate noneconomic,violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct aggregate effect on interstate commerce.id.at.likewise,in lopez,the court specifically declined to pile inference upon inference to find that either the costs of crime or impacts on national productivity could affect commerce to a constitutionally adequate degree.at.morrison,at.rejecting the argument that congress could regulate any crime as long as the nationwide,aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment,production,transit,or consumption because t he constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.
here,even when lopez and morrison instructions are read in the light most favorable to exercise of congressional power,any potential effect on commerce of alderman possession of body armor is both spare and particularly attenuated.the possession subject to regulation under need not be coupled with possession of a weapon or connected with the commission of a federal crime,circumstances which might fairly be said to substantially affect the national economy.in this case,alderman possession of body armor posed no danger he was walking down a street,unarmed,his vest invisible beneath his shirt.his conduct had no adverse economic or commercial impact whatsoever and,in the absence of any further,affirmative criminal or other activity,it had no potential for such an impact.even conceding that alderman possession of body armor might facilitate criminal conduct nonetheless,lopez and morrison patently reject the argument that because an object facilitates crime,possession of that object can be regulated under congress commerce power.
i would conclude,therefore,that felon possession of body armor is not part of a broader attempt to regulate the interstate market and that it does not have a substantial and unattenuated effect on interstate commerce.
the congressional findings accompanying do not demonstrate that possession substantially affects interstate commerce.
congressional findings that address the national impact of the regulated activity in question can assist in determining whether that activity substantially affects interstate commerce.lopez,at.their use is in enabling a court to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce,even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye.id.at.
the relevant congressional findings here are limited.there are no preambulatory findings enacted as part of the statute,however the house report contains findings as follows 
nationally,police officers and ordinary citizens are facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry,body armor,and other sophisticated assault gear 
crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear 
there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise affecting interstate commerce,and existing federal controls over such traffic do not adequately enable the states to control this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their police power 
recent incidents,such as the murder of san francisco police officer james guelff by an assailant wearing layers of body armor,a bank shoot out in north hollywood,california,between police and heavily armed suspects outfitted in body armor,and the murder of captain chris mccurley of the etowah county,alabama drug task force by a drug dealer shielded by protective body armor,demonstrate the serious threat to community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a violent crime 
pt,at.whether these findings support a rational basis for the position that possession of body armor substantially affects interstate commerce is not so clear.see raich,at.
first,the conclusion that there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise affecting interstate commerce is an eminently reasonable one,pt,at.like the court in patton,i recognize that congress found that existing federal controls over traffic in body armor do not adequately enable the states to control this traffic,at,but i fail to see how is responsive to that finding where it does nothing to limit the interstate movement of body armor.the regulation of felon possession is wholly intrastate.and,where congress itself determined that the prohibition on possession,purchase,and ownership of body armor by felons would probably affect fewer than cases each year,pt,at,it is especially difficult to perceive how of body armor substantially affects interstate traffic.at best,by federalizing traditional state crimes,the statute duplicates similar state prohibitions.see patton,at listing states in which possession of body armor is regulated.at worst,it tampers with policy choices by the states in an which states are sovereign.
congress conclusion that crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate movement of body armor,pt,at,is likewise however,in lopez,in which guns were at issue,a similar concern did not establish that the prohibited possessions substantially affected interstate commerce.in lopez,the court rejected the idea that congress could rely on generalized costs of crime for the power to regulate not only all violent crime,but all activities that might lead to violent crime,regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce.at.emphasis added.to the contrary,the court required a close nexus between the criminalized conduct and interstate commerce.the court explained that the absence of such a nexus raised grave federalism concerns because the suppression of violent crime and the vindication of its victims is quintessentially within the police power of the several states.morrison,at.although congress was concerned that police officers and ordinary citizens are facing increased danger as the result of of body armor,pt,at,it is precisely this area that the court has determined to be one of traditional state concern.remaining faithful to this precedent,i can not discern a rational basis on which congress could have concluded that possession of body armor substantially affects interstate commerce.
i therefore turn to the remaining morrison factor whether there is a jurisdictional element that limits the reach of the possession prong of to a discrete set of cases that substantially affect interstate commerce.morrison,at.
section jurisdictional element does not serve to render the possession prong of the statute a valid exercise of congress commerce clause authority.
a jurisdictional element,as the term has been used in and after lopez,refers to a provision in a federal statute that requires the government to establish specific facts justifying the exercise of federal jurisdiction in connection with an individual application of the statute.lopez,at.
here,the majority and the government point to jurisdictional element and conclude that because the government must show that the body armor at issue in a particular case was sold or offered for sale in interstate commerce alone is sufficient to bring the regulated possession within the scope of congress authority.in particular,the majority holds that preceded lopez by two the result in this case.as the majority explains,in scarborough,the court interpreted the predecessor statute to g to require only that a firearm had previously traveled in interstate commerce in order to satisfy the nexus between possession and commerce.i do not believe that scarborough controls the result here,and such a conclusion,in my view,is contrary to our precedent.
as we have explained,
the supreme court decisions in lopez and morrison,reject the view that a jurisdictional element,standing alone,serves to shield a statute from constitutional infirmities under the commerce clause.at most,the court has noted that such an element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of congress regulation of interstate commerce,or that it may lend support to this conclusion.morrison,at,d emphasis added.thus,the jurisdictional element must be considered along with the other factors listed in morrison.
mccoy,at noting that the third and seventh circuits agree with that analysis indeed,in mccoy,as well as cortes,we conducted a substantial effects test f ollowing the rubric outlined in lopez,morrison,and jones united states,d.cortes,at mccoy,at.our analysis contemplated that t he purpose of a jurisdictional hook is to limit the reach of a particular statute to a discrete set of cases that substantially affect interstate commerce.mccoy,at.the presence of a jurisdictional element does not ipse dixit result in a constitutional exercise of congress commerce clause power.
in light of this precedent,i agree with the tenth circuit observation in patton that jurisdictional element,which limits the definition of body armor to any product sold or offered for sale,in interstate or foreign commerce,as personal protective body covering does not seriously limit the reach of the statute.at.
nearly all body armor will meet that test.more important,there is no reason to think that possession of body armor that satisfies the jurisdictional hook has any greater effect on interstate commerce than possession of any other body armor 
where congress has chosen to allow production,distribution,and sale of body armor in interstate commerce it is hard to understand why possession of armor that meets that description is more objectionable than any other.
id.or,put slightly differently,as in mccoy,the connection between the activity regulated and the jurisdictional element is jurisdictional element does not provide adequate support for the government assertion of federal jurisdiction.this is the case here even though the jurisdictional hook in the statute and the item which affects interstate commerce are one and the same,mccoy,at,because the crux of the analysis is whether the jurisdictional element guarantees that the regulated possession substantially affects interstate commerce.here,the possession at issue is,by statutory design,attenuated both from the interstate market in body armor and any use of that body armor during an activity that might affect interstate commerce.consequently,the jurisdictional element does not serve its required purpose of limiting the statute to that have a direct and substantial affect on interstate commerce.
to the contrary,virtually every possession will fall within the sweep of the statute.the supreme court avoided precisely this result in jones,at.in jones,the court narrowly interpreted the jurisdictional element in the federal arson statute,i,to avoid the grave and doubtful constitutional questions that would arise were we to read i to render the traditionally local criminal conduct in which petitioner jones engaged a matter for federal enforcement.id.at.in particular,the court expressed concern with the government view that the home was used in activities affecting commerce because the homeowner had mortgaged and insured the property through entities,and the home received natural gas from interstate sources.id.at.quotation marks and brackets omitted.to read the statute as the government argued would have the constitutionally dubious result of mak ing virtually every arson in the country a federal offense.id.at.the court narrow construction of the jurisdictional element ensured that only arson crimes substantially affecting interstate commerce could be prosecuted under the statute.id.at.
here,it is impossible to narrowly interpret jurisdictional element,as the court did in jones,so that only possessions substantially affecting interstate commerce may be prosecuted.congress specified that it intended to regulate the possession of any product sold or offered for sale,in interstate or foreign commerce,as personal protective body covering.a.no plausible interpretation of cabins the statute reach to a discrete set of cases.this is problematic,however,because as we have noted,virtually all criminal conduct involve s the use of some object that has passed through interstate commerce.mccoy at quotation marks and citation omitted.section requirement that the government show that the body armor once traveled in interstate commerce does not ensure that the regulated conduct has the requisite substantial effect on interstate commerce.
in particular,jurisdictional element does nothing to prevent congress from claiming the general police power that the constitution denied the national government and reposed in the states.morrison,at.while the use of a broad jurisdictional element does not invalidate a statute that otherwise substantially affects commerce,cortes,at,such an element can not save a statute that otherwise lacks the required effect.
our decision in cortes amply demonstrates this point.there,we conducted a substantial effects test under morrison and found that the carjacking statute was enacted as an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity,id.at quoting lopez,and that because carjacking does substantially affect interstate commerce,the fact that a particular instance of carjacking may have a de minimis effect on interstate commerce is of no consequence.id.at.turning only then to the jurisdictional element,we rejected cortes argument that the element was so broad as to invalidate the statute,reasoning that where carjackings targeted by substantially affect interstate commerce a minimal nexus provides the necessary connection between each instance of carjacking covered by the statute and interstate commerce.id.at.in other words,the presence of the jurisdictional element was a factor in the analysis that followed a substantially affects was not the sole reason for that determination.
contrary to the majority view,neither the supreme court decision in scarborough nor our court treatment of scarborough alters this analysis.scarborough decided only a question of statutory interpretation about the predecessor statute to g.scarborough held a fair reading of that a minimal nexus with commerce was required to demonstrate that of a firearm substant
