the government appeals from the district court order granting the santee sioux tribe the tribe relief from a prior order of contempt.we affirm.
background 
this is our third review of this case,which has an extensive factual and procedural history.in early,the tribe attempted to negotiate a compact with the state of nebraska that would have permitted class iii gaming on tribal lands,pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act,et.igra.no agreement was reached,but the tribe nevertheless opened a class iii gambling casino on the reservation in.thereafter,the chairman of the national indian gaming commission nigc issued a closure order against the tribe because the tribe was illegally participating in class iii gaming activities.the chairman ordered the casino to close by may,and the tribe complied with that order.however,on june,the tribe reopened its casino.
the government then filed suit in federal court,alleging violations of federal and state law and requesting closure of the casino.the district court dismissed both the tribe and the government request for injunctive relief.we reversed on appeal,holding that the tribe had violated the igra by conducting class iii gaming in contravention of nebraska law and that injunctive relief was warranted.united states santee sioux tribe of,cir santee i.
on remand,the district court ordered removal of all class iii gaming devices.soon after,the tribe voted to continue operating the casino,including the class iii devices,and the government sought an order of contempt.the district court found the tribe in contempt,and by november,the district court had reduced to judgment accrued fines totaling in excess of million.however,the district court determined that members of the tribal council could not be individually liable for contempt fines and that certain bank accounts could not be garnished.on appeal,we reversed the district court decision not to hold the individual members of the council in contempt and also reversed the district court determination that certain monies could not be garnished.united states santee sioux tribe of,cir santee ii.other findings by the district court relating to garnishment were affirmed,and the case was remanded.id.at.
in may,the tribe ceased operation of its class iii gaming devices.it eventually replaced them with what is commonly known as lucky tab ii machines,in part because the nigc chief of staff wrote a letter to the tribe legal counsel suggesting that the tribe install and operate the lucky tab ii dispensers.the nigc thereafter dissolved its closure order because it took the position that the lucky tab ii is not a class iii gaming device.accordingly,the tribe brought this action,seeking relief from the prior order of contempt.the government,however,contends that the lucky tab ii is a class iii device,or,in the alternative,that even if it is a class ii device,it is prohibited by the johnson act,et.
at trial,the following evidence was adduced regarding the lucky tab ii machines.first,the instruments look and sound very much like traditional slot machines.internally,the device is essentially a computer.it also has a manual feed for money,a roll of paper,a bar code reader to read the back of each,a rubber roller to dispense the,a cutter which cuts the from the roll,and a cash drawer.the bar code reader reads the as it passes through the machine to the player,and based on this reading,a video screen displays the contents of the it is a winner or loser.the machine also emits different sounds,depending on whether it has read a winning or losing ticket.
a player begins playing by feeding money into the machine,but the machine can not give change.the player presses a start button and after approximately two and a half seconds an animated display appears,announcing winner or loser status.the machine then dispenses the paper to the player.at this point,the player can either pull back the paper tab to verify the contents,or continue playing by feeding more money into the machine and pressing the start button again.if the is a winner,the machine can not pay the player or give credits for accumulated wins instead,the machine tells the player to go to the cashier and present the to redeem winnings.
the themselves are small,preprinted,paper cards.the player peels off the top layer to reveal symbols and patterns which indicate a winning or losing card.the also indicate the number manufactured,game type,and unique sequence number.the back of the shows an encrypted bar code with fifteen characters.the bar code must be scanned with a laser light to determine if the card is a winner or a loser.because the information is encrypted,the data on the bar code is unknowable without the proprietary software from the manufacturer,world gaming technologies.also,devices ensure that a that has already been scanned will be rejected and that the tabs will be dispensed in the correct sequence.without a roll of paper in place,the machine can not will not accept money or display any symbols.
the evidence suggested that,as a practical matter,players often take the winning tickets,unopened,to the cashier for redemption.furthermore,players frequently leave the losing tickets,unopened,in the dispenser drawer of the lucky tab ii machines.
the district court found that the machines at issue were class ii devices because the machines do not determine the winner or loser,can be played without these machines,the player does not play against the machine,and no winnings are paid or accumulated by the machines.the district court followed the reasoning in diamond game,reno,in coming to this conclusion.united states santee sioux tribe of,d.
ii.discussion 
in reviewing a district court final judgment following a bench trial,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.a tadlock powell,cir.a district court choice between two permissible views of evidence will not be clearly erroneous,and we must give weight to the district court opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.estate of davis delo,cir.
the first issue in this case necessitates our delving into the relationship between the igra and the johnson act.the government argues that if lucky tab ii is construed to be a class ii gaming device,it is still a gambling device within the parameters of the johnson act and therefore prohibited.if that is the case,the tribe can not be granted relief from the contempt order.the tribe argues that the johnson act defines gambling device so expansively that it would include any device which is electric or mechanical,including those which are allowable class ii gaming devices.because class ii gaming is permitted under one federal law the igra,but the machines which facilitate class ii gaming are arguably prohibited under another the johnson act,the tribe argues that the igra has repealed the johnson act by implication.
the igra,in section b a,states that an indian tribe may engage in class ii gaming where the state in which it is located permits similar games and such gaming is not otherwise specifically prohibited on indian lands by federal law.b a.this section,the government argues,shows that the two acts can be read together because the igra contemplated prohibition of certain class ii games if the devices used to carry out the gaming are prohibited johnson act gambling devices.
we agree with the government that the two acts can be read together.first,it is that repeals by implication are not favored.morton mancari,d.in the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal,the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.id.at.the two statutes here are not irreconcilable.section b a clearly states that class ii devices may be regulated by another federal the johnson act.thus,the argument that the igra implicitly repeals the johnson act with respect to class ii devices is not well taken,even though some version of this view has been expressed by several courts.see,united states megamania gambling devices,cir noting that the igra indicates congress did not intend to allow the johnson act to reach class ii
