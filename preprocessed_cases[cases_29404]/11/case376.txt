opinion of the court 
before the court is an application by hess oil virgin islands corporation hovic for an extension of time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari from a decision of the supreme court of the virgin islands.our rules provide that an extension of the period in which to file a certiorari petition may be granted for good cause shown.cir.local appellate rule lar a.hovic seeks an additional thirty days to file its petition on the ground that it recently retained counsel to represent it before this court,and counsel contends that he can not meet the current deadline,mainly due to other professional commitments.for the reasons explained below,i conclude that hovic grounds for seeking an extension of time do not amount to good cause.however,because this court has not previously addressed standards applicable to the showing required under lar a,i will grant hovic request for an extension of time.
i need not recount the nature of the dispute between hovic and the respondent,pierre joseph,for purposes of addressing this extension request.briefly stated,hovic intends to file a certiorari petition from a decision of the supreme court of the virgin islands entered march.the supreme court reversed an order in which the superior court of the virgin islands granted summary judgment in hovic favor,and it remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.according to hovic,the parties agreed to settle the case shortly before the supreme court issued its march decision.hovic moved to recall the mandate or for leave to file a petition for rehearing out of time,citing the purported settlement.the supreme court denied both requests.hovic maintains that the case became moot once the parties agreed to settle,and it intends to seek certiorari to argue,inter alia,that mootness deprived the supreme court of jurisdiction to issue the march decision.
a petitioner may seek review in this court of a final decision of the supreme court of the virgin islands by filing a petition for a writ of certiorari within days from the entry of judgment sought to be reviewed.lar a emphasis added see also pichardo comm r of labor,cir under,the third circuit has temporary certiorari jurisdiction over final decisions of the virgin islands supreme court.for purposes of adjudicating the present motion,i will assume that the march decision is a final decision,and therefore one that would fall within the scope of this court jurisdiction under if a timely certiorari petition were filed.as such,hovic period to file a certiorari petition in this matter expired on monday,may,hovic filed its application for an extension of time on may,six days prior to the due date.hovic asks for an extension of thirty days,until june 
hovic contends that it needs more time because it retained appellate counsel to advise it of its procedural options and to represent it before this court only a few weeks ago.appellate counsel notes that the supreme court denied the motion to recall the mandate on april,and the analysis contained in that order must be addressed in any petition that is to be filed.finally,appellate counsel asserts that he had competing obligations prior to the due date for hovic certiorari petition,including the filing of a petition for rehearing and an extension request in other cases.in addition,on the thursday and friday before the monday on which the certiorari petition was due,counsel had commitments to the third circuit bar association and third circuit judicial conference,including an appearance as a panelist at a judicial conference meeting.
congress has provided that,for the first fifteen years following establishment of the supreme court of the virgin islands,the third circuit court of appeals shall have jurisdiction to review by writ of certiorari all final decisions of the highest court of the virgin islands from which a decision could be had.congress also has conferred upon this court jurisdiction to promulgate rules necessary to carry out the provisions of.id.consistent with this mandate,we adopted local rules in to govern practice and procedure in the exercise of our certiorari jurisdiction see lars.among other things,we established a deadline to file a certiorari petition,lar a,and made allowance for a petitioner to seek additional time.our local rule regarding extensions of time to file a certiorari petition provides as follows 
a circuit judge,for good cause shown,may extend the time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari or for a period not exceeding days.any application for extension of time within which to file a petition for writ of certiorari must set out the grounds on which the jurisdiction of this court is invoked,must identify the judgment sought to be reviewed and have appended thereto a copy of the opinion,and must set forth with specificity the reasons justifying an extension.an untimely petition for writ of certiorari must be accompanied by a motion for extension of time.however,an application for extension of time to file a petition for certiorari ordinarily will not be granted,if filed less than days before the expiration of the time to file a petition.
this court has not,in a precedential decision,addressed the showing required to establish good cause for an extension of time to file a certiorari petition because good cause is undefined in lar a,my undertaking here is to give meaning to the term.i begin,as i must,by looking to the plain language of the rule.see,in re lord abbett mut.funds fee,cir.
good cause is understood to mean a legally sufficient reason,and it reflects the burden placed on a litigant usu.by court rule or order to show why a request should be granted or an action excused.black law dictionary ed.of course,a proffered reason or cause that may be legally sufficient in one context may not be so in another.federal practice is replete with rules that require a moving party to show good cause,but determining whether the showing made will justify granting the relief sought can be accomplished only by considering the specific nature and purpose of the rule at issue.see,shingara skiles,cir holding that there is good cause for a protective order under.when a party shows that disclosure will result in a clearly defined,specific and serious injury but that broad allegations of harm are not sufficient to establish good cause mci telecomms.teleconcepts,cir explaining that good cause to excuse late service under former.j requires a demonstration of good faith on the part of the party seeking an enlargement and some reasonable basis for noncompliance within the time specified in the rules,and absence of prejudice alone can never constitute good cause quotation marks omitted.in short,the term good cause itself does not define the precise showing that we should require in the particular context of a party seeking more time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.
the history behind the adoption of lar a,as reflected in the committee comments to the lars,does not shed light on the showing required.it appears that several provisions in our local rules regarding certiorari review were modeled after ninth circuit court of appeals local circuit rule,which established procedures for that court interim exercise of certiorari jurisdiction over the supreme court of guam.however,rule,which the ninth circuit abrogated in consistent with the termination of its certiorari jurisdiction,see as amended,santos guam,cir,contained no provision for seeking an extension of time to file.see cir.as such,lar a was not based on a ninth circuit rule that provides meaningful guidance for the present inquiry.and while it appears that lar a was modeled after the united states supreme court rule on extensions of time,which is discussed below,the committee comments do not expressly identify a specific source for the rule 
lacking authority and commentary from this court as to the intended meaning of good cause in lar a,i must look elsewhere.fortunately,there are analogues to draw upon.courts routinely interpret and apply the standard under rules that,like lar a,govern requests for extensions of time to act.i find two such rules instructive here the united
