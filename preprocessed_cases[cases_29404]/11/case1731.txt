plaintiff and appellant joyce flannery filed a complaint which alleges that by virtue of defendant and respondent vw credit,vw failure to comply with provisions of california vehicle leasing act vla,et,vw violated california fair debt collection practices act,et the rosenthal act and california unfair competition law bus,et the ucl.vw filed a demurrer to the complaint,which the trial court sustained without leave to amend.on appeal,flannery contends the court erred by applying the doctrine of substantial compliance to consumer protection laws.
vw has moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely.we deny the motion to dismiss and reverse the dismissal.following the trial court ruling on its demurrer,vw sought and received entry of an order dismissing the complaint and provided flannery with notice of entry of the order however,before the time in which to appeal from the dismissal expired,vw asked the trial court to vacate the dismissal and enter a new dismissal that included vw costs.the trial court granted vw request and entered an order vacating the first dismissal and ordering entry of a second dismissal,which included vw costs.vw then served flannery with notice of entry of the second dismissal.thereafter,flannery filed a notice of appeal from the second dismissal.vw argues that the notice of appeal was untimely because it was not filed within days after service of notice of entry of the first dismissal vw contends that,notwithstanding the literal meaning of the trial court order vacating the first dismissal,we should interpret the order as simply amending the first judgment to add vw costs and thereby render flannery notice of appeal untimely.we decline to do so.we interpret the trial court order literally the first dismissal was vacated by the terms of the trial court order,and a second dismissal was entered from which flannery filed a timely notice of appeal.
with respect to the merits,we reverse.although the doctrine of substantial compliance has been employed when doing so avoids injustice and is consistent with the purposes of a particular statute,those considerations are not present here,where vw failed to provide consumers with notice of their right to an appraisal upon early termination of their automobile leases in the language prescribed by civil code section.as we explain,the legislature has expressed its intent that the vla provisions in dispute here be strictly enforced.in addition to the legislature evident preference,strict enforcement encourages greater care on the part of lessors when providing statutory notices and avoids repeated resort to judicial construction with respect to which part of a verbatim notice prescribed by the legislature is material and which is not.importantly,strict enforcement of the vla does not provide consumers with any unfair advantage or benefit but only relieves them of liability for any deficiency.
because the parties briefing here has been directed solely to vw obligations under the vla,we do not reach the question of whether vw alleged violation of the vla will support any relief under provisions of the rosenthal act and the ucl.
factual and procedural background 
in,flannery was the lessee of a volkswagen jetta.vw was the lessor and,in the middle of,vw repossessed the jetta.following the repossession,vw sent flannery a notice that attempted to comply with the requirements of civil code section,subdivision d b by its terms,subdivision d b of section requires that lessors of vehicles which have been repossessed give the lessees a notice that contains the following statement the amount you owe for early termination will be no more than the difference between the gross early termination amount stated above and the appraised value of the vehicle or if there is no appraisal,either the price received for the vehicle upon disposition or a greater amount established by the lessor or the lease contract.
you have the right to get a professional appraisal to establish the value of the vehicle for the purpose of figuring how much you owe on the lease.if you want an appraisal,you will have to arrange for it to be completed at least three days before the scheduled sale date of the vehicle.the appraiser has to be an independent person acceptable to the holder of the lease.you will have to pay for the appraiser.the appraised value will be considered final and binding on you and the holder of the lease.italics added.
if a lessor fails to provide a notice that complies with section,subdivision d,a lessee is not liable for any deficiency,subd.d.
the notice vw sent flannery did not contain all of the language required by the statute.vw notice deleted the phrase to establish the value of the vehicle for the purpose of figuring how much you owe on the lease.thus,vw notice read the amount you owe for early termination will be no more than the difference between the gross early termination amount stated in this notice and the appraised value of the vehicle or if there is no appraisal,either the price received for the vehicle upon disposition or a greater amount established by the lessor or the lease contract.you have the right to get a professional appraisal you will have to arrange for it to be completed at least three days before the scheduled sale date of the vehicle.the appraiser has to be an independent person acceptable to the holder of the lease.you will have to pay for the appraiser.the appraised value will be considered final and binding on you and the holder of the lease.
relying on vw failure to send her a notice that complied with the requirements of section,flannery filed a complaint against vw,which alleged she represented an unknown class of lessees to whom vw had sent the defective notice and from whom vw had thereafter collected or attempted to collect unauthorized deficiencies.she alleged vw collection or attempts to collect the deficiencies violated the rosenthal act and the ucl and had damaged her and other class members.
vw demurred to the complaint.vw argued that its notice substantially complied with the requirements of section,subdivision d,and,therefore,it was authorized to collect deficiencies from lessees to whom it had sent the notice.
after a hearing on november,the trial court sustained vw demurrer without leave to amend.on january,the trial court entered an order of dismissal with prejudice.vw served flannery with notice of entry of the dismissal on january.
at the request of vw,the trial court set aside the january dismissal and entered a judgment of dismissal with costs on february.on march,vw served flannery with notice of entry of the order setting aside the january dismissal and entering judgment of dismissal with costs.
on may,flannery filed a notice of appeal from the february judgment.
discussion 
vw has moved to dismiss flannery appeal.vw contends entry of the january order of dismissal commenced the time for appeal and the february order merely amended the january order and,therefore,did not restart the time to file an appeal.we disagree.
a notice of appeal from a judgment must be filed on or before the earliest of days after the trial court mailing of the notice of entry of judgment,days after a party service of the notice of entry of judgment,or days after the entry of judgment.cal.rules of court,rule a.when a judgment is vacated and then reinstated,the time to appeal the judgment begins to run after reinstatement.lantz vai cal,lantz matera mcleod th,matera.in lantz,a judgment in a quiet title action was entered on august,finding that neither party was the owner of a disputed parcel of real property the judgment was thereafter vacated and a substitute judgment,finding the plaintiff was not the owner,was entered on october.in finding that the time for appeal ran from the reinstated judgment,and not the vacated judgment,the court stated w e are of the opinion that no appeal lies from the judgment of august.the effect of the order vacating and setting aside the judgment was to destroy it.lantz,at.similarly,in matera,the trial court vacated a default judgment but then concluded that the defendants were not entitled relief from the judgment and reinstated the judgment.matera,at
