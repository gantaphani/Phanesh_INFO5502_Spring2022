background 
this appeal consolidates two cases involving facial and challenges to the johns county,florida,sign ordinance ordinance or ordinance,codified as article vii of the johns county land development code ldc.each case presents identical legal issues.we review the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees,café erotica of florida,café or café erotica,and café erotica we dare to bare adult toys great food exit,we dare to bare.
the first case involves café erotica,an adult entertainment establishment in johns county county,florida.café has advertised its business on billboards located along interstate.county officials issued several citations to café for constructing signs on its business premises,advertising on the side of a truck,and erecting political message banners without following the county required permitting procedures.on june,café challenged the johns county sign ordinance,ordinance.the district court issued a preliminary injunction against its enforcement.the county subsequently passed four new versions of its sign ordinance,finally enacting ordinance.
in the other case,we dare to bare brought a facial challenge against ordinance,and also alleged that the county applied ordinance against it in an unconstitutional manner with respect to a billboard it erected along interstate.we dare to bare argued that the county took an impermissibly long time to render its licensing decision and imposed additional requirements upon it not imposed on similarly situated businesses 
both district courts permanently enjoined the county from enforcing ordinance and granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs.each district court declared sections and of ordinance unconstitutional,and determined that these sections could not be severed from the rest of article vii of the ldc 
the district courts confined their analyses to ordinance.however,after enacting ordinance,the county amended its sign regulation,enacting ordinance on may.we dare to bare attempted to challenge ordinance,arguing that it is substantively the same as the predecessor law and contains the same constitutional flaws.rather than having the parties amend their pleadings,the district court ruled only on the constitutionality of ordinance,as the challenged provisions of ordinance were substantially the same under the new ordinance.see coalition for the abolition of marijuana prohibition city of atlanta,cir w hen an ordinance is repealed by the enactment of a superseding statute,then the superseding statute or regulation moots a case only to the extent that it removes challenged features of the prior law.to the extent that those features remain in place,and changes in the law have not so fundamentally altered the statutory framework as to render the original controversy a mere abstraction,the case is not moot.quoting naturist soc y,fillyaw,cir.thus,we consider only the constitutionality of ordinance in this appeal.specifically,we consider appellees facial challenges to sections,and of ordinance,taking into account other provisions that may affect the constitutionality of those provisions.
appellees assert two facial challenges.first,they argue that ordinance is a restriction on speech because certain provisions favor commercial speech over political speech.specifically,appellees argue that because the ordinance limits political message signs to square feet while allowing commercial billboards to be as large as square feet,the county impermissibly discriminates against political speech.second,appellees argue that the permitting requirements of ordinance act as an unconstitutional prior restraint because the ordinance does not contain the required procedural protections for licensing schemes pursuant to,city of dallas,d.
the county responds that ordinance is a constitutional ordinance.under the county reading of the ordinance,both and signs can contain commercial and noncommercial content.thus,according to the county,political messages can be placed on billboards.the county admits that it regulates various types of signs differently,but contends that any differences in treatment are due solely to factors related to safety and aesthetics.the county believes that nothing in the ordinance allows it to deny a permit based on a sign content.the county,however,admits that because the ordinance treats different types of signs differently,the content of a sign must be considered for determining the location and duration of a sign.
ii.applicable ordinance provisions 
ordinance requires anyone wishing to erect a sign larger than fifteen square feet in area to obtain a sign permit.see ldc.further,the ldc requires a permit for all outdoor advertising displays café banner is a sign within the above definition,as are the billboards that café wishes to construct.thus,café would have to obtain a permit before erecting these structures.the county administrator of johns county county administrator makes all permitting decisions in accordance with the standard building code see ldc.
appellees challenge various sections of the ordinance setting forth the time in which the county must perform its obligations.ordinance states 
applications for sign permits shall be approved or denied,by the county administrator,within fourteen days of submittal of a fully completed application.if more information is required from the applicant,the fourteen day period shall run from receipt of that additional information.if the applicant certifies in writing that the application is complete,the fourteen day period shall run from the date of the county receipt of that writing.
any permitting decision may be appealed to the board of county commissioners within thirty days of the decision.the board of county commissioners has fifteen days to render a written decision.see ldc.this decision may be appealed to the circuit court within thirty days.the ordinance states,i n any case where the message or content of the proposed sign affected the denial of the permit,the county shall bear the cost of initiating the case with the circuit court and shall also bear the burden of justifying the denial.id.emphasis added.
ordinance contains a general severance provision stating,i f any section,phrase,sentence,or portion of this ordinance or the code is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional such portion shall be deemed a separate,distinct,and independent provision,and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.ordinance recitals.
ordinance regulates different types of signs differently,including the following sign categories billboards signs and special use signs,which include political message signs.
billboards 
part regulates billboards.billboards are limited to feet in height,and can be as large as square square feet if located along the interstate.see ldc a b.billboards are defined as signs over square feet in size that are used for outdoor advertising and display,and they also include signs that exceed square feet.ldc emphasis added.the ordinance defines advertising message as including not only commercial messages,but also political copy intended to directly or indirectly promote a candidate or issue.ldc.
billboards are subject to greater restrictions than signs with regard to the number of billboards and their location.compare ldc a restricting new billboards to designated locations,and stating that no increase in the total number of billboards shall be permitted unless fully compliant with this code with ldc a limiting ground signs to four per location,but placing no limits on the number of building signs such as marquee and canopy signs.
section c concerns severability of the billboard provisions.it states,i f any of the provisions of this code,including provisions pertaining to permitting new billboards is found unconstitutional all provisions pertaining to allowing and permitting new billboards shall be deemed voided in totality and no new billboards shall be allowed.
part regulates signs.signs are generally limited to square feet.see ldc b.those within feet of the interstate are allowed up to square feet of advertising space.see ldc b.signs include advertisements for a business,person,or service located on the sign premises.signs,by contrast,contain similar advertisements for a product or business that is not located or furnished on the property where the sign is erected.see ldc.
political message signs 
political message signs are regulated under a third category of signs called special use signs.ldc.a political message sign is defined as a ny sign containing a opinion or endorsement message and not containing a commercial message.ldc emphasis added.under this definition,the separate requirements for political message signs appear to govern all signs.political message signs are limited by l to between six and square feet.commercial signs and billboards,on the other hand,can be as large as square feet.see ldc a,a.
iii.jurisdiction and standing 
both appellees have standing to challenge ordinance.in order to have standing,a plaintiff must prove that it has sustained an injury of a legally protected interest a causal connection exists between the injury and the conduct complained of and the injury is capable of being redressed by the court.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d citations omitted granite state outdoor,cir.moreover,the plaintiff injury must be concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.citations omitted.pursuant to various provisions of john county sign ordinance,both café erotica and we dare to bare have been ordered to remove certain signs,some of which display political messages.in addition,both parties retain substantial interests in the outcome of this litigation,as both parties stand to gain by a favorable ruling.as such,both parties may challenge ordinance as applied.
we also have jurisdiction to consider whether ordinance is facially invalid.when a statute is challenged as facially invalid,a court may entertain such a challenge where every application of the challenged provision may create an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas.see freedman maryland,d.as determined below,with respect to the decision of whether to issue or deny a sign permit,ordinance places unbridled discretion in the hands of the county administrator.thus,ordinance creates a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections,and we may therefore entertain a facial challenge.see city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d.further,the fact that café erotica and we dare to bare primarily engage in commercial advertising does not prevent us from considering their facial challenges.see metromedia,city of san diego,d.
iv.standard of review 
we review orders granting summary judgment de novo.see joel city of orlando,cir we also review decisions of lower courts addressing the constitutionality of ordinances de novo.id.
prior restraint analysis 
we analyze certain challenged portions of ordinance under prior restraint analysis and others under analysis.we start with prior restraint analysis because our holding in this section highlights the potential for decisionmaking under ordinance.when analyzing a facial challenge,we must analyze the statute as written.see redner dean,cir.
a prior restraint on speech exists when the government can deny access to a forum for expression before the expression occurs.united states frandsen,cir.ordinance requires a permit prior to erecting any new billboard thereby making it a restraint on speech in advance of its occurrence.see ward rock against racism,d for prior restraint analysis,t he relevant question is whether the challenged regulation authorizes suppression of speech in advance of its expression.although prior restraints are not unconstitutional per se,any system of prior restraint bear s a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.southeastern promotions,conrad,d.accordingly,we must consider whether ordinance is an impermissible prior restraint.
prior restraints must ensure that permitting decisions are made within a specified time period,see,city of dallas,d plurality opinion citing freedman,at.and must avoid unbridled discretion in the hands of a government official.see id.at.quoting lakewood,at.see also lady lingerie,city of jacksonville,cir licensing schemes commonly contain two defects discretion and the opportunity for delay.the café district court found that ordinance lacked both of these requirements.after careful analysis,we find that the first requirement above is satisfied however,as discussed below,we also find that ordinance unconstitutionally grants unbridled discretion in the hands of just one government official.
requirement sufficient time limits for issuing permitting decisions 
a scheme that fails to set reasonable time limits on the decisionmaker creates the risk of indefinitely suppressing permissible speech,and therefore will not be tolerated,at.plurality opinion.to satisfy this requirement,an ordinance should contain two procedural safeguards licensing officials must be required to make prompt decisions and prompt judicial review must be available to correct erroneous denials.lady lingerie,at citation omitted.ordinance satisfies the first requirement because it contains both procedural safeguards set forth above.
with respect to the first licensing officials be required to make prompt states,
applications for sign permits shall be approved or denied,by the county administrator,within fourteen days of submittal of a fully completed application.if more information is required from the applicant in order to complete review of the application,the fourteen day period shall run from receipt of that additional information.if the applicant certifies in writing that the application is complete,the fourteen day period shall run from the certification date.
the café district court was concerned that,under these requirements,the county administrator could unduly delay the permitting process.however,ordinance amends this section.see coalition for the abolition of marijuana prohibition,at noting that a superseding ordinance moots a case to the extent that it removes challenged features of the prior law.the ordinance as amended now gives the county administrator thirty days to deny or approve a fully completed sign application and twenty days to notify the applicant of any deficiencies.significantly,if the application is not approved or denied within the period,the sign permit is deemed denied.see ordinance c.thus,the county administrator can not delay the permitting process indefinitely,and an applicant should receive a final denial well within ninety days of its initial submission.see redner,at holding that a day restraint is reasonable,and expressing agreement with other federal courts that have found time periods as long as ninety days to be reasonable but see fly fish,city of cocoa beach,cir ordinance setting forth no real time limits deemed unconstitutional.
ordinance also satisfies the second prompt judicial review be available.with respect to licensing schemes,this requirement means that the ordinance must provide for prompt judicial review of a permit denial,rather than prompt judicial resolution.see boss capital,city of casselberry,cir.ordinance satisfies this requirement because ldc provides that an adverse decision may be appealed to the circuit court within thirty days.see id.finding prompt judicial review requirement met where ordinance specified that licensing decisions may be immediately reviewed as a matter of right by the circuit court.
requirement no unbridled discretion 
although ordinance satisfies the first requirement,we find that ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint because the discretion it grants to the county administrator extends beyond permissible boundaries.see shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d a law subjecting the exercise of first amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license,without narrow,objective,and definite standards to guide the licensing authority,is unconstitutional saia new york.ordinance found facially invalid because discretion of was unlimited fly fish,at ordinance struck down as unconstitutional because it exceed ed the limits of permissible ministerial discretion lady lingerie,at virtually any amount of discretion beyond the merely ministerial is suspect and therefore s tandards must be precise and objective.
the county argues that its ordinance does not give the county administrator discretion to reject a sign based on its content because the sign applicant need not disclose the sign message.even if we were to accept this argument,however,the ordinance still fails to address our primary there be reasonably specific and objective grounds for denying a permit application that are narrowly drawn,reasonable,and definite so as to sufficiently reduce the potential for decisionmaking.thomas chicago park,d redner,at citations omitted without adequate standards to guide the licensing authority,w e can not depend on the individuals responsible for enforcing the ordinance to do so in a manner that cures it of constitutional infirmities.
ordinance lacks specific and definite statutory checks on the county administrator discretion,thereby impermissibly creating the potential for discrimination.ordinance contains the same constitutional flaws as the ordinance struck down in city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d.in lakewood,the supreme court noted that the face of the ordinance itself contains no explicit limits on the mayor discretion.indeed,nothing in the law as written requires the mayor to do more than make the statement it is not in the public interest when denying a permit application.id.at.like the lakewood ordinance,ordinance contains no explicit limits on the county administrator discretion.rather,ordinance simply states that permits shall be reviewed by the county administrator and issued in accordance with the standard building code.ldc a review of the standard building code reveals that ordinance does not provide specific grounds under which the administrator may deny a billboard permit application.any such grant of unrestrained discretion to an official responsible for regulating first amendment activities is facially unconstitutional.see atlanta journal and constitution city of atlanta of aviation,cir en banc.thus,as the supreme court has noted,the constitution requires that johns county establish neutral criteria to insure that the licensing decision is not based on the content or viewpoint of the speech being considered.lakewood,at.such criteria should be expressly included within the county sign ordinance,and should set forth specific grounds under which a sign permit may be denied.see,thomas,at.upholding an ordinance listing thirteen specific grounds under which a permit application may be denied,none of which has anything to do with what a speaker might say 
vi.applicable first amendment framework for content based analysis 
we now consider whether,which limits political message signs to square feet,impermissibly favors commercial messages over ones.we must first determine the appropriate analytical framework to apply when considering the constitutionality of regulations restricting speech placed on billboards.
the regulation of billboards is controlled by metromedia,as the law of billboards is a law unto itself.metromedia,at.see ackerley communications krochalis,cir metromedia continues to control the regulation of billboards.metromedia instructs courts to employ one of two distinct analytical frameworks,depending on whether the restriction is of commercial or noncommercial speech.see metromedia,at.ordinance distinguishes between commercial and noncommercial speech,thereby taking this case out of the realm of regulations of purely commercial speech.
with respect to restrictions placed on noncommercial speech,the county argues that our inquiry should be confined to whether its ordinance discriminates based on viewpoint.in striking down the portion of san diego sign ordinance that favored commercial over noncommercial speech,however,the metromedia plurality explicitly rejected a strictly analysis,holding that the first amendment not only prevents the government from distinguishing between different viewpoints but also from distinguishing between broad categories or types of speech.see metromedia,at.because the metromedia decision controls the law of billboards,we will apply the analytical framework employed by the metromedia plurality 
consistent with metromedia,we first ask whether ordinance is a valid,time,place,and manner regulation.this is the test employed by the café district court in order to be constitutional,a time,place,and manner regulation may not be based upon the content of the regulated speech,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and must leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.see rock against racism,at.if the regulation is deemed,however,our inquiry becomes more exacting,as we then apply strict scrutiny.see consol.edison,at.one world one family now city of miami beach,cir.under strict scrutiny,the government must show that the regulation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.one world one family now,at.
thus,we must now determine whether ordinance is.metromedia held that discriminating among political messages is not always required for an ordinance to be deemed.see metromedia,at.rather,discriminating in favor of commercial messages over political ones,without regard to the actual messages conveyed,is also discrimination.see id.at.our inquiry therefore becomes whether ordinance in fact favors commercial messages over political ones.
vii.distinction favoring commercial over speech is 
johns county argues that the ordinance does not favor commercial speech over political messages because under its reading of ldc defining billboards,any speech,including political messages,can be placed on billboards under the county argument,the ordinance simply provides an additional,superfluous provision regarding political message signs.
while the county interpretation is entitled to deference,southlake prop.assocs.city of morrow,cir,we need only defer to the county interpretation when that interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the ordinance.id.however,the county interpretation effectively rewrites the ordinance by completely disregarding certain ordinance provisions and is flawed for several additional reasons.first,the county disregards the plain fact that the ordinance limits political message signs to square feet.significantly,ordinance defines political message signs as a ny sign containing a opinion or endorsement message and not containing a commercial message,which by its terms encapsulates all signs carrying a message,and then restricts such signs to sizes far below that allowed for billboards.see in re gosman,any does not refer to certain things and not others.any means every and all.it is unlimited.see also ldc.further,the definition of billboard makes no mention of signs.ldc.thus,the county interpretation disregards the plain language of the ordinance if the county truly intended political and commercial messages to be on equal footing,the county would not have regulated the size of political message signs separately.the separate size limitation can not be ignored as superfluous.this conclusion is supported by multiple canons of interpretation.see,connecticut bank germain,d courts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous united states louwsma,cir a precisely drawn statute dealing with a specific subject controls over a statute covering a more generalized spectrum.
second,the county interpretation,which would allow purely political messages to be displayed on billboards,is inconsistent with ldc l.section l states in its entirety,political message signs are limited to square feet,except those in residential districts which shall not exceed six square feet.emphasis added.if the county actually intended for billboards to carry political messages,the county would have presumably included a second exception stating,and except those on billboards which shall not exceed square feet.this inference is supported by the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius,expressing one item of an associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned.see chevron echazabal,d quoting united states vonn,d.
third,the county interpretation can not be reconciled with ldc g,which states,a ll billboards within the county shall have displayed on them the o wner name information displayed in such a manner as to provide clear readable visibility from the abutting road during daylight hours.the minimum space allowable between the billboard and the is generally fifteen feet,but it can be up to six hundred feet along certain highways.a review of café erotica billboards reveals that this display requirement means that the corporation complete legal name must prominently appear on the billboard facing.see ldc a,e.such a requirement makes sense for commercial messages,but not for political ones.under the county interpretation of ordinance,a sign displaying the message vote for john smith would also have to include the words café erotica we dare to bare adult toys great food exit,in similar bold print.such an interpretation is inconsistent with the supreme court direction that an author decision to remain anonymous is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the first amendment.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d.however,we should construe ambiguities in a manner that avoids constitutional questions.see southlake prop,at.
finally,the county interpretation of ordinance gives the administrator unbridled power to discriminate between political messages as he sees fit.on the one hand,the county believes that political messages may in fact be displayed on billboards.on the other hand,the county also concedes that political message signs carry greater size restrictions and are defined as a ny sign containing a opinion or endorsement message and not containing a commercial message.ldc emphasis added.with these two provisions in place,the county has created a handy tool for discriminating based on content.presumably,if the county administrator disagrees with the applicant likely message,then the county can utilize its political message sign tool and thereby restrict the sign to square feet.such a restriction would be entirely permissible under the ordinance as written.see ldc.if,on the other hand,the county administrator reviews an application from an organization he agrees with ideologically,then the county can invoke its seemingly inclusive definition of billboards and allow that particular political message to be displayed much more prominently in this way,the county can effectively discriminate between political messages based solely upon political content,which the county can not do absent compelling reasons.see fly fish,at quoting rock against racism,at.a law that suppresses protected speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys violates the first amendment,absent some compelling state interest in its enforcement.
the county contends that the administrator is never given the opportunity to determine whether a sign contains political speech because the permit application does not require information regarding the message.however,the county needs information regarding,at a minimum,the type of proposed message in order to determine the appropriate sign category,which in turn determines the sign allowable size and location.further,while it is true that the permit application does not require information regarding the proposed message,the county can often infer the content based on the nature of the applicant business.in this case,for example,there is a long history of conflict between café erotica and johns county.thus,any permit application submitted by café erotica could be denied simply because of the perceived danger of the sign possible political message or because of the undesirability of the applicant entertainment.without guidelines,there is a distinct possibility that the county could decline to issue café erotica a permit based on content.see,lakewood,at.a licensing scheme where the licensor does not necessarily view the text of the words about to be spoken,but can measure their probable content or viewpoint by speech already uttered is sufficiently threatening to invite judicial concern.internal citations omitted.
having determined that ordinance does in fact distinguish based on by allowing commercial messages to be displayed more prominently than political messages and by giving the county administrator the unchecked ability to discriminate between political messages,we now turn to metromedia in order to determine whether such restrictions are nevertheless constitutional 
viii.metromedia applied 
in metromedia,the united states supreme court struck down san diego ordinance generally banning the erection of outdoor advertising displays including billboards.the ordinance provided two exceptions to the general prohibition onsite signs and signs falling within one of twelve specified categories thus,onsite commercial advertisements were permitted,but offsite commercial advertising and political messages on billboards were generally forbidden.the actual restriction on outdoor signs was defined by reference to the structural characteristics of the sign,but also by reference to the sign content.specifically,the regulation only applied to a permanent structure used for the display of a commercial or other advertisement to the public.id.at.companies engaged in the business of outdoor advertising challenged the san diego ordinance as facially invalid.
the metromedia court made two distinct rulings.first,with respect to the limits placed on purely commercial speech,the court ruled that commercial billboards may be prohibited while commercial billboards are not.id.at.applying central hudson test for restrictions on commercial speech.second,the metromedia court struck down the portion of the san diego ordinance that banned billboards displaying political messages.the court held 
o ur recent commercial speech cases have consistently accorded noncommercial speech a greater degree of protection than commercial speech.san diego effectively inverts this judgment,by affording a greater degree of protection to commercial than to noncommercial speech the use of onsite billboards to carry commercial messages related to the commercial use of the premises is freely permitted,but the use of otherwise identical billboards to carry noncommercial messages is generally prohibited.the city does not explain how or why noncommercial billboards located in places where commercial billboards are permitted would be more threatening to safe driving or would detract more from the beauty of the city.insofar as the city tolerates billboards at all,it can not choose to limit their content to commercial messages.
metromedia,at.
the same impermissible preferences that the supreme court found unconstitutional in metromedia are also present here,but in a different form.in metromedia,the provision struck down allowed all onsite commercial billboards,but almost completely banned similar noncommercial signs.the instant case involves a similar unconstitutional preference,but in the form of greater size restrictions for noncommercial messages commercial ones.while ordinance does not involve a complete ban on political speech,neither did the metromedia ordinance,as it provided several exemptions from the permitting requirements for certain noncommercial speech.just as in metromedia,the county may not conclude that the communication of commercial information concerning goods and services connected with a particular site is of greater value than the communication of noncommercial messages.id.at.by limiting the size of political messages to roughly that of commercial ones,that is precisely what the county has done.because of its preference for commercial speech,the metromedia court struck down the san diego ordinance as unconstitutional on its face.see metromedia,at.we must do the same,unless the county can satisfy the requirements of strict scrutiny.
because ordinance discriminates against political speech in favor of commercial speech,the county must provide compelling reasons for this disparate treatment that are narrowly tailored to further those interests.see metromedia,at.see also consol.edison,at.the county stated goals are to protect the safety and aesthetic interests of its citizens.the county argues that its ordinance is of no greater restraint on speech than is necessary to protect those interests.the goals of safety and aesthetics are no doubt substantial.however,while size limitations may be justified for all signs based on safety and aesthetics,these interests can not justify allowing billboards to be built up to square feet while allowing a maximum of only square feet for political message signs.the ordinance contains no findings of fact suggesting that political speech distracts motorists more than commercial messages or that political signs are more aesthetically displeasing than commercial advertisements.in short,safety and aesthetics are not truly furthered by an ordinance that allows one small,safe,and visually pleasant political sign to be placed adjacent to a large,unsafe,and aesthetically displeasing commercial billboard.
we also find the county argument unpersuasive for the reasons stated in metromedia,which declared,by allowing commercial establishments to use billboards to advertise the products and services they offer,the city necessarily has conceded that some communicative interests,onsite commercial advertising,are stronger than its competing interests in esthetics and traffic safety.it has nevertheless banned all noncommercial signs except those specifically excepted.id.at.like the city of san diego,johns county has conceded that allowing a certain number of billboards outweighs its interests in aesthetics and safety however,the county favors commercial messages over political ones by allowing commercial messages to be displayed more prominently.this amounts to an unconstitutional preference for commercial speech over political speech.see id.at.the county can achieve its goals simply by mandating that all messages,whether political or commercial,be limited to the same size.see consol.edison,at.
because we find that ordinance makes unconstitutional distinctions,we need not consider whether alternative channels are available for the regulated speech.see consol.edison,at.
ix.severance the district court properly refused to sever the political message provisions 
ordinance contains a severability provision.however,the café district court ruled that it could not sever the unconstitutional provisions of ordinance and still be left with a workable statute.the district court noted the two competing policies at stake,that the court must make every reasonable construction of the ordinance to save it from unconstitutionality at the same time,the court will not an ordinance because this is a function that is within the province of the county.café erotica of florida,johns county,at,order granting summary judgment.the district court also recognized that florida law requires it to sever any provisions of the ordinance that it finds unconstitutional,while allowing valid portions to stand,but only if problematic provisions can be distinguished and clearly separated from the remainder.see lysaght city of new smyrna beach,so d.
we also find that severance is inappropriate.the interests of federalism and comity dictate conservatism to federal courts in imposing their interpretative views on state statutes.see national adver.town of niagara,cir.we agree with the county that the provision separately regulating political message signs is easily severable.however,severance of just this one provision will not address our concerns with the administrator unfettered discretion.therefore,we affirm the district courts decision in striking down the entire johns county sign ordinance,codified as article vii of the johns county ldc.
conclusion 
we reverse the district courts ruling that and are facially unconstitutional.we affirm the district courts ruling that of ordinance is facially unconstitutional and can not be severed from the rest of article vii of the ldc.we also hold that the lack of specific guidelines needed to limit the discretion of the county administrator creates an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.
finding severance inappropriate under these circumstances,we strike down article vii of the johns county ldc in its entirety.because we find ordinance unconstitutional on its face,we need not determine whether ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to the appellees.
affirmed in part,and reversed in part.
the majority holds that the john county ordinance runs afoul of the first amendment in two separate ways.first,the ordinance creates an unacceptable prior restraint on speech by placing too much discretion in the county administrators in accepting or rejecting sign licenses.second,the ordinance favors commercial over speech,thereby,disfavoring core political speech.although i agree with the legal standards announced in the majority opinion,i disagree,in part,with the application of these standards to the ordinance at issue here.specifically,in my view,the ordinance establishes sufficiently explicit and objective standards for reviewing sign applications and thus does not vest administrators with unbridled discretion.in addition,the ordinance provides less protection for speech only with regard to signs.therefore,i respectfully concur only in part with the majority holding.
prior restraint analysis 
as the majority correctly states,county administrators may not have unbridled discretion to determine who can announce their commercial and viewpoints.see city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d.for instance,in city of lakewood,the supreme court determined that a city plan,which allowed the mayor to determine unilaterally which newspapers could place newsracks on city streets and only required him to provide a reason for any denials,was an impermissible prior restraint because it vested too much discretion with the mayor.id.at.at.there,the supreme court required that the city establish neutral criteria to insure that the licensing decision is not based on the content or viewpoint of the speech being considered.id.at.at.
here,john county has established neutral criteria for making its licensing decisions.the sign code is extensive and regulates the number,size,and construction of signs.the county has a legitimate state interest in regulating signs for traffic,safety,and aesthetic reasons,and,thus,it can establish a licensing procedure that limits the signs on these bases.see metromedia city of san diego,d.in addition,the county administrator must provide a written copy of the his decision,if requested,and the decision then can be appealed.see.both of these factors distinguish the john county ordinance from the one challenged in lakewood.
the majority determines that there is the potential for discrimination with regard to political message signs and signs,and that this creates a prior restraint problem.although i agree that john county makes an impermissible distinction between commercial and speech when regulating signs,i do not agree that this is a prior restraint issue.the process for receiving a sign permit is explained in detail,based on objective factors,and open to judicial review.in fact,the criteria are announced clearly enough for this court to rule on the substance of the code based on the face of the ordinance.
moreover,this court has held that county regulations that address the number,size and construction of outdoor signs are permissible.see granite state outdoor advertising,city of petersburg,cir.there,the city also drew distinctions between and advertising.the distinction in the ordinance required the city examiner to review the content of any proposed sign to determine if it met the ordinance requirements,although the city claimed that the review was not for viewpoint.id.at.nonetheless,the court found that such minimal content based distinctions did not make the provision an impermissible prior restraint.id.at.the existence of a content review,in itself,did not vest administrators with unbridled discretion because the review was based on objective factors.here,we review a similar sign regulation procedure.although the ordinance may infringe on first amendment protections by making impermissible distinctions between types of speech,it does not vest administrators with too much discretion 
ii.content based distinctions 
i agree with the majority that john county may not favor commercial messages over political messages.see metromedia,at.at.however,i partly disagree that the ordinance challenged here does so.the majority determines that the county ordinance favors commercial speech for two reasons first,political speech is limited to signs no more than square feet but commercial speech can be placed on larger billboards and second,the ordinance prohibits political speech from being posted on an sign.i disagree that the john county ordinance does the former,but agree that it does the latter.
on the first point,the plain text of the john ordinance permits both commercial and political messages on billboards,which can be as large as square feet.section regulates the size of billboards and contains no reference to the content.section,by contrast,regulates special use signs.that section does not apply to billboards and expands the areas where political signs may be placed.that section states,in relevant part 
the following signs shall be allowed in addition to other signs allowed by this code and are subject to the provisions contained herein and violation of these provisions shall result in a violation of this code 
political message signs,limited to square feet,except those in residential districts which shall not exceed six square feet.
emphasis added.
the majority concludes that this section limits political message signs to square feet,a size much smaller than the square feet permitted for billboards.the most natural reading of the ordinance,however,leads to a different interpretation.billboards,as large as square feet,may contain political or commercial messages under.other signs bearing political messages are allowed in addition to billboards,but are limited to square feet under.in short,the political message signs provision in does not limit the size of political messages on billboards,but simply permits signs other than billboards.if residents of john county wish to publicize political views,they can do so on a square foot billboard or on smaller signs in residential areas.
on the second point,i agree with the majority that the county ordinance favors commercial speech over political speech in regulating signs.here,the county restricts speech where it permits commercial speech,and,thereby,provides less protection to core speech in violation of the metromedia rule.for the above reasons,i concur in part and dissent in part with the majority opinion.
