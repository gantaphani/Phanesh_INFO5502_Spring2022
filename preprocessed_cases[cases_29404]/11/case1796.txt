discussion 
pnec appeals the court order awarding attorney fees.as noted,the provision in the pertinent contract provides the customer and the undersigned agree that if the account is referred for collection to an attorney,the undersigned will pay reasonable attorney fees and costs of collection.the provision must be construed to provide for reciprocal recovery of attorney fees,notwithstanding the contractual language favoring only pnec,subd.a indicating the prevailing party shall be entitled to fees whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not.
pnec primary contention is that a dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds code civ,subd.a does not provide an adequate basis for deeming a defendant to be a party prevailing on the contract pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a.we review a determination of the legal basis for an award of attorney fees de novo as a question of law.pueblo radiology medical group,gerlach th.
it does not appear that the precise question before us has been addressed in published california authority.however,in profit concepts,supra,th at page,this court held that a defendant who successfully moved to quash service for lack of personal jurisdiction code civ,subd.a was the party prevailing on the contract under civil code section and was therefore entitled to recover his reasonable attorney fees as costs.profit concepts,at.
in reaching its holding,the profit concepts court relied principally on its interpretation of the language of civil code section,which states a in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.b the court,upon notice and motion by a party,shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section,whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment.except as provided in paragraph,the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.the court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.where an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case,there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.profit concepts,supra,th at.
reading the language of civil code section,and comparing such language to a prior version of civil code section applied in previous cases,profit concepts concluded that a defendant obtaining a dismissal of a contract claim for lack of personal jurisdiction is a prevailing party.profit concepts,supra,th at.profit concepts contrasted this result with a case in which a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses its case civil code section,subdivision b,plainly provides there is no prevailing party for purposes of that section when the case is voluntarily dismissed,or dismissed pursuant to settlement.profit concepts,supra,th at.
profit concepts rejected the notion that a final judgment was required to obtain attorney fees under civil code section nothing in the current version of the statute as opposed to the version indicates a final judgment is necessary.profit concepts,supra,th at.profit concepts also rejected the argument that only a determination on the merits of the contract claim can result in attorney fees for a prevailing party.id.at.the case in california has been finally resolved.what was awarded on profit concepts complaint zero.thus,the contract claim was finally resolved within the meaning of hsu abbara cal th,and that case does not use the term merits.the determination of which party is the prevailing party must be made without consideration of whether the plaintiff may refile the action after a motion to quash service is granted.the issue of final resolution should not depend on the plaintiff possible future conduct.prevailing party attorney fees should be awarded based on the contract language,the statutory language,and the fact of dismissal of the case,not on speculation.profit concepts,supra,th at.the profit concepts court also found it to be inconsequential to its prevailing party adjudication in the california action that an action in oklahoma had been filed to litigate the merits of the dispute.ibid.
here,the court dismissed the action on forum non conveniens grounds rather than for lack of personal jurisdiction.pnec claims this difference is determinative because forum non conveniens is not a jurisdictional concept,but is instead an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.stangvik shiley cal d.but,like the trial court,we find the cogent statutory analysis set forth in profit concepts to apply equally to this case.if an action on a contract here,the meyer guaranty agreement is dismisse
