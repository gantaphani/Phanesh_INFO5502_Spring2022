background 
street surfing began selling a,inline skateboard called the wave to retail stores around december.less than a year after street surfing began doing business,it had already earned about in sales.by,street surfing also sold and advertised accessories for the wave,such as lime green street surfing wheels for the wave,and the new ultimate street surfer wheel set.
in august,street surfing applied for general liability insurance coverage from great american.street surfing application certified that its website address was and that the wave displayed the street surfing logo.the application did not include a picture or any description of the logo.great american granted the application and provided general liability insurance to street surfing from august until september.this period spanned two policies,the policy august until september,and the policy september until september in september,before it issued the policy,great american captured a screenshot of street surfing website and saved a copy in its underwriting file.
the policies covered,among other things,personal and advertising injury liability that coverage was limited by several exclusions,including a prior publication exclusion,which disclaimed coverage for p ersonal and advertising injury arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period an intellectual property exclusion ip exclusion,which barred coverage for p ersonal and advertising injury arising out of the infringement of copyright,patent,trademark,trade secret or other intellectual property rights,though it did not apply to infringement,in your advertisement,of copyright,trade dress or slogan and an advertising injury amendment ai amendment,which further clarified that t his insurance does not apply to advertising injury arising out of any actual or alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or violation of laws relating to patents,trademarks,trade dress,trade names,trade secrets and.
rhyn noll,who owned the registered trademark streetsurfer,sued street surfing in june,claiming trademark infringement,unfair competition and unfair trade practices under federal and california law.street surfing had known that noll owned the streetsurfer trademark since early,and had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase the trademark around that time.in september,street surfing submitted a claim for coverage to great american and tendered noll complaint.great american denied street surfing claim,citing the ip exclusion and the ai amendment.the letter did not mention the prior publication exclusion,but it did reserve to great american the right to assert any and all other terms,provisions,conditions exclusions set forth in its policy which may be applicable to the noll action.street surfing responded,arguing that none of the intellectual property,prior publication,knowing violation of the rights of another,or breach of contract exclusions applied.nevertheless,great american again denied coverage based on the ip exclusion and ai amendment,noting that discussion of the other issues raised by street surfing,including the prior publication exclusion,would be irrelevant because great american did not cite or rely upon those policy provisions for its denial of coverage.
street surfing settled with noll in december.its only response to great american second denial was to file this action in july,seeking a declaration that great american was obligated to defend and to settle the noll action.when the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the prior publication exclusion relieved great american of any duty to defend street surfing in the noll action.it accordingly granted great american motion for summary judgment,denied street surfing motion for partial summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of great american street surfing timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court rulings on for summary judgment.see rocky mountain farmers union corey,cir.a motion for summary judgment should be granted when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at quoting.a internal quotation marks omitted.as both sides agree,we apply california insurance law.
discussion 
the parties dispute whether great american was obligated to defend street surfing in the noll action.under california law,a general liability insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.waller truck ins,cal.the duty to defend is therefore broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.montrose chem.superior court,cal quoting horace mann ins.barbara,cal.the duty continues until the underlying lawsuit is concluded or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage.id.citation omitted.
to prevail,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage,whereas the insurer must prove it can not.id.at.that is,a ny doubt as to whether the facts establish the existence of the defense duty must be resolved in the insured favor.id.at.these principles apply only to facts potentially giv ing rise to a duty to defend,however,not to doubts regarding the legal interpretation of policy terms.indus.indem.apple computer,d,see also mirpad,llc cal.ins.guarantee ass n,d,if coverage depends on an unresolved dispute over a factual question,the very existence of that dispute would establish a possibility of coverage and thus a duty to defend.lebas fashion imps.of usa,itt hartford ins,d,i t is settled that a potential for coverage can not be based on an unresolved legal dispute concerning policy interpretation which is ultimately resolved in favor of the insurer.
in this duty to defend case,we first address the scope of potential coverage,accepting great american concession that the noll action potentially falls within coverage for use of another advertising idea,but rejecting street surfing argument that the action would also fall within the policies coverage for slogan infringement.next,we hold that the prior publication exclusion relieves great american of its duty to defend street surfing in the noll action because the extrinsic evidence available to great american at the time of tender conclusively establishes that street surfing published at least one advertisement using noll advertising idea before coverage began and that the new advertisements street surfing published during the coverage period were substantially similar to that advertisement.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to great american.
a.the noll action potentially falls within the policies coverage.
in resolving insurance coverage disputes,before considering exclusions,a court must examine the coverage provisions to determine whether a claim falls within the policy terms.waller,at alteration in original quoting hallmark ins.superior court,ct.app internal quotation marks omitted.we accept great american concession,for purposes of summary judgment,that the noll action potentially falls within the policies coverage of injuries arising from t he use of another advertising idea in street surfing advertisement.
we reject street surfing contention that the noll action also falls within the policies slogan infringement liability coverage,which extends to injuries arising out of infringing upon another slogan in street surfing advertisement.interpreting a similar provision,the california supreme court defined a slogan as a brief phrase used in advertising or promotion or a phrase used repeatedly,as in promotion,but recognized that there may be instances where the name of a business,product or service,by itself,is also used as a slogan.palmer truck ins,cal quoting webster collegiate dictionary ed american heritage college dictionary ed.
although streetsurfer arguably could be used as such a slogan,street surfing has not identified any instance of such a use that would have been readily ascertainable by great american at the time the claim was filed,and specifically,nothing in the complaint or in the extrinsic evidence suggests that noll ever used streetsurfer as a slogan.interstate bakeries onebeacon ins,cir.street surfing circumstances are distinguishable from hudson insurance colony insurance,cir,where the third party complaint alleged infringing use of the phrase steel curtain,which we readily recognized as a slogan,a brief phrase,that was used to promote fan loyalty in pro football pittsburgh steelers.id.at.in contrast,when great american reviewed the allegations in noll complaint,it would have ascertained only that noll used streetsurfer as a recognizable brand name to identify his products,not as a phrase promoting that brand because street surfing points to no facts alleged in the complaint or otherwise that would have given rise to an inference that slogan infringement would be at issue in the noll action,its claim for coverage under that provision fails.see interstate bakeries,at holding that the complaint did not fall within the policy slogan infringement coverage because,although it is conceivable that nature own could serve as a slogan,the complaint made no specific allegation relating to such a use and the insured had not shown that the insurer otherwise knew of such a use.street surfing purported use of street surfing as a slogan in its own advertising is irrelevant.the policies coverage extends only to street surfing infringement of another slogan.
we therefore conclude that the noll action potentially fell within the policies coverage,triggering great american duty to defend under the advertising injury provision,but not under the slogan infringement provision.
b.the prior publication exclusion applies to the noll action.
we must next consider whether the district court correctly concluded that the prior publication exclusion relieves great american of its duty to defend the policies prior publication exclusion exempts from coverage p ersonal and advertising injury arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.the straightforward purpose of this exclusion is to bar coverage when the wrongful behavior beg a n prior to the effective date of the insurance policy.taco bell cont l cas,cir see also kim seng great am.ins,d,the purpose of the prior publication exclusion is to preclude coverage for risks that have already materialized.
in the context of advertising injury coverage,an allegedly wrongful advertisement published before the coverage period triggers application of the prior publication exclusion.see infra section.if this threshold showing is made,the exclusion bars coverage of injuries arising out of republication of that advertisement,or any substantially similar advertisement,during the policy period,because such later publications are part of a single,continuing wrong that began before the insurance policy went into effect.ringler.cas,d.if a later advertisement is not substantially similar to the advertisement,however,it constitutes a distinct,or fresh,wrong that does not fall within the prior publication exclusion scope.see kim seng,d at.
street surfing argues that great american has not met its burden of proving that the prior publication exclusion applies for two reasons.first,street surfing argues that the prior publication exclusion does not apply at all because neither the noll complaint nor the extrinsic evidence available to great american at the time of tender conclusively established that street surfing used noll advertising idea in its own advertisements before coverage began in august.street surfing further contends that even if it published such precoverage advertisements,great american duty to defend was separately triggered by new street surfing advertisements published during the policy period using noll advertising idea,because the advertisements were not substantially similar to any advertisements.we address these two arguments in turn.
street surfing published at least one advertisement using noll advertising idea before coverage began.
the policies prior publication exclusion is triggered only if the insured published allegedly injurious material before the beginning of the policy period.the california court of appeal interpreted the scope of an identical exclusion in ringler by looking to the nature of the potential coverage.see d at interpreting the exclusion in the context of the law of defamation because o nly the underlying lawsuits ancillary claims of defamation potentially fell within the policy personal or advertising injury coverage.in this case,the potential coverage is for injuries arising out of t he use of another advertising idea in street surfing advertisement.because this provision specifies the covered injuries in the policies own terms,we can interpret the policies prior publication exclusion without looking to underlying principles of substantive law.
here,the noll action is potentially covered because it alleged that street surfing advertisements using its street surfing logo and brand name were wrongful uses of streetsurfer noll advertising idea.accordingly,if street surfing used its brand name or logo in an advertisement as defined by the policy before august,the prior publication exclusion would bar coverage of injuries from the republication of that advertisement after august 
to determine whether street surfing used noll advertising idea in its own advertisements before coverage began,the district court looked to the noll complaint and three items of extrinsic evidence the affixation of the street surfing logo to the wave,street surfing website address and the screenshot of street surfing website content.we conclude that affixing the street surfing logo to the wave was an advertisement using street surfing brand name and logo.because the street surfing logo was published on the wave before coverage began,the prior publication exclusion bars coverage of injuries caused by that affixation during the policies coverage periods.accordingly,we need not decide whether street surfing website address and content also constituted advertisements under the policy.
noll complaint 
we agree with street surfing that the noll complaint itself does not establish that street surfing used noll advertising idea in advertisements that were published before august.the complaint alleged that the challenged conduct occurred since at least on or about january of,or such other date as may later be determined.these allegations explicitly leave open the possibility that the challenged conduct occurred at such other date as may later be determined.after discovery,the evidence could have established that the challenged conduct actually started after coverage began in august.see cna cas.of cal.seabord sur,holding that there w
