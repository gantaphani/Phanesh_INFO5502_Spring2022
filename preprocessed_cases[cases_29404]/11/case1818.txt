this writ proceeding arises out of a lawsuit filed by the los angeles city attorney against a health insurer,a managed health care service plan,and their parent corporation concerning coverage rescission practices.defendants demurred to the complaint on multiple grounds,and the trial court overruled the demurrer.defendants then filed the instant petition for writ of mandate,seeking reversal of the trial court ruling on the demurrer.we deny the petition.
the principal issue presented is whether the regulatory and enforcement authority of the california department of managed health care dmhc over managed health care service plans,pursuant to the health care service plan act of health,et,hereafter the act,strips the city attorney of the authority to pursue the unfair competition and false advertising claims alleged in the complaint.we conclude that the dmhc regulatory and enforcement authority does not preclude the city attorney from pursuing the unfair competition and false advertising claims.
background 
i.the complaint 
on april,the city attorney filed suit on behalf of the people of the state of california against wellpoint,anthem blue cross of california,blue cross,and anthem blue cross life and health insurance company blue cross insurance,alleging claims under both the unfair competition law bus,et hereafter the ucl and the false advertising law,et hereafter the fal blue cross is a managed health care service plan subject to the act and regulated by the dmhc.blue cross insurance is a life and disability insurer subject to the insurance code and regulated by the california department of insurance doi.both blue cross and blue cross insurance are subsidiaries of wellpoint.
the city attorney claims all relate to postclaims underwriting,a practice prohibited by section of the health and safety code and section of the insurance code no health care service plan shall engage in the practice of postclaims underwriting.for purposes of this section,postclaims underwriting means the rescinding,canceling,or limiting of a plan contract due to the plan failure to complete medical underwriting and resolve all reasonable questions arising from written information submitted on or with an application before issuing the plan contract.this section shall not limit a plan remedies upon a showing of willful misrepresentation.health,see also,containing an identical prohibition except for substitution of the phrase policy or certificate for plan contract and elimination of the final sentence,concerning willful misrepresentation.in order to complete medical underwriting before issuing coverage,the health plan or insurer must make reasonable efforts to ensure a potential subscriber application is accurate and complete.hailey california physicians service th,d.
the complaint alleges that blue cross and blue cross insurance have engaged in a practice of violating the statutory prohibition on postclaims underwriting with respect to their individual and family health coverage according to the complaint,unless an application for health coverage on its face indicates that the applicant has a medical condition or history that may materially impact the risk of assuming coverage,blue cross and blue cross insurance underwriters do not contact the applicant doctors or obtain the applicant medical records before issuing coverage.n o steps of any kind are taken to determine the accuracy of the responses provided in an application that is regular on its face and that does not itself indicate a serious underwriting risk.the complaint alleges that most applications are regular on their face and do not indicate a serious underwriting risk.
after blue cross or blue cross insurance issues coverage,however,certain types of claims for benefits will trigger an investigation of the information provided in the application.according to the complaint,defendants have compiled a list of medical diagnoses that appear to be associated with conditions whose treatment is likely to be costly.whenever defendants receive a claim involving one of those diagnoses,the claims processing is automatically suspended,and defendants undertake an investigation to try to identify any discrepancies between the claimant medical records and the information provided by the claimant in the original application for coverage.if they find a discrepancy,they notify the claimant and take additional steps to rescind coverage,irrespective of whether there is any evidence that the discrepancies were the result of intentional misconduct.even if no discrepancy is found,the suspension of processing of the claim may have caused a substantial delay in approval of the claim,resulting in postponement of needed medical care delay in the payment of the patient doctor,hospital,or other provider.
the complaint further alleges that defendants engage in a number of other acts and practices,all related to their alleged practice of postclaims underwriting,that are unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent within the meaning of the ucl or constitute false advertising within the meaning of the fal.for example,the complaint alleges that many of the medical history questions on defendants application forms are exceedingly and unnecessarily confusing and compound,call for the applicant to make medical judgments,or are otherwise ambiguous and unintelligible to the average consumer,thereby inducing applicants to provide incorrect or incomplete responses,which defendants can later use to rescind coverage if the applicant develops a medical condition requiring expensive treatment.
in a similar vein,the complaint alleges that the members of defendants sales force typically lack the expertise to take an accurate medical history,receive little training in that area,and are paid commissions only on applications that are accepted.the commission payment structure,combined with the lack of training,works to incentivize agents to downplay to consumers the significance of questions in the application that might produce information that could result in the rejection of the application,or that might jeopardize the sale by causing the consumer to be put in a risk category that carries a higher premium for coverage than the agent had previously quoted.as a consequence,agents frequently help consumers fill out applications so that the consumer will qualify for coverage at the rate quoted.
in addition,the complaint alleges that defendants advertising and marketing of their individual and family health coverage convey untrue and misleading information to consumers.again,the allegations all relate to postclaims underwriting.for example,the complaint alleges that defendants purport to cover various medical conditions requiring expensive treatment,but defendants fail to disclose that being diagnosed with one of those conditions will trigger an investigation aimed at rescinding coverage.more broadly,defendants do not disclose their practice of postclaims underwriting and illegal rescission to applicants for individual and family health coverage,and defendants instead make untrue and misleading assertions about their integrity and reliability.
finally,the complaint alleges that defendants issued a press release on february,stating that they had taken steps in to strengthen and make more transparent their process for rescinding policies in order to further minimize the possibility of errors.the press release listed several specific steps that defendants had purportedly taken in,but the complaint alleges that the claims in the press release were false or misleading.for example,one of the measures identified in the press release was c reating a new simplified application for individual benefit policies.the complaint alleges that although defendants did draft a new application form in connection with a tentative settlement of some private litigation relating to postclaims underwriting,the settlement was never finalized and the newly drafted application form has never actually been used by d efendants for any of their individual and family health coverage.
on the basis of those and related allegations,the complaint alleges claims against all defendants under the ucl and the fal.the prayer for relief seeks the full range of remedies authorized by those statutes,including injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from engaging in the unlawful,unfair fraudulent business acts and practices and deceptive advertising described in the complaint,reinstatement of all health coverage that was wrongfully rescinded as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint,disgorgement,and civil penalties of per violation of the ucl and the fal.
ii.the demurrer 
defendants moved to strike certain allegations in the complaint and demurred to the complaint on multiple grounds,only three of which are at issue in this writ proceeding first,defendants argued that all of the claims against blue cross should be dismissed because the power to regulate,investigate and initiate enforcement actions against blue cross has been entrusted exclusively to the dmhc under the act.thus,according to defendants,the city attorney ucl and fal claims against blue cross are barred by the dmhc exclusive regulatory and enforcement powers 
second,defendants argued that the trial court should abstain from deciding the claims in the complaint.defendants contended that this case would require the c ourt to assume general regulatory powers over the health care industry,but that is a task better accomplished by the dmhc and doi,the agencies charged by the legislature with the necessary enforcement powers to ensure compliance.
third,defendants argued that all of the city attorney claims should be either dismissed or stayed under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.according to defendants,all of the relevant considerations weigh in favor of permitting the doi and the dmhc to exercise their primary jurisdiction in this case before the c ity a ttorney should be allowed to pursue his claims,if at all.
the dmhc filed an amicus curiae brief in support of defendants demurrer.defendants also sought judicial notice of certain documents relating to regulatory and enforcement actions already undertaken by the doi and the dmhc,two of which are of particular relevance to this proceeding.both documents postdate the city attorney april,lawsuit against defendants.
one document is a report of a survey conducted by the dmhc to assess compliance by blue cross and other health care service plans with the statutory prohibition on postclaims underwriting.the survey of blue cross included review of case files that were randomly selected from a log of individual policy rescissions occurring between january and june.the dmhc concluded that blue cross had failed to comply with the statutory prohibition in two respects first,in of the reviewed cases,blue cross did not conduct a thorough and complete underwriting investigation prior to approving the application.second,in the cases in which the investigation was inadequate,blue cross did not base its decision to rescind coverage on a finding of willful misrepresentation.indeed,the dmhc found no evidence that blue cross considers the intent of the enrollee to commit willful misrepresentation before rescinding coverage.the report was issued to blue cross on july,and issued to the public file one week later.
the other document is a settlement agreement between blue cross and the dmhc that resulted from the dmhc investigation but actually preceded issuance of the dmhc report.the effective date of the agreement is july.the agreement states that blue cross has made a voluntary decision to allow former enrollees defined as persons whose individual or family health coverage was rescinded between january,and july,to purchase individual or family coverage going forward without medical underwriting.blue cross also agreed that it would not rescind any individual or family coverage issued on or before the agreement effective date,but blue cross reserved the right to rescind in accordance with california law any individual and family coverage issued thereafter.elsewhere,the agreement further states that blue cross contends that its actions regarding rescission were already in accordance with california law and that the agreement is not,and shall not be construed as,any sort of admission by blue cross of a violation of,or with,s ection of the california health and safety code,any other provision of the act,or any other federal or state statute,law or regulation,or under common law.
in addition,under the settlement blue cross agreed to undertake reasonable efforts to make a written offer to provide a financial settlement to some but not necessarily all of the former enrollees to cover their medical expenses,which are defined as those charges or a portion of charges from a medical provider that blue cross would otherwise have paid but for the rescission.should disputes about the amounts of the individual financial settlements arise,the agreement provides for alternative dispute resolution.under the settlement blue cross also agreed to pay an administrative fine of million and to undertake certain forms of corrective action pursuant to a corrective action proposal that blue cross was to submit to the dmhc.
finally,the settlement agreement provides broadly that it is a full settlement of all dmhc claims against blue cross concerning any rescissions that occurred before the agreement effective date by entering into this s ettlement a greement,the parties hereby settle all pending enforcement matters and all issues,accusations,and claims that the dmhc has or may have against blue cross,including,without limitation,any alleged violation of section of the health and safety code or any other provision of the act,relating to or arising from any rescission of individual or family health coverage that may have occurred on or before july.the dmhc final report of the medical survey on underwriting regarding blue cross rescission practices will not be referred to the division of enforcement for any further administrative action or otherwise referred for enforcement.italics added.the agreement also acknowledges that blue cross is currently involved in private litigation regarding rescission issues,but the agreement provides that a ny settlement agreements arising out of the private litigation shall have no e ffect on the terms of this settlement agreement.
on appeal,defendants ask that we judicially notice certain additional documents concerning actions the doi has taken against blue cross insurance.the documents postdate the trial court hearing on defendants demurrer,and the record does not indicate that the documents were ever submitted to the trial court we nonetheless grant defendants request that we judicially notice the doi documents and we also grant the other requests for judicial notice submitted by the parties and their amici.the documents reflect that on february,the doi initiated an administrative proceeding against blue cross insurance concerning its health coverage rescission practices.the documents further reflect that on february,the doi and blue cross insurance entered into a stipulation and waiver that settled the dispute.the settlement is broadly similar to the settlement between the dmhc and blue cross.it provides,inter alia,that blue cross insurance does not admit any form of wrongdoing blue cross insurance agrees to stop knowingly engaging in any acts or practices in the business of life and disability insurance that violate certain insurance code provisions,including the prohibition on postclaims underwriting blue cross insurance shall make certain funds available to pay certain past medical costs of former insureds whose coverage was rescinded blue cross insurance will also offer to sell those former insureds health coverage going forward and the settlement is intended to be a complete and final resolution of the issues and allegations arising out of the rescission practices that were the subject of the administrative proceeding,and no further action will be brought against blue cross insurance by the doi upon the matters referenced therein.
iii.the trial court ruling 
on march,the trial court entered a detailed order overruling defendants demurrer in its entirety.the court rejected all three of the defense arguments described court concluded that the dmhc regulatory and enforcement powers under the act do not preclude the city attorney ucl and fal claims,defendants judicial abstention argument is not well taken,and defendants have not established the applicability of the primary jurisdiction doctrine.
at the same time,the court ruled pursuant to code of civil procedure section that there is a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of this litigation.defendants filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking review of the ruling on the demurrer,and we issued an order to show cause.we also granted the requests of various third parties,including the dmhc,to file amicus curiae briefs.the dmhc contends,as it did in the trial court,that the demurrer should have been sustained.
discussion 
i.the city attorney has standing to bring this action under the ucl and the fal 
defendants argue that the city attorney has no standing to enforce california health plan laws either directly or pursuant to the ucl and the fal,because t he dmhc exclusive regulatory and enforcement authority displaces and subordinates the power of other government prosecutors to regulate health plans or assert that their conduct violates state laws such as the act.we disagree.
the city attorney has express statutory authority to file suit on behalf of the people under the ucl actions for relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction by the attorney general or a district attorney or by a county counsel authorized by agreement with the district attorney in actions involving violation of a county ordinance,or by a city attorney of a city having a population in excess of,or by a city attorney in a city and county or,with the consent of the district attorney,by a city prosecutor in a city having a city prosecutor in the name of the people of the state of california upon their own complaint or upon the complaint of a board,officer,person,corporation,or association,or by a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.bus,italics added.the city attorney also has express statutory authority to sue on behalf of the people under the fal.id.granting the city attorney authority to sue under the fal in terms largely identical to those used in the ucl.defendants do not contend to the contrary.
the ucl and the fal also contain the following provision unless otherwise expressly provided,the remedies or penalties provided by this chapter are cumulative to each other and to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.bus.therefore,the fact that there are alternative remedies under a specific statute does not preclude a ucl remedy,unless the statute itself provides that the remedy is to be exclusive.state of california altus finance cal th,d,hereafter altus see also stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,hereafter stop youth addiction.altus and stop youth addiction were ucl cases,but because the legislature used identical language in both the ucl and the fal to make both statutes remedies cumulative,there is no reason why the holdings of altus and stop youth addiction on this point should not apply to the fal as well.
existing case law attests to the breadth of the ucl and the cumulative nature of its remedies,both in general and in the specific contexts of the act and postclaims underwriting.first,unlawful business practices that are actionable under the ucl include anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,hereafter farmers,quoting barquis merchants collection cal d.second,the ucl authorizes lawsuits to remedy unlawful conduct even if the underlying statute that renders the conduct unlawful does not itself create an independent right of action.stop youth addiction,supra,cal th at,d,committee on children television,general foods cal d.third,the ucl authorizes duplicate enforcement by both public prosecutors and administrative ucl action by law enforcement officials does not preclude a later administrative proceeding against the same defendant concerning the same conduct,and an administrative proceeding does not preclude a later law enforcement action under the ucl.people damon th,d same result under both the ucl and the fal setliff.service bureau of automotive repair th,d.fourth,even if the underlying statute that renders the conduct unlawful expressly authorizes a particular agency to enforce the statute but does not include a parallel authorization for suits by local law enforcement officials,those officials can still sue under the ucl for violation of the statute.people mckale cal d,hereafter mckale.fifth,postclaims underwriting,as prohibited by insurance code section,is unlawful within the meaning of the ucl and hence is actionable under the ucl.ticconi blue shield of california life health ins.th,d hereafter ticconi.sixth and finally,although the act expressly authorizes the dmhc to enforce the statute and does not include a parallel authorization for suits by private individuals,private individuals can bring suit under the ucl for violations of the act.bell blue cross of california th,d hereafter bell.
as applied in this case,the foregoing authorities point unambiguously to the conclusion that the city attorney has authority to sue under the ucl for violation of health and safety code section,the act prohibition of postclaims underwriting unless there is a statute that expressly precludes the city attorney from doing so.defendants do not cite any such statute.indeed,the dmhc effectively concedes in its amicus brief that no such statute exists.concededly,the act does not contain a specific statute stating that the act and the dmhc are the exclusive remedy.
the dmhc nonetheless contends that the absence of such a statute does not doom defendants argument,because t he legislature can not and need not anticipate every situation that might arise and supply a rule for each situation,and t he legislature was not required to provide catch phrases to preempt the city attorney actions here.the legislature did,however,supply a rule for the situation before ucl and the fal expressly provide that the city attorney may sue for redress under the ucl and the fal unless some other statute provides to the contrary.bus,altus,supra,cal th at,d,stop youth addiction,supra,cal th at,d.because no statute provides to the contrary,the city attorney may sue.
in their petition for rehearing,defendants contend that they have indeed cited statutes that expressly preclude the city attorney from suing under the ucl and fal based on violations of the act.defendants first point to health and safety code section,which is entitled penalties not exclusive and provides in its entirety as follows the civil,criminal,and administrative remedies available to the director pursuant to this article are not exclusive,and may be sought and employed in any combination deemed advisable by the director to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
according to defendants,that statute supports their position for the following reasons the statute empowers the dmhc director to select any combination of remedies to be sought,including ucl and fal claims based on violations of the act.by leaving the combination of available remedies to the discretion of the dmhc director,defendants conclude,the statute strips other law enforcement officials of their power to bring ucl and fal claims based on violations of the act without the director prior authorization.
defendants argument fails because it ignores the requirement that in order for a statute to deprive the city attorney of authority to sue under the ucl or fal,it must do so expressly.bus.code.on its face,health and safety code section does not meet that requirement.it authorizes the dmhc director to pursue the remedies available to the director in any combination that the director deem s advisable.health saf.code.but the statute says nothing about anyone else authority to pursue those remedies or to pursue any other remedies,any remedies that are not available to the director.thus,directly contrary to defendants contention,the statute does not expressly preclude the city attorney from suing under the ucl and fal based on violations of the act.we express no opinion on defendants contention that the remedies referred to in health and safety code section include remedies provided by statutes that are not part of the act,such as the ucl and fal.
the other statutes cited in defendants petition for rehearing fare no better.health and safety code section authorizes the dmhc director to bring an action for an injunction and an ancillary or other equitable relief,or to ask that the attorney general do so,but the statute says nothing about the authority of anyone private citizens or public pursue such remedies.health and safety code section authorizes the dmhc director to suspend or revoke the license of a health care service plan if the director determines that the licensee has committed acts or omissions that are grounds for disciplinary action,which include engaging in any conduct that constitutes fraud or dishonest dealing or unfair competition,as defined by the the ucl.health and saf.code,subd.b.but the statute says nothing about the authority of anyone including the dmhc director to bring an action under the ucl or fal.defendants petition for rehearing also cite health safety code sections and,but we address those statutes in footnote,post.
lacking the requisite statutory provision to support their argument of exclusivity,defendants instead rely primarily on an overbroad reading of van de kamp gumbiner d.hereafter gumbiner,a case that did not involve either the ucl or the fal.in gumbiner,the attorney general filed suit against a health care service plan and its officers and directors for breach of contract and conspiracy to breach fiduciary obligations.gumbiner,supra,d at.the breach of contract claims arose out of the defendants alleged breaches of the settlement of a previous lawsuit brought by a previous attorney general.id.at.the fiduciary duty claims arose out of the officers and directors alleged undervaluing of the plan assets before converting the plan from a nonprofit to a corporation.id.at.the defendants demurred,arguing that the attorney general had no authority to maintain the action,and the trial court agreed.id.at.the court of appeal affirmed,reasoning that although the attorney general had once held certain common law and statutory law enforcement powers concerning health care service plans,those powers had been stripped away by more recent legislative enactments including the act,which had vested regulatory and enforcement authority in the department of corporations id.at.see also id.at.department refers to the department of corporations.the court further reasoned that some of those legislative enactments actually demonstrated legislative intent to supersede the very settlement that the attorney general was trying to enforce.id.at.moreover,the parties to the settlement were the defendants and the people of the state of california,not the attorney general personally,and the attorney general lacked authority to sue on the settlement in the name of the people because the attorney general had been stripped of his common law enforcement powers over health care service plans.id.at.
gumbiner says nothing at all about the authority of any public attorney general,a district attorney,or a city sue a health care service plan under the ucl or the fal in connection with an alleged violation of the act.defendants nonetheless contend that gumbiner is controlling here because,for example,it states that the intent of certain legislation was to ensure that sole regulatory authority over health care service plans was vested in the department of corporations gumbiner,supra,d at,and that the effect of another piece of legislation was to divest the a ttorney g eneral of statutory authority to intervene in certain actions involving health plans and to vest sole regulatory authority over health plans in the department of corporations id.at.because gumbiner thus repeatedly refers to the sole authority of the department of corporations which authority has since been transferred to the dmhc,defendants conclude that neither the attorney general nor any other law enforcement official,such as a district attorney or a city attorney,has authority to enforce the act,via the ucl or in any other manner,without prior authorization by the dmhc.
defendants argument fails because gumbiner references to the sole authority of the department of corporations do not carry the broad significance that defendants attribute to them.those references mean only that the attorney general was stripped of both its common law authority and its authority under certain specified statutes to regulate health plans,and the act expressly gave regulatory authority concerning health plans to the department of corporations and later to the dmhc and did not give it to anyone else.but in the case before us,we are dealing with two statutes,the ucl and the fal,that do expressly give the city attorney authority to sue as long as no other statute expressly provides to the contrary.gumbiner does not hold or even state in dictum that some other statute provides to the does not involve,and hence says nothing about,the ucl and the fal.and,as noted above,by failing to identify any statute that does provide to the contrary,defendants implicitly concede and the dmhc explicitly concedes that no such statute exists.
defendants attempt to distinguish mckale,supra,is likewise unavailing.mckale involved ucl claims brought by a district attorney to enforce certain provisions of the mobilehome parks act and related sections of the administrative code.mckale,supra,cal d at.the supreme court stated that t he central issue presented is whether the district attorney has power to proceed against defendants for the claimed violations.while he has no express authority to enforce the mobilehome parks authority being expressly vested in the commission on housing and community does have standing to sue for acts of unfair competition prescribed by the ucl,which expressly empowers a district attorney to prosecute actions for an injunction to halt acts of unfair competition and for collection of civil penalties assessed for such acts.ibid.the court concluded that the district attorney did have that power,because the ucl expressly gave it to him and no other statute expressly provided to the contrary.id.at.mckale is therefore squarely on point when a statute the mobilehome parks act or the act grants enforcement authority to a particular government agency the commission on housing and community development or the dmhc and does not grant it to anyone else,a local law enforcement official a district attorney or a city attorney can still pursue ucl claims based on conduct made unlawful by the statute.
defendants petition attempts to dispose of mckale in a single short paragraph,arguing that mckale did not involve a situation where exclusive enforcement authority was vested in a single governmental agency.the argument fails because it assumes that the dmhc enforcement authority is exclusive in the relevant sense,but that is precisely the point at issue.no statute says it is,just as in mckale no statute said the authority of the commission on housing and community development was exclusive in the relevant sense rather,defendants sole basis for the claim of exclusivity apart from gumbiner,which we have already explained is irrelevant is that the act gives enforcement authority to the dmhc and does not give it to anyone else,just as in mckale the mobile home parks act gave enforcement authority to the commission on housing and community development and did not give it to anyone else.we conclude that defendants have failed to distinguish mckale and,moreover,that the case is not materially distinguishable 
defendants reliance on various other cases is similarly misplaced.for example,defendants cite samura kaiser foundation health plan,th,d hereafter samura,for the proposition that even private party plaintiffs claiming injury by health plan practices may not bring ucl or other act claims based on regulatory provisions of the act.that case,unlike gumbiner,did involve a ucl action premised on violations of the act.id.at,d.the court of appeal distinguished between provisions of the act that are merely regulatory and those that proscribe certain conduct as unlawful.id.at,d.the court concluded that because the ucl does not confer on private individuals a general power to enforce the act,private suits under the ucl can not be used to enforce the act regulatory provisions.ibid.but the court recognized that a private individual may still sue under the ucl to enjoin acts which are made unlawful by the act.ibid.the court then reviewed the act provisions on which the plaintiff suit was based,concluded that they were merely regulatory,and therefore concluded that the suit could not proceed.id.at,d.
samura is of no use to defendants here,because health and safety code section like insurance code section both defines the term postclaims underwriting and expressly provides that postclaims underwriting is unlawful.postclaims underwriting is thus an act which is made unlawful by the act and hence may be enjoined under the ucl samura,supra,th at,d.
we are not the first court to reach that conclusion.in ticconi,supra,the defendant health insurer relied on samura in arguing that the insurance code provisions dealing with postclaims underwriting do not provide a basis for a ucl action because they are merely regulatory in nature.ticconi,supra,th at,d.that is,the defendant raised exactly the same argument under samura with respect to insurance code section that defendants in this case raise under samura with respect to health and safety code section.the court of appeal rejected the argument because insurance code section explicitly makes postclaims underwriting unlawful and thus provides a basis for an injunction under the ucl.ibid.the same conclusion follows concerning health and safety code section.by statute,under both the insurance code and the health and safety code,postclaims underwriting is an unlawful practice and thus may be enjoined under the ucl.
defendants also rely on altus,supra,for the proposition that when a state agency has exclusive jurisdiction over a subject,the authority of other prosecutors is displaced whenever they seek to act concurrently,in a manner that would essentially duplicate the regulating agency legal action.quoting altus,supra,cal th at,d.again,the problem with defendants argument is the lack of statutory support for the claim that the act excludes the authority otherwise expressly granted to city attorneys to sue under the ucl to remedy unlawful conduct such as violations of the act.altus involved a statute that expressly vested certain powers exclusively in the insurance commissioner.altus,supra,cal th at,d,quoting.accordingly,the supreme court concluded the attorney general can not seek remedies under the ucl that would essentially duplicate the insurance commissioner exclusive enforcement powers.id.at,d.but the attorney general remained free to pursue ucl remedies that did not duplicate those exclusive enforcement powers.id.at,d.
defendants cite no statutory provision that expressly vests exclusive enforcement power in the dmhc.altus therefore supports the city attorney,not defendants.the city attorney ucl and fal claims do not duplicate any enforcement powers that a statute expressly makes the exclusive province of the dmhc.
defendants also argue that we should show deference to the dmhc view that the city attorney lacks standing to pursue this action against blue cross.we disagree.although t he construction of a statute by the executive department charged with its administration is entitled to great weight and substantial deference bell,supra,th at,fn,d,we can not agree with the dmhc ultimate conclusion that the city attorney lacks standing.both the ucl and the fal which the dmhc does not administer expressly authorize the city attorney claims and expressly provide that both statutes remedies and penalties are cumulative to those available under all other california laws unless a statute expressly provides to the contrary.the dmhc concedes that the act which the dmhc does administer does not expressly provide to the contrary.we therefore do not defer to the dmhc view that the act divests the city attorney of authority to pursue the ucl and fal claims alleged in the complaint.
finally,both defendants and the dmhc advance various public policy arguments aimed at showing that the city attorney suit constitutes pernicious dual regulation of health plans and will have an adverse effect on california fragile healthcare ecosystem.such arguments are properly addressed to the legislature,not to this court.the statutory language is ucl and the fal expressly give the city attorney authority to sue unless otherwise provided to the contrary,and,as relevant here,no other statute does provide to the contrary.
further,defendants and the dmhc public policy arguments are not persuasive.defendants and the dmhc concede,as they must,that private plaintiffs can pursue ucl actions based on violations of the act.bell,supra,th at,d.defendants and the dmhc position therefore is not that no one can bring a ucl action that would duplicate the dmhc power to enforce the act.rather,defendants and the dmhc contend that local law enforcement officials can not bring such actions,even though private plaintiffs undisputedly can.but defendants and the dmhc never explain why,at the level of public policy,ucl actions based on violations of the act will allegedly lead to more undesirable consequences when brought by local law enforcement officials than when brought by private plaintiffs.in the absence of such an explanation,it is difficult to discern any public policy rationale for prohibiting the city attorney suit.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the city attorney has standing to pursue the complaint ucl and fal claims against blue cross.
ii.the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to abstain 
defendants argue that t he trial court should have abstained as to all the claims in this case.we review the trial court decision for abuse of discretion.alvarado selma convalescent hospital th,d hereafter alvarado.we conclude that the trial court decision not to abstain did not exceed the bounds of reason,so the court did not abuse its discretion.
a reviewing court should not disturb the exercise of a trial court discretion unless it appears that there has been a miscarriage of justice it is fairly deducible from the cases that one of the essential attributes of abuse of discretion is that it must clearly appear to effect injustice.citations.discretion is abused whenever,in its exercise,the court exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.the burden is on the party complaining to establish an abuse of discretion,and unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of justice a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of its discretionary power.denham superior court cal d,quoting loomis loomis d.
case law states that a court may abstain from adjudicating a suit that seeks equitable remedies if granting the requested relief would require a trial court to assume the functions of an administrative agency,or to interfere with the functions of an administrative agency.alvarado,supra,th at,d.abstention may also be appropriate if the lawsuit involves determining complex economic policy,which is best handled by the legislature or an administrative agency,or if granting injunctive relief would be unnecessarily burdensome for the trial court to monitor and enforce given the availability of more effective means of redress.ibid.
the trial court could have reasonably concluded that none of those circumstances is present in the city attorney action.first,the city attorney is not asking the court to assume or interfere with the functions of an administrative agency.rather,the city attorney is asking the court to perform an ord
