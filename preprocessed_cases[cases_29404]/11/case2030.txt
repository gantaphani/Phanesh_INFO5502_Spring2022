commercial real estate landlords impliedly warrant that their premises are suitable for the tenants intended commercial purposes.in this case,however,the tenants expressly disclaimed that warranty.we must decide whether the disclaimer precludes the tenants suit against the landlord for breach of the warranty.we also decide whether the tenants agreement to lease the commercial building as is prevents them from suing the landlord for other claims based on the property condition.we answer both questions yes and affirm the court of appeals judgment.
background 
in,ron snider founded playgrounds,a playground equipment manufacturing company.the business grew rapidly.in,snider purchased six acres of land in new braunfels and subsequently constructed a square foot building for the business.by the late,employed about twenty people,including bonnie caddell and patrick finn,to whom snider later sold the business.caddell was bookkeeper finn performed miscellaneous jobs including assembling and installing playgrounds,maintaining machinery,purchasing supplies,and managing human resources.
the city of new braunfels fire code requires owners to install sprinkler systems for any building exceeding square feet if the building contains certain combustible materials.building exceeded that threshold,and the fire marshal recommended,but did not require,that the building have a sprinkler system.both caddell and finn knew that the fire marshal recommendation was never implemented.
eventually,finn and caddell purchased the business,and snider leased them the building.each party was represented by counsel during the lease negotiations.finn and caddell decided not to inspect the premises before leasing because,as caddell testified,they knew more about the building than anyone else.
the lease provided that would accept the building as is,expressly waiving all warranties obtain insurance on the building to cover loss and perform maintenance and repairs the lease also contained a holdover provision 
the lease was signed on september,and the original term expired in september of.the parties did not execute a new instrument,but continued to pay and snider continued to accept monthly rent checks.on august,a fire destroyed the building.
procedural history 
snider insurer,american economy insurance company,paid him approximately for the loss of the building.received nearly under its insurance policy covering the building contents and business interruption.thereafter,american economy brought a subrogation suit against,which filed against american economy and claims against snider.ultimately,all parties other than and snider were dismissed prior to this appeal.
suit against snider alleged that defective electrical wiring and the lack of a sprinkler system caused the fire snider summary judgment motion argued that all of claims,except the breach of contract claim,were barred by the as is clause and warranty disclaimer,or were alternatively precluded by the lease waiver of subrogation clause.the parties settled the contract claim,and the trial court granted snider a final summary judgment.in the court of appeals,argued that the as is clause was no longer in effect after the original lease term ended in,and that even if it was,the clause was unenforceable.
the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment.id.at.we granted petition for review.
issues presented 
argues that the as is clause lapsed when the original lease term expired the clause does not waive claims for breach of the implied warranty of suitability,negligence per se,gross negligence,and fraud the absence of a sprinkler system constitutes a latent premises defect and the waiver of subrogation clause is not valid.we hold that the as is clause was in effect at the time of the fire,the implied warranty of suitability disclaimer expressly and effectively disclaimed that warranty,and the as is clause negated the causation element of other claims against snider.consequently,we do not reach remaining issues.
discussionaenforceability of the as is clause 
argues that the as is provision did not survive when lease original term expired.contends that because it never exercised the lease renewal options and the lease expired almost four years before the fire,the parties shared a simple,relationship under the holding over clause of the original lease when the fire occurred.citing bockelmann marynick,argues that the holdover tenancy is a new tenancy to which the terms of the original lease do not apply.
snider responds that,under the written lease,the as is clause,along with all other terms of the lease,governs during any holdover tenancy.the court of appeals held that the as is clause survived the original lease term expiration.at.we agree.
and snider allowed the original lease agreement to expire without executing a new instrument.because continued to occupy the premises,it was a holdover tenant.the parties agree that their relationship was best characterized as a tenancy as contemplated by the holdover clause in the lease.that clause provides that a ny holding over without written consent of landlord shall constitute a lease from,under the terms and provisions of this lease to the extent applicable to a tenancy from.emphasis added.although argues that the tenancy is not governed by the lease terms,we can not ignore the plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase under the terms and provisions of this lease.we hold that under the terms and provisions of this lease means just that the lease governed the tenancy.thus,the as is clause was in effect when the fire occurred.
furthermore,reliance on bockelmann is misplaced.see bockelmann.in that case,brenda and hermann bockelmann,husband and wife,were cotenants in a residential lease.id.at.ten days before the lease expired,brenda separated from hermann and vacated the residence.id.hermann remained on the premises after the lease expired,triggering the lease holdover provision,which provided that s hould tenant remain in possession of the demised premises after the natural expiration of this lease,a new tenancy from year to year shall be created between lessor and tenant which shall be subject to all the terms and conditions hereof id.subsequently,hermann ceased paying rent and the landlord sued both hermann and brenda to recover the unpaid rent.id.
the issue before us was whether brenda was liable for the rent that accrued while hermann was a holdover tenant.id.at.holding that brenda was not liable,we said that under the express terms of the lease,hermann holdover tenancy was a new tenancy rather than an extension or renewal of the original lease.id.at.thus,hermann holdover tenancy was not a continuation of the original cotenancy,but rather a new tenancy for which only hermann was liable.id.at.our use of the term new tenancy came directly from the holdover provision of the lease.we did not say that the terms and provisions of the original lease would not apply.to the contrary,we gave effect to the lease stating that this new tenancy would be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original tenancy.id.at.the difference between the original and new tenancies involved the parties who were bound,not the tenancy terms and conditions.at least one court of appeals has recognized this important distinction.clark whitehead,dist,writ denied rejecting holdover tenant argument that bockelmann supports a finding that guarantees contained in the original lease did not apply to the holdover tenancy.bockelmann stands for the proposition that a cotenant who does not holdover is not liable for unpaid rent incurred when the other cotenant holds over thus,it does not support argument that the original lease terms did not apply to the holdover tenancy.
having concluded that the as is provision was still in effect when the fire occurred,we next address whether it waives some or all of claims.
effect of the implied warranty of suitability disclaimer 
argues that the as is provision can not nullify the implied warranty of suitability as to the defects at issue in this case.contends that our davidow opinion authorized a waiver of the implied warranty of suitability only when the lease makes the tenant responsible for certain specifically enumerated defects.davidow inwood north professional i.consequently,the general as is provision in this lease could not waive the warranty.
snider answers that claim for breach of the implied warranty of suitability is waived because the lease as is clause expressly disclaimed that warranty.see prudential ins.of am.jefferson.we agree with snider 
we first recognized the implied warranty of suitability for intended commercial purposes in davidow.at.the warranty means that at the inception of the lease there are no latent defects in the facilities that are vital to the use of the premises for their intended commercial purpose and that these essential facilities will remain in a suitable condition.id.
davidow illustrates the purpose of the implied warranty of suitability.davidow leased office space from inwood for his medical practice and began experiencing problems soon after moving into the building.davidow,at.the problems were extensive inadequate air conditioning,a leaky roof,pest and rodent infestations,inadequate lighting,periods of no electricity,a filthy parking lot,and repeated vandalization.id.at.davidow eventually vacated the premises and ceased paying rent before the lease expired.id.at.inwood sued davidow for the unpaid rent.id.davidow raised the affirmative defenses of material breach of contract and breach of the implied warranty that the premises were suitable for use as a medical office.id.we agreed with davidow argument that commercial tenants generally rely on their landlords greater abilities to inspect and repair the premises.id.at.davidow merely expanded the application of the implied warranty of habitability already recognized in residential leases in kamarath bennett,
while davidow did not address whether or how the implied warranty of suitability may be waived,we did say that if the parties to a lease expressly agree that the tenant will repair certain defects,then the provisions of the lease will control.davidow,at.we also listed several factors to consider when determining a breach of the warranty,including 
the nature of the defect its effect on the tenant use of the premises the length of time the defect persisted the age of the structure the amount of the rent the area in which the premises are located whether the tenant waived the defects and whether the defect resulted from any unusual or abnormal use by the tenant.
id.emphasis added.thus,davidow both recognized the implied warranty of suitability and noted that the agreement terms could alter that warranty.we had no occasion to decide the manner in which the warranty could be waived.
although we have not spoken again on the scope of the waiver,several courts of the court of appeals in this.see,at u nder davidow,the as is clause negates the implied warranty of suitability itself.lee perez,dist,no pet.noting that an as is clause may waive implied warranties,but concluding that the clause in this case did not waive the deed restriction defect at issue because the scope of the as is waiver was limited to physical conditions on the property parts indus,christi,no pet.as a matter of law,the landlord implied warranty of suitability for commercial purposes is limited only by those specific terms in a commercial lease whereby a tenant expressly agrees to repair certain defects.gober wright,dist,writ denied same.the parts industries and gober courts agreed that the implied warranty of suitability can only be waived as to specific conditions where the tenant expressly agrees to repair certain defects.parts,at gober,at.neither of these cases,however,involved an express disclaimer of the implied warranty of suitability like the lease at issue here.moreover,the leases in parts industries and gober expressly made the lessor responsible for the defects at issue.parts,at finding that the lessor agreed to keep the defect at issue in good repair gober,at finding that under the lease,the lessors were responsible for repair of the defect at issue.therefore,is distinguishable from parts industries and gober because the lease expressly disclaims the implied warranty of suitability.here,the court of appeals determined that under prudential,the as is clause would foreclose the implied warranty of suitability claim at.we agree.
in prudential,we were asked to determine the effect of an as is clause on a buyer claim for damages against the seller based on the condition of the commercial property.at.in that case,goldman bought an office building from prudential insurance company.id.at.the contract as is clause provided 
seller and purchaser agree that purchaser is taking the property as is with any and all latent and patent defects and that there is no warranty by seller that the property is fit for a particular purpose.purchaser acknowledges that it is not relying upon any representation,statement or other assertion with respect to the property condition,but is relying upon its examination of the property.purchaser takes the property under the express understanding there are no express or implied warranties except for limited warranties of title set forth in the closing documents.
id.at.goldman,a knowledgeable real estate investor,had the property inspected by his maintenance supervisor,his property manager,and an independent professional engineering firm none of the inspectors discovered the asbestos that would later become the basis of the lawsuit.id.at.in addition,there was no evidence that prudential the parties completed the the building contained asbestos.id.at.goldman later discovered that the building contained asbestos fireproofing when he tried to refinance the building.id.at.he sued prudential,alleging violations of the texas deceptive trade protection act,negligence,fraud,and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.id.at.we held that the as is provision negated the causation element necessary for goldman to recover on each asserted cause of action.id.at.
the sole cause of a buyer injury when he agrees to purchase something as is,by his own admission,is the buyer himself.he has agreed to take the full risk of determining the value of the purchase.he is not obliged to do so he could insist instead that the seller assume part or all of that risk by obtaining warranties to the desired effect.if the seller is willing to give such assurances,however,he will ordinarily insist upon additional compensation.rather than pay more,a buyer may choose to rely entirely upon his own determination of the condition and value of his purchase.in making this choice,he removes the possibility that the seller conduct will cause him damage.
id.thus,by agreeing to purchase the property as is,goldman agreed to rely on his own appraisal of the bargain,and he accepted the risk that he may err.id.we did not address what effect,if any,an as is provision would have on a claim for breach of the implied warranty of suitability,as this warranty applies only to commercial leases and prudential involved a sale of commercial property.today,we squarely address whether an express disclaimer may waive the implied warranty of suitability in a commercial lease.davidow noted that the provisions of the lease would control if the parties expressly agreed that the tenant would repair certain defects.at.prudential stands for the proposition fraud in the as is provision can waive claims based on a condition of the property.at.taken together,these cases lead to one logical conclusion the implied warranty of suitability is waived when,as here,the lease expressly disclaims that warranty.we hold,therefore,that as a matter of law,waived the implied warranty of suitability 
our conclusion that the implied warranty of suitability may be contractually waived is also supported by public policy.texas strongly favors parties freedom of contract.bmg direct,peake,in re prudential ins.of,as a rule,parties have the right to contract as they see fit as long as their agreement does not violate the law or public policy.we recently reaffirmed this policy,stating that 
p ublic policy requires that men of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contracting,a
