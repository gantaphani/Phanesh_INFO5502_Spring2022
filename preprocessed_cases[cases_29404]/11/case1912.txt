the police obtained a search warrant for a business establishment that was open to the public,based on sales from the establishment of methamphetamine by an individual who was neither an owner nor an employee of the business establishment.we conclude the search warrant was facially invalid.when a search warrant for a business establishment open to the public is based on the sale of controlled substances by a target who is neither an owner nor employee of the establishment,the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant must establish probable cause to believe controlled substances will be found at the business establishment.the sale of controlled substances alone is insufficient,because there is no probable cause to believe the controlled substances are stored in the business establishment rather than on the person or in the possession of the target.we conclude further,however,that the police relied in good faith on the search warrant.we affirm.
