plaintiffs and appellants greg rosolowski et collectively,plaintiffs appeal a judgment of dismissal following an order sustaining a demurrer interposed by defendant and respondent guthy renker llc guthy to rosolowski first amended complaint without leave to amend.
the advent of electronic mail,or email,has brought with it a flood of commercial advertising,some of it misleading,false,or deceptive,some even fraudulent,much of it unwanted.that in turn has given rise to federal and state legal initiatives intended to stem the flow of the unwanted,and especially the misleading,false,deceptive,and fraudulent,legislation.beyond systems,kraft foods,d,beyond systems.
here,the essential issue presented is whether plaintiffs stated a cause of action for violation of business and professions code section on the theory that guthy sent them unsolicited commercial email advertisements purporting to be from proactiv special offer,wen hair care,proactiv special bonus deal,wen healthy hair,wen by chaz dean,proactiv bonus deal,proactiv bonus gift,and proactiv special offer,which are not names or registered fictitious business names of existing entities,and are not traceable to guthy via a whois database search 
plaintiffs also alleged the subject lines of the emails asserted the recipient was entitled to a free or complimentary gift,without mentioning the gift was contingent upon a purchase.
we conclude no cause of action was stated for violation of section,subdivision a misrepresented header information or subdivision a misleading subject line and affirm the judgment of dismissal.
we hold a header line in a commercial email advertisement does not misrepresent the identity of the sender merely because it does not identify the official name of the entity which sent the email,or merely because it does not identify an entity whose domain name is traceable from an online database,provided the sender identity is readily ascertainable from the body of the email,as was the case here.
further,the body of the emails made clear that free shipping or free gifts were contingent upon a purchase.as the trial court found,a reasonable sender would not have reason to believe that commercial missives like these were likely to deceive a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message,subd.a.
factual and procedural background 
the gravamen of the allegations in the operative first amended complaint is that guthy sent plaintiffs unsolicited commercial email advertisements which,instead of identifying the sender as guthy,indicated the sender was proactiv special offer,wen hair care,proactiv special bonus deal,wen healthy hair,wen by chaz dean,proactiv bonus deal,proactiv bonus gift,and proactiv special offer,which are not names or registered fictitious business names of existing entities,and are not traceable to guthy via a whois search.further,the emails contained subject lines stating plaintiffs were entitled to a free or complimentary gift without mentioning that the gift was contingent upon a purchase.
the first amended complaint was filed on behalf of lead plaintiff greg rosolowski and individual,who collectively sought to be class representatives to represent a larger class.a number of the allegedly offending emails were attached as exhibits to the pleading.for example,exhibit a included an email bearing the subject line exclusive wen deal complimentary shipping,and it originated from wen hair care mavk.
guthy demurred,contending plaintiffs claims should be dismissed because they were preempted by federal law,specifically,the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of et the can spam act,which preempts claims under section,unless header or subject lines are materially false or misleading the from lines contained famous brand names,identified with guthy,the business entity whose name and address were set forth in the body of the same email and the subject lines of the emails accurately referred to a free or complimentary gift and were not actionable.
opposition to demurrer.
in opposition,plaintiffs argued the emails violated section,subdivision a,in that the names appearing on the from lines could not be traced to guthy by way of an online database such as whois,and also violated section,subdivision a because the subject lines represented the recipients were entitled to a free or complimentary gift,without mentioning such gift was contingent upon a purchase.
plaintiffs further contended their claims were not preempted by the federal can spam act due to material deception in the header line,which concealed the identity of the sender,namely guthy,and in the subject line,which enticed the recipients with the promise of free gifts,but the gifts came with strings attached.
trial court ruling.
the trial court sustained guthy demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend,and set forth its rationale as follows 
the claims,as pled,set up theories that the email header information used by defendants was falsified,misrepresented,or forged within the meaning of section,subdivision a and the subject line was one the sender knows would be likely to deceive a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message within the meaning of section,subdivision a.said claims could escape preemption by the federal can spam act if and only if,each such misrepresentation were material.hypertouch,valueclick,th,hypertouch.
since the sender line does not identify defendant guthy renker by name and instead uses the name of defendant various products,plaintiffs collectively allege its spams say they are coming from people and companies that do even exist.this is akin to complaining that an email from buick is falsely labeled because,in plaintiffs view,the sender should read general motors corporation.the court holds as a matter of law that this is not a material misrepresentation sufficient to overcome can spam.kleffman vonage holdings cal th,kleffman.
the various subject lines are criticized as making affirmatively false material representations to the effect that the recipient is entitled to a free or complimentary gift.the email text which emerges if one clicks to open,show that free shipping is offered for an email saying so in the subject line,that free shipping and a tube of proactiv oil free moisture is offered for an email saying so in the subject line,and that free shipping and two free gifts are offered when the subject line says get more with new wen hair care system plus two free gifts and free shipping.the same is true as to the others presented,and no email is so simple as to merely offer a free gift with nothing further said.despite plaintiffs protests that they were duped by these emails,the court holds as a matter of law that a reasonable sender would not have reason to believe that commercial missives like these were likely to deceive a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message.thus,all of plaintiffs claims are subject to federal under can spam act.
in denying leave to amend,the trial court stated,plaintiffs have already put their cards on the table with the detailed pleading and the many emails attached thereto.a review of the theory of the case and the facts offered in support as compared to the various matters pled as matters for which plaintiffs lack evidentiary support at the present time first amended complaint alleged emails,alleged faked online consent from recipients,demonstrates that this is exactly the kind of case which the can spam act was intended to to avoid vexatious litigation of no substantial social value.congress has the power to california consumer law,and it has done so here.plaintiffs have failed to show that they come within the narrow exception to can spam provisions.it is for this reason that this court exercises its discretion to deny plaintiffs leave to amend.the theory of the case is manifest already and will not improve just by adding more prolixity and surmise to a pleading with more than enough already.
plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of dismissal.
contentions 
plaintiffs contend the operative first amended complaint stated facts sufficient to state causes of action against guthy for violations of section,subdivision a misrepresented header information and subdivision a misleading subject line,and the claims are not preempted by federal law.
discussion 
standard of appellate review.
in determining whether a plaintiff has properly stated a claim for relief,our standard of review is clear we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citations.zelig county of los angeles cal th,italics added zelig.our review is de novo.ibid.
overview of section and the can spam act.
in,the california legislature passed senate bill,which imposed broad restrictions on advertising in unsolicited commercial advertisements sent from or to a computer within california.citation.according to the legislature findings and declarations,the bill was adopted to address the skyrocket ing costs and annoyance s associated with spam,which the statute defines as unsolicited commercial advertisements.citations.the legislature concluded that,to effectively regulate the abuses associated with spam,it was necessary to target not only the entities that send unsolicited commercial advertisements,but also the advertisers whose products and services are promoted in those.hypertouch,supra,th at.
section prohibits certain deceptive practices in commercial email,which practices are enumerated in subdivision a as follows 
a it is unlawful for any person or entity to advertise in a commercial advertisement either sent from california or sent to a california electronic mail address under any of the following circumstances the advertisement contains or is accompanied by a domain name without the permission of the third party.the advertisement contains or is accompanied by falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information.the advertisement has a subject line that a person knows would be likely to mislead a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message.italics added.
section,subdivision b,in turn,contains an enforcement provision that permits the attorney general,an electronic mail service provider or a recipient of an unsolicited commercial advertisement to bring an action against a person or entity that violates any provision of this section,subds.b a i iii.
section,subdivision b also lists the remedies available under the statute,which include either or both of the following i actual damages.ii liquidated damages of one thousand dollars for each unsolicited commercial advertisement transmitted in violation of this section,up to one million dollars per incident,subd.b b.the statute further provides,however,that if the court finds the defendant established and implemented,with due care,practices and procedures reasonably designed to effectively prevent unsolicited commercial advertisements that are in violation of this section,the court shall reduce the liquidated damages to a maximum of one hundred dollars for each unsolicited commercial advertisement,or a maximum of one hundred thousand dollars per incident,subd.b.
b.the can spam act.
shortly after california adopted,congress enacted the can spam act,which,like,was passed in response to mounting concerns associated with the rapid growth of spam.citation.the act does not ban spam outright,but rather provides a code of conduct to regulate commercial messaging practices.stated in general terms,the can spam act prohibits such practices as transmitting messages with deceptive subject headings or header information that is materially false or materially misleading.citation.the act also imposes requirements regarding content,format,and labeling.for instance,unsolicited messages must include the sender physical postal address,indicate they are advertisements or solicitations,and notify recipients of their ability to decline further mailings.citation.citation.hypertouch,supra,th at.
the can spam act includes a provision that expressly preempts state statutes that regulate the use of commercial except to the extent that any such statute prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial,subd.b.the preemption clause reflects one of the primary goals of the can spam act to regulate commercial electronic mail on a nationwide basis,subd.b.as stated in the congressional findings accompanying the act,the federal statute was intended to to implement one national standard citation regarding the content of commercial because the patchwork of state laws had proven ineffective.citation.hypertouch,supra,th at.
the kleffman decision.
in kleffman,the supreme court addressed the scope of section a,which makes it unlawful to advertise in a commercial advertisement that contains or is accompanied by falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information.kleffman,supra,cal th at,italics added.
in kleffman,as in the instant case,the plaintiff sued under section a,alleging vonage,by and through its marketing agents,sent him unsolicited advertisements for its broadband telephone services using different domain names and.these different domain names can all be traced to a single physical address in nevada where vonage marketing agent is located.none of these domain names provides any indication to the recipient or its spam filter that the advertisement is from vonage.vonage use of these multiple domain names reduces the likelihood that an internet service provider will identify these advertisements as spam and block them before they reach the email inboxes of plaintiff and class members.kleffman,supra,cal th at.
the discrete issue addressed by the supreme court in kleffman was whether sending unsolicited commercial advertisements from multiple domain names for the purpose of bypassing spam filters constitute falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information within the meaning of section,subdivision a.kleffman,supra,cal th at.kleffman concluded the use of multiple domain names for the purposes of bypassing spam filters does not violate the statute.
at the outset of its analysis,kleffman noted there was no dispute the domain names used in the challenged emails actually exist and are technically accurate,literally correct,and fully traceable to vonage marketing agents,and the therefore neither contained nor were accompanied by falsified or forged header information within the meaning of section a.kleffman,supra,cal th at,italics added.the parties agreed the issue was whether the emails contained or were accompanied by misrepresented header information within the meaning of that subdivision.kleffman,supra,at,italics added.the plaintiff argued the domain names,while not actually false,were misrepresented because their random,garbled,and nonsensical nature created a misleading or deceptive impression the emails were all from different entities when in fact they were all from vonage via a single marketing agent.id.at.
based on a close reading of the text and legislative history of the statutory language in issue,the supreme court rejected the plaintiff argument the word misrepresented in section,subdivision a means misleading or likely to mislead.kleffman,supra,cal th at.the court found the legislature did not intend subdivision a generally to prohibi
