this case presents questions concerning the interpretation of the department of commerce commerce orders resulting from antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings.duferco steel,duferco,an importer of carbon steel floor plate produced in belgium,appeals from the united states court of international trade decision holding that its imported floor plate with patterns in relief,raised figures at regular intervals that provide a surface derived directly from rolling was within the scope of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders final orders or scope orders regarding carbon steel floor plate.duferco steel,united states,d cit.there is no claim in the final scope ruling that the language of the final orders can be interpreted to include appellant product.however,commerce concluded that its final orders covered the product because the petitions that initiated the investigation included appellant product within the scope of the requested investigation,and no language in the final orders explicitly stated that carbon steel plate with patterns in relief was excluded from the scope of the orders,as had been done with respect to universal mill plates.the court of international trade affirmed.
we hold that commerce approach is inconsistent with fundamental principles of administrative law and with our own earlier decisions.scope orders may be interpreted as including subject merchandise only if they contain language that specifically includes the subject merchandise or may be reasonably interpreted to include it.because commerce made no claim in the final scope ruling under review that the scope orders here contain such language,we reverse the decision of the court of international trade.
background 
generally,american industries may petition for relief from imports that are sold in the united states at less than fair value dumped,or which benefit from subsidies provided by foreign governments.allegheny ludlum united states,citing.
commerce determines whether there have been sales at less than fair value,or whether a subsidy has been provided,id.a whereas,the international trade commission itc determines whether the imported merchandise materially injures or threatens to materially injure the pertinent domestic industry,id.b,b.if both inquiries are answered in the affirmative,commerce issues the relevant antidumping and countervailing duty orders.id.c,c i bruce clubb,united states foreign trade law.
an antidumping investigation is typically initiated by a petition filed by a domestic industry requesting that commerce conduct an investigation into possible dumping.the petition initially determines the scope of the investigation.section b of title provides that the petition may be amended at such time,and upon such conditions,as commerce and the itc may permit.b.commerce has inherent power to establish the parameters of the investigation,so that it would not be tied to an initial scope definition that may not make sense in light of the information available to commerce or subsequently obtained in the investigation.cellular mobile telephones and subassemblies from japan final determination of sales at less than fair value,fed.reg.
commerce makes an initial determination as to whether the petition contains information supporting the allegations.c a i.then commerce must make a preliminary determination of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold,or is likely to be sold,at less than fair value.id.b a.this is followed by a final determination of whether the subject merchandise is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than its fair value.id.a.the term subject merchandise is defined as the class or kind of merchandise that is within the scope of an investigation,a review,a suspension agreement,or an order id.as noted above,the itc makes a determination as to material injury or threat of material injury to the domestic industry.
after the issuance of the final antidumping order,id.c,questions may arise concerning its scope.the regulations provide procedures for determining whether a particular product is included within the scope of an order a.a countervailing duty investigation follows a generally parallel procedure,but focuses on whether there is any material injury from benefits provided by foreign governments to foreign exporters.see,a.the orders in question here are the product of such antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings.
on june,bethlehem steel corporation bethlehem,along with other members of the domestic steel industry,filed petitions with commerce and the itc asking that antidumping and countervailing duties be imposed on carbon steel plate from belgium.bethlehem and the other domestic steel producers claimed that such imported merchandise was being sold and was likely to be sold at less than fair value and that foreign governments were providing subsidies to foreign exporters,which,in turn,caused material injury to the domestic producers.the petitions generally described the scope of the requested investigations and the subject merchandise as covering carbon steel plate,which is one class of carbon steel products.to further describe the scope of the requested investigations,the petitions in a footnote made reference to the definition of products provided by the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus,chapter,note k.the pertinent language of note k defined products as r olled products of solid rectangular other than square cross section,and stated that f products include those with patterns in relief derived directly from rolling for example,grooves,ribs,checkers,tears,buttons,lozenges and those which have been perforated,corrugated or polished,provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.htsus,chapter,note k emphases added.the petitions also described the merchandise in terms of the width and thickness of the products.
in july,commerce and the itc initiated the investigations in initiating the investigations,commerce described certain carbon steel plate as including 
carbon steel universal mill plates,products rolled on four faces without patterns in relief of solid rectangular other than square cross section and certain carbon steel flat products in straight lengths,of solid rectangular other than square cross section 
notices of initiation,fed.reg.at fed.reg.at emphases added.in august,commerce also set forth proposed product matching criteria that helped interested parties identify the merchandise covered by the petitions in addition to allowing parties to object to any of the identified criteria.one of the criteria specified by commerce to describe the subject merchandise was whether checkered or not.the parties do not dispute that checkered refers to raised patterns in relief.moreover,none of the interested parties to whom the product matching criteria were sent objected to using this criterion to identify the subject merchandise.
on november,prompted by a foreign manufacturer inquiry as to whether its products with bevelled edges were within the scope of the investigations,the petitioners amended their petitions.the amended petitions included carbon steel flat rolled products which have bevelled edges or other surface or edge characteristics which might render their cross section other than rectangular emphases added.
on january,commerce published a decision memorandum,which,inter alia,addressed whether the scope of the investigation should be broadened to encompass products with a nonrectangular cross section.although commerce recogniz ed that heretofore these products have not been subject to these investigations,commerce nevertheless recommend ed accepting petitioners clarification that products of nonrectangular are covered by these investigations 
after completion of its preliminary investigation,commerce found that certain carbon steel plate from belgium is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than fair value commerce also concluded that benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing duty statute are being provided to manufacturers,producers,or exporters in belgium of certain steel products.
in july,commerce published its final scope determinations associated with the antidumping and countervailing duty investigations,reiterating the conclusions that it had drawn in its preliminary determinations the final ad determination regarding steel products from belgium incorporated by reference appendix i of the final argentine antidumping duty determination to define the scope of the final order,stating that t he full description of the subject merchandise is included in appendix i to the final determination of sales at less than fair value certain carbon steel flat products from argentina argentine final final ad determination,fed.reg.at 
the final cvd determination regarding steel products from belgium similarly incorporated by reference the scope appendix of the final austrian countervailing duty determination.fed.reg.at.although both the final ad determination and the final cvd determination incorporate scope appendices from different countries,both appendices use the same language to describe their respective scopes.for ease of reference,we consider only the language set forth in appendix i of the argentine order.
appendix i of the final argentine determination is entitled scope of the investigations.fed.reg.at.appendix i identified four categories of steel products that were covered by the investigations,including certain carbon steel plate.id.at.appendix i referred to htsus item numbers,but explained that our written descriptions of the scope of these proceedings are dispositive.id.at.
notably,appendix i specifically stated that i ncluded in these investigations are products of nonrectangular where such is achieved subsequent to the rolling process,products which have been worked after rolling for example,products which have been bevelled or rounded at the edges.id.at emphasis added.thereafter,appendix i stated that absent a specific exclusion of any other products from the written description of the scope,all other products covered in the htsus items cited in the petitions are included within the scope,including products of nonrectangular.id.at emphasis added.
significantly,commerce further noted in appendix i that since the preliminary determination the department has addressed the following scope issues.id.at.under the heading products of nonrectangular and the subheading department position,commerce stated that i n contrast to the petitions explicit exclusion of products of nonrectangular shape,nowhere do the petitions specifically exclude nonrectangular products from the scope of the investigations.id.at.however,commerce also interpreted petitioners scope amendment 
we believe that,having relied on htsus item numbers as a distinguishing factor,petitioners intended to limit their scope amendment to products whose nonrectangular have been imparted onto the steel after the rolling process,to products which have been worked after rolling for example,products which have been bevelled or rounded at the edges o nly those products whose nonrectangular are achieved subsequent to the rolling process are included within the scope of the investigations.
id.at emphasis added.
appendix i also described the scope orders as including 
carbon steel universal mill plates,products rolled on four faces or in a closed box pass,of a width exceeding millimeters but not exceeding millimeters and of a thickness of not less than millimeters,not in coils and without patterns in relief,of rectangular shape,neither clad,plated nor coated with metal,whether or not painted,varnished,or coated with plastics or other nonmetallic substances and certain carbon steel products in straight lengths,of rectangular shape,hot rolled,neither clad,plated,nor coated with metal,whether or not painted,varnished,or coated with plastics or other nonmetallic substances,millimeters or more in thickness and of a width which exceeds millimeters and measures at least twice the thickness 
id.at emphases added.
on august,the itc concluded that there was material injury or a threat of material injury to domestic industries because imports of certain carbon steel products were subsidized by foreign governments or sold in the united states at less than fair value the itc incorporated by reference the scope provided in commerce final antidumping and countervailing duty orders.itc determination at.in august,the itc also published a report of its investigations where it specifically included within the scope of the investigations plate the nonrectangular cross section of which was formed by working the plate following the process bevelling or rounding the edges of the plate,for example.
on october,duferco request ed commerce to issue a scope ruling confirming that the carbon steel plate from belgium orders do not include floor plate,which has a imparted during the rolling process.the focus of the present proceedings was on whether duferco carbon steel plate with patterns in relief floor plate was within the scope of the orders.patterns in relief describe a surface pattern containing raised figures at regular intervals,which provide a surface for floors and was alleged to render the cross section nonrectangular.on november,commerce issued its final scope ruling,which is the order currently under review in this court 
in the final scope ruling,commerce concluded that the disputed items were within the final orders.however,commerce pointed to no language in the final orders that included floor plate with patterns in relief.commerce concluded that the original scope definition proposed by the petitioners and supported with the corresponding htsus definition remains dispositive for the purposes of the product in question because,as explained,the existence of patterns in relief was understood as not altering rectangularity.final scope ruling at emphasis added.the original scope definition was dispositive because the final orders did not specify any exclusions relating to patterns in relief,and t he lack of exclusionary language regarding patterns in relief such as those found on floor plate demonstrates commerce intention to include plate with a textured surface,id.at.commerce identified three factors that supported its conclusion the original petition made reference to the htsus definition,which included products with patterns in relief derived directly from rolling there was a lack of protest to inclusion of whether checkered or not in the proposed product matching criteria and unlike universal mill plates with patterns in relief,which were explicitly excluded from the scope of the orders,there was a lack of exclusionary language regarding patterns in relief for carbon steel products in the orders.id.
subsequently,before the court of international trade,duferco moved for judgment on the agency record under rule.duferco steel,d at.to address this motion,that court summarized and agreed with commerce final scope ruling.id.at.the court agreed with commerce approach of determining the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order by first consider ing whether the underlying petitions cover the product.id.at.the court concluded that commerce reasonably relied upon the first two of the three factors cited as support for its conclusion that floor plate is within the scope of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders.id.at.the court found unreasonabl e commerce reliance on the third factor relating to the specific exclusion for universal mill plates because the parenthetical reference to without patterns in relief following the modifier in the final orders only defined universal mill plates,rather than specifically defining the type of universal mill plate to be included in the scope of investigation.id.in sum,the court upheld commerce final scope ruling because it was supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law.id.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we have reviewed scope orders on a number of occasions,and the general rules are well established.we grant significant deference to commerce own interpretation of those orders.ericsson ge mobile communications,u
