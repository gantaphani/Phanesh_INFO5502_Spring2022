this case involves the circumstances under which puerto rico act is intended to protect local dealers from termination of their distribution agreement in market withdrawal situations.
a manufacturer of household cleaning supplies,dow brands,sold a product line to another company and,as a result,terminated its relationship with suarez,the local of those products in puerto rico.the dealer sued,claiming a violation of act,the puerto rico distributorship protection statute.we hold that the manufacturer termination of the dealer relationship was with just cause,and we affirm the summary judgment dismissal of the case.
factual history 
the following facts are uncontested by the parties.suarez company,was a distributor of many household products in puerto rico,including over twenty products manufactured by dow brands,such as fantastik,glass plus,spray n wash,pine magic,janitor in a drum,spray n starch,and wood plus.by,its annual sales of dow products exceeded million.
for whatever reasons suarez sales of dow products have decreased every year since.in may,a consulting company hired by suarez recommended that it divest itself of several dow products,and suarez incorporated this concept into its corporate strategy for and.in august,suarez stopped distributing a number of dow products.by early,suarez distributed only three dow products,all household cleaners fantastik,glass plus,and spray n.at that time,its annual sales of these products were less than million,out of total annual sales of more than million.the dow products suarez distributed constituted only of suarez total business.in the spring of,suarez was at least contemplating the idea of divesting itself of the remaining dow products.in february,it hired another consulting firm to perform a valuation of the dow product line in order to estimate the fair market value of the distribution rights for their possible sale.
on october,dow entered into an agreement to sell its worldwide consumer products business to johnson son.the sale included the trademarks to,and the rights to produce and sell,the three dow products suarez was still distributing in puerto rico.johnson did not agree to assume any distributorship agreements,including the one with suarez during the negotiations,dow entered into a confidentiality agreement,as is common,which prevented it from disclosing its negotiations with johnson until the sale was completed.the sale closed on january.that same day,dow informed suarez that it would no longer be able to provide products to suarez for distribution because johnson now owned the product line.

act protects distributor contracts 
n o principal or grantor may directly or indirectly perform any act detrimental to the established relationship or refuse to renew said contract on its normal expiration,except for just cause.
laws.ann.just cause is defined in the statute as nonperformance of any of the essential obligations of the dealer contract,on the part of the dealer,or any action or omission on his part that adversely and substantially affects the interests of the principal or grantor in promoting the marketing or distribution of the merchandise or service.laws.ann.d.
from a plain reading of the statute,it may appear that only action or inaction on the part of the dealer would provide just cause to allow a principal to terminate the relationship.but a plain reading of act would produce,in some situations,absurd and constitutionally suspect results.as a consequence,the courts have filled in other readings.
in medina medina country pride foods,medina i,cir breyer,this court addressed a related question about market withdrawal and certified the question to the puerto rico supreme court.in doing so,we recognized a primary intention of the act.law was intended to protect dealers who built up a market,from suppliers who wish to appropriate their established clientele.id.at 
this court certified the following question to the puerto rico supreme court 
where there is a contract of indefinite time period,with price and credit terms left open to negotiation,and the parties negotiate in good faith but can not reach an agreement as to price and credit,does law prohibit the supplier from unilaterally and completely withdrawing from the market,when the supplier makes no attempt to appropriate the dealer good will or established clientele 
medina i,at.the puerto rico supreme court responded by explaining that market withdrawal may constitute just cause 
act of june,does not bar the principal from totally withdrawing from the puerto rican market when his action is not aimed at reaping the good will or clientele established by the dealer,and when such constitutes just cause for terminating the due to the fact that the parties have bargained in good faith but have not been able to reach an agreement as to price,credit,or some other essential element of the dealership.in any case,said withdrawal must be preceded by a previous notice term which shall depend on the nature of the franchise,the characteristics of the dealer,and the nature of the negotiations.
medina medina country pride foods,medina ii,offic.trans.
medina ii involved an indefinite term contract with price and credit terms left open to negotiation.after negotiating and reaching an impasse over key terms,the principal unilaterally withdrew from the market.medina ii,then,could be distinguished on several grounds from our situation.first,the puerto rico supreme court in medina ii sought to avoid a holding that there was no just cause under act,because that would have meant an impairment of the parties ability to change or bargain in good faith over the terms of the contract.id.the present case,by contrast,does not involve withdrawal from the market for such reasons and so does not implicate those interests.second,as best can be told,in medina ii there was no continued distribution of those products at all in puerto rico,and so no risk of unfair usurpation of the customer base and good will the distributor had built up.
in a more recent and more pertinent case,the puerto rico supreme court further clarified when a market withdrawal constitutes just cause.in borg warner international quasar,the defendant principal,quasar,stopped selling products to distributors that business was transferred to a different division as part of a corporate reorganization by the parent company.the other division continued to distribute its goods in puerto rico through a chain of retailers and attempted to negotiate in good faith an agreement with plaintiff,but was unable to do so.
in this context,the puerto rico supreme court made two pertinent rulings.first,it held that a market withdrawal constitutes just cause if the defendant has withdrawn from the market and there was a breakdown in the negotiations over time it matters not if others continue to sell the product in question.the issue here is whether any of the defendants,taking advantage of the market created by the plaintiff,has continued to sell the product in puerto rico the court looked only to the defendants business activity and ignored allegations that the product at issue was
