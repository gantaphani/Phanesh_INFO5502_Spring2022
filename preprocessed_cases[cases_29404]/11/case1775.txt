fsi,financial solutions,fsi deposited a check into its account at wells fargo bank,wells fargo.ultimately,the check was dishonored by the third party payor bank because the account upon which the check was drawn had been closed months earlier.in the interim,fsi transferred most of the out of its account to pay off preexisting debts.wells fargo charged back the remaining funds in fsi account after discovering the check had been dishonored.wells fargo and fsi then sued each other pursuant to various causes of action.in a bench trial,the trial court entered judgment in favor of fsi on a promissory estoppel theory,finding fsi was entitled to the because of misrepresentations by wells fargo to fsi about the status of the check during processing.
we reverse.although substantial evidence supports a conclusion wells fargo acted negligently in its delayed processing of the check and in representations to fsi concerning the status of the check,substantial evidence does not support a conclusion fsi was harmed to the extent reflected in the judgment.
undisputed facts 
the parties submitted a joint statement of stipulated facts in advance of the bench trial,from which we set forth the material quoted in this section.
fsi opened its checking account with wells fargo bank the account on march.the check which is the subject of this litigation was issued on november,made payable to fsi in the amount of and was drawn by bay capital on an account at an arizona branch of bank.morgan chase morgan chase the check.
fsi first deposited the check to the account on november.the check was returned by morgan chase unpaid because of nonsufficient funds.fsi again deposited the check to the account on december.the check was again returned by morgan chase unpaid because of nonsufficient funds on january.
thereafter,on march,fsi sued the maker of the check,bay capital,and that suit was dismissed without any recovery by fsi.
on november,the day before the thanksgiving day holiday,fsi again deposited the check to the account by an atm automated teller machine transaction.the check as deposited to the account on november,was a legal copy of the original check.on november,wells fargo sent notice to fsi of a hold on the check,which advised fsi in writing that of funds from the november,deposit to the account would not be available until november.
on november,fsi transferred from the account to the wells fargo account of development from the account to pay down a credit line fsi had with wells fargo and from the account to pay down two credit cards it maintained with wells fargo.
as of november,the check had not yet been forwarded for presentment to morgan chase.wells fargo forwarded the check for presentment to morgan chase via the federal reserve clearing house on november.the check was presented to morgan chase on december.morgan chase returned the check to the federal reserve clearing house on december.wells fargo received a return advice and the check from the federal reserve clearing house on december.the check when returned to wells fargo bank by morgan chase,unpaid,on december,was marked unable to locate account.the morgan account,against which the check had been drawn,had been closed since march.
on december,wells fargo charged back the account which ultimately resulted in the balance in the account being paid to wells fargo and the account having a negative balance of as of january.on and after december,wells fargo bank rejected payment on several checks and electronic transactions written or initiated by fsi on the account in the total sum of and charged for their return.
wells fargo sued fsi on october,alleging the following causes of action overdrafts breach of contract money had and received indebtedness and unjust enrichment.wells fargo alleged fsi was subject to an account agreement wells fargo attached to the complaint,which fsi breached by failing to pay for amounts owed as a result of the dishonored check.
fsi filed a,alleging the following causes of action violation of california uniform commercial code section material misrepresentation negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel.the court sustained a demurrer with regard to the second cause of action.
witness testimony 
janet gifford,a regional service manager for wells fargo,testified for her employer.gifford explained that the check,having been deposited by atm,would have gone to our atm processing department in el monte,california,which we call eapd.by custom and practice,i t would be removed from the envelope that the customer placed the check in,and it would be processed by the process division at eapd.typically,eapd employees remove checks from atm envelopes and immediately the same day transmit such checks electronically to the clearing house.the ordinary processing time for clearing a check in the same region as california including arizona is two days from the time that eapd processes the check and gets it into the stream.wells fargo applied a two business day hold on the check,from november to november.
gifford had no personal knowledge of why there was a delay with regard to this check,and had been unable to determine who at eapd handled the check.she did note that a legal copy of a check like the one deposited by fsi can be used as an original check for any purpose,but it does not have a micr magnetic ink character recognition line on it.at some point during the processing stream it would need to be handled by someone that would either put it in a carrier or put a stripe across the bottom that would have the magnetic ink with the information from the check.as noted above,the parties stipulated the check was not presented to the clearing house until november.gifford had no answer for why this delay occurred.
michael dean horton,a former wells fargo area manager,also testified he was called to testify by fsi.he testified that,on monday,november,he spoke by telephone with fsi president ryan zeber with regard to the check.horton and zeber were social acquaintances before their banking relationship began.horton followed his usual process upon receiving zeber inquiry and checked two wells fargo proprietary systems.from both of those systems what it showed is that the hold had been released and the funds were showing available for use.on direct examination,horton testimony suggested zeber asked whether the funds had cleared,and horton responded to the effect that yes,the funds on the hold had been released and so that assumes that the funds had cleared and had been made available.
horton acknowledged on that both the placement and removal of a hold is automated the hold is simply released electronically absent intervention by a wells fargo employee.horton then acknowledged he did not recall the precise words he used in his conversation with zeber,and the substance of what he intended to communicate to zeber was that now these in funds were available for zeber to draw down on 
horton opined the court overruled various objections to this testimony that,in looking at all of the circumstances pertaining to the check,a business days hold was improper according to usual procedures t his is a check that has been deposited previously.it also an out of state check,and the client also did not have the amount of available funds in the account to justify releasing the hold.under any of those three guidelines a hold of a minimum of five business days should have been placed on this check and wells fargo definitely had the right to adhere to a hold.had horton seen a copy of the actual check,he would have advised zeber that notwithstanding the fact that the hold may have been released,the check may well not ultimately clear.
finally,zeber testified.zeber personally deposited the legal copy of the check at an atm.on november,he made a few phone calls.zeber explained i called the number on the back of my business banking atm card to the customer service department to verify with the wells fargo staff that i was reading my statement correctly,and that the check had cleared.i got reassurance from the customer service department that the check had cleared and the funds were available and clear.we also had the letter that said that the hold would be released on the,so i went one step further and then called horton.horton had been my business banker for a few years,and i had a lot of confidence and trust in him,so i called him to verify that funds were actually clear.i believe he placed me on hold and he came back and said that the check had cleared and the funds were ready to be spent or used.
the following facts were admitted by zeber on the from bay capital were loan commissions received because fsi was an agent for bay capital at the time the check was issued,financially bay capital was a sinking ship and zeber explanation for the lack of success of fsi suit against bay capital was fsi had a venue issue.
as to the november,debits from the account,zeber admitted the transfer to w z development was for purposes of paying off a preexisting loan t here were several notes payable and that was one of them,the oldest the transfer was for purposes of paying down a then existing obligation to wells fargo on a line of credit and two transfers were separate payments to wells fargo credit card accounts on amounts then owed.smaller payments made out of the account during the november,to early december time period were normal course of business,we had invoices due,and we made payments to our vendors and employees.
there was no evidence presented by fsi regarding any credit rating effects or harm to vendor relationships as a result of the in transfers dishonored by wells fargo after december.as noted above,however,fsi incurred in overdraft fees.
judgment for fsi 
the court entered judgment in favor of fsi in the amounts of the amount wells fargo recovered from fsi account after the check was dishonored and penalties imposed on fsi for checks dishonored by wells fargo.the court also ordered wells fargo to release forthwith the chargeback of levied by wells fargo against fsi bank account basically,the court found wells fargo now owned the check and the likely worthless right to recover payment from bay capital.finally,the court awarded fsi in attorney fees and in costs.
the court explained its ruling orally.the court finds for fsi on the basis only of promissory estoppel the court found several clear and unambiguous statements by wells fargo agents.as to what those statements were,the court found t he bank stated that there would be a hold from to next,zeber contacted two people in the bank one was the initial contact on november indicating information that the check had cleared,that it was available.receiving a positive report,zeber then contacted horton,and horton ran a program that showed the check had cleared,that the funds were available,and so he reported that to zeber.
the court also found reasonable and foreseeable reliance,in light of the multiple confirmations by wells fargo of the status of the check.as to damages,the court observed zeber relied on it,and he discharged obligations that were owing to others by fsi,the alleged payee on the check.i believe under those circumstances that does denote to damage.i understand the argument of wells fargo attorney that the balance sheet does change,only in this instance it does change to the exten t of and as ordered.and the court further orders the attempt to take the be discharged and no further conduct be taken on that.
the court denied wells fargo motion for new trial,which contended there was no evidence of damages to fsi in the record other than,perhaps,the overdraft fees imposed.
discussion 
wells fargo argues on appeal as it did in its new trial motion that substantial evidence does not support the judgment because wells fargo mishandling of the check and concomitant statements to fsi about the status of the check did not result in any harm to fsi other than,perhaps,the overdraft fees in short no matter how quickly wells fargo had presented the check to the federal reserve clearinghouse,the check never would have been paid by morgan chase the payor bank because bay capital account had closed down many months before and fsi transfer of the can not amount to damages,particularly because the amounts spent went to discharge preexisting debts.in essence,fsi racked up a bigger debt to wells fargo than it had before this snafu,but these liabilities were offset on its balance sheet by the discharge of preexisting debt to wells fargo and another creditor w z development.
fsi counters that wells fargo bought the check as a result of its negligence,without regard to proof of recoverable damages suffered by fsi.fsi contends in its brief based on the lapse of time involved days between deposit and return,and given the bank interim statement that the check had cleared,the bank deprived itself of its chargeback rights long before it wrongfully invaded its customer account on december.according to fsi,if a bank does not follow an appropriate timeline with regard to check processing and misrepresents the status of the check during such processing,the bank forfeits any rights it may have had to push the losses associated with the nonpayment of a check back onto the payee here,fsi and must instead pursue the maker of the check here,bay capital if it wishes to recover the amount of the check here.
we turn first to a discussion of the law of bank deposits and collections under the california uniform commercial code 
check settlement 
there is a well defined process for the settlement payment of an item here,the check deposited by a customer here,fsi at a depositary bank here,wells fargo,which is also a collecting bank,which transmits the item to the payor bank here,morgan chase 
when a customer deposits a check drawn on another bank,the customer receives a provisional credit for the amount of the check.citations.fn.omitted.the collecting bank,acting as the customer agent,then forwards the check to the payor bank or a presenting bank which gives the collecting bank a provisional credit.citation.if the check is forwarded to a presenting bank,the presenting bank in turn presents the check to the payor bank from which the check is to be drawn and receives a provisional credit.if the payor bank does not promptly dishonor the check,the provisional settlements throughout this chain of banks become final.holcomb wells fargo bank,th,holcomb.
there is no evidence in this case that the provisional settlements of the check throughout the chain of banks became final once it received the check,morgan chase promptly dishonored it.thus,the provisional settlements made through the chain of banks did not become final but instead were reversed.had wells fargo received a final settlement for the check,it would have been accountable to fsi for the amount of the item and any provisional credit given for the item in an account with fsi would have become final,subd.d.but this did not happen.
it is presumed a bank does not intend to purchase a check from its customer simply by crediting its customer with a provisional settlement unless a contrary intent clearly appears and before the time that a settlement given by a collecting bank for an item is or becomes final,the bank,with respect to the item,is an agent or subagent of the owner of the item and any settlement given for the item is provisional,subd.a.
typically,if a payor bank dishonors a check,the collecting bank exercises its right to recover the amount of any provisional credit given to its customer for the dishonored item.if a collecting bank has made provisional settlement with its customer for an item and fails by reason of dishonor or otherwise to receive settlement for the item which is or becomes final,the bank may revoke the settlement given by it,charge back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer account,or obtain refund from its customer,whether or not it is able to return the item these rights to revoke,charge back and obtain refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final,subd.a.
the bank right to revoke a refund applies even if the return of the item or notice of dishonor by the payor bank is delayed,subd.a.the right to charge back is not affected by either of the following previous use of a credit given for the item.failure by any bank to exercise ordinary care with respect to the item,subd.d.a failure to charge back or claim refund does not affect other rights of the bank against the customer or any other party,subd.e.
the relevant statutes are clear.wells fargo had the right under section to charge back or otherwise seek recovery of from fsi based on morgan chase dishonor of the check.see symonds mercury savings loan d,symonds.wells fargo did not receive a final settlement of the check through the chain of banks,which is the only way the right to charge back terminates,subd.a.the right to charge back applies even if the customer has already used the credit given for an item,subd.d or the bank failed to exercise ordinary care with respect to the item,subd.d.see holcomb,supra,th at.thus,wells fargo was within its statutory rights when it successfully charged back.wells fargo also retained its contract and common law rights to seek recovery of the remainder of the.
offsetting bank liability for negligence under the california uniform commercial code 
the issue in this case is whether wells fargo negligence the lengthy delay in the forwarding of the check to the federal reserve clearinghouse alleged misrepresentations to fsi about the status of the check having cleared resulted in the provisional settlement between wells fargo and fsi becoming final in that wells fargo could not recover the from fsi,notwithstanding the lack of finality in the settlement of the item in the chain of banks.
as shown above,wells fargo had the legal right under applicable law to charge back fsi account for.but fsi has an offsetting right to recover damages against wells fargo or avoid repaying the portion of the that it had moved out of its account to the extent wells fargo negligence caused fsi to suffer losses,subd.a bank is liable for any loss resulting from the delay in returning item to customer or providing notice of dishonor,subd.d bank remains liable for failure to exercise ordinary care chino commercial bank,peters th,symonds,supra,d at while bank may be entitled to charge back customer account and seek a refund for its provisional settlement,it is not entirely free of liability white summers,uniform commercial code,supra,liability for nsf and forged checks,in effect section permits the collecting bank to hold the funds while it is determined whether it,or its customer,must bear the liability.
the statutory scheme imposes potential liability on banks for a variety of acts in the processing of checks.a collecting bank shall exercise ordinary care in all of the following presenting an item or sending it for presentment.sending notice of dishonor or nonpayment or returning an item to the bank transferor after learning that the item has not been paid or accepted,as the case may be.settling for an item when the bank receives final settlement.notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit within a reasonable time after discovery thereof,subd.a.a collecting bank exercises ordinary care under subdivision a by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following receipt of an item,notice,or settlement.taking proper action within a reasonably longer time may constitute the exercise of ordinary care,but the bank has the burden of establishing timeliness,subd.b.a collecting bank shall send items by reasonably prompt method,subd.a.
the measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care.if there is also bad faith it includes any other damages the party suffered as a proximate consequence,subd.e.thus,absent a finding of bad faith which was not found here,the most wells fargo could be liable for is under section,subdivision e.this amount should be reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care.ibid.in other words,when some part or all of the item could not have been collected even by the use of ordinary care the recovery is reduced by the amount that would have been in any event uncollectible.com,reprinted at pt.west ann.foll.here,the item was entirely uncollectible by the use of ordinary care the bay capital account had been closed months earlier.
section,subdivision a,provides that if return of the item or notice of dishonor is delayed beyond the bank midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts the bank is liable for any loss resulting from the delay.there is no evidence wells fargo dallied in providing notice to fsi of the check dishonor after the check was actually dishonored by morgan chase.fsi contends it can recover damages under section,subdivision a,based on the delay in submitting the check to the payor bank the delayed submission resulted in a delayed notice of dishonor.even if recoverable outside the context of section,subdivision e,such damages would be limited to any loss resulting from the delay.
bank liability pursuant to alternative causes of action 
fsi operative alleged causes of action for violation of the california uniform commercial code,negligent misrepresentation,and promissory estoppel.the discussion above pertains directly to the first cause of action,but also is necessary background for understanding the application of the other two causes of action.
there is nothing in the california uniform commercial c ode prohibiting a claim based on a depositor detrimental reliance on a bank employee incorrect statements.holcomb,supra,th at.in holcomb,the customer alleged a bank manager negligently misrepresented that a deposit had been verified,and that the customer could write checks against the deposit.id.at.the holcomb court reversed the judgment against the customer,finding in part that the trial court erred by sustaining a demurrer to the customer negligent misrepresentation action.id.at.the holcomb court also held the trial court should afford the customer an opportunity to amend his complaint to separately allege negligence in the bank handling of the check under the california uniform commercial code.id.at.
thus,fsi properly brought both a negligence claim under the standards set forth in the california uniform commercial code and a negligent misrepresentation claim.the elements of negligent misrepresentation are the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact,without reasonable ground for believing it to be true,with intent to induce another reliance on the fact misrepresented,justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation,and resulting damage.national union fire ins.of pittsburgh,pa cambridge integrated services group,th.
unlike negligent misrepresentation,there is no precedent for a customer bringing a promissory estoppel cause of action against a depositary bank in these circumstances.the elements of a promissory estoppel claim are a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms reliance by the party to whom the promise is made the reliance must be both reasonable and foreseeable and the party asserting the estoppel must be injured by his reliance.aceves bank,th.equitable estoppel appears to be a more apt legal theory,as it pertains to misrepresentations of existing fact rather than promises.cotta city and county of san francisco th,equitable estoppel also requires proof of reliance to the injury of party asserting doctrine.
regardless of the propriety of a promissory estoppel cause of action under the facts of this case,the issue raised by wells fargo on appeal is whether there is substantial evidence supporting the award of damages to fsi in the judgment and the denial of wells fargo request to recover the remainder of the it did not already recover by way of charge back.whether the legal theory is equitable estoppel,promissory estoppel,or negligent misrepresentation,any damages awarded to fsi or avoidance of wells fargo charge back rights must be losses caused by wells fargo misrepresentations unfulfilled promises.wells fargo ri
