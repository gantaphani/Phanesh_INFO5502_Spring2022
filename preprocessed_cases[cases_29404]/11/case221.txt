in,the board of health of the city of new york adopted a resolution requiring all tobacco retailers to display signs bearing graphic images showing certain adverse health effects of smoking.the city did so as part of its continuing campaign to discourage cigarette use by educating new yorkers about the dangers of smoking.the district court held below that the resolution is null and void because it is preempted by federal labeling laws.we agree,and therefore affirm.
background 
federal regulation of cigarettes the labeling.purpose 
in,congress enacted the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act the labeling act.the purpose of the labeling act is 
to establish a comprehensive federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising,whereby 
the public may be adequately informed about any adverse health effects of cigarette smoking by inclusion of warning notices on each package of cigarettes and in each advertisement of cigarettes and 
commerce and the national economy may be a protected to the maximum extent consistent with this declared policy and b not impeded by diverse,nonuniform,and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.
the labeling act thus seeks to strike a balance between informing the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking and protecting commerce and the national economy.
labeling requirements 
the labeling act prescribes the content and format of warnings that must appear on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements.id.specifically,all cigarette packages and advertisements must contain the phrase surgeon general warning followed by one of the following four cautions 
smoking causes lung cancer,heart disease,emphysema,and may complicate pregnancy.
quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.
smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury,premature birth,and low birth weight.
cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide.
id.a the warnings must be in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography,layout,or color with all other printed material on the package.id.b.furthermore,the labeling act mandates that manufacturers rotate these warnings in alternating sequence on packages,and in advertisements,of each brand.id.c.
preemption 
congress also included a preemption provision in the labeling act,limiting the extent to which states may regulate the labeling,advertising,and promotion of cigarettes.id.first,the preemption provision prohibits states from requiring any additional statement relating to smoking and health,other than the statement required by a,on any cigarette package.id.a.second,it provides that n o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes labeled in conformity with the act.id.b.
finally,subsection c states 
notwithstanding subsection b,a state or locality may enact statutes and promulgate regulations,based on smoking and health,imposing specific bans or restrictions on the time,place,and manner,but not content,of the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes.
b.the resolution 
on september,the board of health the board adopted a resolution amending article of the new york city health code.as amended,the article provides

one large sign at each location where tobacco products are displayed so that 
a the sign s are unobstructed in their entirety and can be read easily by each person considering a tobacco product purchase and 
b in such a way that the distance between the bottom of the sign s and the floor shall be no less than four feet,and the distance between the top of such sign s and the floor shall be no more than seven feet.

the department produced three signs,any one of which retailers could display to comply with the resolution.one shows an image of a cancerous lung over the warning smoking causes lung cancer.another depicts a photograph of a decaying,extracted tooth over the warning smoking causes tooth decay.the third is an mri of a brain with damaged tissue resulting from a stroke,and states,smoking causes stroke.each sign also reads,quit smoking today.call or nyquits.commissioner farley declares that each image is true and medically accurate.farley decl.at.
the city passed the resolution to promote further reductions in smoking prevalence in new york city.notice of adoption at.the city attributed the continued widespread use of cigarettes to a lack of awareness and comprehension of the negative health outcomes associated with tobacco use.id.at.accordingly,it sought to reduce smoking by broadening its informational campaign.
specifically,the city observed that cigarette advertising was particularly prominent in retail locations,but the retail environment lack ed information about tobacco health risks.dep t of health and mental hygiene,proposal to require health warnings and smoking cessation information where tobacco is sold the proposal at june.it also noted research indicating that pictorial warnings were more effective and engaging than warnings,especially among youths.notice of adoption at.the city concluded that requiring graphic images at retail locations would c ounteract tobacco advertising and further smoking.proposal at notice of adoption at.
procedural history 
on june,two cigarette retailers,two trade associations,and three of the nation largest cigarette manufacturers initiated the action below against the board,the department of health,the department of consumer affairs,and their respective commissioners,seeking a declaration that the resolution was preempted by federal labeling laws and violated their first amendment rights.on june,plaintiffs moved to enjoin preliminarily the enforcement of the resolution.on june,the parties stipulated that enforcement of the resolution would be stayed until the earlier of a fourteen days after the district court ruling on the preliminary injunction or b january.defendants moved for summary judgment on august.

preemption generally 
to determine whether a state or local law is preempted by federal law,we look to congress intent.cipollone liggett,inc,congressional intent is the ultimate touchstone of preemption analysis internal quotation marks omitted.when congress expressly codifies its preemptive intent in statutory form,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.jones vilsack,cir quoting lorillard tobacco reilly,see also csx,easterwood.we assume that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.cipollone,at blackmun,concurring internal quotation marks omitted see also park n fly,dollar park and fly.

preemption of state mandated cigarette warnings 
the labeling requirement and preemption provision of the labeling act express congress determination that the prescribed federal warnings are both necessary and sufficient to achieve its purpose of informing the public of the health consequences of smoking.altria,at.accordingly,states may not require that additional warnings be displayed by the manufacturer.see id.b oth of the act purposes are furthered by prohibiting states from supplementing the federally prescribed warning id.

application 
we conclude that the resolution is preempted by the labeling act because it is a requirement with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes,under b.we recognize our duty to assume that a local regulation is not preempted unless congress has made such an intention clear and manifest.bates,at.we find,however,that congress has clearly manifested its intent to preempt the resolution through the language of the preemption provision and the overall statutory scheme.
the language of section b 
the labeling act prohibits states from imposing any requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes.b.the parties agree that the resolution is a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health.appellants br.at appellees br.at.they dispute,however,whether the resolution is with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes.plaintiffs argue that it is a requirement with respect to promotion defendants argue that it is only a requirement with respect to sale.appellees br.at appellants br.at.we agree with plaintiffs that the resolution is a requirement with respect to the promotion of cigarettes.
first,we discuss the meaning of the word promotion and the types of activities that constitute promotion.second,we discuss why the requirements of the resolution affect promotion in a way that causes them to fall within section b preemptive scope.
the word promotion is not defined in the labeling act.hence,we look to the word plain meaning.specifically,we consider the the ordinary,meaning of the word.united states dauray,cir see harris sullivan,cir a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.internal quotation marks omitted.
merriam webster defines promotion as the act of furthering the growth or development of something especially the furtherance of the acceptance and sale of merchandise through advertising,publicity,or discounting.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.a broad array of activities may fall under this umbrella.see dep t of health human,preventing tobacco use among young people a report of the surgeon general.distribution of coupons and free samples,for example,would obviously be classified as promotional activity as they further the sale of merchandise.promotional activity may also include the place ment and display of products in ways that will maximize the opportunity for purchase.id.indeed,many companies pay additional fees to have their product displayed in a desirable location at a retail outlet.see generally benjamin klein joshua wright,the economics of slotting contracts,econ.referring to promotional shelf space.therefore,to the extent a product display furthers the sale of merchandise,it is a type of promotion.
b.the requirements of the resolution are with respect to promotion.
the resolution requires that every tobacco retailer place signage either next to the register or next to each tobacco product display.option directly affects the promotion of cigarettes.by its terms,it affects the display of cigarettes,which is a type of promotion.specifically,a display is a form of publicity that can further the sale of merchandise.it is an opportunity for the manufacturer to present the consumer with its trade dress,product pricing,and any deals or sales that the manufacturer may be offering.placing a graphic warning adjacent to a product display necessarily affects or treads on,mango media,at the content of the image projected and the message conveyed to the consumer by that display.
whether option affects promotion is a closer call,as it does not explicitly reference the display of tobacco products.indirectly,however,it is likely to affect product display,and therefore,product promotion.new york law requires retailers to place cigarettes either behind a counter accessible only to store personnel or in a locked container.see pub.health law cc mckinney.as a result,the vast majority of retailers choose to place cigarettes behind the counter,where the registers are located,prominently displayed in plain view but accessible only to store personnel.in such circumstances,placing signage at the register is practically the same as placing it at the point of display.furthermore,the resolution may very well prompt retailers to choose not to place cigarettes near the register a decision that would affect promotion 
the city primary argument is that the resolution is a not a requirement with respect to the promotion of cigarettes,but rather,a requirement with respect to the sale of cigarettes.specifically,it argues that it is not regulating or restricting a manufacturer ability to advertise or promote it is simply requiring any establishment that sells cigarettes to post warning signs,regardless of whether any advertising or promotion occurs at the particular retail establishment.appellants br.at.
while it is true that the resolution only explicitly requires action on the part of the seller,not the manufacturer,the city ignores the practical effect the resolution has on the manufacturer promotional activity at the retail location.specifically,requiring a warning sign in close proximity to a cigarette display has practically the same effect as requiring a warning on the display itself,thereby directly affecting the content of the promotional message conveyed to consumers at the point of display.indeed,by the city own admission,one of the reasons it chose to regulate the point of sale was to deliver a different message from that delivered by the cigarette manufacturers and to counteract tobacco advertising.id.at proposal at.requiring that the manufacturers message be countered at the point of purchase
