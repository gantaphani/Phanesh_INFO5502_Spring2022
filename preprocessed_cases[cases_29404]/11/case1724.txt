ashley tamas appeals from the judgment entered in favor of defendants safeway,and lucerne foods,collectively safeway after the trial court sustained a demurrer to tamas proposed class action complaint without leave to amend.in her complaint,tamas alleged safeway was culpable for misbranding its lucerne brand of greek yogurt as yogurt because the food ingredients included milk protein concentrate mpc,which is not included on the list of allowable optional ingredients for yogurt under the applicable regulation promulgated by the federal food and drug administration fda.the trial court disagreed,concluding that mpc was an allowable ingredient in yogurt,as the restrictive regulation relied upon by tamas had been stayed,and the fda had informally agreed to allow the use of mpc in yogurt until the stay was resolved.
we affirm.the regulation relied upon by tamas to preclude the use of mpc in yogurt is one that she admits was stayed by the fda shortly after it was enacted,in response to concerns the rule was unduly restrictive.the glacial pace at which the fda has moved in attempting to resolve those concerns and redraft a new formal regulation did not,as tamas seems to suggest,operate as a stealth reenactment of the stayed rule.
tamas filed her complaint in april,on behalf of herself and a class of similarly situated consumers who have purchased lucerne greek yogurt from safeway stores,believing it was classic greek yogurt which achieves its thicker consistency and high protein content as a result of straining.she alleged safeway had misbranded its lucerne greek yogurt as yogurt,because the product listed ingredients include mpc,which was used as an artificial thickener,and to increase its protein content,but is not an ingredient permitted in any product labeled as yogurt.
specifically,tamas alleged the fda has promulgated a regulation specifying the standard of identity soi for yogurt.this soi sets forth the definition of yogurt and follows it with a restrictive list of the ingredients that may be included within any product labeled as yogurt.she also alleged that pursuant to the federal nutrition labeling and education act of,the states are preempted from adopting their own standards for food labeling which are inconsistent with the federal soi.thus,california has adopted the federal soi for yogurt as california own pursuant to the sherman food,drug,and cosmetic law health,et.
as set forth in tamas complaint,the soi for yogurt describes yogurt as being made by culturing one or more of the optional diary sic ingredients cream,milk,partially skimmed milk,or skim milk,used alone or in combination and allows the addition of o ne or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraphs b referring to allowable vitamins and d of this section.
tamas notes that paragraph d,in turn,specifies the other optional ingredients which may be included in yogurt,including c oncentrated skim milk,nonfat dry milk,buttermilk,whey,lactose,lactalbumins,lactoglobulins,or whey modified by partial or complete removal of lactose minerals,to increase the nonfat solids content of the food.as tamas alleges,mpc is not included on that list.d all further regulatory references are to this title of the code of federal regulations.
tamas also acknowledges that subparagraph d of the yogurt soi,which lists the foregoing other optional ingredients that may be included in the product,has been stayed since.she alleges,however,that the effect of that stay was to further restrict the ingredients allowed in yogurt,such that even those ingredients listed in the stayed subparagraph which would otherwise be allowed are prohibited.
thus,under tamas construction of the soi for yogurt,mpc is not currently a permitted ingredient in any food labeled as yogurt.consequently,she alleges safeway misbranded its lucerne greek yogurt as yogurt,and based on that allegation she stated causes of action for violation of the consumers legal remedies act,et and violation of the unfair competition law bus,et.tamas prayed for a court order declaring that safeway had misbranded its lucerne greek yogurt product as yogurt,an injunction prohibiting safeway from continuing to sell their product as yogurt,and an award of restitution.
safeway demurred to the complaint.it acknowledged using mpc in its lucerne greek yogurt,but denied that doing so was prohibited by the partially stayed soi.specifically safeway disputed tamas contention that the fda stay of the other optional ingredients provision of the yogurt soi operated as a further restriction on the ingredients allowed in yogurt.instead,safeway contended that the stay of section,para.d operated to lift that restriction on other optional ingredients,leaving it free to include mpc as an ingredient and still call its product yogurt.
in support of its demurrer,safeway asked the court to take judicial notice of various federal regulations,fda rulings contained in the federal register,and a memorandum summarizing questions and answers from a regional milk seminar,an advanced milk processing course and a special problems in milk protection course available on the fda website.the court granted that request in its entirety.
tamas opposed the demurrer,and asked the court to take judicial notice of various documents as well.the court granted this request in part,and denied it in part.
after considering the arguments,as well as the documents of which it took judicial notice,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.

the federal soi for yogurt 
the soi for yogurt,which became effective in,is contained in section.it describes yogurt as the food produced by culturing one or more of the optional dairy ingredients specified in paragraph c of this section with a characterizing bacterial culture that contains the lactic bacteria,lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus.it also allows o ne or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraphs b and d of this section to be added.a.
the dairy ingredients that can be cultured to make yogurt are c ream,milk,partially skimmed milk,or skim milk,used alone or in combination.c.these allowable cultured ingredients listed in paragraph c of the soi are sometimes referred to as the basic milk ingredients of the yogurt.
paragraph b of the soi allows the addition of vitamins a and and the o ther optional ingredients that can be used in yogurt,listed in paragraph d of the regulation include concentrated skim milk,nonfat dry milk,buttermilk,whey,lactose,lactalbumins,lactoglobulins,or whey modified by partial or complete removal of lactose minerals,to increase the nonfat solids content of the food nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners flavoring ingredients.color additives.stabilizers.d.
the fda stay of the other optional dairy ingredient provision of the soi 
the fda enactment of the yogurt soi followed its publication of a proposed soi,which was somewhat less restrictive,june.under the proposed rule,the other optional dairy ingredients which could be added to the basic cultured dairy ingredients to make yogurt included c oncentrated skim milk,nonfat dry milk,or other ingredients.id.at.however,some of the public comments about the proposed rule included objections to the breadth of the phrase other ingredients,and after considering those objections,the fda chose to incorporate a specific list of acceptable ingredients which could be added to yogurt into the soi,rather than rely upon the broader category originally proposed.
but when the fda published the new soi for yogurt,it again expressly invited public comment,giving i nterested persons until march,to file objections and request a hearing on the final rule.see e allowing either the fda or any interested member of the public to propose an amendment or repeal of an soi.title united states code section also specifies that when such a proposal is made,the fda shall afford all interested persons an opportunity to present their views thereon,orally or in writing.ibid.then,if timely objections are filed,they operate to stay the effectiveness of those provisions of the order to which the objections are made.as soon as practicable after the time for filing objections has expired the secretary shall publish a notice in the federal register specifying those parts of the order which have been stayed by the filing of objections and,if no objections have been filed,stating that fact.id.at subparagraph e.
in this case,responses were filed objecting to specific provisions of the final rule and in most cases requesting a hearing.according to the fda,objectors focused on the provision of the soi which restrict s the kinds of safe and suitable ingredients that may be used as optional ingredients to increase the nonfat solids contents of these foods,italics added which it characterized as having replac ed the phrase other ingredients in the proposed rule with a limited list of names of ingredients ibid,italics added.the fda explained that some objectors had claimed this change does not promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers because this interpretation of the phrase bars the use of other safe,nutritional,and functional ingredients the objections also maintain that a definition of the phrase other ingredients should be established at a hearing.ibid.the fda acknowledged that the objectors raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact that must be resolved at a public hearing as provided for in cfr.ibid.
thus,in accordance with title united states code section e,the fda announced it was staying the effective date of the provisions pending the outcome of a public hearing.
the public hearing was long delayed,and in,the fda published a memorandum containing questions and answers from a recent regional milk seminar,and later made that memorandum available on its website.among the questions posed was whether mpc could be used as an ingredient in yogurt to increase the nonfat solids content the answer provided was yes.cfr d,which would have precluded mpc use,was one of several provisions of the standard of identity for yogurt that were stayed in 
in january nearly years after announcing the stay the fda acknowledged its very lengthy delay in scheduling that public hearing,explaining that t o date,due to competing priorities and limited resources,fda has not held a public hearing to resolve these issues and the effective date for these provisions remains stayed.therefore,these provisions were never in effect.consequently,cultured milk and yogurts may deviate from the relevant standards in the previously mentioned respects,italics added.
the fda then proposed a new rule amending the soi for yogurt in several respects.to date,the fda has not formally adopted that,or any other,amended soi for yogurt,and the previously announced stay remains in effect.
the fda power to stay a soi 
the fda authority to stay the effectiveness of a soi,in whole or in part,is grounded in title united states code section e,which provides for a stay of an order if a person who is adversely affected by it file s objections thereto stating the grounds therefor,and requesting a public hearing upon such objections.in this case,the fda specifically solicited such objections when it announced the yogurt soi.then,u ntil final action upon such objections is taken by the secretary under paragraph,the filing of such objections shall operate to stay the effectiveness of those provisions of the order to which the objections are made.ibid.
tamas does not dispute the fda has that power.instead,the question posed in this appeal is the effect of the fda decision to impose such a stay on one part of a soi,while otherwise leaving that soi intact.the parties positions can be summed up as follows safeway argues that when the fda stays the effectiveness of part of a restrictive soi,the result is a rule that is only partially restrictive.tamas belief is that because the very nature of a soi is to set forth the allowable ingredients in a specified product and to restrict the use of any ingredients not specified within the rule the stay of any provision which identifies some of those acceptable ingredients can only create a further restriction.in tamas view,once a formal soi has been enacted,the only way to relax its restrictions would be to formally repeal it or formally enact a new,less restrictive soi.
in the abstract,we conclude safeway has the better of this argument.if tamas view were accepted,the fda undisputed power to stay a soi in its entirety would result in a complete prohibition on the manufacture of the specified product.no ingredients would be allowed.
the trial court did not err by relying on statements by the fda in construing the effect of its partial stay of the yogurt soi.
tamas argues the trial court erred by relying on the fda own statements interpreting the soi in its current form.her first contention is that the statements must be disregarded because they are wholly inconsistent with the plain language of the soi.but the contention is a red herring.the disputed issue in this demurrer had nothing to do with interpreting the language of the soi.instead,the issue to be decided was the effect of the fda partial stay of that soi.while the former might be entirely clear,the latter is not.
significantly,the fda partial stay of the yogurt soi was not accomplished by any specific amendment of its language.the fda did not parse the words of the soi in an effort to create a different soi.thus,the usual rules we might employ to conduct our own parsing of the resulting words,to ascertain the plain meaning of the newly constituted soi,are not helpful.lungren deukmejian cal d,describing the plain meaning rule watt alaska,d noting that the starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.
instead,the fda simply described the impact of its decision,which also encompassed the soi of other specified dairy products,as staying the effective date of the provisions that restrict the kinds of safe and suitable ingredients that may be used as optional ingredients to increase the nonfat solids contents of these foods.
thus,the real issue before us is what the fda meant to accomplish when it imposed that partial stay did it mean to relax the restrictions on other optional dairy ingredients contained in the yogurt soi,or tighten them further it is that uncertainty,rather than any disagreement about the language of the soi,which renders the soi ambiguous in the wake of the partial stay.consequently,the subsequent comments of the fda,explaining the effect of its imposition of the partial stay,are pertinent to the resolution of that resulting ambiguity.chase bank usa,mccoy,d when a regulation is ambiguous,the court will defer to the agency own reasonable interpretation coeur alaska,southeast alaska conservation council,d coeur alaska.
moreover,in coeur alaska,the supreme court also disposed of tamas more specific contention that the trial court also erred by considering informal statements of the fda in determining the effect of the partial stay,such as the memorandum summarizing questions and answers from the regional milk seminar,an advanced milk pro
