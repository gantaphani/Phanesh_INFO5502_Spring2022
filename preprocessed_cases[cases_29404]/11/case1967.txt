defendant and appellant norm wilson sons,wilson appeals an order denying its motion for attorney fees following a court trial wherein it successfully defended an action brought by plaintiff and respondent california wholesale material supply,doing business as calply calply for collection of accounts receivable.wilson also appeals an order granting a motion by calply to tax attorney fees as an item of costs.
after the judgment for wilson was entered,the essential issue remaining is whether the subject action by calply arose out of a contract containing an attorney fee clause,namely,the subcontract between wilson and johnwall interiors,johnwall,so as to entitle wilson,as the prevailing party,to attorney fees.
pursuant to a security agreement,johnwall had granted a security interest in the subcontract and in its accounts receivable to a creditor,calply.following johnwall default,calply,as a secured party and johnwall assignee,sued wilson to collect the money johnwall had earned under the subcontract.consequently,calply collection action against wilson arose out of the subcontract.wilson defeated calply claim,entitling wilson to recover its attorney fees as the prevailing party pursuant to the fee provision in the subcontract.
the matter is reversed and remanded for a determination of the amount of attorney fees to be awarded to wilson.
factual and procedural background 
on november,johnwall,a drywall subcontractor,borrowed from home bank the bank.as security for the notes,johnwall granted a security interest to the bank in all property set forth in the security agreement,including johnwall accounts receivable.that same day,johnwall executed a ucc financing statement in favor of the bank said financing statement was filed with the california secretary of state on december.
johnwall also was indebted to its supplier,calply,for various materials,including drywall products.to secure the obligation,johnwall executed another financing statement in favor of calply.this financing statement similarly granted calply a security interest in johnwall contract rights and accounts receivable,even though johnwall same accounts receivable already were pledged to the bank.calply financing statement likewise was filed with the secretary of state on july.
wilson is a general contractor.wilson entered into subcontracts with johnwall for drywall work.wilson became indebted to johnwall on those jobs.thus,johnwall accounts receivable included the money it was owed by wilson.wilson owed johnwall.
after johnwall defaulted on its obligation to calply,calply sought to have wilson pay directly to it the money wilson owed to johnwall.wilson responded that calply demand letter was insufficient to constitute proper notice under the commercial code,and that it also appeared the bank had a senior position.
on september,the bank assigned its interest in johnwall promissory note,security agreement and financing statement to construction financial,llc.construction financial notified wilson it was the bank assignee and requested payment of the money wilson owed to johnwall.as of november,johnwall owed construction financial approximately as the remaining balance on a july,promissory note.on that day,wilson paid to construction financial as the holder of the july,promissory note and a prior perfected security interest in johnwall accounts receivable.
proceedings.
calply filed this collection action against various defendants,including wilson.calply alleged it was a secured party and the assignee of johnwall accounts receivable pursuant to its security agreement with johnwall,but that wilson wrongfully paid the money it owed johnwall under the subcontract to construction financial rather than to calply.calply alleged a cause of action against wilson for damages for breach of california uniform commercial code ucc former section,which set forth the collection rights of a secured party 
a court trial was held over five days between september,and march.the parties stipulated to certain facts,including any contracts entered into by wilson were entered into with johnwall any amounts owed by wilson were owed to johnwall and on november,wilson paid to construction financial as the holder of a july,promissory note and prior perfected security interest in the accounts receivable of johnwall.
on march,judgment was entered in favor of wilson,because it had properly paid the full amount it owed johnwall on the subcontract to construction financial.
on april,wilson filed a motion to recover the attorney fees it had incurred in defending the action.the attorney fee motion was based on code of civil procedure section et,and was made on the grounds that wilson was the prevailing party in the collection action and therefore entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant to the subcontract in the motion,wilson argued calply was also the assignee of johnwall accounts receivable,and as the assignee,calply stood in johnwall shoes relative to its claim for money due from wilson,and therefore calply was subject to an award of attorney fees as the losing party in the litigation pursuant to the underlying subcontract between wilson and johnwall.wilson filed a memorandum of costs,seeking,including in attorney fees.
calply opposed the attorney fees motion and filed a motion to strike or tax the item of attorney fees from the memorandum of costs.calply took the position no attorney fees were due because its sole cause of action against wilson was for damages for wrongful payment of moneys in violation of calply priority security interest pursuant to california ucc former section there was no contract between calply and wilson the subcontract upon which wilson based its attorney fee request was not introduced or admitted into evidence at trial and calply action against wilson was not an action on the subcontract.
the matter came on for hearing on may and june.the trial court denied wilson motion for attorney fees,but awarded it costs of.in ruling on the matter,the trial court observed t his case was tried on a single theory,it was a contract theory.because if there was a contract claim as well as the claim based on section of the ucc,it was not tried on that theory.
the trial court further found the subject action did not arise out of the contract between wilson and johnwall.rather,the litigation arose out of the security agreement between calply and johnwall.in rejecting wilson argument,the trial court observed,it seems to me,sir,you boot strapping a contract and trying to make that the basis of your claim for attorney fees.
wilson filed a timely notice of appeal from the orders 
contentions 
wilson contends pursuant to the security agreement,calply was the assignee of johnwall rights under a contract that included an attorney fee provision calply would have been entitled to recover attorney fees against wilson had it prevailed and therefore wilson is entitled to recover its fees from calply.the claim made by calply constituted an action on a contract and,even if it did not,the attorney fee provision in the agreement between johnwall and wilson is broad enough to encompass noncontract claims as well.
calply,in turn,seeks sanctions for what it contends is a frivolous appeal by wilson.
discussion 
standard of review.
on appeal,this court reviews a determination of the legal basis for an award of attorney fees de novo as a question of law.sessions payroll management,noble construction th,d.attorney fees are not recoverable as costs unless a statute or contract expressly authorizes them.ibid.
here,the issue is whether calply action against wilson arose out of the subcontract so as to implicate the attorney fee provision therein.california courts liberally construe on a contract to extend to any action a s long as an action involves a contract and one of the parties would be entitled to recover attorney fees under the contract if that party prevails in its lawsuit milman shukhat,th,d.in re baroff cir,accord santisas goodin cal th,d.
overview trial court erred in denying wilson motion for attorney fees as the prevailing party because calply action against wilson arose out of the subcontract between wilson and johnwall,which subcontract had been assigned to calply pursuant to the security agreement.
the trial court denied wilson motion for attorney fees on the ground that calply action against wilson did not arise out of the subcontract between wilson and johnwall.rather,according to the trial court,the litigation between calply and wilson arose out of the security agreement between the calply and johnwall,and the case was tried on a single theory under the ucc,it was a contract theory.
however,the trial court ruling overlooked the existence of the underlying subcontract,which fact was stipulated to at trial,and which subcontract contained the attorney fee provision.as indicated,johnwall had given calply a security interest in the subcontract.subsequently,there arose competing claims to johnwall earnings under the subcontract.in this action by calply against wilson,the parties litigated the issue of which party had the right to payment of the money earned by johnwall under the subcontract.
pursuant to the security agreement between johnwall and calply,calply became the assignee of johnwall rights in the subcontract between wilson and johnwall and calply thereby stepped into johnwall shoes as a matter of law.thereafter,calply,as johnwall assignee,but junior to the bank position in johnwall receivables,filed a meritless collection action against wilson and lost.calply sought in its complaint to enforce its security interest in johnwall accounts receivable and contract rights pursuant to the ucc,and as pled in the complaint,calply was also the assignee of johnwall accounts receivable and contract rights.
irrespective of the fact calply framed its complaint against wilson as an action for damages for breach of california ucc former section,which set forth the collection rights of a secured party,the parties necessarily litigated calply claim for money allegedly due johnwall under the subcontract with wilson.as the prevailing party in the collection action,wilson was entitled by way of a motion to invoke the attorney fee provision in the subcontract and it is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees from calply,even though that aspect of the subcontract was not litigated at the time of trial.
for purposes of california ucc former section,no distinction exists between an assignee of a debtor accounts receivable and the holder of a security interest in a debtor accounts receivable.
clearly,attorney fees would be available to the prevailing party in a straightforward action arising out of the subcontract between wilson and johnwall.as indicated,the subcontract contains the following attorney fees clause if either party becomes involved in litigation arising out of this contract or the performance of it,the court in such litigation,or in a separate suit,may award reasonable costs and expenses of litigation,including attorney fees,to the party justly entitled to them.
in order to secure its debt to calply,johnwall gave calply a security interest in its contract rights and accounts receivable.the financing statement described the security interest as including a ll accounts receivable,instrument,chattel paper,general intangibles and contract rights,now or hereafter owned or acquired by debtor calply thus became the assignee of johnwall rights under the subcontract.
nonetheless,in opposition to wilson claim to attorney fees,calply attempts to draw a controlling legal distinction between the holder of a security interest and an assignee,and argues the security interest it obtained from johnwall was not an assignment of contractual rights.
western decor furnishings industries,bank of america d,speaks directly to this issue.there,the court rejected the borrower contention that only an assignee of accounts receivable may seek payment from an account debtor,and that the bank had no right to seek payment from the account debtors because the bank merely was a creditor with a security interest in the borrower accounts receivable and not an assignee.id.at.in arriving at that conclusion,western decor stated this theory that a distinction exists between an assignee of accounts receivable and a holder of a security interest in proceeds in the application of section,subdivision,is erroneous.the purpose of section,subdivision is to provide an alternative method for a secured party to foreclose a security interest in accounts receivable although the most prevalent kind of financing transaction is a loan secured by an assignment of accounts,there appears to be no reason to distinguish between a secured party who has a security interest in the accounts receivable and one who has an assignment.id.at,italics added.
a case from another jurisdiction,bank of waunakee rochester cheese sales,cir,is in accord.there,a bank with a security interest in the accounts receivable of waunakee kase haus,kase haus brought an action against rochester cheese sales,rochester,an account debtor of kase haus,seeking collection of kase haus accounts receivable.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of rochester,finding that as an account debtor of kase haus,rochester was entitled to set off amounts kase haus owed it against the amount it owed kase haus pursuant to section b of the wisconsin ucc.id.at.
on appeal,the bank contended wisconsin ucc section was inapplicable because the bank security interest in kase haus accounts receivable was not an assignment of those accounts as collateral.bank of waunakee,supra,at.the seventh circuit rejected the bank contention and affirmed,stating for purposes of section and the equivalent statute in other states,the courts and the ucc have made no distinction between a party with a security interest in a debtor accounts receivable and a party who is an assignee of a debtor accounts receivable.id.at,italics added.
the analyses of western decor and bank of waunakee are applicable to our fact situation.the facts herein clearly establish that calply sued wilson to collect on the subcontract after having obtained a security from johnwall.the mere fact that the trial court found the case was tried on one theory does not preclude wilson from collecting its attorney fees,provided it has a legitimate theory to do so.guided by western decor and bank of waunakee,we find no inconsistency between wilson defeating a suit brought by calply as johnwall assignee,and wilson entitlement to attorney fees pursuant to the fee provision in the subcontract.
here,calply action to recover the sum allegedly due under the subcontract terminated with a judgment in favor of wilson wilson was the party prevailing on the subcontract as a matter of law in that it obtained a simple,unqualified win by defeating the sole contractual claim alleged against it hsu abbara cal th,d,and wilson is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees from calply pursuant to the attorney fee provision in the subcontract.
calply is liable for attorney fees pursuant to the subcontract even though it was not a signatory thereto.
for purposes of wilson entitlement to attorney fees,it is immaterial that calply was not a signatory to the subcontract.
given the purpose of establishing mutuality of remedy,and to prevent attorney fee provisions,reynolds metals alperson cal d,interpreted civil code section to provide a reciprocal remedy for a nonsignatory defendant,sued on a contract as if he were a party to it,when a plaintiff would clearly be entitled to attorney fees should he prevail in enforcing the contractual obligation against the defendant.cal d at.
unlike the fact situation in reynolds metals,here the plaintiff,calply,is the nonsignatory party and the defendant,wilson,signed the subcontract.however,the rationale of reynolds metals has also been applied in actions by a nonsignatory plaintiff seeking to enforce a contract against a signatory defendant.citation.where a nonsignatory plaintiff sues a signatory defendant in an action on a contract and the signatory defendant prevails,the signatory defendant is entitled to attorney fees only if the nonsignatory plaintiff would have been entitled to its fees if the plaintiff had prevailed.citation.sessions payroll management,supra,th at,d.
