we must decide,among other issues,whether the california public utilities commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it interpreted an interconnection agreement between two competitive local telephone exchange carriers as establishing the rate at which each must compensate the other for handling calls.
prior to,local telephone service generally was provided by a local monopolist who offered services at prices regulated and imposed by a variety of governmental agencies.pac.bell.cal.pub.utils.comm n,wl,at cir.under this system,a single local exchange carrier lec provided all telephone service in a geographically confined area known as a local access and transport area lata.the passage of the telecommunications act of act,stat.codified in part at,ended this system of regulated monopolies.in its place,the act established a competitive regime under which formerly monopolistic providers,or incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,and new providers,or competitive local exchange carriers clecs,compete to provide telephone service in the same lata.
because each of the lecs operating within a lata owns and operates an independent network of telephone lines,the customers of each lec may call the customers of other lecs only if these networks are interconnected.for this reason,the act requires lecs to interconnect their networks of telephone lines with the networks of other lecs.see a.interconnection allows customers of one lec to call the customers of another,with the calling party lec the originating carrier transporting the call to the connection point,where the called party lec the terminating carrier takes over and transports the call to its end point.verizon cal.peevey,cir.
interconnection gives rise to a potential problem,however.if one lec customer calls a second lec customer,the second customer lec will not be compensated for its role in completing the call because it does not bill the caller.this is so because people do not customarily pay for receiving phone calls,only for placing them.see generally peter huber et,federal telecommunications law,at ed describing the manner in which providers are compensated for their services.to ensure that each lec is compensated for its role in such calls,the act requires lecs to negotiate interconnection agreements that establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b.to satisfy this obligation,lecs typically execute contracts referred to as interconnection agreements that establish the rate at which the originating carrier compensates the terminating carrier for completing a call.see global naps,verizon new,cir.for such calls,the originating carrier compensates the terminating carrier at the rate set forth in the carriers interconnection agreement,rather than under the access charge regime applicable to calls.id.
although federal law requires lecs to execute interconnection agreements,the contracts themselves are creatures of state law.bell.global naps,cir verizon,peevey,cir.such contracts are executed under,and interpreted according to,state law.bell,at.thus,when a disagreement over the terms of such an agreement arises,the suit is not based on federal law in any realistic sense,but on a term in a contract.id.
federal law permits a lec that believes another lec has violated the terms of an interconnection agreement to seek redress before a state public utilities commission.see peevey,at see also bellsouth,mcimetro access transmission,cir en banc.if a party to such a proceeding believes that the state public utility commission decision is incorrect,that party may seek review of the decision in federal court.verizon.pub.serv.comm of.
because federal law requires lecs to enter into interconnection agreements with other lecs operating within the same lata,such agreements typically concern calls that originate and terminate within the lata.see in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecomms.act of,fcc rcd.thus,interlata those that involve the transport of a call originating in one lata and terminating in fall outside the regime described above.see sbc commc ns fcc.calls within a single lata,or intralata calls,are often purely local,although sometimes calls between distant geographic points within a single lata are nevertheless calls.the latter type of such calls are known as intralata toll calls.see huber et,supra,at.interconnection agreements often set forth the rate of compensation applicable both to intralata calls and to intralata toll calls.
this appeal arises out of a dispute between two lecs that operate in california global naps california,global and cox california telcom,llc cox.
to comply with their section a obligation to interconnect their networks,global and cox executed a negotiated interconnection agreement on october.this agreement,the network interconnection agreement agreement,established the terms,conditions and pricing under which global and cox would offer and provide to each other interconnection within the state of california.
the agreement provides that when either carrier terminates an intralata toll call that originated on the other carrier network,the terminating carrier shall charge the originating carrier a prescribed fee based on the length of the call.the agreement defines intralata toll traffic as those intralata calls that are not defined as local traffic in the agreement.local traffic is defined as traffic other than traffic that is originated by a customer of one party on that party network and terminates to a customer of the other party on that other party network,within a given local calling area,or expanded area service area.the agreement further provides that t he designation of traffic as local traffic or intralata toll for purposes of compensation shall be based on the horizontal and vertical coordinates associated with the originating and terminating of the call.
in june,cox terminated intralata toll traffic originating on global network and began billing global pursuant to the agreement.global refused to pay.in response to cox invoice,global denied the existence of the agreement and argued that the traffic it delivered to cox was not subject to any compensation obligations.specifically,global asserted that the disputed traffic originated with its clients that provide voip services to consumers,and the traffic was therefore not subject to compensation obligations under the agreement.the eighth circuit has helpfully described such technology in the following way 
voip is an internet application utilizing to transmit a voice communication over a broadband internet connection.in that respect,it is different from the application used to route traditional landline telephone calls.in communications,an electrical circuit must be kept clear of other signals for the duration of a telephone call.communications travel in small digital packets along with many other packets,allowing for more efficient utilization of circuits.
pub.util.comm fcc,cir.
global does not provide voip services directly to end users.instead,it contracts with voip providers to transfer their calls to traditional telephone lines.when a customer of one of global clients makes a voip phone call,the voip provider transfers that call to global.global then transfers the call to the appropriate this case,in turn connects the call to the intended recipient.
on april,cox filed a complaint with the california public utilities commission cpuc.the complaint alleged that cox had been terminating intralata toll calls for global since june,and that global had failed to pay cox for terminating those calls in accordance with the agreement.cox asked that the cpuc order global to pay all amounts due to cox under the agreement for the termination of intralata toll calls,including past due amounts and interest and to make all future payments due to cox under the agreement.
in its answer,global admitted that it had executed the agreement with cox,but denied that it had breached it.in response to cox claim that global had failed to compensate cox for terminating intralata toll calls,global acknowledged that the sole area of dispute presen
