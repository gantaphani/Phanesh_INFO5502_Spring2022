background 
the background facts are described in our earlier opinion,cromeens,at we reiterate only those relevant to fms claim under the maine franchise law.in fms entered into a dealer agreement with samsung construction equipment america corporation authorizing fms to sell a ll samsung construction equipment for sale in north america on a nonexclusive basis in a territory covering a portion of the state of maine.the relationship did last very long.in samsung decided to sell its business to volvo,a competitor.under the deal,volvo acquired samsung division,including its factory and the right to use samsung excavator designs.volvo also assumed samsung contractual obligations to its dealers.
volvo did not,however,acquire the samsung trademark or trade name instead,volvo was authorized to manufacture and sell excavators under the samsung name for a period of three years following the acquisition.for a short time it did so,distributing the products through samsung network of dealers.meanwhile,however,it began the process of volvoization,gradually introducing changes to make the excavators more.when that process was completed in the fall of,volvo began to market the excavators under its own name.as one of volvo sales bulletins described it with these new volvo excavators,we have taken a good excavator,the samsung,and made it better,offering our dealers a wider range of marketing potential.
this dispute soon followed.when volvo completed its redesign and rebranding of the excavators,it terminated the agreements with a majority of the samsung dealers,including fms.fms and five of the terminated dealerships brought this suit against volvo alleging among other claims breach of contract and wrongful termination under various statutes.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of decision that,for the most part,we affirmed when the case was last before this court.cromeens,at.as to fms claim under the maine franchise law,however,we reversed the judgment.
more specifically,we held that the maine franchise law evidences a strong public policy against contracts that violate the franchise law generally and therefore applies even when contracts purport to waive its protections.id.at.accordingly,we concluded as a matter of law that fms is entitled to the protections of the maine franchise law.id.the statute requires good cause before a manufacturer may terminate a franchise,and further provides that t here is good cause when the manufacturer discontinues production or distribution of the franchise goods.ann.tit,c,c.we noted that the parties disagreed over whether volvo had discontinued production of the franchise goods within the meaning of this provision.volvo maintained that it had,while the dealers contended that because volvo had made only modest improvements to some of the excavators and rebranded them,the excavators essentially continued to be sold in a form covered by the dealer agreements.cromeens,at.based on this framing of the dispute,we concluded that a t this stage of the proceedings,we believe there is a genuine factual dispute over whether volvo had good cause to terminate fms and remanded the claim to the district court.id.
back in the district court,the parties completed discovery and filed for summary judgment.volvo argued that it had good cause to terminate the fms dealer agreement because it was no longer manufacturing excavators.in its view the franchise goods under the statute and the terms of the dealer agreement included only construction equipment,so rebranding the excavators amounted to a discontinuation of the franchise goods within the statute definition of good cause.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that rebranding alone did not qualify as discontinuation of the franchise goods.in its view,discontinuation occurred only if volvo made such substantial changes to the excavators that they could be considered a distinct product.on that issue there were disputed facts,so the court denied both motions for summary judgment and the case was tried to a jury.
at the close of the evidence,volvo unsuccessfully moved for judgment as a matter of law,once again arguing that its rebranding had been the equivalent of a discontinuation of the franchise goods.the court again rejected the argument,this time adding that it had been implicitly rejected by this court in the first appeal.the case was then submitted to the jury.on the central issue of whether volvo had discontinued the franchise goods and therefore had good cause to terminate the franchise relationship under the maine statute,the jury was instructed that it must decide whether fms had proven,by a preponderance of the evidence,that as of the date of termination,volvo had not substantially changed the excavator fms had been buying from volvo.
the jury determined that the changes volvo made to the rebranded excavators were not substantial enough to constitute a discontinuation as defined by the court instruction and that volvo therefore lacked good cause to terminate its relationship with fms.for that improper termination,the jury awarded damages of million.volvo moved posttrial for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial,reiterating its argument that the district court had misconstrued both the maine statute discontinuation provision and the dealer agreement.the district court denied the motion.the court also denied fms motion for an award of prejudgment interest and attorneys fees.volvo appealed the judgment,and fms the denial of attorneys fees.
ii.analysis 
the maine courts have not interpreted the maine franchise law,but we have previously observed as a general matter that the purpose of state franchise and dealership laws is to protect franchisees who have unequal bargaining power once they have made a investment in the franchisor.ricoh,cir.when a manufacturer appoints a dealer and authorizes the dealer to use its trademark,the dealer has an incentive to promote that example,by investing in inventory and facilities by advertising the products by their brand name and by providing service,often according to specifications required by the manufacturer.but this firm or investment poses a potential danger to dealers.once a dealer sinks time and money into developin
