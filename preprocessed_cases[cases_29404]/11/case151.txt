this is an appeal from the judgment of the district court rejecting claims by coady corporation coady against toyota motor distributors,toyota.toyota is the regional arm of toyota motor sales usa,a national distributor of toyota motor vehicles coady,doing business as toyota and owned by kevin coady,is a toyota dealer based in milford,massachusetts.much of the dispute revolves around coady access to new vehicles from toyota.
toyota,like other major distributors,supplies a large number of dealers in its boston region,which includes most of new england,there are about dealerships,each with its own primary market area.however,other dealers are free to compete with coady,and coady with them.coady nearest competitor is bernardi toyota,which is based closer to the boston metropolitan area.boch toyota is another competitor,and its primary market area adjoins coady.
coady has been a toyota dealer since and,for most of the period,operated under the standard toyota dealer agreement.among other things,the agreement obligates toyota to explain its vehicle distribution methods to dealers,to use its best efforts so dealers can meet their own obligations under the agreement,and to allocate vehicles in a fair and equitable manner as determined by toyota.statutes impose additional and more detailed obligations on toyota,as we discuss below.
until february,coady mostly operated under agreements,and,for part of its tenure was not apparently a successful dealer,which coady says resulted from his unfair treatment by toyota.when the last of these agreements expired in,with coady performance and acting against a background of quarrels between coady and local toyota coady only a extension.the proposed new agreement contained a provision requiring coady to maintain percent or better retail sales efficiency a measurement used by toyota for which percent is supposed to represent average dealer sales performance in the region.
when the agreement expired in,toyota again offered a new agreement,even though coady efficiency rating had fallen to under percent.the proposed new agreement retained the unenforced percent sales efficiency requirement.it also proposed new requirements that coady maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more than and renovate the interior of its dealership.coady declined to sign the new agreement and has instead operated under extensions of its franchise.
in the meantime,coady filed the present lawsuit in november,against toyota asserting a host of claims under federal and state law,including federal antitrust claims,claims under the federal automobile dealers day in court act,and claims under the massachusetts dealer bill of rights.laws ch.chapter.
in due course,the district court dismissed certain of the claims,allowed coady to expand its complaint and then denied for summary judgment.beginning on january,the district court held a trial,comprising eight days of testimony.on april,the district court filed a detailed decision over pages rejecting on the merits all of the coady claims,and coady now appeals.
on this appeal,coady main claims are directed at a set of practices or occurrences that,in coady view,represent violations of chapter as it stood prior to recent amendments coady also presses claims for breach of contract.our review of the district court decision is for clear error as to its findings of fact and de novo as to questions of law.liberty mut.ins.nippon sanso,cir as to questions of characterization,the standard is more complex.see note below.
as its primary method of allocating balanced day supply method toyota allocates vehicles to dealers once every two weeks usually at the beginning and middle of the month the method uses a formula that assigns available vehicles in the region based upon each dealer inventory and recent sales volume.the method does not simply replace vehicles sold on a basis but rewards past sales performance,so that successful dealers do better than unsuccessful ones.
in the first instance,the system relies upon self reporting.for each sale,the dealer inputs the sale the vehicle identification number and the name and address of the a computer network that informs toyota of the sale.when supplies are tight and stock can be easily sold,as was true for much of the,there is some incentive for dealers to misreport in the hope of increasing new inventory.
coady did offer evidence that its competitors had misreported sales and toyota was aware of the problem although the precise effect on coady is uncertain.how many inaccurate reports are required to affect the allocation and how much of an effect inaccurate reports produce is hard to summarize.some evidence at trial suggested that for coady to be deprived of a single toyota camry it would take inaccurately reported camry sales by other dealers in the region during a period.
toyota monitors the accuracy of the reporting by comparing the sales reports it receives from dealers with the registration data provided by the polk a widely used automotive information and statistical reporting service.when the two reports do not match for a feature such as the customer name or address toyota labels this a.can reflect either innocent reporting errors or intentional false reporting by the dealer.all dealers,including coady,incur from time to time.coady position at trial was that deliberately false reporting was widespread and known to toyota.
at trial,coady claimed that toyota tolerance of false reporting by its competitors violated chapter.the statute makes unlawful u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.laws.ch,a,and then lists specific forbidden practices.see tober foreign motors,reiter oldsmobile.pertinently,section a makes it a violation for a distributor 
to adopt,change,establish or implement a plan or system for the allocation and distribution of new motor vehicles to motor vehicle dealers which is arbitrary or unfair or to modify an existing plan so as to cause the same to be arbitrary or unfair.
laws.ch,a emphasis added.
relying on dictionary definitions and case law relating to a new hampshire statute similar to chapter,see auto.dealers ass n,motors,aff in part,vacated in part,cir,the district court held that in this context arbitrary meant a regime that is not based in reason and is implemented in bad faith because of a dishonest purpose.as for unfair,the court relied again on the dictionary and a massachusetts case,levings forbes wallace,addressing.laws ch,to limit the term to an allocation plan based on inequity,dishonesty and fraud.
applying this definition to allocation systems,the district court held that 
in the absence of any claim that toyota itself cut off coady supply of vehicles,in order to show that toyota has implemented an unfair or arbitrary allocation system for the distribution of motor vehicles to coady through periodic allocations,coady must prove,based on all pertinent circumstances,that toyota affirmatively facilitated or encouraged fraudulent sales reporting by dealers other than coady.it is insufficient for coady to prove that dealers other than coady inaccurately reported sales because,to be arbitrary or unfair,such inaccurate sales reporting must be shown to be fraudulent or dishonest.nor is it sufficient to prove that toyota knew about fraudulent sales reporting by its dealers but failed to prevent it.
we think that the district court has made the legal standard too demanding.based on ordinary usage,conduct can be arbitrary and perhaps even unfair without subjective bad faith agency action taken without any whiff of dishonesty or fraud is commonly so characterized,and overturned,under an arbitrariness standard true,as the district court said,chapter finds its roots in a concern about oppressive power of makers and distributors,beard motors,toyota motor,but such power can be carelessly as well as wilfully deployed.
admittedly,the district court reading of the arbitrariness standard is supported by a statement of a sister federal court in new hampshire construing the same term arbitrary in that state statute.relying on black law dictionary,that case held that arbitrary was synonymous with bad faith or failure to exercise honest judgment.auto.dealers ass n.at.but this old definition was too narrow even then and was pure dictum because the district court found that the challenged conduct in that case was based on reasonable business practices the same test that we now endorse.id.at.
nevertheless,chapter as we read it does not demand perfection in allocation or warrant a substitution of judicial for business judgment.a distributor acting honestly is entitled to latitude in making commercial judgments and chapter was not meant to insulate dealers from the ordinary flux of pressure and striving that is part of a free economy.am.honda motor,bernardi.in this context,it is only the egregious decision that should be labeled arbitrary or unfair.schott motorcycle supply,am.honda motor,cir.
to us,this means that a n allocation system is not unreasonable simply because it is possible to subvert it,as long as reasonable steps are taken to prevent and detect such subversion.cabriolet porsche audi,am.honda motor,cir,cert.denied,d.and reasonable does not mean foolproof there are costs to every business endeavor,including enforcement,which are ultimately borne by those who purchase the product.
here,the district court found as fact that toyota had sought to combat dishonest reporting in addition to making false reporting a ground for termination and offering periodic education on proper reporting,toyota conducted ground stock audits to reverse reported sales of vehicles found on lots adopted a policy to decrease allocations to dealers found to have no match rates over a fixed percentage and began to decrease district manager bonuses for excessive rates in their districts although coady says that this was delayed for two years because of computer problems.
these findings in turn led the district court to conclude that toyota took reasonable steps at all relevant times to ensure that sales were reported accurately and to reverse those sales that were not and so ensured that periodic allocations to the boston region were neither arbitrary nor unfair.this determination amounts,in substance,to an alternative ruling by the district court that even if reasonable efforts by toyota to check fraudulent reporting were required,toyota made those efforts.and,this alternative based on a proper affirmance,assuming that the finding of reasonableness is sound.
in substance,coady claim is that toyota long knew of the problem of false reporting,acted too casually to bring it under control,and even now does not have anything like a foolproof system.coady evidence describes flaws toyota responds by pointing to its own efforts to monitor and control the problem.except by describing each incident and measure in the very extensive record,there is no way to summarize the ebb and flow.in the absence of some sharper standard,the district court had to make an assessment as to whether toyota had acted unreasonably.
applying abstract labels to settled facts is,strictly speaking,a prescriptive and therefore a legal judgment but where the outcome is debatable,some and often much deference is normally afforded to the factfinder evaluation,because the one who heard the evidence is closer to the scene and better steeped in the nuances affording such deference to the district court ultimate conclusion and considering the latitude the statute permits to business managers,we can not say that the district judge was wrong.
a second set of chapter claims by coady,relating to allocation,concerns turndowns.dealers including coady do not accept every vehicle earned in a periodic allocation,and each region has its own method of reallocating such rejected vehicles.in the boston region,turndowns are first offered to dealers within the same district where they were originally assigned,and if unclaimed they are offered to all dealers in the region as port stock a subject to which we will return.
coady first claim regarding the turndowns was that this system of allocation is arbitrary or unfair because coady two main competitors,bernardi and boch,are part of a contiguous but separate district with more turndowns,so they have access to turndowns that coady does not.the district court rejected this contention,finding that the current method of allocating turndowns 
is employed because it allows for rapid,distribution of turndowns based on an individualized assessment of each dealer needs.it is deemed more efficient to distribute turndowns in this manner rather than to group all turndowns together and distribute them through a second balanced day supply method allocation as was done between and.
the choice not to allocate turndowns had a plausible business rationale indeed,toyota had experimented with allocation of turndowns between and before changing to the current system.every system has pluses and minuses,and a fair allocation system does not mean one without wrinkles.nothing in coady showing on this issue causes us to second guess the district court assessment.
coady second turndown complaint stems from the failure of toyota to have a written policy on turndowns.this is not itself arbitrary or unfair but,as the district court noted,the turndown allocation system depends,to some extent,upon each district manager discretion in offering vehicles to the dealers,and the court found that this discretion had been abused on at least one occasion when then district manager andrew brody reduced coady access to desirable turndowns due to some bad blood between brody and coady.however,an occasional abuse does not automatically require a more formal or rigid policy.as to the incident itself,the district court found that coady had not offered evidence of specific damages arising from the incident 
the vehicles rejected in the turndown process fall into what is known as port stock vehicles available to all dealers in the region.toyota informs dealers about the vehicles it has in port stock by fax and dealers may claim those vehicles on a first come,first served basis.coady says that toyota was arbitrary because it sent such notices by fax and not,listing coady last on the fax list.coady does not quantify the effect and,at least in these circumstances,chapter does not require this kind of by courts.
next,in a further attack on toyota fairness in allocation,coady complains about again relying upon chapter toyota market representation vehicle support program.under this program,a dealer can earn extra vehicles by becoming an exclusive toyota dealership,by installing qualifying branding signs or by making improvements in new or modernized facility improvements.to qualify for the program,dealers must document their expenditures.
coady says that toyota failed to provide thirty vehicles under the program after coady spent on qualifying improvements to its facility in,even though toyota awarded more than vehicles to bernardi for qualified improvements.the key difference was that coady,unlike bernardi,failed to provide receipts to toyota to verify its construction expenditures,which was a prerequisite under the program.coady says he was relieved of this obligation by toyota but the district court did not credit this claim,and on appeal coady is silent on this point.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir.
finally,under toyota allocation regime,its general manager in the region can distribute up to of the cars and of the trucks to dealers at his discretion in order to help dealers meet specific inventory and customer needs.this group of vehicles is not included in the pool subject to the formula periodic allocations.before but not after,the percentage limitations on this general manager pool included any vehicles distributed under the market representation vehicle support program.
on appeal coady argues again relying upon chapter that the change in undermined the formula allocations because there is no limit to the number of vehicles that can be assigned under the support program.in principle,a very large number of assignments under the latter program might leave few,if any,for distribution by formula.but the district court found there was no evidence that any such distorting had occurred.coady offers no answer to this finding,which
