ii.background 
this is the second appeal between the parties related to plaintiff march,complaint against defendants for work performed on her home.in the first appeal,in an unpublished opinion,we affirmed a damages award in her favor for defective construction work.oceguera cohen,wl nonpub.opn.we also reversed and remanded the matter for a limited retrial of two causes of return of money pursuant to section,subdivision b second and unfair competition in violation of section sixth.id.at.we concluded that the trial court had erred in summarily adjudicating the partnership was duly licensed at all times it performed the construction contract due to conflicting evidence as to when the qualifying or responsible managing employee,arie golan,disassociated himself from the partnership.that partnership had previously consisted of golan,cohen,and grimberg.id.at.we further held,t he existence of this controversy required defendants to produce a verified certificate of licensure pursuant to section,subdivision d.id.at.
the limited retrial reveals the following facts and circumstances.prior to march,the partnership engaged in the construction business with three partners,golan,cohen,and grimberg.golan was the licensed partner and the responsible managing employee.on may,golan,the only licensed partner,executed a disassociation notice pursuant to section,subdivision c on may,the partnership filed a fictitious business name statement which listed cohen and grimberg as the only partners of the partnership.
the construction contract at issue was entered into on june.work commenced the next day on june.between june,and june,oceguera paid the partnership for construction work on her home.there were quite a few defects in the construction.oceguera testified that she never saw golan on the job site.neither cohen nor grimberg was a licensed contractor between may and june when the construction work was performed at plaintiff home.
cohen and grimberg gave conflicting testimony as to when golan disassociated from the partnership.according to grimberg,golan no longer had any interest in the partnership after may.in contrast,cohen testified that golan continued to act as a partner until the end of the month of july.
defendants did not produce a verified certificate that any entity other than the partnership with golan held a license prior to and during the times that construction work was performed on oceguera home.rather,defendants argue that they were not required to refund payments was predicated on the following theories the partnership consisting of golan,cohen,and grimberg held a license during the pertinent times golan did not officially disassociate himself from the former partnership until july and the current partnership substantially complied with licensing requirements sometime in july.
in support of defendants substantial compliance theory,grimberg testified that he submitted documents to the state contractor license board the board to change the qualifying or responsible managing officer in july.cohen testified that the partnership ultimately obtained a continuance from the board.the continuance was to allow the partnership to complete projects that had been commenced prior to golan disassociation.grimberg testified golan disassociation notice was filed with the board on july.thus,although golan signed the notice of disassociation in may,according to grimberg,it was not submitted to the board until or around july.
nevertheless,a document by the california state contractor license board the board on july,entitled application for replacing the qualifying individual states that the exact date of golan disassociation was may.on august,an unsigned letter from linda loudon in the license modification unit of the board states the partnership license was cancelled on may,due to golan disassociation.according to loudon letter,his disassociation caused the automatic cancellation of the license.loudon letter also stated the remaining partners were entitled to continue conducting business one year from the date of disassociation if a request for continuance was made in writing.in order to be effective,the continuance request would have to be filed with the registrar within days of golan disassociation.the letter further provided that defendants could not contract for any additional projects while conducting business under a continuance.defendants did not object to the consideration of loudon letter.
the trial court ruled plaintiff was entitled to a judgment on the second cause of action for return of money paid.the trial court ruled the unfair business practice claim was moot because both cohen and grimberg were licensed by the time of the trial.in rendering its decision,the trial court ruled i think this is obviously a case where we talking about substantial compliance,not about whether or not there was a license in effect at the time.there was this retroactive cancellation of the license.but even if it had been retroactive,once the responsible managing employee ceases to function in that capacity,it as if there is no license at all.now,the evidence is somewhat conflicting as to golan position in the partnership.we do have the fictitious name statement filed in may of.we had the notice of disassociation which states the date is may of.we have grimberg testimony where he believed he was no longer involved as of may of.we also have plaintiff testimony that she never saw golan at the job site and no evidence from the defendant that he was ever there.the only evidence we have is cohen testimony regarding golan being involved until july.i think,weighing the evidence,i do think defense has met their burden of proof in terms of golan involvement therefore,it would appear that he was not involved as of may of.that being the case,it is as if there was no license at all the retroactive finding of the board.so then,i think we need to address whether or not there is substantial compliance,nevertheless.you know,i appreciate the fact that the defendants did everything they thought they should be doing in terms of trying to rectify the situation,that they were sending letters back and forth,that they ultimately did get their licenses,but i do know i can get around,you know,the plain language of section subdivision e where it says that the doctrine of substantial compliance shall not apply if the contractor has never been a duly licensed contractor in the state.i do see a whole lot of wiggle room in that code section.i think it may,in fact,work something of an injustice,because your clients did do work.the quality of the work was the subject of another litigation,but be that as it may,i think the language of the statute controls,and i just do see a way around it.and of course as recognized,there are other harsh results in terms of licensing requirements and their policy reasons for that.but nevertheless,i think i bound by the plain language of the statute to find in favor of plaintiff,in that the doctrine of substantial compliance is not available where individuals were not licensed at the time of the act.
defense counsel requested the trial court clarify whether its ruling interpreted the word person as used in section,subdivision e to mean individuals who comprised the partnershi
