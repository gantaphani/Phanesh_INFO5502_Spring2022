this diversity action implicates a contract between mining cwm and aquila,aquila,pursuant to which cwm supplied aquila,a public utility that produces electrical power,periodic shipments of coal from cwm utah mine.at trial,aquila claimed that cwm breached the parties contract by failing to perform as promised and that,as a result,it had to purchase coal from other sources at prices higher than those specified in the contract.cwm conceded its failure to perform,but argued that its nonperformance was excused by virtue of a labor dispute that amounted to a force majeure event under the terms of the contract.the district court disagreed with the factual premise underlying this defense,finding that geological,not labor,problems were the primary force inhibiting cwm performance.the district court further rejected cwm alternative theory that the geological difficulties themselves qualified as force majeure events because aquila had actual notice of them that substituted for the written notice required under the contract instead,the court found that aquila never received adequate notice that cwm considered its geological difficulties to constitute force majeure events.finally,the district court found that aquila properly mitigated its losses and that it was entitled to approximately million in damages.cwm appeals each of these determinations.because we agree with the district court legal conclusions and find no clear error in its factual findings,we affirm.
on september,the parties signed an agreement obliging cwm to provide aquila with a total of tons of coal during the years,with an option for aquila to extend the contract through.pertinent for our purposes,the contract also contained a force majeure provision providing in relevant part as follows 
section force majeure 
the term force majeure as used herein shall mean any and all causes beyond the reasonable control of the party failing to perform,including but not limited to acts of god labor disputes boycotts lockouts labor and material shortages breakdowns of or damage to plants,equipment,or facilities or other causes of a similar nature which wholly or partly prevent or make unreasonably costly i the mining,delivering,or loading of the coal by seller or ii the receiving,transporting,accepting,or utilizing of the coal by buyer at the station.to be considered unreasonable such increased costs must be substantial and sustained so that mining is no longer possible.this section shall not be construed to require either party to prevent,settle or otherwise avoid or terminate a strike,work slowdown,or other similar labor action.
b effect hereunder 
if,because of any force majeure,either party hereto is unable to fulfill any of its obligations under this agreement,and if such party shall promptly give to the other party concerned written notice of such force majeure,then the obligation of the party giving such notice shall be suspended to the extent made necessary by such force majeure and during its continuance,and the obligations of the party receiving the notice shall be equally suspended provided,however,that the party giving such notice shall use its best efforts to eliminate such force majeure insofar as reasonable,with a minimum of delay.any deficiencies in deliveries or acceptance of coal hereunder caused by force majeure shall not be made up except by mutual consent.if a force majeure continues for more than six months then either party may terminate this agreement by giving written notice to the other party without penalty or cost.during an event of partial force majeure by either party,a fair and reasonable allocation of deliveries of coal or the ability to consume coal shall be made to mitigate the impact on each party.
at section of the contract.
the contract further included a choice of law clause specifying that missouri law was to control the parties agreement,id.at section,as well as a nonwaiver clause indicating that 
t he failure of either party hereto to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any provision of this agreement by the other party hereto,or to take advantage of any of its rights hereunder,shall not be construed as a waiver by it of any such provisions,or of the obligation to comply with such provisions in the future and the same shall continue and remain in full force and effect.
id.at section a.
less than a week after signing the contract,a labor strike hit cwm,and between and of its employees walked off the job.because cwm believed its collective bargaining agreement with the international association of united worker union prohibited its employees from striking,the company anticipated that the strike would be quickly resolved.as it happened,however,the labor dispute lingered unresolved for over two years.
fall of also represented the beginning of other hardships for cwm.several roof collapses that season culminated in the federal mine safety and health administration msha ordering cwm to seal its mine number one in january.at that time,cwm anticipated it could still meet its contractual obligations to aquila with coal from its mines three and four,but cwm soon encountered a slew of geological problems in mine three.these included roof collapses,muddy conditions,and hot spots of coal essentially areas of extremely high temperatures.according to cwm mining supervisor,defa,the muddy conditions and the hot coal were the worst of those problems he had seen in years of mining.at.because of the muddy conditions in mine three,according to defa active mining in that mine almost stopped.at testimony of defa.and as to the hot spots of coal,they slowed the mining way down.it stopped cwm from mining that area.id.at.when the problems first erupted in mine three,mine four was not yet ready for coal production.
in december,just before cwm delivery obligations to aquila were slated to begin,cwm notified aquila in writing that it considered its labor dispute a force majeure event,as defined by the parties contract,and that its coal shipments would be reduced as a result.over the course of the following months,cwm sent several more letters to aquila confirming the labor dispute status as a force majeure event,and updating aquila on the progress of its labor negotiations.for its part,aquila accepted the coal cwm did deliver,but informed cwm by letter on august,that f or the avoidance of doubt,aquila does not,with this letter and the requests contained herein,waive any rights it has or excuse cwm from any obligations it has under the agreement.at.
while cwm invoked the force majeure clause with respect to its labor problems,the geological difficulties it experienced were another matter.in march,a coal purchasing agent for aquila,phil rogers,visited cwm mines and was shown maps of mines three and four,escorted through mine three,and told that mine number one had been closed by order of msha.some months later rogers again visited the mines,was escorted through both mines three and four,and was told of the geological problems cwm continued to face.at no point,however,was rogers or anyone else at aquila notified,in writing or otherwise,that cwm considered these geological problems force majeure events.to the contrary,cwm downplayed its geological problems and represented that they would be overcome shortly 
in april,cwm informed aquila of its intent to cancel the contract entirely,citing the parties force majeure provision.until cwm cancelled the contract,aquila accepted cwm partial deliveries of coal and bought the remainder of its required coal on the spot market.once cwm cancelled the contract,aquila entered into a new contract with consolidated coal company consolidated on terms less favorable to aquila than those contained in the cwm contract.in particular,the price of coal aquila had to pay was higher,and the coal it received had a higher sulfur content,necessitating the purchase of sulfur emission credits before the coal could be burned.
in due course,aquila brought suit against cwm in the united states district court of utah to recoup the damages it sustained as a result of cwm impaired performance eventual cancellation contract.as its chief defense,cwm asserted that its labor dispute and geological problems,of which it argued aquila had written notice of the former and actual notice of the latter,excused its deficient performance under the contract as force majeure events.cwm also asked the court to find that aquila had waived its claim that cwm breached the contract by continuing to accept coal shipments from cwm,and that,if nothing else,aquila had failed to mitigate its damages.
after a bench trial,the district court rejected each of cwm defenses and awarded over million in damages to aquila.in doing so,the court found cwm failed to prove that its performance was excused by virtue of a force majeure labor dispute cwm did not inform aquila in writing that it considered geological problems to be force majeure events,and neither did aquila have actual notice to that effect cwm did not prove aquila had waived its right to sue for breach of contract and cwm did not prove that aquila failed to mitigate its damages.cwm timely appealed these holdings,and we review each in turn.
in aid of its first the district court erred in concluding that the labor dispute at cwm was not a force majeure that excused performance,aplt.br.at appears to offer two distinct theories.first,it asserts that the district court decision rests on a factual error then,and alternatively,it assigns legal error to the court conclusion.
as a factual matter,cwm contends that its labor dispute caused all of its coal production problems and,thus,as a force majeure event of which aquila had written notice,the labor dispute excused all of its deficient performance under the contract.in cwm view,the geological problems it suffered affected coal production only because the company lacked sufficient workers to overcome them its geological troubles were thus merely symptoms of the labor dispute,not an independent malady.as cwm puts it,h ad cwm not lost its labor force,it would have been able to overcome the geological problems and would have fully performed under the contract,despite the problems.aplt.br.at.
reviewing the district court factual finding that cwm geological problems were the primary cause of its production difficulties and arose independently from its labor dispute,we may reverse only in the presence of clear is,only if the court finding is without factual support in the record or if,after reviewing all the evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.keys youth,city of olathe,cir quotation marks omitted.after a careful review of the record,we have no such conviction.
copious evidence supports the district court finding that cwm geological problems were the primary cause of its inability to perform as promised in the parties contract.indeed,testimony from cwm own employees supports the district court factual finding on this score.see.at defa,cwm mining supervisor,testified that the hot spots cwm encountered slowed the mining down.it stopped us from mining that area of mine three.id.at defa testified that due to the muddy conditions in mine three mining there almost stopped.id.at cwm president,reynolds,testified that in march of,as we were developing mine three,we again encountered the burn area,only in this area the temperatures were gone ahead of us but so was the coal.it had already been burned,and there was no coal there.id.at reynolds testified that we knew we were not going to fill the production levels because of that burnout and because of the hot zone there,that the reserves we thought we had were not there.
the question remains whether its geological problems arose independently,as the district court found,or whether they affected production only because cwm lacked sufficient personnel to address them,as cwm contends.the record before us reveals that cwm prepared a list of job openings on april,showing only three openings on that date.cwm list see also dist.op.at.this cwm professed to need only three additional workers at a time when it was suffering mightily from its geological to undercut its position.if cwm geological difficulties could be cured simply by additional employees,why seek only three more employees making matters worse,cwm own president testified that the reason for the list being short at that time was we had encountered that hot spot in the one section,and we were working on the rock tunnel in the other section,and we had no other areas to put the employees to work at that time.dist.op.at quoting testimony from reynolds.given such evidence,we can not help but conclude that the district court factual finding that geological,not labor,problems formed not just the primary but also an independent cause of cwm difficulties is entirely plausible,if not inescapable.accordingly,we see no reversible clear error.
even accepting the district court factual finding that geological problems were the primary and independent cause of its production difficulties,cwm contends that the district court decision nonetheless rests on a legal error.cwm suggests that its labor indisputably inhibited its performance to some degree and was a declared force majeure the entirety of its deficient performance.that is,even if the labor dispute was not solely or even primarily responsible for its deficient performance,cwm contends that it remains,under the parties contract,a force majeure event sufficient to excuse cwm from its failure to perform.we of course review assignments of legal error,including allegations of contractual misconstruction,de novo.see holdeman devine,cir.
even under that standard,however,we ultimately find cwm argument unavailing.to be sure,we agree with the initial premise of cwm argument the plain language of the parties agreement defines a force majeure as including difficulties that prevent performance wholly or partly.a force majeure event thus need not be something that precludes a party from performing at all.at the same time,we can not accept cwm subsequent assertion that a partial force majeure could excuse it from performance difficulties arising from what the district court fairly found to be other,entirely independent causes.the parties agreement expressly indicates that a party obligations will be suspended by the force majeure,but only to the extent made necessary by such force majeure,at least until such time as the contract is properly terminated.that is,under the terms of the agreement,the district court could lawfully excuse cwm deficient performance during the life of the contract only to the extent that the partial force,the labor the deficiency.
under this contractual scheme,cwm was free to prove at trial the extent to which the labor dispute force majeure,as opposed to independent geological problems,caused its nonperformance,and to be excused from damages caused by the labor dispute.under missouri law,much as elsewhere,however,it was cwm burden to come forward with proof from which the district court could determine the impact of the force majeure labor strike.see asi indus.gmbh memc materials,wl,at invoking force majeure in response to a claim of breach is affirmative defense gennari prudential ins.of,the burden o f proof on all affirmative defenses rests upon the defendant as the asserting party.the difficulty in this case is that cwm declined to offer the district court any evidentiary basis from which the court could have assessed what part of aquila losses were attributable to labor problems versus geological problems.perhaps a reflection of the persistent optimism of miners throughout the history of the american west cwm instead adopted an all or nothing trial strategy,asserting that all of its nonperformance should be excused under its theory.see,aplt.br.at.in doing so,cwm declined to offer a theory,tailored to the possibility that the court might find that geological problems posed an independent obstacle to cwm performance,that identified which part of its nonperformance might be fairly attributable solely to its labor difficulties.
the district court recognized cwm tactical decision and noted that,without some evidence about the extent to which labor problems caused cwm failure to perform,it was simply unable to reduce aquila dama
