the city of atlanta solicited bids for a contract to manage the advertising displays at international airport.plaintiff corey airport services,submitted a bid,but the city ultimately awarded the contract to the incumbent advertising contractor,clear channel outdoor.corey,a political outsider,contends the bidding process was rigged.it sued the city and individual city employees pursuant to,claiming they conspired to ensure clear channel,a political elite,would be awarded the contract,even though acceptance of corey bid would have been in the best interest of the city.corey asserts that this discriminatory classification between political insiders and outsiders denied it equal protection of the laws.
the individual defendants ben decosta,kyle mastin,hubert owens,adam smith,and carolyn chavis the defendants contend they are entitled to qualified immunity.they moved for summary judgment on this basis.the district court denied the defendants motion,and they appeal.we conclude that these defendants did not violate a clearly established constitutional right and are therefore entitled to qualified immunity.
background 
we basically accept the facts as stated in the district court order denying summary judgment to the city employees.see cottrell caldwell,cir in exercising our interlocutory review jurisdiction in qualified immunity cases we have discretion to accept the district court findings,if they are adequate.citation omitted.we first review the factual background of the case and summarize general contentions of bias in the bidding process before proceeding to outline the evidence corey offers to support its claims against these individual defendants.
in,the city of atlanta issued a request for proposal for a advertising contract at international airport.the successful proponent would have the right to manage and rent out over advertising display locations throughout the airport.in exchange,it would pay a percentage of its monthly gross receipts to the city as a rental payment.the incumbent contractor,clear channel,continued to manage the airport advertising pending the award of a new contract.
the request for proposal required bid proponents to project their gross receipts for the term and to commit to a monthly rent payment of at least of those receipts.the request also provided for a minimum annual guaranteed payment to the city if a contractor failed to attain projected revenues.each month,the advertising contractor would pay the city the rent payment,or the minimum annual guaranteed payment,whichever was greater.the first payment would be due days after execution of the contract.according to corey,if clear channel was awarded the new contract,it could continue to receive revenue from advertisements it had installed under its old contract for the first month of the new contract.thus,corey claims,the provision making the first rental payment due days after execution of the contract offered clear channel a potential windfall equal to one month advertising revenues,approximately.at.in contrast,a new advertising contractor would not likely generate any revenue during the first month of the contract because it could not obtain airport security clearance or approval for new advertisements prior to the due date for the first month rent therefore,corey argues,the day rent provision is evidence that bias in favor of clear channel was built into the request for proposal.id.at.
corey,clear channel,and one other proponent ultimately submitted bids for the advertising contract,which the city evaluated by awarding points based on various criteria,including projected fees,past performance,the proponent financial condition,and experience in airport advertising.corey proposal included an offer to pay the city a higher percentage of its gross receipts than did clear channel proposal,but clear channel proposal included higher overall revenue projections,due,in part,to an assumption the city would increase the number of advertising display locations.at.ultimately,the city proposal evaluation team awarded more points to clear channel bid than to corey bid.the city selected clear channel as the winning bidder,and these parties met to negotiate final contract terms on november.corey contends that,during these negotiations,the city amended its original request for proposal and allowed clear channel to revise its bid.corey was not afforded the same opportunity.
in november,corey filed an administrative protest,challenging the city selection of clear channel as the winning bidder.this protest was denied,but an appeal remains pending.the atlanta city council has postponed action to ratify the new contract pending the resolution of corey challenges to the bidding process.
corey calls attention to various acts of each defendant that it argues demonstrate that they conspired to manipulate the bidding process to favor clear channel.we now summarize the relevant contentions against each defendant 
ben decosta 
decosta was the airport aviation general manager.he chose the team that evaluated the proposals for the advertising contract and recommended that the city award the contract to clear channel.according to corey,decosta had prior knowledge of the meeting between the city and clear channel in november to negotiate terms of the advertising contract and he did nothing to prevent its occurrence 
kyle mastin 
mastin was the airport concession manager.first,he drafted portions of the request for proposals,including the terms that corey claims favored incumbent clear channel over other bid proponents.mastin refused corey request to modify or remove these provisions.second,mastin was a member of the proposal evaluation team.corey presents evidence suggesting he manipulated the scoring of the proposals to favor clear channel.corey contends,for example,that clear channel proposal included inflated revenue projections,that mastin knew the projections were inflated,and that he used those projections in awarding extra points to the proposal.finally,mastin participated in the november meeting with clear channel representatives to negotiate the terms of the advertising contract.at.
hubert owens 
owens was the director of the city office of contract compliance.one criterium in the proposal evaluation rubric awarded points if the proponent partnered with a disadvantaged business enterprise,certified by the office of contract compliance.both corey and clear channel proposed to partner with disadvantaged business enterprises,corey with sydney baxter,and clear channel with creative media displays of georgia.the office of contract compliance certified both as disadvantaged business enterprises and awarded the same number of points to corey and clear channel proposals.corey presents evidence,however,that during the certification process owens and his staff examined the application of corey partner more thoroughly than the application of clear channel partner.corey argues that if owens and his staff had thoroughly examined the application of clear channel partner,he would not have approved the disadvantaged business enterprise application,and clear channel proposal would not have received as many points.at.
adam smith 
smith was hired as chief procurement officer for the city in january,several months after the city selected clear channel as the winning bidder and after smith predecessor denied corey bid protest.corey argues that smith discriminated against corey by neglecting to launch an independent investigation of corey bid protest.also,corey presents evidence that smith knew there were irregularities with the request for proposal,but he declined to cancel the bid and issue a new request for proposal.at.
carolyn chavis 
chavis was the city aviation contract administrator.she served as the contact person for bid proponents,receiving and answering questions about the bidding process.corey submitted three sets of questions to chavis.she answered the first two sets of questions,but not the third.in contrast,chavis answered all of clear channel questions.while chavis claims the failure to answer the third set of questions was a simple mistake,corey argues it was a discriminatory act.at.
