plaintiffs manuela and juan zermeno appeal from the judgment entered for defendants in their unfair competition action after the trial court found that the settlement of their damage claims meant they no longer had standing to sue under the new standing requirements of proposition.we hold that the changed standing rule was not intended to apply to cases pending when it took effect where a plaintiff had suffered actual injury as required by the new law,but settled that portion of its action before proposition took effect.
facts and procedural history 
manuela and juan zermeno joined a healthcare discount program offered by care entrée in december for a monthly fee of,deducted automatically from the zermenos bank account,care entrée offered access to groups of healthcare providers who would charge discount rates.when three dentists identified on care entrée list of providers said they did not participate in the program and would not offer discounts,the zermenos tried to cancel their membership in the program.care entrée did not terminate their membership for another year,however,and continued to withdraw the monthly fee from the zermenos account.when care entrée finally ended the zermenos contract,it refunded less than of the it had taken from them.
in august,the zermenos sued care entrée in the los angeles superior court,alleging that care entrée had violated the law governing discount buying services,et they also alleged that care entrée violation of that law amounted to unfair competition,in violation of business and professions code section.care entrée removed the action to federal court,where the zermenos filed a first amended complaint that added a claim for violation of health and safety code section,which bars the operation of healthcare referral services the unfair competition claim was amended to include a violation of that provision,along with the discount buying service claim.
on october,care entrée and the zermenos reached a partial settlement.the parties stipulated to remand the action to state court solely to litigate the zermenos injunctive relief claims under health and safety code section and the unfair competition laws.care entrée would pay the zermenos as full compensation for damages of any kind,including their restitution claims for unfair competition and their damage claims under the discount buying service laws.the zermenos also agreed to forego any unfair competition restitution claims on behalf of the general public.the settlement was subject to approval by the federal district court,and on october,that court approved the agreement and remanded the action to the los angeles superior court.
after remand,the state court denied the zermenos motion for summary adjudication of their health and safety code section claim because that statute allowed only the attorney general to sue,and did not confer a private right of action 
on november,the voters approved proposition,which amended the unfair competition law to state that a person has standing to sue for unfair competition only if he has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.see bus,as amended by.before then,anyone acting for the general public had standing to sue for relief from unfair competition even if he had not suffered any injury.former bus,stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d.the initiative findings and declarations of purpose stated that it was designed in part to stop lawyers from filing unfair competition actions if they have no client who has been injured in fact under the standing requirements of the united states constitution.see historical and statutory notes,west ann.bus.ed.foll.the new law took effect the day after its passage.in july,our supreme court decided californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,mervyn,which held that proposition new standing requirement applied to all pending unfair competition actions,including those filed before the changed law took effect.
the zermenos case went to trial in june on the theory that they could seek to enjoin care entrée alleged violation of health and safety code section under the unfair competition law.see stop youth addiction,lucky stores,supra,cal th at,d,plaintiffs can bring unfair competition action for violation of any statute,even if that statute does not confer a private right of action.the trial court found that they lacked standing to pursue their unfair competition claim because,under mervyn,supra,cal th,d,the new standing requirements applied to their action,and because their settlement and release of all damage claims meant they no longer had any injury in fact.
the zermenos contend the trial court erred when it ruled on their earlier summary adjudication motion that they lacked standing to sue under health and safety code section,and when it found at trial that the settlement of their damage claims eliminated their standing to sue for unfair competition 
discussion 
the new standing requirement does not apply to this unique factual situation 
it is undisputed that up to the time of the settlement,the zermenos had a claim for actual injury that would have conferred standing under proposition.they contend those injuries continued to give them standing even after the settlement and the decision in mervyn.care entrée contends that mervyn foreclosed the standing issue against the zermenos.we conclude that proposition,as construed by mervyn,does not impose the new standing requirement on these peculiar facts 
the plaintiff in mervyn was a disability rights organization that sued for unfair competition because it alleged the layout of defendant department stores interfered with access by persons who used wheelchairs,scooters,crutches,and other mobility assistance devices.at no time had the plaintiff itself suffered any actual injury,but because the plaintiff sued before proposition was passed,it had standing at the time it brought the action.mervyn won at trial and the plaintiff appealed.after proposition took effect,mervyn moved to dismiss the appeal because the plaintiff had suffered no injury and therefore lacked standing under the new law.the court of appeal denied the motion to dismiss,and the supreme court reversed.
the parties framed the issue as whether the new law was intended to apply retroactively or prospectively.the supreme court noted the general rule that statutes are presumed to operate prospectively in the absence of a clearly expressed contrary intent.mervyn supra,cal th at,d.the statutory language was silent on the topic,but there was language in the preamble that could be so construed.rather than rely on that ambiguous language,the court relied on the traditional rules of statutory construction and determined that applying the new standing requirement to pending unfair competition cases resulted in a prospective application of proposition.ibid.
the mervyn court reached that conclusion by focusing on the effects of new legislation,not its substantive or procedural labels.if a new law changes the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities for that conduct,or if it substantially affects existing rights and obligations,then its application to a trial of preenactment conduct is forbidden,absent an express legislative intent to permit such retroactive application.mervyn,supra,cal th at,d.a statute that establishes rules for the conduct of pending litigation without changing the legal consequences of past conduct is not retroactive,even if it draws upon facts that existed before the new law took effect.ibid.
applying the new standing requirement in that case did not make the provision retroactive because it did not change the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities based on that conduct.it also did not change the substantive rules governing improper business conduct and it still permitted restitution of profits obtained in violation of the unfair competition law.mervyn supra,cal th at,d.instead,all proposition did was withdraw standing from uninjured persons to sue on behalf of others who were injured.standing must exist throughout the
