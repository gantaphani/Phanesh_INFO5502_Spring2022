damage to electronic equipment being shipped by defendant federal express corporation federal express led to litigation that culminated in a judgment in favor of plaintiff power standards lab,psl for in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.the dispositive question is whether federal the form of a preemption provision in the airline deregulation act of and a doctrine of federal common a state court from awarding any relief greater than was expressly and contractually negotiated between the carrier and the shipper.we answer this question in the affirmative.we hold that once the shipper has paid the contractual limit of its liability,state common law and statutory remedies can not augment that recovery.
background 
because issues of law resolve this appeal,it is not necessary to recount the evidence introduced at the trial except in the briefest form most favorable to psl.cassim allstate ins.cal th,d.
psl shipped a prototype piece of electronic equipment from its emeryville factory to san diego,using federal express as the shipper.the shipping airbill stated federal express liability policy 
limitations on our liability and liabilities not assumed 
our liability in connection with this shipment is limited to the lesser of your actual damages or,unless you declare a higher value,pay an additional charge,and document your actual loss in a timely manner.you may pay an additional charge for each additional of declared value.the declared value does not constitute,nor do we provide,cargo liability insurance.in any event,we will not be liable for any damage,whether direct,incidental,special,or consequential in excess of the declared value of a shipment,whether or not federal express had knowledge that such damages might be incurred including but not limited to loss of income or profits.psl paid for of additional declared value coverage from federal express the airbill also set forth the procedures for filing a claim,which included for us to process your claim,you must make the original shipping cartons and packing available for inspection.
the shipment arrived badly damaged.psl president called federal express telephone number and was repeatedly told that no inspection was necessary,and that after psl had the equipment repaired,it should submit a claim for the amount of repair expenses.psl paid to have the equipment repaired,and submitted a claim for that amount.federal express denied the claim because the equipment had not been inspected before it was repaired.four months of repeated entreaties produced no change in federal express position.having been told the only way fedex pays claims like this is if you sue us,psl reluctantly did so.
six weeks before the scheduled trial date,federal express sent psl a check for the costs of repair,plus a refund of the originally charged to ship the equipment.by that time psl had incurred more than of attorney fees.it therefore proceeded to trial on its causes of action for breach of contract and recovery of attorney fees based upon breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the jury found that federal express breached its contract with psl,and also breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing it owed to psl by unreasonably denying the claim.the jury awarded psl representing the amount of attorney fees psl reasonably incurred to collect the benefits due under the contract.the jury also awarded psl punitive damages of million.the trial court denied federal express motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,but it conditionally granted a new trial unless psl agreed to accept only of punitive damages.after psl consented to this reduction,federal express perfected this timely appeal.
federal express advances a number of contentions centered on the argument that federal law limited psl damages to recovery of no more than psl original claim for repair costs of its equipment,which federal express paid.this case should never have been tried because psl was seeking forms of relief under california law that are precluded by federal law.the airline deregulation act of ada and two decisions of the united states supreme court interpreting the ada establish that federal express can not be made to pay for more than the declared value of the equipment.the same result is also compelled by the federal common law doctrine limiting a carrier liability to the value of a shipment declared by a shipper to the carrier.anything more than the amount of psl repair costs,which federal express paid prior to trial,can not be recovered in a california court.as we explain,both of the grounds cited by federal express support its argument.
the ada enacted by congress in largely deregulated air transport service within the united states.congress determined that the quality and efficiency of air carrier service would be better promoted by relying on competitive market forces instead of the existing system of pervasive federal regulation.a major congressional concern was that carriers should not be burdened with conflicting state laws and policies that would have adverse economic consequences on the goal of increasing competition among carriers.see a conf,cong,american airlines,wolens,d morales trans world airlines,d.to avoid state frustration of its purposes,congress included a provision preempting conflicting state law.in its current version,the provision reads in pertinent part a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier b.the united states supreme court has twice considered the scope of this provision.
in morales trans world airlines,supra,the attorneys general of seven states notified airlines that they would enforce certain nonstatutory guidelines related to the content of the airlines advertising concerning frequent flyer programs and overbooking.the court held the guidelines relat ed to fares and were thus preempted.the court noted the wide and inclusive scope of the preemption provision the statute was described as having an expansive sweep granted by broadly worded language that is deliberately expansive and conspicuous for its breadth.from this language the court concluded state enforcement actions having a connection with,or reference to,airline rates,routes or services are preempted even if consistent with federal law.id.at.the court further concluded that the states threatened action against what it termed fare advertising related to the rates charged by the airlines and was therefore preempted.id.at.
in american airlines,wolens,supra,members of an air carrier frequent flyer program brought suit in state court alleging that a change in the way the program was administered constituted a breach of contract,and violated an illinois consumer fraud statute.refusing to retreat from the broadly inclusive reading given the preemption provision in morales,the court held that preemption was not restricted to matters that were essential to airline operations.nonessential matters were also preempted if they relate d to the objects of the preemption provision.id.at.the illinois statute could not be employed because it was intended to guide and police the marketing practices of the airlines,a matter le ft largely to the airlines themselves,and not at all to states by the ada.id.at.
the breach of contract part of the action,however,was not a obligation and was thus not preempted.american airlines,wolens,supra.helpful to understanding what is and what is not prohibited to state involvement is the distinction between what the parties bargain for and what is externally imposed upon that bargain by a state.terms,conditions,and remedies offered by the carrier and accepted by the customer qualify as privately ordered obligations,and therefore are not enacted or enforced by the state.a remedy confined to a contract terms simply holds parties to their agreements and business judgments id.at.
these considerations persuaded the united states supreme court to formulate the following preemption provision permits court adjudication of routine claims although it stops states from imposing their own substantive standards with respect to rates,routes,or services,but not from affording relief to a party who claims and proves that an airline dishonored a term the airline itself stipulated.this distinction between what the state dictates and what the airline itself undertakes confines courts,in actions,to the parties bargain,with no enlargement or enhancement based on state law or policies external to the agreement.american airlines,wolens,supra.as one federal court held,when the state begins to change the parties financial arrangements it is supplying external norms,a process that the national government has reserved to itself in the air transportation business.united airlines,mesa airlines,cir.
there is no dispute that federal express qualifies as an air carrier for purposes of this provision.see a kemper ins.companies federal exp.cir,fn.federal exp.postal service d.it is equally plain that psl lawsuit is about the service federal express provides to customers.the essence of that service is the transportation of freight by air.psl lawsuit is clearly founded on the unsatisfactory manner in which federal express performed that service.it is therefore related to a service of an air carrier in addition,it is elemental economics that and impact the rates federal express charges for its services see federal exp.california public utilities com cir.imposing liability for performance of a carrier core function would clearly impact the economic ability of that carrier to compete,and thus must be deemed relating to a price or service of an air carrier,burlington air express,cir,hih marine ins.services,gateway freight services th,d.
the contract in this case was the airbill federal express issued to psl,zubaz,federal exp,commodities recovery emery worldwide.at trial psl was no longer pursuing a routine breach of contract action.federal express had already paid the compensatory damages for breach agreed upon by the parties in the contract of carriage.instead,psl was pursuing recovery of brandt damages,named after brandt superior court cal d.our supreme court recently explained the nature of brandt damages in brandt,this court established a notable exception to the rule,that parties ordinarily pay their own attorney fees for insurance bad faith cases.we explained that if an insurer fails to act fairly and in good faith when discharging its responsibilities concerning an insurance contract,such breach may result in tort liability for proximately caused damages.those damages can include the insured cost to hire an attorney to vindicate the insured legal rights under the insurance policy.when an insurer tortious conduct reasonably compels the insured to retain an attorney to obtain the benefits due under a policy,it follows that the insurer should be liable in a tort action for that expense.the attorney fees are an economic caused by the tort.citation.these fees must be distinguished from recovery of attorney fees qua attorney fees what we consider here is attorney fees that are recoverable as damages resulting from a tort in the same way that medical fees would be part of the damages in a personal injury action.cassim allstate ins,supra,cal th,d,quoting brandt superior court,supra,at.federal express claims that the jury awarded compensatory damages for bad faith,arguing that such damages are,notwithstanding federal preemption,beyond those permitted by brandt.psl contends that the jury awarded no more than attorney fees reasonably incurred in compelling federal express to provide the coverage it refused in bad faith 
brandt damages are not awarded in routine breach of contract actions.they are also the result of california common law,which qualifies as an other provision having the force and effect of law within the meaning of the preemption statute.united airlines,mesa airlines,supra.brandt damages,or recovery of attorney fees,is not mentioned in the airbill agreement between psl and federal express.this type of damages is thus not a part of the bargain struck by the parties.it must therefore be regarded as an enlargement or enhancement based on state law or policies external to the agreement.american airlines,wolens,supra.moreover,brandt damages are based on a bad faith refusal of an insurer to provide policy benefits,another creature of state common law,freeman mills,belcher oil cal th,d,i n california,the law implies in every contract a covenant of good faith and fair dealing mitchell exhibition foods,d.same spindle travelers ins.companies d.the evolvement of the doctrine of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is an expression of public policy in our state.the covenant is also extracontractual it is implied as a supplement to the express contractual covenants waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.conditions implied by law are conditions imposed by law they are not negotiated by the contracting parties.claims based on violation of the covenant are therefore preempted,howell alaska airlines,osband united airlines,and decisions cited express,fedex d,wl.
the same is also true for punitive damages.they were not part of the bargain struck by psl and federal express.a creature of statute,the purpose of punitive damages is a purely public one.the public goal is to punish wrongdoing and thereby to protect itself from future misconduct,either by the same defendant or other potential wrongdoers.adams murakami cal d.s uch damages are never recoverable in routine breach of contract cases.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,italics added accord,cates construction,talbot partners cal th,d,in the absence of an independent tort,punitive damages may not be awarded for breach of contract even where the defendant conduct in breaching the contract was willful,fraudulent,or malicious.tomaselli transamerica ins.th,d simple breach of contract,no matter how willful and hence tortious,is not a ground for punitive damages.an award of punitive damages would therefore also constitute an enlargement or enhancement of the bargain based on state law or policies external to the agreement.travel all over the world,saudi arabia cir,fn,quoting american airlines,wolens,supra.accord,deerskin trading post,ups of america,see also west northwest airlines,cir,since punitive damages by their very nature seek to punish the entity against whom they are awarded,such damages would be contrary to the goals of deregulation.cleveland beltman north american,cir,punitive damage awards could have a dramatic impact on a carrier liability and seriously enlarge a shipper remedy.
nothing in the ninth circuit decision of charas trans world airlines,cir,or our decision in aquino asiana airlines,th,d compels a contrary conclusion.the former held only that congress did not intend to preempt passengers personal injury claims charas trans world airlines,supra,at,whereas this case involves neither passengers nor tort claims,but what amounts to tort recovery for a breach of contract,something california allows only in the insurance context or when the breach is accompanied by an intentional tort that is independent of the contract.robinson helicopter,dana cal th,d.aquino likewise involved a primarily tort causes of action.a breach of contract claim was involved,but we held it could not be determined by summary judgment because there was an undecided question of that might prohibit the carrier action in refusing to board passengers for an intercontinental flight the ada preempts states from imposing policies that affect an air carrier prices,routes,or service.there is no indication in the act that federal policies are likewise preempted.aquino asiana airlines,supra,at fn,d.
psl maintains that the basis of its dispute with federal express is not with the actual transportation but with the subsequent conduct in handling psl repair reimbursement claim.the argument is tempting.but the law of federal preemption does not allow such a distinction.preemption cases dealing with mail and highway carriers are illustrative of this principle.the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act governs liability for property transported by surface carriers.in language almost identical to that it used in wolens to character
