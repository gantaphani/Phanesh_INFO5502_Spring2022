sdo appealed commerce decision to the court of international trade.on september,the court held,inter alia,that commerce should have applied a common stake analysis with respect to the importing domestic producers,comparing each individual producer import dependency to its stake in the domestic industry.save domestic oil,united states,d.int l trade.the court of international trade therefore remanded the case to commerce.
on august,commerce upheld its original dismissal,again considering the opposition of the integrated oil producers.administrative determination pursuant to court instructions antidumping and countervailing duty petitions on certain crude petroleum oil products from iraq,mexico,saudi arabia,and venezuela dep t commerce,remand determination.in particular,commerce considered the opposition of arco,coastal,chevron,conoco,exxon,fina,marathon,mobil,murphy,phillips petroleum,shell,and texaco.see id.at.applying the common stake analysis as dictated by the court of international trade,commerce developed a matrix to compare each company dependency on imports none,low,significant,high to its stake in domestic production based on factors such as production volume,number of workers,number of new wells drilled,number of wells in operation,capital expenditures,and reserve holdings.see id.at.performing the analysis on a company and basis,commerce determined whether it would disregard a company opposition to a petition.id.at.in the end,commerce concluded that approximately of the domestic industry opposed sdo various petitions.it therefore dismissed the petitions.id.at.
sdo again appealed to the court of international trade.the court,however,upheld commerce dismissal,finding that commerce did not have to disregard the opposition of domestic because it found that the opposition arose out of the producers domestic interests.save domestic oil,d at.in particular,the court found that the high level of dependency on crude oil imports justified including the large,opposition.id.at.noting the discretion given to commerce in performing its analysis,as well as the lack of an established rule or test,the court of international trade approved commerce matrix analysis because it adequately accounted for the particular characteristics of the domestic crude oil industry.id.at.

under the statute,cvd and ad investigations may be initiated either by the administering authority commerce or by petition.cvd,ad when evaluating whether to initiate such investigations by petition,commerce must determine if the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry.id.c a ii cvd,c a ii ad.to that end,congress has established specific rules.see id.c cvd,c ad.specifically,commerce shall find that the industry supports the petition if 
i the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for at least percent of the total production of the domestic like product,and 
ii the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for more than percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support for or opposition to the petition.

on appeal,sdo presents two primary arguments commerce improperly departed from its standard practice of disregarding the opposition of domestic without reasonable explanation and commerce matrix analysis was arbitrary and capricious,therefore warranting reversal.appellees disagree with both assertions.
sdo argues that commerce improperly departed from its prior practice of disregarding the opposition of producers who also import the subject merchandise.in particular,sdo points to commerce approach in frozen concentrated orange juice from brazil,fed.reg.dep t commerce,fcoj,an approach subsequently affirmed by the court of international trade in citrosuco paulista united states.int l trade.it also maintains that congress ratified the fcoj approach in the uruguay round agreement act statement of administrative action saa in fcoj,sdo points out,commerce refused to consider the opposition of producers who imported approximately of their production level.moreover,since then,sdo argues,commerce has refused to consider the opposition of companies that import as little as to of their production level.see live cattle from canada and mexico,fed.reg.dep t commerce initiating antidumping investigations live cattle dep t of commerce mem.from susan kuhbach and gary taverman to richard moreland,petitions on live cattle from canada and mexico determination of industry support at,live cattle mem.thus,in considering the opposition of crude oil producers who import between and of their domestic production level,sdo contends commerce unreasonably and unjustifiably deviated from its standard practice 
appellees counter that the statute itself gives commerce broad discretion to either include or disregard the positions of domestic there are no conditions,limitations,or qualifications on commerce discretion.according to appellees,commerce does not have a standard practice of discounting the opposition of domestic based on any particular percentage of imports.instead,appellees contend that commerce prior determinations illustrate a case or approach.
our analysis begins with the language of the statute.it states that commerce may disregard the position of domestic producers of a domestic like product who are importers of the subject merchandise.c b ii cvd,c b ii ad emphasis added.the legislative history reiterates this point,noting that the provision gives commerce the discretion to disregard the position of domestic producers who are also importers of the subject merchandise,at emphasis added.finally,the saa also evinces commerce discretionary authority.it provides that commerce will not apply a bright line test to determine whether a producer who is an importer of the subject merchandise should be excluded from the domestic industry.instead,it will look to relevant factors,such as percentage of ownership or volume of imports.saa,pub,at.based on the above,we conclude that the statute and related legislative authority grant commerce discretion in its consideration of the opposition of domestic.
despite commerce statutory discretion,sdo correctly points out that if commerce has a routine practice for addressing like situations,it must either apply that practice or provide a reasonable explanation as to why it departs therefrom.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.a n agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance.thus,the question becomes whether commerce has a standard practice of disregarding the opposition of domestic whose level of importation surpasses a specific percentage level and,if so,whether commerce reasonably departed therefrom in evaluating sdo petitions.
addressing the first issue,we find that commerce does not have a standard practice applicable to all industries of disregarding the opposition of domestic with import levels beyond a certain percentage.instead,we agree with the court of international trade that the decisions evince the application of an analysis.for example,in fcoj commerce evaluated the relevant orange juice industry in order to determine whether to disregard the opposition of certain domestic.noting the orange juice industry reliance on imports,commerce observed that disregarding all domestic opposition would leave an unrepresentative population for purposes of determining petition support.fcoj,fed.reg.at.based on an analysis,commerce chose to consider the opposition of those producers importing up to of their domestic production.
performing a similar analysis in live cattle,commerce disregarded the opposition of the texas cattle feeders association tcfa to a petition regarding cattle imports.live cattle,fed.reg.because over of the cattle imported from mexico went to texas significant chose to disregard the opposition of the tcfa live cattle mem.at.commerce concluded that tcfa members,more than half of which were importers or handlers of mexican cattle,opposed the petition not as domestic producers,but out of their interests as importers.id.notably,in contrast to fcoj,live cattle dealt with a domestic industry having little overall import dependency,of which the tcfa was only a small part.id.at app.as such,the exclusion of tcfa opposition did not exclude a disproportionate amount of the domestic industry.
commerce here applied an analysis similar to that of fcoj and live cattle.like fcoj,but unlike live cattle,the domestic crude oil industry relies heavily on imports.in fcoj,commerce specifically found that the high import dependency justified including the opposition of domestic producers importing up to of their orange juice production.here,the import dependency is even higher than in fcoj,therefore justifying commerce inclusion of the opposition of those domestic producers importing even more than of their domestic production.in addition,unlike in live cattle,domestic in this case account for a large proportion of both the total domestic crude oil production and the opposition to the petition.therefore,in contradistinction to its determination in live cattle,commerce here reasonably included the opposition of the large,integrated crude oil producers so as to avoid excluding a disproportionate amount of the domestic industry.finally,commerce here looked beyond simple import dependency and evaluated additional factors to determine each company stake in the industry.because commerce determined that these other factors were particularly relevant to the crude oil industry,it reasonably considered them in performing its analysis,consequently refusing to disregard the opposition of domestic with an import dependency of to.
in light of our conclusion that commerce does not have a standard practice of disregarding the opposition of domestic based on a specific percentage of imports,it is unnecessary to evaluate whether it reasonably deviated from this practice.even assuming,however,that commerce prior determinations established such a practice,we find that commerce provided a reasoned analysis that justified considering certain domestic opposition in this case.first,commerce included the opposition of domestic producers importing between to of their domestic production because of the significant reliance on imports in the crude oil industry.remand determination at.as discussed,this distinction followed the reasoning in fcoj,but reasonably distinguished that case based on the even higher level of import dependency in the crude oil industry.id.at.second,commerce detailed matrix analysis discussed below,which it used to compare a company import dependency to its stake in the domestic industry in order to determine whether to disregard an opposition,was not unreasonable.rather,it evinces a rational,analysis that evaluated relevant variables and other economic factors.thus,even assuming commerce departed from any common practice of disregarding the opposition of domestic importing over of their production,it provided a detailed justification therefore in accordance with motor vehicle manufacturers ass n,at.consequently,we agree with the court of international trade alternative holding and conclude that even assuming commerce departed from standard practice,such departure was reasonable.
sdo also contends on appeal that commerce common stake analysis in its remand determination was arbitrary and capricious.specifically,sdo argues commerce arbitrarily performed a analysis for each opposing domestic commerce arbitrarily evaluated each company stake in the industry and commerce arbitrarily considered the amount of crude oil reserves for each company.
appellees disagree.they contend commerce properly implemented the court of international trade remand instructions,determining each company stake in the domestic industry and then weighing it against its import dependency.responding to each of sdo arguments,appellees argue commerce properly evaluated each petition individually commerce used data in evaluating each company stake and commerce rightfully considered each company crude oil reserves.
before addressing these questions in detail,we first review commerce common stake analysis in more detail.commerce began its common stake analysis by evaluating each domestic producer import dependency on a basis.remand determination at.it established four separate categories of import dependency none for zero importation low for importation of up to of production significant for imports between and of production and high for imports over of production.id.at.at the same time,commerce evaluated each producer stake in the domestic industry,using such factors as production volume,the number of workers employed,the number of new oil wells drilled,the number of wells in operation,and capital expenditures.id.at.it also looked at each company investment risk arising from its reserve holdings,id.at,as well as its time amount of time it would take to deplete each company reserves at current production levels.id.at.commerce subsequently balanced each company level of importation against its stake in the domestic industry,thereby determining if commerce could consider that comp
