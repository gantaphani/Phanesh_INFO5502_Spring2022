wag more dogs,llc appeals the district court dismissal of its complaint,which alleged that arlington county sign ordinance violated the first amendment.we agree with the district court that the ordinance is a restriction on speech that satisfies intermediate scrutiny.finding no merit to the other constitutional challenges,we affirm.
like most local governments throughout the country,arlington county arlington has enacted a comprehensive zoning ordinance.several provisions of the zoning ordinance pertain to the display of signs sign ordinance.arlington enacted the sign ordinance to regulate the construction,placement and display of signs in order to maintain the health,safety,convenience and welfare of residents and businesses of the county,as well as the overall visual appearance throughout the county.arlington county,zoning ordinance among other aims,arlington promulgated the sign ordinance to reduce the traffic hazards caused by unregulated signs and to enhance the aesthetic environment of the county.id.
the sign ordinance defines sign as a ny word,numeral,figure,design,trademark,flag,pennant,twirler,light,display,banner,balloon or other device of any kind which,whether singly or in any combination,is used to direct,identify,or inform the public while viewing the same from outdoors.id.b.it further provides as a general rule that a sign permit shall be obtained from the zoning administrator before any sign or advertising is erected,displayed,replaced,or altered so as to change its overall dimensions.id.a.
two categories of signs are not subject to the permit process.the first,a list of signs permitted in all zoning districts without permits,includes fifteen types of signs and covers such rudimentary postings as official notices required by law,no trespassing signs,and directional signs.id.e.a second category lists fourteen types of prohibited signs most of which involve jarring or displays for which no permit may be issued.id.c.a catchall provision allows noncommercial speech on a sign wherever commercial speech is permitted.id.a.
the sign ordinance sets out intricate requirements for various types of signs located in different zoning districts.relevant to this appeal,a provision includes size regulations for businesses in c and m districts business sign provision.id.g.the business sign provision mandates that an individual obtain a sign permit before erecting a business sign that is,a sign identifying the products or services available on the premises or advertising a use conducted thereon.id.on the walls of commercial buildings in all c and m districts,businesses are allowed to display up to three signs for each tenant,up to a maximum total sign area of sixty square feet per tenant,or a total sign area of one square foot per linear foot of the tenant frontage,whichever is greater.id.g.
if a proposed sign does not otherwise qualify for a permit under the sign ordinance but does not fall under the category,an individual may seek a special exception through a comprehensive sign plan.id.a.the provision detailing the process through which arlington evaluates applications for a comprehensive sign plan comprehensive sign plan provision states as follows 
use permits may be issued for any of the special exceptions or conditional uses for which a use permit is required by the provisions of this ordinance provided,that the county board shall find that after a duly advertised hearing,the use will not affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood be in conflict with the purposes of the master plans of the county.
individuals who violate the sign ordinance are initially subject to civil penalties.arlington imposes a fine on a violator,and fines steadily increase for subsequent transgressions.id.d.when an individual has accrued or more in fines,arlington may prosecute the violation as a criminal misdemeanor.id.g.
kim houghton owns and maintains wag more dogs,llc wag more dogs,a doggy daycare business located in an m district in arlington,virginia.houghton sought to position her store near the shirlington dog park,ultimately renting a space in adjacent to the park.in an effort to beautify the area and to create goodwill with the people who frequented the dog park,many of whom were potential wag more dogs customers,houghton commissioned a painting on the rear of the business building.the final product,measuring approximately square feet,incorporated some of the cartoon dogs in wag more dogs logo.houghton described it as including happy cartoon dogs,bones,and paw prints.id.
on august,arlington county zoning administrator melinda artman emailed houghton to inform her that the painting violated the sign ordinance.specifically,the painting exceeded the size limitations imposed on signs displayed in m districts,in contravention of section g of the sign ordinance.artman stated that an administrative lock would remain on the building permit until houghton cured the violations.houghton could either paint over the display or apply for a comprehensive sign plan to maintain compliance with the sign ordinance,though her chances of success with the latter option were dubious,according to artman.in the interim,artman told houghton to cover the painting with tarps if she elected not to paint over it.
houghton followed up with artman by email,asking what steps she could take to ensure that the painting was not considered a business sign.artman responded as follows 
for the mural to not be considered a sign,it may depict anything you like except something to do with dogs,bones,paw prints,pets,people walking their dogs.in other word sic,the mural can not sic show anything that has any relationship with your business.if it does,then it becomes a sign.
id.houghton ultimately covered the painting with tarps,and artman released the lock on her building.artman subsequently issued wag more dogs a final certificate of occupancy on september,under the condition that the tarps remain in place over the painting.
about two weeks later,arlington officials sought to reach an accommodation with houghton so that she could remove the tarps while keeping the painting mostly intact.they told her that she could include the words welcome to shirlington park community canine area above the artwork,which would convert the painting from an impermissible sign into an informational sign not requiring a permit under the sign ordinance.houghton declined.
unable to display the painting because it violated the sign ordinance,wag more dogs filed suit against artman and arlington.it challenged the sign ordinance on a variety of first amendment grounds.wag more dogs first contended that the sign ordinance was an impermissible restriction on speech,both facially and as applied to the business.it then alleged that the sign ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.augmenting the vagueness attack by referencing artman email to houghton,wag more dogs claimed that artman enforced the ordinance using an impermissibly vague any relationship test,she would consider any display to constitute a business sign if it had any relationship to the business.wag more dogs further alleged that the comprehensive sign plan provision operated as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.finally,it claimed that arlington offer of accommodation in which houghton could display the painting if she included above the artwork welcome to shirlington park community canine area qualified as unconstitutionally compelled speech.wag more dogs sought declaratory and injunctive relief for these alleged first amendment violations.
wag more dogs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,while arlington and artman moved to dismiss the complaint.the district court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denied the motion for a preliminary injunction as moot.the court initially held that the sign ordinance was a restriction on speech that easily satisfied intermediate scrutiny,rejecting wag more dogs facial and challenges.the court further found no merit to wag more dogs vagueness challenges.it first concluded that the sign ordinance definition of sign,when read in the context of the rest of the regulation,was not impermissibly vague.the court next held that wag more dogs had not plausibly alleged that arlington uses the any relationship test as a decisive interpretation,and,in any event,the standard is not unduly vague.finally,the court rejected wag more dogs allegations that the comprehensive sign plan provision qualified as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech and that arlington had impermissibly compelled its speech.
wag more dogs appeals the district court dismissal of its complaint and denial of its request for a preliminary injunction.
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss,lebron rumsfeld,cir,accepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint,see aziz alcolac,cir.
to survive a motion to dismiss,a plaintiff must establish facial plausibility by pleading factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,d.although we are constrained to take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,we need not accept legal conclusions couched as facts or unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.giarratano johnson,cir quoting shore,assocs,cir.at bottom,a plaintiff must nudge its claims across the line from conceivable to plausible to resist dismissal.bell atlantic twombly,d.
the heart of wag more dogs complaint is that the sign ordinance is an impermissible restriction on speech,both facially and as applied,that can not survive strict scrutiny.we disagree and hold that the sign ordinance is content neutral on its face.as applied to wag more dogs,the regulation is a restriction on commercial speech.because the sign ordinance satisfies intermediate scrutiny,wag more dogs challenges lack merit.
wag more dogs advances a syllogistic argument to support its claim that the sign ordinance is unconstitutional on its face as a restriction on speech any regulation that differentiates between types of speech is content based.the sign ordinance imposes different requirements on different types of speech.therefore,the sign ordinance is content based.but wag more dogs would have us hew to a euclidean commitment to wooden logic,where the law instead demands a more pragmatic judgment.viewing the sign ordinance with reference to precedent that applies a practical analysis of content neutrality,requiring that a regulation do more than merely differentiate based on content to qualify as content based,we conclude that the sign ordinance is content neutral and satisfies intermediate scrutiny 
eschewing a formalistic approach to evaluating content neutrality that looks only to the terms of a regulation,the supreme court has instead embraced a more practical inquiry.see,hill colorado,d.the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality,the court has declared,is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.id.at.quoting ward rock against racism,d see also ward,at.the government purpose is the controlling consideration.the court has repeatedly explained that government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral if it is justified without reference to the content of regulated speech.hill,at.this is so even if the regulation has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.ward,at.
distilling the principles enunciated by the court in hill,we have established a test for evaluating content neutrality 
a regulation is not a regulation of speech if the regulation is not a regulation of speech,but rather a regulation of the places where some speech may occur the regulation was not adopted because of disagreement with the message the speech conveys or the government interests in the regulation are unrelated to the content of the affected speech.

cognizant that e ach method of communicating ideas is a law unto itself and that our jurisprudence must reflect the differing natures,values,abuses and dangers of each method,metromedia,city of san diego,d plurality quoting kovacs cooper.jackson,concurring,we pay here particular attention to cases addressing sign regulations.the supreme court in metromedia weighed the constitutionality of a sign ordinance.generally speaking,the ordinance permitted commercial advertising but prohibited other forms of commercial advertising and most noncommercial communications.id.at.noncommercial messages were permitted only if they fell into one of twelve specified exceptions.id.at.the court invalidated the ordinance as an unconstitutional restriction on speech.the plurality cited two principal constitutional defects.first,the regulation privileged commercial speech over noncommercial speech,inverting the constitutional protection afforded each type of speech.id.at.second,the city through its exceptions to the general ban on noncommercial signs impermissibly distinguished between various noncommercial communicative interests.id.at.
we drew on metromedia in evaluating the content neutrality of a sign regulation in covenant media.the ordinance there distinguished between signs and signs.signs were defined as signs identifying or advertising a business,person,or activity,or goods,products,services or facilities located on the premises where the sign is installed.covenant media,at internal quotations omitted.signs were signs identifying or advertising a business,person,or activity,or goods,products,services or facilities not located on the premises where the sign is installed or directing persons to a different location from where the sign is installed.id.internal quotations omitted.the sign regulation imposed size and location requirements on signs and mandated receipt of a permit prior to construction of such a sign.id.the regulation drew further distinctions between types of signs within the two principal categories,imposing varying requirements on,directional,instructional,memorial,and public signs.id.at.
we held that the ordinance was content neutral.we first stressed that the city adopted the ordinance to regulate land use,not to stymie any particular message.id.indeed,the interests proffered by the city securing traffic safety,promoting the efficient transfer of information,and enhancing the area aesthetics were completely unrelated to the content of messages displayed.id.we succinctly rejected the argument advanced by the plaintiff,one that mirrors that set forth by wag more dogs 
to be sure,the sign regulation defined and distinguished between different types of signs.and we recognize that distinguishing between different types of signs and where those signs may be located may also in effect distinguish where certain content may be displayed.but a regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral,even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.the sign regulation did not regulate the location of different types of signs based on the ideas or views expressed.
id.citations and internal quotations omitted.the regulation moreover did not suffer from the constitutional infirmities that plagued the ordinance in metromedia.first,the regulation did not afford greater protection to commercial speech than noncommercial speech.id.at.second,although the regulation drew distinctions between types of noncommercial speech imposing different restrictions on directional signs,memorial signs,and the like the framework of the ordinance counseled reaching a different outcome from the metromedia court.id.whereas the ordinance in metromedia operated as a general prohibition on noncommercial signs,the regulation in covenant media generally allowed all signs regardless of message,applying only time,place,and manner restrictions.id.
applying hill and covenant media to the sign ordinance,we have no trouble concluding that it is a regulation.as an initial matter,wag more dogs has not alleged nor could it that arlington has regulated speech through the sign ordinance because of disagreement with the message it conveys,which is the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality,hill,at.quoting ward,at.as with the city in covenant media,arlington adopted the sign ordinance to regulate land use,not to stymie a particular disfavored message.on this score,then,the sign ordinance content neutrality is incandescent.
moving to the text of the sign ordinance,we acknowledge that arlington has differentiated between types of speech.for instance,the regulation imposes size requirements on business signs that do not similarly apply to noncommercial signs,and it exempts fifteen types of signs from its coverage.but this varying treatment is not sufficient to convert the sign ordinance into a restriction on speech.arlington enacted the ordinance to,among other aims,promote traffic safety and the county aesthetics,interests unrelated to messages displayed.thus even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others,the sign ordinance is nevertheless content neutral because it serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression,covenant media,at quoting ward,at.the sign ordinance is moreover distinguishable from the invalidated regulation in metromedia.in contrast to that enactment,the sign ordinance does not privilege commercial speech above noncommercial speech,arlington county,zoning ordinance a wherever commercial speech is permitted on a sign under this section of the ordinance,noncommercial speech also is permitted.and like the ordinance in covenant media,the sign ordinance departs from the metromedia regulation in that it generally allow s all signs regardless of message,applying only time,place,and manner restrictions.covenant media,at.
that arlington officials must superficially evaluate a sign content to determine the extent of applicable restrictions is not an augur of constitutional doom.see,hill,at.we have never held,or suggested,that it is improper to look at the content of an oral or written statement in order to determine whether a rule of law applies to a course of conduct.for a regulation with a clear purpose to be content based,there must be a more searching inquiry into the content.covenant media,at.as in covenant media,the sign ordinance objectives,which seek to address problems caused by signs wholly apart from any message conveyed,mitigate any concern that the kind of cursory examination brought about by looking generally at what type of message a sign carries to determine where it can be located renders the regulation content based.see id.at quoting hill,at.
deeming the sign ordinance content neutral,we now readily conclude that it satisfies intermediate scrutiny.a regulation passes constitutional muster if it furthers a substantial government interest,is narrowly tailored to further that interest,and leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.am.legion,at.the sign ordinance meets all three standards.
arlington enacted the sign ordinance to,in part,promote traffic safety and enhance the county aesthetics.both are substantial government interests.members of the city council of taxpayers for vincent,d aesthetics metromedia,at.plurality aesthetics and traffic safety.the sign ordinance is narrowly tailored to further its interest in traffic safety and aesthetics,as its size and location restrictions d o no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy,taxpayers,at.ruling that government may impose even a flat ban on certain classes of signs.finally,the sign ordinance leaves open ample alternative channels of communication,am.legion,at,by generally permitting the display of all types of signs,subject only to size and location restrictions.to take an example from this dispute,wag more dogs could display its painting if it were no larger than sixty square feet.
wag more dogs also attacks the sign ordinance as applied to it.characterizing its painting as noncommercial speech,wag more dogs maintains that arlington impermissibly restricted its sign while allowing other noncommercial messages to stand.we reject the premise,however,and conclude that the painting is commercial speech.because arlington regulation of wag more dogs commercial speech satisfies intermediate scrutiny,we must turn aside the business challenge.
because the degree of protection afforded by the first amendment depends on whether the activity sought to be regulated constitutes commercial or speech,we must first determine the proper classification of the mural at issue here.bolger youngs prods,d.in bolger,the supreme court observed that the core notion of commercial speech is speech which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.id.at.quoting.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d see also cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm n,d stating that commercial speech is expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.
bolger recognized a broader definition of commercial speech,encompassing speech that can not be characterized merely as proposals to engage in commercial transactions.at.before the court in bolger was an informational pamphlet distributed by a manufacturer of prophylactics.id.at.the pamphlet discussed the utility of condoms in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.id.at.it identified the manufacturer only on the last page,which stated that the firm had contributed the pamphlet as a public service.id.despite the pamphlet plainly not falling within the core notion of commercial speech,the court nevertheless deemed it commercial speech.id.at.a combination of three factors provide d strong support for the court conclusion the manufacturer conceded that the pamphlet was advertising,a specific product was referenced,and the manufacturer had an economic motivation for mailing the pamphlets.id.at.the court cautioned that it did not mean to suggest that each of the characteristics present in this case must necessarily be present in order for speech to be commercial.id.at.
the three factors relied on by the court in bolger similarly counsel classifying wag more dogs painting as commercial speech.first,wag more dogs alleged in its complaint that the painting was meant to attract customers from the nearby dog park,which is tantamount to conceding that it was advertising.second,the painting included cartoon dogs from the business logo.because wag more dogs offers services rather than goods,the inclusion of part of its logo is analogous to referencing a specific product.third,wag more dogs certainly had an economic motivation for displaying the painting,as it admitted in its complaint that it sought to create goodwill with the people who frequented the dog park,many of whom were potential customers.when viewed through the lens of bolger,wag more dogs complaint fails to plausibly allege that the painting qualifies as noncommercial speech.
as applied to wag more dogs,the sign ordinance regulation of commercial speech satisfies intermediate scrutiny.to sustain its regulation of commercial speech,arlington must show at least that the sign ordinance directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest,sorrell.at.arlington has met that burden.see supra part.the sign ordinance is therefore constitutional as appli
