this case raises questions about supplemental jurisdiction after removal,and about choice of law in a challenge to a limitation of liability in a waybill.
siemens,a german manufacturer,made computer chips in singapore,and sent them to san jose,california,for testing.when the cartons containing the boxes of chips came back to siemens factory in singapore,one of the three inner boxes in each carton contained a brick instead of circuits.
siemens had purchased insurance from albingia versicherungs,which paid siemens about for the stolen chips.albingia brought this subrogation claim against all the firms in the shipping chain.albingia sued in the california superior court for san francisco county.the complaint stated five causes of action,the first arising under the warsaw convention,the other four arising under california state law for negligence,breach of contract,breach of the duty of care by bailee,and conversion.one of the defendants,eva air,an international air carrier,removed the case to federal court based on the warsaw convention claim.
after discovery,the case was settled as to all defendants but one,schenker international,a freight forwarder.schenker operated a warehouse in south san francisco where the chips had been stored prior to transport on eva air back to singapore.schenker and albingia stipulated to facts establishing,basically,that the chips had probably been stolen by schenker employees while in schenker warehouse.
siemens waybills contained a limitation on liability supplementing the liability limitation in the warsaw convention.the contract said that,with exceptions immaterial to this case,liability where the warsaw convention did not apply was limited to per kilogram.the waybill says that this amount is designed to be the approximate value of the french gold francs specified as the warsaw convention limit.thus schenker idea was plainly,our liability is limited to per kilo if the warsaw convention does apply,and also if it does.
schenker branch manager and warehouse manager watched a videotape from their security camera to figure out whether the shipment had been weighed when it came in.but somehow all the videotapes made from the security cameras during the whole four days the chips were in schenker care disappeared.the district court presumed that the chips were stolen by employees,for their own benefit and not for schenker benefit.this presumption has not been challenged in this appeal.
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the applicability of the warsaw convention and the monetary limitations in the waybill.in its summary judgment motion,albingia did not raise the issue of the jurisdiction of the federal court over the state law supplemental claims if the court found that the warsaw convention did not apply,nor the issue of the exercise of discretion by the court over retention of the supplemental claims.the district court determined that the warsaw convention did not apply,that the limitation on the waybill was valid under federal common law,and that albingia was entitled to summary judgment in the amount of,computed under the waybill limitations.albingia appeals,to get the rest of the plus expenses that it is out of pocket to its insured on the stolen shipment.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment albingia argues on appeal that once the district court held that the warsaw convention did not apply,the basis of question gone,as was jurisdiction to consider the remaining state law claims.albingia therefore argues that the district court should have remanded the state law claims back to the state superior court,because it lacked supplemental jurisdiction to rule on them.and albingia further argues that even if the district court had supplemental jurisdiction,the district court should have applied california law rather than federal common law,and that under california law albingia would have avoided the per kilogram liability limitation.
jurisdiction 
eva air properly removed the case from state to federal court,because a ny civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under treaties or laws of the united states shall be removable no party filed a motion to remand upon removal.the complaint was drawn claiming a right to recover under a treaty and federal statute the federal aspect was central to the claim and was not insubstantial or all albingia knew,the chips were stolen while aboard eva air.therefore,jurisdiction at the time of removal existed regardless of whether the warsaw convention ultimately turned out to supply a basis for recovery 
there is also no serious question that in its summary judgment order,the district court first determined that the warsaw convention did not apply and then determined the state law limitations issue in favor of schenker.we held in corporation burlington air express,that where the loss to the goods occurs outside the airport,the warsaw convention does not apply the convention applies to transportation by air but not everything leading up to transportation by air.
thus by the time the district court entered judgment in the case at bar,the federal question that justified removal had disappeared.the claim under the warsaw convention disappeared once the district court presumed and the parties stipulated that the bricks had been substituted for the chips in schenker south san francisco warehouse 
albingia argues that once the district court correctly so decided,that should have been the end of the case in federal court.but instead of dismissing the state law claims or remanding them to state court,the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over them.albingia contends that there was no supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.as stated,supra,albingia did not raise this issue until after the district court had ruled against it on its state law claims.
the supplemental jurisdiction statute provides that in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.in this case,the district court had a basis of original jurisdiction because of the federal question raised by albingia warsaw convention claim.further,the state law claims plainly form part of the same case or controversy as the federal claim.just like the warsaw convention claim,the state claims are four different theories for getting reimbursed for the that albingia paid siemens for the stolen chips.the removal was without question proper at the time it was accomplished,because of the warsaw convention claim,so the district court plainly had supplemental jurisdiction at that time over the state law claims 
the district court,in a single ruling on cross motions for summary judgment,held that because the chips were stolen in schenker warehouse,the warsaw convention did not apply,and the contractual limitation to per kilogram was valid under federal common law.albingia argues that upon deciding that the warsaw convention did not apply,the district court lost jurisdiction to decide that the contractual limitation applied.that contention is incorrect.where removal was proper,but the federal question claim is defeated on the merits,the district court nevertheless may in its discretion retain supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims the supreme court held in bell hood that when a complaint states a federal claim,j urisdiction,therefore,is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which the petitioners could actually recover,and i f the court does later exercise its jurisdiction to determine that the allegations in the complaint do not state a ground for relief,then dismissal of the case would be on the merits,not for want of jurisdiction.in the case at bar,the federal claim was dismissed on the merits rather than for lack of jurisdiction,because it turned out that the chips were stolen at schenker warehouse.jurisdictio
