luigino,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to robert peterson and ibp,on luigino claims of breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation,corporate usurpation,misappropriation of trade secrets,and breach of confidentiality agreement.we affirm.
luigino is a minnesota corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of frozen food entrees under the brand names yu sing and michelina.at all times relevant to this litigation,ibp was a publicly held company headquartered in south dakota with approximately billion in annual sales and direct or indirect subsidiaries.in may,ibp acquired specialty brands,sbi,a manufacturer of frozen mexican foods,when it acquired sbi parent company,foodbrands america,foodbrands.for more than two years prior to its acquisition by ibp,sbi sold frozen mexican food through convenience stores,warehouse clubs,and grocery stores under four different brand names butcher boy,posada,little juan,and marquez.patrick,the president of sbi,began the process of consolidating these brands shortly after he became president of sbi in.presented this idea to the foodbrands directors in september,and by early had hired several people to assist with the launch of the new brand.
in,jeno paulucci,founder and chairman of the board of luigino,contemplated selling luigino.on february,ibp and luigino entered into a confidentiality agreement so that ibp could examine luigino and decide whether to purchase the company.paulucci rejected ibp highest offer during the summer of.in september,sbi director of marketing,robert berry,began the market research that would lead to the launch of the consolidated josé olé brand.through copies of ibp annual report and by sampling sbi frozen mexican foods,paulucci and other luigino employees knew of ibp offerings in the frozen food market.in a december,letter,paulucci invited peterson to sit on the luigino board of directors,suggesting he could keep an eagle eye on this business.peterson agreed to sit on the board and completed a questionnaire at luigino request for purposes of luigino january bond offering.in response to one question,peterson stated that he sat on the board of ibp,that ibp and its subsidiaries manufacture food products,and that none of ibp products directly competed with luigino products.peterson attended luigino board meetings on april,july,and november.several luigino employees and directors who knew of ibp ownership of sbi and of sbi frozen mexican food business also attended these meetings.
on february,sbi submitted a capital expenditure request to peterson and the ibp board of directors.peterson attended no luigino board meetings after he received this request.sbi launch of josé olé was announced in april and the products began appearing in stores in june.by this time,the luigino howlin coyote line had been in several markets for several months.the josé olé line included items,of which were products that sbi had previously offered under another brand name.the five new items were items sold in bowls.sbi conducted market tests on the bowl products beginning in february.in june,stouffer launched a line of frozen mexican food products under its ortega brand.anticipating great difficulty competing with two extensively marketed lines,luigino suspended work on the howlin coyote line on june.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.toghiyany amerigas propane,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.viking supply national cart,cir.
the district court held that luigino failed to assert facts sufficient to support a finding of a causal link between any of the defendants alleged improprieties and luigino alleged damages.luigino bears the burden of demonstrating causation on each claim.nguyen control data,affirming judgment as a matter of law on negligence,misrepresentation,contract,and fiduciary obligation claims for lack of evidence of causation.a mere possibility of causation is not enough.id.at see also klimstra granstrom,cir finding lack of causation on both contract and negligence claims and citing nguyen.we agree with the district court that each claim fails for lack of causation because luigino failed to present evidence sufficient to support an inference that ibp used luigino confidential information to its advantage or to luigino detriment.
as a preliminary matter,luigino alleged that ibp obtained luigino confidential information,either through peterson attendance at board meetings or during ibp failed negotiations to purchase luigino.this information included luigino research and development information,luigino financial information,income statements and documents reflecting volume and sales margins,details pertaining to the launch of howlin coyote,luigino top ten customers by volume,the offering circular,a second offering circular pertaining to snack items,and ebitda earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation and amortization projections for luigino through.we agree with the district court that the first three items are merely general categories of information,insufficiently specific to qualify as trade secrets.see controlled motion.although these general categories of information are not actionable under luigino misappropriation claim,we consider this confidential information under luigino breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims.
in support of its causation argument,ibp relies principally on the timing of ibp launch of josé olé and the similarity between some of the josé olé food items and those offered by luigino under the howlin coyote brand.luigino directs us to the following record evidence prior to ibp introduction of josé olé in,no ibp or sbi products had been sold in the frozen entree section of grocery stores prior to the launch of josé olé,sbi products were handheld products,only a small number of which were sold in grocery stores in ibp was exposed to confidential information about luigino michelina and yu sing lines of frozen entrees in july peterson was exposed to trade secret information at a luigino board meeting regarding the development of luigino howlin coyote brand of frozen entrees in october,sbi submitted to the ibp board a request for appropriation to d evelop and launch a new frozen mexican food brand into the retail and warehouse club channels one reason ibp declined to purchase luigino in was its view that michelina was not in a growth category josé olé and howlin coyote included similar products luigino frozen food industry expert testimony that,based on the similarities between the two product lines,ibp probably used manufacturing,retail trade and consumer information to develop the josé olé line.
luigino has thus identified several categories of confidential information and evidence that luigino was exposed to the information.except for citing similarities between the two product lines,however,luigino failed to allege how such information was used in the launch of josé olé and did not point out any circumstantial evidence supporting such an inference.luigino industry expert asserted a theory that ibp knowledge that luigino thought it was possible to succeed in the frozen mexican food market gave ibp confidence that it could be done,resulting in ibp decision to enter the market.luigino does not seem to place much reliance on this theory on appeal,however,and in any case the theory does not provide a causal connection between ibp possession of confidential information and harm to luigino.rather,it merely establishes a temporal relationship between ibp knowledge that luigino thought it could succeed in the frozen mexican entree market and ibp overcoming its own concerns about whether to risk entering that market.
we are left with the similarities between the howlin coyote and josé olé product lines,which luigino claims are so striking that under no stretch of the imagination could they be the result of coincidence.ibp josé olé line includes a chicken fajita bowl product,a meal containing grilled chic
