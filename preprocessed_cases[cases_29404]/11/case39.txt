this case arises out of a contract dispute between plaintiff appellant carter of new bedford,carter,a retail clothing and footwear business with two stores in massachusetts,and defendant appellee nike,nike.in an attempt to stop nike from terminating the parties business relationship,carter filed suit in massachusetts state court,bringing a host of contractual claims as well as a claim under.laws ch,and chapter.nike removed the suit to federal court and then moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.according to nike,its invoices the agreement included a forum selection clause that regulated the relationship between it and carter and required the latter to bring any claim in oregon,not massachusetts.the district court agreed with nike and dismissed carter claims.we now affirm that decision.
background 
carter has sold nike footwear for approximately years.over that period,nike products have accounted for a substantial portion of carter revenue.in march,nike notified carter that it was terminating the parties business relationship.carter theorizes that nike did so as part of a new marketing strategy that favors large national retailers over small businesses.in an attempt to forestall nike termination,carter sued nike in bristol superior court alleging that nike breached its agreement with carter breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing violated.laws ch,enacting the uniform commercial code in massachusetts,which provides a default reasonable time requirement for terminating agreements of successive performance with indefinite duration and violated chapter,which broadly prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade.
carter recognized in its complaint that the parties business relationship was at least partially defined by nike invoices and appended a copy of one of these invoices,entitled terms and conditions of sale,to said complaint.the document defines itself as the agreement and establishes that e ach order,together with these terms and conditions and,if applicable customer credit application and account agreement,may be referred to collectively as the agreement.carter pleaded always hav ing performed its obligations under such agreement.while the agreement includes a clause that states that it contains the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and supersedes prior and contemporaneous oral and written agreements,commitments and understandings,carter complaint did not explain whether there are any unwritten portions prior,contemporaneous,or of the parties understandings or how exactly nike breached those.carter did claim,however,that the business relationship was governed by various instructional materials and guidelines on product advertising,as well as other customs and procedures that reflect the expectations and arrangements between nike and carter in conducting their business together.in addition to that,carter asserted that it had become a de facto franchise of nike.therefore,carter argued that terminating the relationship was a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and that such conduct was in violation of massachusetts law.
once removed to federal court,nike moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.according to nike,a forum selection clause in the agreement required carter to file its claims in oregon carter opposed the motion,arguing that the agreement was unconscionable and an unenforceable contract of adhesion.in support of that assertion,carter claimed that it did not have the opportunity to bargain,and that the agreement unfairly constrained carter possibilities while allowing nike to litigate in the forum of its choosing.carter also argued that nike had changed the invoice to include the forum selection clause only three years prior to termination,and without notifying carter.as proof,carter attempted to introduce a copy of the nike invoice as an exhibit to its memorandum in opposition to nike motion to dismiss.nike moved to strike that exhibit,arguing that district courts are required to confine their b inquiry to the complaint and the exhibits attached thereto.carter never objected to nike motion to strike the exhibits,so the district court struck the invoices.
the district court dismissed carter complaint.it noted that carter had never alleged that the invoice agreement was unconscionable in its complaint.in fact,carter admitted that the parties business relationship was partially governed by the agreement and attached the invoice in the first instance.the district court further noted that while carter alleged that the business relationship was also governed by the parties course of dealing,it never explained what terms such course of dealing created.the district court determined that carter did not meet its burden to show that the forum selection clause would deprive carter of its day in court.thus,it granted nike motion to dismiss.carter appeal ensued.

carter challenge to the procedural vehicle 
carter extensively argues in its brief on appeal that nike can not use a motion to dismiss under rule b to enforce the forum selection clause.carter brief relies principally on the supreme court recent decision in atlantic marine construction united states district court for the western district of texas.at oral argument,however,carter counsel expressed that carter no longer objects to the use of rule b by the district court.thus,we focus on the merits of the district court dismissal 
enforcement of forum selection and massachusetts public policy 
this court reviews the enforceability of forum selection clauses employing the bremen factors.huffington,llc,cir citing bremen zapata off shore,the burden of proof is on the party opposing the enforcement of the forum selection clause.claudio de león,at citing bremen,at explaining that the party arguing that a forum selection clause is inapplicable bear s a heavy burden of proof alteration in original.under bremen,we enforce the forum selection clause absent a strong showing that it should be set aside.bremen,at.a strong showing can exist where the clause is the product of fraud or overreaching enforcement is unreasonable and unjust its enforcement would render the proceedings gravely difficult and inconvenient to the point of practical impossibility or enforcement contravenes a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought,whether declared by statute or judicial decision.huffington,at internal quotation marks omitted.
only the second,third,and fourth factors are at issue in this appeal.related to the second factor,carter argues that nike inconspicuously inserted the forum selection clause in its invoices without bargain.as to the third factor,carter argues that it should not be required to finance a cross country legal battle against an international financial behemoth and that it,as well as other retailers,would face extreme hardship if forced to go to oregon.finally,with regards to the fourth factor,carter asserts that the forum selection clause enforcement contravenes both federal and massachusetts public policy.we now consider carter arguments.
the scope of the forum selection clause 
as a preliminary matter,carter attempts to narrow the scope of the forum selection clause in two respects.first,carter states that nike unilaterally included the forum selection clause in later invoices,and suggests that the forum selection clause should be limited to issues regarding the goods covered in each of these invoices.second,carter argues that its chapter claim falls outside the scope of the forum selection clause.i t is the language of the forum selection clause itself that determines which claims fall within its scope.rivera centro médico de tur
