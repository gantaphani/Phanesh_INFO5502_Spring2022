evergreen solar,and eagle metal distributors,collectively,the appellants appeal the final decision of the united states court of international trade sustaining the final countervailing duty rate set by the department of commerce commerce in an investigation of aluminum extrusions imported from the people republic of china.maclean fogg united states,d.int l trade maclean fogg iv.we have jurisdiction under a.because the court of international trade did not interpret the relevant statute correctly,we reverse.
when commerce conducts a countervailing duty investigation of particular merchandise in a market involving a large number of exporters and producers,the countervailing duty statute authorizes it to select a sample of exporters and producers for individual investigation.the countervailing duty statute provides in for the calculation of an countervailing duty rate which applies to exporters or producers who are not individually investigated.exporters or producers who are initially selected by commerce are called mandatory respondents.mandatory respondents who cooperate with commerce investigation are given countervailing duty rates particular to their individual circumstances.mandatory respondents who fail to cooperate to the best of their ability are given rates determined under b using adverse facts available afa.exporters or producers who are not initially selected for investigation and who wish to participate may supply the necessary information to commerce to calculate individual countervailing duty rates for them.such exporters or producers are called voluntary respondents.are those exporters or producers not examined as initial selectees or as voluntary respondents.
the general rule for calculation of the countervailing duty rate specifies that the rate will be an amount equal to the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated,excluding any zero and de minimis countervailable subsidy rates,and any rates determined entirely under section of this title.c a i.there is an exception to the general rule for calculation of the rate.the exception comes into play i f the countervailable subsidy rates established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis rates,or are determined entirely under section.c a ii.when the exception is applicable,the statute permits commerce to use any reasonable method to establish an rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated.id.
this case arose from a countervailing duty investigation of aluminum extrusions from the people republic of china,pursuant to a petition filed by appellee aluminum extrusions fair trade committee.there are three categories of exporters or producers in this case.first,the three selected mandatory respondents who refused to cooperate and who consequently were awarded rates entirely under.second,the two voluntary respondents,who after individual investigation were awarded individual rates that reflected their own particular circumstances.and third,the,some of whom are the appellants,who challenge the legality of the rate commerce established in this case.
to establish the rate,commerce first discarded the afa rate assigned to the three mandatory so,because the all others rate statute mandates exclusion of rates determined entirely under.next,commerce excluded the individual rates assigned to the voluntary respondents,relying on d,which expressly requires exclusion of countervailable subsidy rates for voluntary respondents from the calculation of the rate.having excluded the voluntary respondents countervailing duty rates,commerce had nothing left with which it could calculate the rate under the general rule,c a i.commerce thus turned to the process of us ing any reasonable method to establish an rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated under the exception rule.c a ii.commerce decided to impose the rate,the afa rate assigned to the noncooperating mandatory respondents,on as a reasonable method.
four domestic importers and one exporter of extruded aluminum challenged commerce action in the court of international trade.the plaintiffs argued that was plain on its face in requiring commerce to use countervailing duty rates for voluntary respondents in calculating the rate,and that commerce regulation to the contrary was unlawful.the plaintiffs also challenged the rate as resulting from an unreasonable method.
the court of international trade concluded that is ambiguous on the question of whether countervailing duty rates assigned to voluntary respondents should be included in the calculation of the rate,and that commerce regulation is reasonable and thus enforceable.maclean fogg united states,d.int l trade maclean fogg i.the court of international trade however deemed the method that produced the unnecessarily punitive and therefore unreasonable,and remanded the case to commerce to recalculate the rate.id.at.on reconsideration,the court of international trade reiterated its conclusion that the relevant statute is ambiguous and that the regulation is valid.maclean fogg united states,d.int l trade maclean fogg ii.
after further rounds of litigation at the court of international trade,commerce arrived at a reasonable method for establishing the rate,settling on a rate of.maclean fogg united states,d.int l trade maclean fogg iii maclean fogg iv,d at.the rate of,sustained by the court of international trade,was obtained by subtracting the contributions of subsidy programs specific to the voluntary respondents from the rate previously given to the mandatory respondents based on all subsidy programs.
appellants challenge the court of international trade conclusions in maclean fogg i and ii,arguing that the countervailing duty statute is clear on its face in providing that the rates of any exporter or producer who is individually investigated must be included in the calculation of the rate under the general rule.they point out that the voluntary respondents were individually investigated,and indeed received rates particular to their individual circumstances.because the statute unambiguously provides for inclusion of voluntary respondents rates in the calculation of the rate,appellants maintain that there is no room for regulatory interpretation of the statute and that d therefore can not lawfully take away what the statute gives inclusion of voluntary rates in calculating the rate.
appellants also attack the court of international trade conclusions in maclean fogg iii and iv about the methodology used to arrive at the rate.they maintain that the statute does not permit direct application of the adverse inference rate as the rate and also that the rate imposed was not reasonable under the particular circumstances of this case.
we agree with appellants that the statute unambiguously requires that the rates of any individually investigated exporter or producer be included in the calculation of the rate under the general rule.we hold that d is invalid and reverse the judgment of the court of international trade,remanding for a proper determination of the rate under the general rule.we do not reach the question as to whether the methodology used by commerce to determine the rate was reasonable under the exception rule.
the central question on appeal is whether is ambiguous on the issue of whether voluntary respondent rates are to be included in the calculation of the rate under the general rule.in chevron analysis terms,congress spoke directly to this question,and as explained below its intent is clear.chevron,natural res.def.council.
states,in relevant part 
the rate shall be an amount equal to the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated,excluding any zero and de minimis countervailable subsidy rates,and any rates determined entirely under section of this title 
if the countervailable subsidy rates established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis rates,or are determined entirely under section of this title,the administering authority may use any reasonable method to establish an rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated 
the court of international trade held that the statute is ambiguous in maclean fogg first,it looked to the fact that c a i recites that the rate be an amount equal to the weighted average countervailable subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated without use of the word all to modify exporters and producers individually investigated.maclean fogg i,d at.second,it reasoned that the statute lacked a clear specif ication as to which particular subset of respondents commerce is to rely upon when setting the rate because there is no definition of the term individually investigated within the statute.id.finally,the court of international trade identified within,which provides that the individual rates determined for mandatory respondents shall be used to determine the rate under section c,a suggest ion that congress intended for commerce to,in some reasonable way,use rates from mandatory respondents when calculating the rate under section.id.
the court of international trade revisited the perceived ambiguity of individually investigated in maclean fogg ii.appellants pointed to the consistent use of investigate within the statement of administrative action accompanying the uruguay round agreements act statement of administrative action in reference to voluntary respondents to show that exporters and producers individually investigated include the voluntary respondents.the court of international trade acknowledged the appellants argument,but upheld its earlier conclusion.in its words,it does not follow that a neutral verb such as investigate always includes voluntary respondents in its scope.maclean fogg ii,d at.
commerce argued to the court of international trade that its regulation is reasonable.first,relying on the view that the statute is ambiguous on whether to count the countervailing duty rates of voluntary respondents when calculating the rate,commerce postulated that voluntary respondents and mandatory respondents should be viewed as proceeding on parallel tracks within the same countervailing duty investigation.cooperating mandatory respondents would be investigated and given particular rates that would be factored into an rate under the terms of.voluntary respondents would likewise be investigated and given individual rates,but in a parallel proceeding in which their rates would be excluded from the calculation.because commerce saw the statute as ambiguous on whether voluntary respondent rates are included in calculating the rate,it considered itself free in effect to conduct parallel proceedings for voluntary respondents.such made sense,according to commerce,because otherwise there was a risk that the rates of the voluntary respondents would reduce the rate that would prevail if only the rates of mandatory respondents were considered.commerce predicted,without any actual evidence,that voluntary respondents would be motivated to seek individual rates only when they had some expectation that their individual rates would be less than the rates that commerce would determine for mandatory respondents.commerce justification for its rejection was deemed reasonable by the court of international trade,which noted the court obligation to uphold commerce interpretation even if the court does not believe it to be the best statutory interpretation.maclean fogg i,d at.
with regard to the treatment of voluntary respondents,congress spoke directly in,which states in relevant part 
a treatment of voluntary responses in countervailing or antidumping duty investigations and reviews 
in any investigation in which the administering authority has,under section e a of this title,limited the number of exporters or producers examined the administering authority shall establish an individual countervailable subsidy rate for any exporter or producer not initially selected for individual examination under such sections who submits to the administering authority the information requested from exporters or producers selected for examination,if 
such information is so submitted by the date specified for exporters and producers that were initially selected for examination and 
the number of exporters or producers who have submitted such information is not so large that individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation.
the statute is clear that voluntary respondents are exporters or producers subject to individual examination.the rates calculated for them are individual countervailable subsidy rate s.within the countervailing duty statute,investigation examination and investigated examined are used interchangeably.
for example,e,which provides commerce with the authority for determining the countervailable subsidy rates by sampling,states that commerce may limit its examination where there is a large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review.emphases added.the statement of administrative action,by statute the authoritative expression by the united states in any judicial proceeding in which a question arises concerning such interpretation or application of the countervailing duty statute,d,also mixes and.see,doc,vol,at,reprinted in,in cases where commerce has limited its examination to selected exporters and producers,it nevertheless will calculate an individual dumping margin for any exporter or producer not selected for examination that provides the necessary information on a timely basis and in the form required.although commerce will not discourage voluntary responses and will endeavor to investigate all firms that voluntarily provide timely responses in the form required,in certain cases where the number of exporters or producers is particularly high,commerce may decline to analyze voluntary responses because it would be unduly burdensome and would preclude the completion of timely investigations or reviews.emphases added.
indeed,describes the limited number of mandatory respondents as having been examined during the investigation.the language of c b i i lends further support to the statutory construction here.it states that commerce shall determine an estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate for each exporter and producer individually investigated,and an estimated rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated c b i i.the two voluntary respondents in this case were individually investigated and received their individual countervailable subsidy rates accordingly.because a recites that the rates of voluntary respondents are individual countervailable subsidy rate s,the voluntary respondents must be understood to be exporter s and producer s individually investigated.
beyond examining the meaning of words,it is also instructive to consider the statutory conflict that would result if exporters and producers individually investigated were construed not to include the voluntary respondents.on one hand,c b i provides that commerce shall determine an estimated rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated.emphasis added.on the other hand,recites that commerce shall establish an individual countervailable subsidy rate for any exporter or producer not initially selected for individual examination who submits the information requested from exporters or producers selected for examination,for the voluntary respondents.emphasis added.the construction adopted by the court of international trade would mean that commerce shall impose on the voluntary respondents both the individual countervailable subsidy rate under and the rate under c b i.that is an impossible result.the court of international trade accidentally created a conflict in the statute where none exists.
were there need for more,as a matter of the plain meaning of words,there is no ambiguity in the word individually or in the word investigated.in the context of the countervailing duty statute,there is no possible doubt that a voluntary respondent who receives his individual rate has undergone individual investigation.
in maclean fogg i,the court of international trade found an ambiguity on the basis that the general rule for calculating the rate did not explicitly state that the rates of all exporters and producers individually investigated be included.d at.this reasoning lacks support because the general rule itself specifies its own exclusions any zero and de minimis margins,and any margins determined entirely on the basis of the facts available.c a i.the existence of exclusions means that congress intended all weighted average countervailable subsidy rates established for exporters and producers individually investigated be factored into the calculation unless the conditions for exclusion are met.
for the same reason,the court of international trade erred in stating that the statute does not clearly specify which particular subset of respondents commerce is to rely upon when setting the rate.maclean fogg i,d at.by setting forth exclusions,congress must be understood to intend that the rates of all individually investigated respondents be relied upon unless the rates fall within one of the exclusions.
we also conclude that ambiguity can not be found in the specific method for calculating the rate under simply because e provides that the rates calculated for mandatory respondents shall be used to determine the rate under section c of this title.section c itself limits e by excluding from the rate calculation any mandatory respondent rate that is zero,de minimis or determined using afa,which demonstrates that the specific rate calculation statute governs the determination of the rate.the fact that some rates determined for mandatory respondents shall be used in calculating the rate does not suggest that rates determined for individually investigated voluntary respondents must be excluded from the calculation of the rate.
the court of international trade in maclean fogg ii did consider the use of the word investigate in the statement of administrative action to refer to the voluntary respondents,but regarded it as a neutral verb which does not always include voluntary respondents in its scope.d at.investigate,by itself alone,may be neutral,but the disputed term,exporters and producers individually investigated,is not.given that repeatedly refers to exporters and producers individually investigated and exporters and producers not individually investigated,the language exporters and producers individually investigated must be understood to be a term of art.that the statement of administrative action would refer to a specific group of respondents with the word investigate is therefore of critical importance to understanding whether exporters and producers individually investigated encompasses such respondents.
we thus conclude that the court of international trade erred in holding that the statute is ambiguous on the question of whether the countervailing duty rates other than zero or de minimis of voluntary respondents must be included in the general rule for calculation of the rate.because the statute is clear that such voluntary respondent rates must be included in the general rate calculation,commerce regulatory interpretation to the exact contrary is invalid.commerce rationale for its regulation is therefore irrelevant and can not serve to create ambiguity where none exists.
the legislative history confirms that voluntary respondents are individually investigated.as the house report explains,

section b of amends section c of the act to establish rules for calculating the rate and the subsidy rate.
reasons for change 
the change is necessary to conform law to the agreement.
at.see also statement of administrative action,doc.at,reprinted in at recognizing the impracticality of examining all producers and exporters in all cases,article of the antidumping agreement permits the use of an all others rate to be applied to noninvestigated firms s ection c a to the act codified as c b provides that the all others rate will be equal to the weighted average of individual dumping margins calculated for those exporters and producers that are individually investigated,exclusive of any zero and de minimis margins,and any margins determined entirely on the basis of the facts available.
the legislative history confirms that those who are individually investigated receive an individual countervailable subsidy rate and those who are not individually investigated receive an rate.a recites that voluntary respondents receive an individual countervailable subsidy rate.consequently,they are individually investigated within the meaning of c a.there is no room for an alternative understanding.
it is further instructive to consider the history of the countervailing duty statute,because,as the statement of administrative action provides,the voluntary respondent provision,generally codifies existing practice.doc.at,reprinted in at.
prior to the amendments to the tariff act in,an rate did not exist.instead,a duty rate,equal to the amount of the net subsidy determined or estimated to exist,shall presumptively apply to all merchandise of such class or kind exported from the country investigated.a amended.even with this presumption,however,differing countervailing duties may be provided when the administering authority determines there is a significant differential between companies receiving subsidy benefits.id.unlike the statute as it is today,the countervailing statute did not state how a duty rate is to be determined or estimated to exist or how individual rates are to be tabulated to ascertain a significant differential.see ipsco,united states.
however,t he regulations require commerce to determine,to the extent practicable,if a producer received a significantly different net subsidy,by comparing the net subsidy received by the producer with the net subsidy calculated on a basis.kajaria iron castings united states,applying the law as it was prior to the amendments citing d.accordingly,the regulations set forth the c alculation of individual rates.d.if the secretary decides that an individual producer or exporter received a significantly different net subsidy,the secretary will state an individual estimated net subsidy for that person.d.
the regulations also set forth a mechanism for producers and exporters to apply for exemption to the presumptive rate.a any producer or exporter which desires exclusion from a countervailing duty order must submit to the secretary an irrevocable written request for exclusion.the secretary will investigate requests for exclusion to the extent practicable in each investigation.id.if investigated,these producers and exporters will get an individual rate,calculated in accordance with paragraph d of the aforementioned,which will be either the net subsidy calculated on a countrywide basis or the individual rate calculated for that person.e.
the producers and exporters whose requests for exclusion from the presumptive rate are investigat ed and who receive an individual rate are the forerunners of the voluntary respondents.to the extent that the countervailing duty statute codifies this existing practice,it also codifies that voluntary respondents are individually investigated within the meaning of the statute.
in addition,in the pre regime,rates calculated for producers and exporters investigated and assigned individual rates were factored into calculation of the rate.for example,in kajaria iron castings,producers who received the rate challenged the method of calculating that rate.commerce had,pursuant to its regulations,determined that three producers had received a significantly different net subsidy from the rate commerce had calculated based on information obtained from all the companies investigated.at.the significantly different net subsidies were,and compared to the subsidy rate of.id.the challengers argued that the higher net subsidy rates established for the individual companies should have been excluded from the calculation of the rate.we rejected that challenge,kajaria iron castings,at,relying on our previous decision in ipsco.in ipsco,in calculating the rate,commerce excluded the canadian producers who received no countervailable subsidy zero rate countervailing duty or de minimis subsidies from the rate calculation.we sustained the challenge to commerce methodology,holding that the rates of all companies,including those receiving no or de minimis subsidies must be included in the average net subsidy rate.at.
the law and regulations as they were before thus contemplated that commerce would assign individual countervailing duty rates to individually investigated producers,and would include any such rates in the calculation of the rate.
accordingly,exporters and producers individually investigated in the context of c a must be read to encompass the voluntary respondents.on the current facts,the precondition for invoking the exception provision,that the countervailable subsidy rates established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis rates,or are determined entirely under section of this title,has not been met.c a ii.we reverse the decision of the court of international trade and remand for determination of the rate under the general rule,c a i.
reversed and remanded 
i disagree with the majority that c a i ii section unambiguously requires that the voluntary respondent rates be included in the rate calculation.because i find the statute ambiguous and commerce interpretation reasonable,i would affirm the court of international trade decision affirming a final countervailing duty rate of in this investigation.i therefore respectfully dissent.
background 
a complete statement of the background of this case is essential to understanding the issues involved on appeal.the present appeal concerns a countervailing duty investigation on imports of aluminum extrusions from china initiated by commerce on april.aluminum extrusions from the people republic of china.dep t of commerce.the petition that triggered the investigation identified as potential respondents chinese exporters and producers of aluminum extrusions.due to limited agency resources,commerce decided to limit the investigation to the three largest companies based on export volume the mandatory respondents.
the investigation initially focused on subsidy programs alleged in the petition.commerce issued a questionnaire to the mandatory respondents regarding these programs,but none of the mandatory respondents submitted a response.two other chinese companies identified in the petition,however,requested voluntary respondent status and submitted questionnaire responses.the government of china also submitted a questionnaire response.
commerce published its preliminary results on september.aluminum extrusions from the people republic of china,at dep t of commerce.because the mandatory respondents failed to cooperate in the investigation by declining to respond to the questionnaire,commerce calculated their preliminary countervailing duty rate using adverse facts available afa.pursuant to b,commerce may use an adverse inference in selecting among facts derived from the petition,the record,or any previous investigation.commerce explained that it typically relies on the rates calculated for cooperating respondents when calculating an afa rate.because in this case there were no cooperating mandatory respondents,commerce used the highest minimis rate calculated for the same or similar subsidy program in another china countervailing duty proceeding,in accordance with its established practice.where no minimis subsidy rates calculated for the same or similar program existed,commerce applied the highest calculated subsidy rate for any program otherwise listed that could conceivably be used by the companies.id.at.following this procedure,commerce arrived at a preliminary countervailing duty rate for the mandatory respondents.id.at.for the two voluntary respondents,commerce calculated rates of and based on their separate,data.id.
for the exporters and producers not designated as mandatory or voluntary respondents the respondents,commerce calculated a preliminary rate equal to the preliminary afa rate for the mandatory respondents.as the basis for this methodology,commerce relied on d,which provides that countervailing duty rates calculated for voluntary respondents should be excluded from the rate calculation.commerce acknowledged that,in prior investigations,it had calculated the rate by averaging the afa rates of the,mandatory respondents with the rate calculated for voluntary respondents.but commerce explained that,upon further examination,it found that approach was not appropriate in this case because the potential for voluntary respondents net subsidy rates to distort or manipulate the rate is too great.id.at.
after receiving case briefs and rebuttal comments from interested parties,including appellants,commerce issued a final determination calculating a final afa rate of for the mandatory respondents.aluminum extrusions from the people republic of china.dep t of commerce.commerce included in the investigation and its calculation of the final afa rate additional subsidy programs identified by petitioners during the course of the investigation.commerce also increased the rate for some programs.commerce revised the rate for the two voluntary respondents to and.
commerce continued to apply the afa rate which had increased to to the respondents.in a memorandum responding to the comments submitted by interested parties,commerce noted that d mandates exclusion of the voluntary respondent rates from the rate calculation.quoting comments accompanying the promulgation of this rule,commerce explained that the tariff act was silent regarding whether voluntary respondent rates should be included,and that commerce had therefore looked at the world trade organization wto antidumping agreement for guidance 
article of the anti dumping agreement provides that the duties applied to exporters or producers not included in the examination,may not exceed the margin for the selected exporters or producers.this implies that those exporters or producers not selected are not considered to be included in the examination.therefore,the better interpretation of section c or c of the act is that producers who are not selected by the department,voluntary respondents are not considered to have been examined,investigated,so that their margins should not contribute to the rate.in effect,the department conducts parallel proceedings for voluntary respondents.
joint appendix at quoting antidumping duties countervailing duties,at dep t of commerce may.commerce also explained that excluding voluntary respondent rates from the rate serves the obvious purpose of preventing distortion or outright manipulation of the rate because exporters or producers most likely to submit voluntary responses are those with reason to believe that they will obtain a lower margin by volunteering than by being subject to the rate.at quoting.at.
appellants and other importers and chinese producers filed suit in the court of international trade alleging that section unambiguously requires that the voluntary respondent rates be included in the rate calculation.the court of international trade disagreed,finding that the statute was ambiguous and that commerce interpretation excluding voluntary respondent rates was reasonable.maclean fogg united states,d.int l trade.the court nevertheless found that commerce had not established that excluding the voluntary res
