the instant appeals involve the contract and tort claims of an orthopedic surgeon who had an agreement with an orthopedic products company regarding the creation and sale of a medical device that bore the surgeon name.after paying royalties to the surgeon for more than a decade,the company renounced its obligations to pay anything further for the medical device even though it still sold a version of the product bearing the surgeon name.
orthopedic systems,osi and allen schlein,entered into an agreement in which osi acknowledged receipt of a medical device called the schlein shoulder positioner,and obligated itself to pay schlein royalties on sales of the resulting product.after osi stopped paying the royalties,schlein threatened to sue for breach of contract,prompting osi to file an action seeking a declaration of rights under the agreement.schlein for breach of contract,conversion,and commercial misappropriation of his name among other things.the jury found in favor of schlein on his contract claim and awarded in damages.the jury also awarded schlein in statutory damages for his misappropriation claim,and found that osi earned in profits attributable to the use of schlein name.the trial court,however,did not include the profits in the judgment.
schlein appeals,challenging the exclusion of the profits from the judgment.osi appeals the judgment,the denial of its judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and the postjudgment award of attorney fees.
we modify the judgment and otherwise affirm.
factual and procedural background 
osi product development 
osi was formed by robert moore,an experienced chiropractor,and his family in to develop,manufacture and sell orthopedic devices.prior to forming osi,moore had invented several products to help his patients.in early,moore hired steven lamb to head up the engineering department at osi.
moore attended orthopedic trade shows and conferences,where he encouraged physicians to bring ideas and concepts to osi in exchange for a royalty,telling them if you have a problem,let me know,i will then try to develop a product or way of solving that problem to make your life easier and to do a better job for the patient and then we will pay you a royalty of five percent on that.
moore worked closely with the physicians who brought their problems to osi,discussing possible improvements and modifications.the product would then evolve from that interface or interaction.
in lieu of legal formalities,moore offered the physicians a handshake agreement,whereby osi would pay a royalty to the physician for as long as osi sold the product.nothing other than moore word was required he said osi would pay and it did.moreover,there was never any requirement that a physician participate in the modification of a product in order to continue to receive the royalties.
osi initial collaboration with schlein 
schlein,an experienced orthopedic surgeon and inventor,met moore in the early at a medical conference.schlein and moore started working together shortly thereafter on a cast padding product that schlein was already manufacturing through subcontractors.moore agreed to distribute the product without any formal written agreement.
in or,schlein brought osi another product called the dynafix,which was a plastic external fixator for wrist fractures.moore agreed to manufacture the product and sell it,and agreed to pay schlein a royalty for as long as osi continued to sell the product.there was no formal written agreement between osi and schlein when osi initially agreed to sell the dynafix.
genesis of the schlein shoulder positioner 
in the mid,as arthroscopic surgery became a popular alternative to traditional surgery,schlein found it difficult to perform arthroscopic shoulder surgery with a patient lying on the operating table then,in or about,schlein attended a meeting on arthroscopic surgery where another surgeon described performing shoulder surgery with a beach chair that elevated the patient into a seated position.
schlein thought the beach chair concept was a good one,and he went home and started to think about how he could create something like it.although schlein thought he could make one,he was having trouble creating a locking or gatch mechanism to support the backrest 
when schlein told moore about his difficulty in crafting a mechanism to lock the device,moore sent him one of osi radiolucent tilt tables.schlein took the table apart and extracted the gatch mechanism.he bought some plastic and went home to make the back piece of the positioner.schlein enlisted the help of a plastic prototype maker,who helped make the head piece.schlein then combined all of the parts and tested the device in surgery.
schlein then sent the prototype of the positioner to moore.after multiple discussions regarding the device,schlein and moore decided to work together on manufacturing it for sale through osi.schlein and moore also discussed the development of a disposable pad set or patient care kit to be used with the shoulder positioner that would provide cushioning for the patients.
starting in or about,schlein and moore worked collaboratively on the shoulder positioner.schlein understood that his agreement with osi would be the same as it was with the dynafix osi would manufacture and sell the positioner and schlein would receive a royalty for as long as osi sold the product.moore had the same understanding about the arrangement.indeed,in a handwritten note dated december,moore noted that for the shoulder positioner schlein gets royalty disp pad set.schlein was not required to work on any subsequent modifications of the product in order to receive the agreed upon royalties.
sale of osi 
in or about march,moore and his family began to contemplate the sale of osi.to that end,moore engaged the services of a company that would assist in finding a purchaser for osi.once the prospective purchasers were found,moore was required to document all of osi royalty agreements.as such,moore drafted a form agreement to document the verbal handshake agreements he had with the physicians who sold products through osi.
in early,schlein received a agreement from moore regarding the schlein shoulder positioner agreement,which provided as follows 
osi of hayward,ca has received a product improvement idea from allen schlein.it is called the schlein shoulder positioner.
osi will manufacture or have manufactured the device and will market the device.
in return,osi will pay a royalty of of the list price less discounts to the adam david schlein trust fund.
it is understood that a disposable pad set is being investigated.should osi determine that a disposable set is desirable and markets the pad set,a royalty on the list price less discounts will apply.
the royalties will be paid the day of the month following the calendar quarter.
schlein,or his representatives shall have any reasonable opportunity to audit the sales of the device at his expense,should he so desire.
the device has been assigned a product number for sales and accounting purposes.the pad set will also be assigned a product number.
schlein signed the agreement on january,and returned it to moore schlein had nothing to do with the drafting of the agreement.schlein had no recollection of having any conversations with moore either before or after he signed the written agreement.
in,moore and his family sold osi to marc abramowitz and allan epstein.a portion of the sales agreement prepared by moore and osi expressly disclosed that as to the shoulder positioner,as well as other products,r oyalties are payable for as long as osi sells the product.
subsequent sale of osi 
in,abramowitz and epstein sold percent of osi stock to mizuho ikakogyo.in the stock purchase agreement,osi represented that p ursuant to a letter agreement dated january,allen schlein licenses osi the schlein shoulder positioner.
following subsequent litigation and mizuho eventual acquisition of the remaining percent of osi stock,abramowitz and epstein agreed to refrain from making any competing products and from undermining the value of osi.the schlein shoulder positioner was expressly identified as one of the products in the noncompetition agreement due to its economic value to osi.
osi modifications to the schlein shoulder positioner 
until,osi marketed and sold the shoulder positioner under the name schlein shoulder positioner or schlein shoulder positioner ssp.in marketing brochures and in the instruction guide,osi stated the manufacturer thanks allen schlein,for his assistance in the development of the osi schlein shoulder positioner ssp.
in,osi modified parts of the backrest and added a chin strap that had been designed and patented by lamb.osi also changed the name of the device to the schlein ii universal shoulder positioner and changed the product number to.
osi also modified the text of its brochures to state osi thanks allen schlein,for his assistance in the development of the osi schlein ii universal shoulder positioner.osi continued to pay schlein for the sales of the schlein ii universal shoulder positioner and the patient care kits.
in,osi changed the name of the device to the schlein ultra and changed the product number from to.in the marketing brochures and user guide,osi thanked schlein for his assistance in the development of the osi schlein ultra shoulder positioner.
osi did not inform schlein that it was changing the product number.osi continued to pay schlein royalties for the sales of the schlein ultra shoulder positioner and the patient care kits.
osi trademarks schlein name 
in,osi applied to trademark the name schlein ultra to the shoulder positioner.the application was approved by lamb,who at that time was osi chief operating officer.lamb also signed a declaration attesting to osi alleged ownership of the name schlein ultra.
lamb filed the trademark application because competitors were using schlein name on competing shoulder positioners patient care kits.however,prior to filing the application,neither lamb nor anyone else at osi asked schlein for his authority to trademark his name to the positioner.
the trademark registration was issued to osi on september.
osi stops paying royalties to schlein 
on january,lamb sent a letter to schlein,remitting his royalty check for the fourth quarter of and advising him as follows as you know,osi has paid you a royalty on the shoulder positioner according to the agreement signed by bob moore since january.in light of the fact that there is no patent protection on the product and this product is in a very competitive market,it has become economically unfeasible to continue this program.it is our standard practice to pay royalties on unpatented products at a rate of for no more than ten years.in this case,we are nearing the end of the year and we have generously paid you a royalty.in light of our long relationship,i am proposing that we continue this royalty at of the sales for more calendar quarters,through june,after which the royalty will be discontinued.
prior to sending the letter to schlein,lamb did not do anything to determine whether it was economically feasible to continue the royalty program.indeed,osi records indicated steady sales of the positioner and pad sets from through.
osi continues to sell shoulder positioner using schlein name 
although osi tendered the last royalty payment to schlein in january,at least until july,osi continued to market and sell the shoulder positioner and pad sets using schlein name.
during the period january,to july,osi total revenues on sales of the shoulder positioner and pad sets were schlein economic expert opined that the profit osi earned on the forgoing sales was,using a percent profit margin this amount did not include royalties that were due to schlein for that period,which was equal to percent of or.
osi eventually changed the name of the shoulder positioner to the ultra shoulder p ositioning d evice.in all respects,there was no difference between the schlein ultra shoulder positioner and the ultra shoulder positioning device.
pretrial proceedings 
osi filed a complaint against schlein in may,seeking declaratory relief,reformation of contract,and unjust enrichment.osi alleged that it had no further obligation to schlein under the agreement,assuming it ever had one.to the extent the agreement was ever enforceable,it was terminable at the will of either party and that osi had effectively terminated the agreement.osi also claimed the agreement was void or voidable for lack of consideration.
schlein answered the complaint and filed a against osi,seeking damages for breach of contract and conversion.schlein also asserted a claim for declaratory relief,seeking a determination that the agreement required osi to continue paying royalties for the sales of the shoulder positioner and pad sets.his amended alleged that osi had violated civil code section,by using his name in conjunction with its marketing and sales of the shoulder positioner and pad set.in support of this claim,schlein alleged that he gave osi permission to use his name to market the schlein shoulder positioner on the condition that osi satisfied its obligations under the agreement.
a jury trial commenced on march.throughout the trial,evidence was presented regarding the difference between damages and profits.also,during argument,counsel for both parties discussed the difference between an award of damages and an award of profits.
the court instructed the jury as to the differences between contract and tort damages.the court also instructed the jury with caci,explaining that schlein could not be awarded duplicative damages schlein has made claims against osi for breach of contract,conversion and misappropriation i f you decide,by way of example,that schlein is entitled to recover royalties on one of his claims,he can not recover those same royalties on another claim but may,if you so decide,recover damages on other claims where permitted.
the jury was also instructed with caci regarding damages under section,and advised that the specific items of damages claimed by schlein were harm to reputation and loss of standing in the community and the commercial value of his name.caci further instructed the jury that in addition,schlein may recover any profits that osi received from the use of schlein name.in establishing the amount of profits,the jury was instructed to d etermine the gross,or total,revenue that osi received from the use of schlein name to d etermine the expenses that osi had in obtaining the gross revenue and to d educt osi expenses from the gross revenue.the jury was also instructed that schlein was required to prove the amount of gross revenue and osi was required to prove the amount of the expenses.
special verdict and judgment 
the jury returned a special verdict finding,among other things,that 
schlein and osi entered into a contract that required osi to pay royalties schlein for the sale of any shoulder positioning device and disposable pad set 
osi failed to pay royalties to schlein 
schlein was harmed by the failure to pay royalties 
schlein damages were 
osi used schlein name on its merchandise or to advertise or sell its products or services during the period from january,to july,
schlein consent to use his name was dependent on osi payment of royalties to schlein 
osi use of schlein name was directly connected to osi commercial purpose 
schlein was harmed by osi wrongful use of his name 
osi conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm to schlein 
schlein suffered in the amount of and 
osi earned in profits that were attributable to the use of schlein name during the period from january,to july.
in the final section of the special verdict form entitled total amount awarded,the jury was asked the following question if you awarded damages to schlein in any of the above claims,state the total amount of damages awarded for all causes of action.in the space provided for the total,the jury inserted the amount of.
in the second phase of the trial regarding the parties declaratory relief claims,the court found that osi has a continuing duty to pay royalties for the schlein shoulder positioner and related disposal pads for so long as osi continue d to use schlein name market a substantially similar product utilizing his contributions.in so ruling,the trial court stated that t he same evidence which resulted in a jury verdict on the breach of contract claims leads to an equivalent conclusion on the declaratory relief claims.
the trial court further found that schlein was not entitled to the profit identified by the jury in the special verdict,and entered a judgment awarding schlein.
motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
osi moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the misappropriation claim,arguing among other things that this should have never gone to the jury,as it was an improper effort to t ortify a straightforward breach of contract claim,and that the verdict was not supported by substantial evidence because there was no evidence regarding a lack of consent.
schlein also moved for partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict solely as to the issue of the exclusion of the in profits.
the trial court denied both motions.
motion for attorney fees and costs 
the trial court awarded schlein costs and also found him to be the prevailing party under section and awarded him in attorney fees.
ii.contentions 
schlein contends in his appeal that the trial court erred in excluding the profits earned by osi that the jury found were attributable to osi use of his name.
osi contends in its appeal that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to interpret the agreement the jury finding that osi breached the agreement is inconsistent with the plain language of the contract and contrary to the extrinsic evidence establishing that osi was required to pay royalties to schlein only on sales of the schlein shoulder positioner in the equitable phase of trial,the court erroneously declared the rights and obligations under the agreement as requiring osi to pay royalties on the sales of products other than the schlein shoulder positioner the evidence does not support the jury finding that osi violated section by misappropriating schlein name the jury finding that osi both breached the agreement and misappropriated schlein name is not supported by law and the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to schlein,and to the extent the award was proper,the amount was unreasonable.
iii.discussion 
schlein appeal no.
in his appeal,schlein argues that the trial court erroneously interpreted the special verdict by excluding the profits that were clearly awarded by the jury.we agree.
background 
the jury returned a special verdict finding,among other things,in favor of schlein on his breach of contract and misappropriation claims.the special verdict contained five sections,which posed various questions.in response to question four in section one of the special verdict,regarding schlein breach of contract claims,the jury found that schlein was damaged in the amount.in section four of the special verdict,pertaining to schlein misappropriation claims under section,the jury was asked in question six what,if any,actual damages did schlein suffer as a result of the wrongful use of his name insert the greater of the actual damages suffered by schlein or the jury inserted in the space provided.then,in question seven,the jury was asked what profit did osi earn,if any,attributable to the use of schlein name during the period from january,to july,in the space provided,the jury wrote.
the final section of the special verdict form was called section five total amount awarded,and it provided as follows if you awarded damages to schlein in any of the above claims,state the total amount of damages awarded for all causes action.the jury wrote in the space provided.
osi argued that the jury insertion of in section five of the special verdict meant that schlein was not entitled to the profits.according to osi,the jury simply inserted in response to question seven of section four the section pertaining to schlein misappropriation claims because there was no instruction suggesting that they could skip the question.alternately,osi argued that the jury declined to award the profits in the total amount awarded because it already had taken the profits into consideration in calculating the damages.
schlein countered that the heading of the final section of the special verdict form total amount awarded was unfortunate,and that the sum denoted in response should be read as referring only to the damages awarded and not as excluding the in profits.
in finding that schlein was not entitled to the profits identified by the jury in the special verdict,the trial court did not provide the basis for its reasoning.rather,it merely incorporated by reference osi brief regarding section,which the court found was more persuasive than the position advanced by schlein.
the trial court improperly interpreted the special verdict 
when no objection is made that a special verdict is ambiguous or incomplete before the jury is discharged,it falls to the trial judge to interpret the verdict from its language considered in connection with the pleadings,evidence and instructions.citations.where the trial judge does not interpret the verdict or interprets it erroneously,an appellate court will interpret the verdict if it is possible to give a correct interpretation.citations.if the verdict is hopelessly ambiguous,a reversal is required,although retrial may be limited to the issue of damages.citations.woodcock fontana scaffolding equip.co.cal d.
however,a court reviewing a special verdict does not infer findings in favor of the prevailing party citation,and there is no presumption in favor of upholding a special verdict when the inconsistency is between two questions in a special verdict.zagami,james crone,th,see also city of san diego horton san diego holding,th,special verdict correctness must be analyzed as a matter of law.
taken as a whole and in light of the parties claims,the special verdict shows the jury found that osi breached the agreement and misappropriated schlein name.consistent with these findings,the jury found that schlein was damaged by the breach in the amount of and that he was harmed by the misappropriation in the amount of.thus,it awarded damages to schlein in the amount of.regarding the amount of profits osi earned that were attributable to the use of schlein name,the jury found for schlein in the amount.
the record belies osi suggestions that the jury may have purposely failed to include the profits in the total amount awarded because it had taken the profits into consideration in calculating damages.in calculating the profit amount,schlein expert excluded the royalties osi should have paid to schlein under the contract for the period from january,to july,from osi gross revenues for that period and also took into consideration a percent profit margin,to arrive at a net figure of.
the jury awarded the exact figure calculated by schlein expert.where,as here,a jury verdict precisely matches an expert testimony,logic and common sense tells us that the jury accepted the expert analysis and calculations.bardis oates th,jury special verdict matched exhibit to the penny see also fassberg construction housing authority of city of los angeles th,jury award of precise amount stated by expert strong indication jury accepted expert testimony on that point foss.anthony industries d,fact that jury awarded exact amount testified by expert showed jury used same underlying assumptions as expert.
moreover,it is clear that had it been so inclined,the jury could have omitted a profits finding from the verdict.specifically,the jury was asked what profit did osi earn,if any,attributable to the use of schlein name italics added.the jury could have easily inserted a zero in the space provided.likewise,the jury could have simply left it blank,which we recognize would have raised another ambiguity problem fortunately we do not have to address that ambiguity or otherwise choose between inconsistent answers.this is not a case where the jury valued a skiploader at both and see zagami,james crone,supra,th at,or valued land at both and per acre see city of san diego horton san diego holding,supra,th at,or found a car was both negligently designed and had no design defect lambert general motors th.rather,the issue is whether schlein was entitled to the in profits earned by osi use of his name.the answer to this question requires a review of the applicable law.
california law has long recognized the right to profit from the commercial value of one identity as an aspect of the right of publicity.gionfriddo major league baseball cal.app th,see also stewart rolling stone llc th,downing abercrombie fitch cir,downing.what may have originated as a concern for the right to be left alone has become a tool to control the commercial use and,thus,protect the economic value of one name knb enterprises matthews th.there are two vehicles a plaintiff can use to protect this right a common law cause of action for commercial misappropriation and a section claim.downing,supra,at.to prove the common law cause of action,the plaintiff must establish the defendant use of the plaintiff identity the appropriation of plaintiff name or likeness to defendant advantage,commercially or otherwise lack of consent and resulting injury.citation.ibid.to prove the statutory remedy,a plaintiff must present evidence of all the elements of the common law cause of action and must also prove a knowing use by the defendant as well as a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial purpose.ibid.
section governs the statutory remedy.section,subdivision a section a provides in relevant part that in any action brought under this section,the person who violated the section shall be liable to the injured party or parties in an amount equal to the greater of seven hundred fifty dollars or the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the unauthorized use,and any profits from the unauthorized use that are attributable to the use and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.
schlein asserts that the phrase and any profits from the unauthorized use that are attributable to the use and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages applies both to the minimum statutory damages of or to actual damages.the interpretation of section a,and its phrase and any profits from the unauthorized use that are attributable to the use and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages,is a legal issue subject to our de novo review.arce kaiser foundation health plan,th.
in arguing that schlein was not entitled to the profits specified by the jury,osi claimed the statute should be interpreted to exclude any award of profit where actual damages are not awarded.according to osi,the section a phrase and any profits from the unauthorized use that are attributable to the use and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages should be applied only to the phrase regarding actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the unauthorized use,and not to the phrase regarding the award.
in construing section a,we turn first to the language of the statute,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citations.we must follow the statute plain meaning,if such appears,unless doing so would lead to absurd results the legislature could not have intended.citations.if our examination of the statutory language leaves doubt about its meaning,we may consult other evidence of the legislature intent,such as the history and background of the measure.citations.people birkett cal th.
osi position is essentially based on the last antecedent rule of statutory construction,which generally provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.white county of sacramento cal d.however,e vidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma.ibid.here,the phrase referencing profits is set off by a comma,suggesting that it applies both to the minimum statutory damages and to actual damages.
what is perhaps the most damaging to schlein position is that the qualifying phrase refers to profits that are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.a.the reference to profits in connection with the computation of actual damages lends some credence to osi interpretation of section a that profits are not applicable when the minimum statutory damages are awarded.although,grammatically speaking,such an interpretation would be plausible,we are not persuaded.the rules of grammar and canons of construction are but tools,guides to help courts determine likely legislative intent.citations.and that intent is critical.those who write statutes seek to solve human problems.fidelity to their aims requires us to approach an interpretive problem not as if it were a purely logical game,like a rubik cube,but as an effort to divine the human intent that underlies the statute.burris superior court cal th,costco wholesale workers comp.appeals bd.th.
the human problem to be solved by section a is the provision of a remedy to a person whose name,among other things,is misappropriated.that statute provides for damages statutory or actual,as well as profits.we recognize there is some ambiguity regarding whether the minimum measure of damages is plus profits or just.accordingly,we look to the legislative history for clarification.people birkett,supra,cal th at.
in miller collectors universe,th miller,the court traced the history of section in order to determine,inter alia,what the minimum statutory damages,the award set forth in subdivision a were meant to remedy id.at.according to miller,t he statute legislative history reveals section a was intended to fill a gap which exist ed in the common law tort of invasion of privacy as applied to noncelebrity plaintiffs whose names lacked commercial value on the open market.citation.unlike an entertainment or sports star,noncelebrity plaintiffs often could not prove damages under the common law therefore,section a as originally enacted in established a concrete remedy for the little man with a minimum payment,a simple,civil remedy for the injured individual.citation.miller,supra,th at,fn.omitted.thus,the miller court confirmed that section was enacted to provide a practical remedy for a noncelebrity plaintiff whose damages are difficult to prove miller,supra,at.
we can conceive no rational basis for the legislature to limit the as an alternative to all other damages,including profits.if someone profits from the unauthorized use of another name,it makes little sense to preclude the injured party from recouping those profits because he or she is entitled to statutory damages as opposed to actual damages.similar reasoning appears to be reflected in the civil jury instructions for damages under section,which provides if name of plaintiff has not proved the above damages,or has proved an amount of damages less than,then you must award.in addition,name of plaintiff may recover any profits that name of defendant received from the use of name of plaintiff name that have not already been taken into account in computing the above damages.caci,italics omitted.
an interpretation of section a that limits the minimum measure of damages to as an alternative to all other damages,including profits,would be contrary to the spirit of the statute and the right to control the commercial use,and thus protect the economic value of one name.gionfriddo major league baseball,supra,th at see also stewart rolling stone llc,supra,th at knb enterprises matthews,supra,th at.section a was enacted to provide a practical remedy for a noncelebrity plaintiff whose damages are difficult to prove miller,supra,th at.the purpose of the statute is not served by preventing an injured plaintiff from recouping the profits attributable to the unauthorized use of his or her name where actual damages are not awarded.
we hold that under section a,an injured party may recover either the amount of damages specified in the statute or actual damages,whichever is greater,as well as profits from the unauthorized use.
given the above analysis,it clearly appears that the trial court interpretation of the special verdict is erroneous.we find no factual or legal support for excluding the in profits from the jury special verdict.whenever an appellate court may make a final determination of the rights of the parties from the record on appeal,it may,in order to avoid subjecting the parties to any further delay or expense,modify the judgment and affirm it,rather than remand for a new determination.citations.sagadin ripper d,see also code civ.the record is sufficiently definite in this case to do so.
accordingly,we modify the judgment so that it accurately reflects the jury special verdict,namely its finding that schlein was entitled to as a result of osi unauthorized use of his name,and affirm the judgment as so modified.
contract claims 
a.the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to interpret the agreement 
the agreement acknowledges that osi has received a product improvement idea from schlein called the schlein shoulder positioner.the agreement states that osi will manufacture and market the device,and in exchange osi will pay a percent royalty to schlein.
the agreement does not further define the term device or product improvement idea.the agreement also does not set forth a specific duration.rather,it provides only that the royalties will be paid the day of the month following the calendar quarter.
throughout this litigation,and its motion for directed verdict,osi argued that the agreement only required it to make royalty payments to schlein for the schlein shoulder positioner,and that it was not required to pay royalties for any subsequent generations of the positioner.the trial court,over osi objection,submitted that issue to the jury.the jury found in schlein favor,concluding that the agreement required osi to make continued royalty payments to schlein for the sale of any shoulder positioning device and disposable pad set.italics added.
osi contends the trial court erred in submitting that question of contract interpretation to the jury because the agreement was completely integrated,which required the court to decide the meaning of the terms as a matter of law.schlein,on the other hand,contends the issue was properly submitted to the jury because the agreement was not integrated as evidenced by the lack of an integration provision.schlein further asserts that the term product improvement idea was ambiguous and required extrinsic evidence to interpret the meaning of this term.schlein argues that the trial court finding regarding the lack of integration is consistent with osi own pleadings,which claimed that the agreement is incomplete in many respects,and that the agreement does not discuss the impact of material modifications made to the schlein shoulder positioner on royalty rights 
the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting.citations.when a contract is reduced to writing,the parties intention is determined from the writing alone,if possible.citation.founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th,founding members.nevertheless,an inflexible rule that would limit the determination of the meaning of a written instrument to its four corners merely because it seems to the court to be clear and unambiguous,would either deny the relevance of the intention of the parties or presuppose a degree of verbal precision and stability our language has not attained.pacific gas thomas drayage.cal d.
as codified,the parol evidence rule provides that the terms of a final,written agreement may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement.code civ,subd.a see,pacific gas thomas drayage,supra,cal d at masterson sine cal d,see generally,witkin,cal.evidence ed.documentary evidence.as the california supreme court explained over years ago,w hen the parties to a written contract have agreed to it as an integration a complete and final embodiment of the terms of an agreement parol evidence can not be used to add to or vary its terms.citations.masterson sine,supra,cal d at.
the crucial issue in determining whether there has been an integration is whether the parties intended their writing to serve as the exclusive embodiment of their agreement.the instrument itself may help to resolve that issue.masterson sine,supra,cal d at see also,founding members,supra,th at.the existence of an integration clause is indicative of that intent.see founding members,supra,th at listing several factors,including existence of integration clause and circumstances at contract formation haggard kimberly quality care,th,discussing contract two integration clauses and circumstances at contract formation.this type of clause has been held conclusive on the issue of integration,so that parol evidence to show that the parties did not intend the writing to constitute the sole agreement will be excluded.citations.witkin,cal.evidence,supra,documentary evidence,italics omitted.
but even where an integration clause manifests the parties intent that the contract is a final and complete expression of their agreement,parol evidence nevertheless may be admissible as an aid to interpreting the contract.haggard kimberly quality care,supra,th at.put another way,evidence offered to prove a meaning to which the contract is susceptible does not contravene the merger clause.citations.witkin,cal.evidence,supra,documentary evidence.
in sum,parol evidence is not admissible to contradict a contract terms,but it may be admitted to interpret those provisions in a proper case,even where the parties have included an integration clause.pacific gas thomas drayage,supra,cal d at haggard kimberly quality care,supra,th at.
here,nothing on the face of the agreement suggests that it is a complete or even partial embodiment of the expression of the parties agreement regarding the payment of royalties.indeed,there is no integration clause or other language manifesting the parties intent that the agreement is the final and complete expression of the royalty agreement.also,given the fact that prior to his endeavors to sell osi,moore had run the company as a family business with handshake agreements and little more than his word as guaranteeing royalty payments the parties understanding of the duration of the agreement and osi obligation to pay royalties thereunder might naturally have been made as a separate agreement.while schlein testified that he did not have any conversations with moore prior to the drafting and signing of the agreement,this does not diminish the fact that the parties might naturally have made a separate royalty agreement.
accordingly,we conclude the agreement was not integrated either completely or partially.even assuming arguendo that the agreement was a fully or partially integrated contract,parol evidence nevertheless would have been admissible as an aid in interpreting the contract.haggard kimberly quality care,inc,supra,th at.of course,that extrinsic evidence may be admissible to interpret an ambiguous contract provision does not mean resolution of that ambiguity is necessarily a jury question.absent a conflict in the evidence,the interpretation of the contract remains a matter of law.citations.wolf walt disney pictures television th.
although osi maintains that interpretation of the agreement did not depend on the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence,the record belies this claim.both moore and schlein were of the understanding that osi would continue to pay royalties for as long as osi sold the product.however,lamb was of the opinion that the agreement was limited solely to the schlein shoulder positioner bearing product number.despite this limited view of the agreement,osi continued to pay royalties to schlein regarding the sales of subsequent generations of the device,which had different names and product numbers.given the conflict in the evidence regarding the product covered by the agreement,as well as the duration of the agreement,the trial court did not err in submitting these matters to jury.
b.the agreement required continued royalty payments to schlein 
we review the jury determination of whether a breach occurred under the deferential substantial evidence standard.roddenberry roddenberry th,roddenberry.under the substantial evidence standard of review,we must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference,and resolving conflicts in support of the findings.citations.it is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence that is the province of the trier of fact.our authority begins and ends with a determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,in support of the judgment.asp properties group,fard,th,italics omitted.
for ease of reference,we again provide the terms of the agreement,which are as follows 
osi of hayward,ca has received a product improvement idea from allen schlein.it is called the schlein shoulder positioner.
osi will manufacture or have manufactured the device and will market the device.
in return,osi will pay a royalty of of the list price less discounts to the adam david schlein trust fund.
it is understood that a disposable pad set is being investigated.should osi determine that a disposable set is desirable and markets the pad set,a royalty on the list price less discounts will apply.
the royalties will be paid the day of the month following the calendar quarter.
schlein,or his representatives shall have any reasonable opportunity to audit the sales of the device at his expense,should he so desire.
the device has been assigned a product number for sales and accounting purposes.the pad set will also be assigned a product number.
relying on roddenberry,supra,th,osi argues the plain language of the agreement limits its obligations to pay royalties to schlein only for the schlein shoulder positioner.osi reliance is misplaced.in roddenberry,the issue was whether a marital settlement agreement entitled the plaintiff to her former husband postdivorce profits on the television series star trek.id.at.the appellate court concluded that the trial court properly ignored or rejected the plaintiff trial testimony regarding her interpretation of the parties intent when they entered into the marital settlement agreement,because it was contrary to the express language of the agreement and inconsistent with other evidence.id.at.
the roddenberry court nevertheless reversed the judgment to the extent it awarded the plaintiff profits for star trek and because the award was not based on evidence of contractual intent,but rather on the plaintiff theory that star trek and were continuations of star trek.roddenberry,supra,th at.in rejecting the continuations theory,the court explained that w hether or not star trek and are continuations of star trek is irrelevant.in order to be relevant,the continuation question would have to be the second step of a analysis.the foundational step would be proof of contractual intent that the plaintiff receive profits from postdivorce continuations of star trek.the second step would be proof that star trek and are in fact continuations of star trek.id.at.the court noted that while the record might arguably contain evidence of step,it did not contain evidence of step.id.at.there,rather than pointing to evidence showing an agreement that the plaintiff would receive profits from postdivorce continuations,so that the plaintiff would share in her former husband postdivorce efforts,the plaintiff merely argued that she was entitled to these uncontemplated profits because the parties agreement did not expressly exclude them.id.at,fn.the appellate court was not persuaded,explaining that a failure to exclude the uncontemplated is not the equivalent of substantial evidence supporting inclusion.ibid.
the instant case is readily distinguishable.unlike the plaintiff in roddenberry,schlein met the foundational requirement of establishing contractual intent.specifically,schlein presented evidence that prior to the agreement,he and moore had performed under a handshake agreement that obligated osi to pay royalties to schlein for as long as osi sold the product.he also presented evidence that he and moore shared the same understanding with respect to the rights and obligations under the agreement.moreover,unlike in roddenberry,there was evidence that product modifications were contemplated by the parties from the very beginning.however,no evidence suggested that schlein was required to participate in all the subsequent modifications in order to receive the royalty payments.indeed,moore expressly stated that such participation was not required,and the only prerequisite for continued royalty payments was continued sales by osi.
consistent with the contractual intent of the parties,osi continued to make royalty payments to schlein even after subsequent product modifications,name changes and product number reassignments.despite this continued performance under the contract,osi insists that schlein was not entitled to continued royalties because the agreement pertained only to the schlein shoulder positioner,and that in any event schlein did not participate in the subsequent product modifications.yet,osi continued to thank schlein for his assistance in the development of the subsequent generations.
these anomalies can not be reconciled on the theory that the parties agreed to limit the agreement to the schlein shoulder positioner.there is no evidence the parties agreed or even discussed such a limited royalty agreement.
in sum,considering the relevant contract language,together with the properly admitted extrinsic evidence that helps explain it,we conclude that the agreement was intended to cover any shoulder positioning device and disposable pad set.the jury finding of breach was thus supported by substantial evidence.
misappropriation claims 
osi raises a argument purportedly establishing reversible error with respect to the judgment in favor schlein on his misappropriation claims under section.first,osi asserts that the trial court erred in granting schlein motion to amend his amended.second,osi argues that the evidence does not support the jury finding that it violated section.and,finally,osi claims that the jury finding that osi both breached the agreement and misappropriated schlein name is not supported by law.we address each claim in turn.
no abuse of discretion in granting leave to amend at trial 
osi contends the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed an amendment to schlein amended to conform to proof after the close of evidence at trial.before addressing the merits of this argument,we begin with an overview of the relevant procedural history.
i background 
in june,schlein filed his original,claiming,among other things,that osi breached the agreement by failing to pay him royalties on sale of the schlein shoulder positioner and its successors.in or around august,osi agreed to a stipulation allowing schlein to amend his to add a common law misappropriation claim and a section claim.for reasons not disclosed in the record,the stipulation and amendment were not actually filed until march.
in any event,even before the amended was filed,osi moved to strike the soon to be added misappropriation claims.the motion was heard on march,two weeks before trial commenced.at the hearing,schlein counsel provided the basis for schlein misappropriation claims.specifically,counsel explained that osi was liable for misappropriation because the company unlawfully registered the schlein shoulder positioner trademark.counsel also explained that osi was liable for misappropriation because it had utilized schlein name to sell the shoulder positioner for a period of time in without ever paying the requisite royalties.osi counsel understood that schlein misappropriation claim was based on the assertion that osi did not have his consent to continue to use his name after the termination of the underlying agreement.
the trial court denied osi motion to strike,and later that same day osi executed the stipulation regarding the amendment,and schlein filed his amended.
once the parties had rested,counsel for schlein moved to amend the misappropriation claims to conform to proof.counsel argued that given how the evidence has unfolded it was clear that osi utilized his name knowing that they owed him a royalty.the proposed amendments had the effect of asserting that osi was liable for common law and statutory misappropriation to the extent there was a finding that the agreement was invalid or unenforceable or where osi was utilizing schlein name and not paying him a royalty.
osi objected to the proposed amendment based on prejudice,claiming that the additional language improperly converted what was essentially a contract case into a tort case.for this reason,osi argued that had this language been in the complaint from the beginning the misappropriation claims would have been subject to a demurrer.osi counsel further argued that the prejudice is essentially another level of potential jury confusion with respect to the fact that tort claims and contract claims are and should be different and accomplish different results.
the trial court permitted the amendment,finding it was appropriate based on the proof and that it was ultimately up to the jury to determine whether schlein prevailed on his misappropriation claims.
ii analysis 
we begin with the proposition that leave to amend a complaint is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court,and t he exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse.branick downey savings loan cal th,garcia roberts th.the amendment of pleadings to conform to proof at trial is specifically governed by code of civil procedure section,which provides no variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof is to be deemed material,unless it has actually misled the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits.whenever it appears that a party has been so misled,the court may order the pleading to be amended upon such terms as may be just.
in the instant case,osi does not specifically claim to have been misled.a central issue at trial was that osi sold various versions of the shoulder positioner device bearing schlein name without paying the requisite royalties.moreover,at the hearing on osi motion to strike schlein misappropriation claims,counsel for schlein explained that osi was liable for misappropriation because it had utilized schlein name to sell the shoulder positioner for a period of time in without ever paying the requisite royalties.osi counsel also acknowledged an express understanding that the misappropriation claim was based on the assertion that osi did not have his consent to continue to use his name after the termination of the underlying agreement.thus,the subsequent amendment was not exactly a surprise.under these circumstances,the court might reasonably have concluded that the variation between the allegations of the,and the evidence that osi sold the device using schlein name without paying him royalties,was not a material variance.
even if the court did view the evidence as representing a material variance from the allegations of the complaint,it still retained the discretion to order the pleading to be amended upon such terms that may be just.code civ.osi fails to explain how the decision to allow the amendment was unjust.
to be sure,osi does claim the decision to allow the amendment was prejudicial,but it merely asserts that the amendment allowed schlein to tortif y his contract claim.according to osi,this amendment was without legal support and the case might have settled early on.beyond this conclusory allegation,osi does not suggest how it might have prepared for trial differently if schlein had formally amended his earlier in the litigation.we can not presume it is prejudicial to a defendant and thus,unjust every time a trial court allows an unpleaded factual allegation to be added into a plaintiff case at trial.the determination of prejudice must be based on the specific circumstances of the case.the cases cited by osi in support of its position are distinguishable.
for example,unlike osi generic claim of prejudice in this case,the defendants in garcia roberts,supra,th at page,detailed exactly how the plaintiff altered claim had interfered with their ability to defend the case as defendants point out,a number of significant factual issues that specifically related to the agreement were not pursued in plaintiff deposition or in other discovery,since it became unnecessary to do so in light of what plaintiff asserted under oath at his deposition indeed,since plaintiff denied knowledge of the agreement,the pursuit of discovery from plaintiff on that subject could reasonably go no further.
similarly,the other cases cited by osi are inapposite.in emerald bay community golden eagle ins.th,following the end of trial,the plaintiff waited until three months after the court had issued its intended decision before seeking to amend the complaint.under these circumstances,there was no abuse of discretion in denying the posttrial motion to amend the complaint.compare id.at with earp nobmann d,overruled on another point in silberg anderson cal d,trial court erred in allowing amendment of after announcement of intended decision and filing of proposed findings of fact amendment also alleged facts entirely outside cause of action alleged in.
likewise,in rainer community memorial hosp.cal.app d,the plaintiff sought to amend a personal injury complaint at the outset of trial,attempting to add a theory of independent negligence in addition to the theory of respondeat superior.id.at.in affirming the trial court denial of the request,the appellate court explained that had the motion been timely made it could have been allowed almost as a matter of course even if it added a significant new dimension to the lawsuit.citation.id.at.however,given the timing of the request,prejudice was shown as the new issue would further complicate an already potentially complicated trial before a jury,and no discovery and preparation on the trial of these issues had been made by the defendants ibid.here,as previously noted,osi had ample notice both before and during trial of schlein claim that his name was used without his consent.
by reason of the foregoing,we conclude there is no basis for osi claim of prejudice.
sufficiency of the evidence 
osi also claims the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate either a lack of prior consent,or that schlein suffered any injury to the commercial value of his name.these assertions are unpersuasive as well.
california has provided a statutory remedy for commercial misappropriation under section,which provides,in relevant part,a ny person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner for purposes of advertising without such person prior consent shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person under section,a plaintiff must prove all the elements of the common law cause of action.in addition,the plaintiff must allege a knowing use by the defendant as well as a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial purpose.citation.stewart rolling stone llc,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
osi argues that properly interpreted section requires only a lack of prior consent,not merely a lack of continuing consent.osi purports to engage in statutory interpretation,but its analysis is perfunctory and conclusory,osi simply claims that based on the plain language of that statute and the legislative history,this court should not read section as requiring a lack of continuing consent.osi does not make a real effort at construing the challenged statutory language,but simply states that section could hardly be plainer,referring as it does to lack of prior consent,not lack of continuing consent.additionally,osi does not actually cite to or discuss the legislative history,but abstractly states n either the legislative history of section nor any other extrinsic aid supports rejection of the lack of prior consent interpretation,in favor of the lack of continuing consent interpretation.
in any case,even overlooking these obvious shortcomings,osi reasoning is clearly flawed,as it fails to consider the nature and scope of the consent given.in essence,osi argument amounts to the assertion that,by consenting to eat apples with dinner,one has also consented to eat oranges.however,t he fact that both are fruit does not make them indistinguishable.ainsworth century supply.in other words,osi defense must amount to more than showing that schlein had previously consented to the use of his name.that is not in dispute.whether schlein consent remained in effect after the nonpayment of royalties is.
although there is scant california authority on this issue,there is ample authority from other jurisdictions standing for the proposition that use beyond the scope of the consent granted constitutes tortious conduct.see leavy cooney d,use outside consent agreement constitutes tortious invasion of privacy see also facenda films,cir,use of plaintiff voice for advertising purposes where consent limited to documentary films constitutes infringement zim western pub.cir,use of author name outside use permitted in publishing contract is tortious,interpreting florida law john daly enterprises,llc hippo golf,d,use of professional golfer name and picture on web page after endorsement agreement ended is infringement ryan volpone stamp,d,plaintiff able to assert infringement claim against former licensee whose license plaintiff terminated for nonpayment of royalties whisper wear,morgan,model had valid misappropriation claim against manufacturer of breast pumps that used photographs of model in manner not authorized under voucher between model and photographer shields gross,defense to invasion of privacy no broader than consent granted welch v.christmas d,use after expiration of effective period of consent no less an invasion of privacy than is use without consent.
here,the fact that schlein consented to the use of his name in selling the device in exchange for a royalty did not constitute consent to the gratuitous use of his name in connection with future sales.thus,osi defense to liability under section can be no broader than the consent granted by schlein see,shields gross,supra,at,which the evidence established was implicitly tethered to the royalty payments.specifically,schlein testified that the consent to use his name was based on the payment of royalties.moore testified that he did not think that osi had the right to use schlein name without his permission.also,mark lane,of sales and marketing at osi,confirmed that he was told to remove schlein name from the product and all advertising because osi had stopped paying royalties to schlein.later,lane sent an to his staff and osi outside marketing firm directing them to remove schlein name from all products.
in sum,substantial evidence supported the jury finding that schlein consent to the use of his name was dependent on osi payment of royalties to schlein.
osi also claims that schlein presented no evidence of any injury to the commercial value of his name.citing to various cases,osi insists that the evidence regarding the amount of royalties it failed to pay schlein was irrelevant to whether he suffered an injury to the commercial value of his name.see knb enterprises matthews,supra,th at noting that has become a tool to control the commercial use and,thus,protect the economic value of one name miller,supra,th at discussing injury to commercial value of celebrity names solano playgirl,cir,measure of damages for misappropriation included economic value of use of name abdul jabbar general motors cir,celebrity injured economically if automobile advertisement using his former name would make it difficult to endorse other automobiles.
osi argues that it is hard to conceive how the nonpayment of royalties could have caused a loss to the economic value of schlein name.osi asserts that although its nonpayment of royalties would have decreased schlein revenue,it would not have decreased his name market value.
in its myopic view of the injury redressed by section a,osi overlooks the crucial fact that schlein was not a celebrity.it bears repeating that section a was enacted to fill a gap which existed ed in the common law tort of invasion of privacy as applied to noncelebrity plaintiffs whose names lacked commercial value on the open market.citation.miller,supra,th at.implicit in this reasoning is a recognition that a plaintiff is entitled to minimal damages even if actual damages are not proven.
returning to the instant case,the jury found that schlein was harmed by the unauthorized use of his name,and that he was entitled to recover the statutory minimum of,which it necessarily deemed was greater than the amount of actual damages suffered by schlein.this finding is supported by substantial evidence.
accordingly,we conclude the injury element was satisfied.
contract and tort claims 
osi argues that the law did not support the section misappropriation verdict because it did not violate any duty that was independent of its obligations under the agreement.osi acknowledges that the duty not to use another name without prior consent arises independently under tort law,but insists that any purported unauthorized use did not arise separately from the agreement.osi reasons that w ithout the agreement,osi would not have begun to use schlein name in the first place.as we shall explain,this assertion rests on faulty logic.
relying on a series of inapposite cases,osi claims that schlein was not entitled to recover for both breach of contract and misappropriation.in each of these cases,the alleged tort violation was based on the nonperformance under the contract.see aas superior court cal th,homeowners could not pursue negligence claims for alleged construction defects causing no separate damages cates construction,talbot partners cal th,no tortious breach of construction contract based on nonperformance under contract erlich menezes cal th,no emotional distress resulting from negligent breach of construction contract freeman mills,belcher oil cal th,no bad faith denial of employment contract where tort based on failure to perform under contract applied equipment litton saudi arabia,cal th,manufacturer not liable for conspiring to breach own contract hunter up right,cal th,fraudulent misrepresentations designed to induce employee to resign not separately actionable foley interactive data cal d,no tortious invasion of employment contract based on employer breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
here,the fatal flaw in osi reasoning is that it overlooks the fact that although the agreement initially provided osi the right to use schlein name,that consent was implicitly revoked when osi repudiated the agreement in january by failing to pay the requisite royalties.we would be in a different situation had osi removed schlein name from the product in january and simply sold it under another name.in that case,schlein would still be entitled to pursue his nonpayment of royalties claim,but there would be no basis for his misappropriation claim.in other words,it is the continued use of schlein name after osi stopped paying the agreed upon royalties the revocation of consent that constituted a violation of an independent legal duty.
although not cited by either party,we find leavy cooney,supra,d to be particularly instructive.there,the plaintiff,a public prosecutor,agreed with a film producer to be photographed and to act as a narrator without compensation in a film depicting a famous trial,provided that the film be shown only on television and not in theaters.id.at.the producer breached the agreement by contracting with a distributor for theatrical exhibition of the film.id.at.the jury awarded compensatory damages to the plaintiff based on his testimony that he suffered humiliation and embarrassment stemming from his fear that if the film would be shown in theaters,the public would think he was being compensated for his participation in the project,which would subject him to severe criticism.ibid.the defendants argued that they were not liable for such damages because any possible injury to the plaintiff feelings from the unauthorized use of the film was not in the minds of the plaintiff and the producer at the time they signed the agreement,and that no injury was shown as a proximate result of the breach of that agreement by the producer.id.at.
in affirming judgment in favor of the plaintiff
