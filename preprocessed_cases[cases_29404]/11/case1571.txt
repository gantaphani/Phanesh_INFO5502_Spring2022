this case requires us to interpret the phrase goods put up in sets for retail sale as used in general rule of interpretation b of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states.the court of international trade upheld a ruling of customs and border protection that spare laptop batteries that were offered for sale individually but were packaged with laptop computers for shipment were not put up in sets for retail sale with those computers.we affirm.
dell products lp manufactures and sells secondary batteries for use with laptop computers.a secondary battery provides an additional power source that allows extended operation of the computer without access to an external power supply.two batteries can not be used at the same time once the primary battery dies,it is removed and replaced with a secondary battery.
the secondary batteries at issue in this case were admitted separately from the laptop computers into dell foreign trade sub zone ftz in nashville,tennessee.at the time of their admission to dell ftz,the secondary batteries had foreign status,meaning that they had not been cleared by customs and would be appraised for tariff purposes at the time of their formal entry into the united states 
laptop computers were offered for sale by dell together with a primary battery,a power cord and adapter,and operational manuals.secondary batteries were offered for sale separately along with other optional accessories.if a particular customer chose to purchase a secondary battery at the time of purchasing a laptop computer,dell would package all of the items for that customer together and would then ship the package from the ftz to the buyer.a small box containing the laptop computer and the primary battery would be placed into a larger box containing the operational manuals and the computer cord and adapter.if the customer chose to purchase a secondary battery or any other optional accessories,those items would also be placed in the larger box for shipping to the customer.
dell proposed to classify secondary batteries that were packaged with laptop computers as portable digital automatic data processing adp machines,the ordinary classification for laptop computers.harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus subheading,codified at.customs disagreed and classified the secondary batteries as other storage batteries,htsus subheading.under that subheading,the secondary batteries were assigned a duty rate of percent.customs explained its classification decision in a formal ruling letter.customs,hrl.it determined that the secondary batteries were not put up in sets for retail sale with the laptop computers under general rule of interpretation b gri b and that the secondary batteries therefore should be classified separately from the laptop computers.
dell appealed the customs ruling to the court of international trade,arguing that the secondary batteries were put up in sets for retail sale with the laptop computers,or in the alternative,that the secondary batteries were functional units of the laptop computers and should be classified as adp machines.the court agreed with customs that the secondary batteries should not be classified as adp machines.the court interpreted gri b to require distinct articles to be offered together for retail sale or displayed or shown together for retail sale before they could be classified together for tariff purposes.the batteries at issue in this case,the court found,are not offered or displayed together for retail sale with the computer the computer is offered together with a power cord and primary battery,and the secondary batteries are offered individually.the court concluded that the batteries are simply one of many optional,complementary items that may be purchased at the same time as a notebook computer and therefore are not put up together with other components of the retail set,as the terms are used for tariff purposes.
the trial court further found that a customer could purchase one or more secondary batteries,along with other supplemental items,when simultaneously purchasing a notebook computer.dell would then package the additional optional items into a shipping box that already contained the notebook computer,a primary battery,and a power cord.under those circumstances,the court explained,even though the secondary batteries were packaged together with the notebook computers for transport to customers,the collection of items that included the secondary batteries was never put up by dell as a set prior to a potential retail sale.to interpret such a collection of items as a set for tariff purposes,the court noted,would be contrary to the language of gri b,which anticipates a set as a defined unit that is offered for sale to retail customers.because the secondary batteries had been offered for sale separately from the laptop computers,the court explained,a consumer customized order of individual,complementary items is not transformed into a gri b retail set upon entry merely by virtue of being ordered at the same time and subsequently packaged together in an ftz.in this case,the court concluded,the contents of a customized order are determined by an individual customer dell did not designate which merchandise constituted a set for retail sale.
the trial court also rejected dell argument that its secondary batteries were functional units of laptop computers under gri.in this appeal,dell challenges only the trial court gri b determination.
the general rules of interpretation govern the interpretation of htsus classifications.gri controls tariff classification when goods can be classified under two or more separate subheadings of the htsus.gri b states 
mixtures,composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components,and goods put up in sets for retail sale shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character,insofar as this criterion is applicable.
this court has not previously interpreted the phrase goods put up in sets for retail sale,nor had the court of international trade done so prior to the decision in this case.dell contends that the phrase encompass es goods that are packaged in a certain manner at the time those goods are entered into the commerce of the united states.the government agrees with the trial court that gri b sets are goods that are offered,displayed or shown together for retail sale.
each party cites to competing dictionary definitions of the term put up,which is used in the phrase goods put up in sets for retail sale.in that context,however,the most relevant definition is that of the phrase for retail sale.the term for sale is defined as offered to be sold made available to purchasers,random house webster unabridged dictionary ed,and is characterized as referring to the status of being purchasable,webster third new international dictionary.thus,the phrase goods put up in sets for retail sale most naturally refers to goods that are offered to customers as a set for purchase rather than to a collection of goods that are assembled into a set after the customer has purchased them.although under the uniform commercial code a sale does not occur until the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price,ucc,which may not occur until delivery,ucc,there is no indication that put up for sale means packaged for delivery to the customer.
dell argues that customs can not consider the manner in which its products were offered for sale because the only point in time relevant to tariff classification is the time of entry into the united states.in support of that argument,dell relies on united states citroen.that case concerned a set of pearls that were purchased in france and then imported into the united states.the buyer had viewed the pearls both loose and strung on a necklace,but the pearls entered the united states in loose form for delivery to her.once delivered,the pearls were combined with others and strung on a necklace.tariff provisions in effect at the time provided for different duty rates for pearls set or strung and pearls in their natural state.at.the supreme court concluded that t
