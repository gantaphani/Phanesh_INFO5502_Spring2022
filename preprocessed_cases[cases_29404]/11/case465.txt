in this appeal,we consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the city of norfolk on claims that the city sign ordinance violated the plaintiffs rights under the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the plaintiffs,a radio manufacturing and repair business and two of its managers,asserted that the sign ordinance unconstitutionally exempted certain displays from regulation,effectuated a prior restraint on speech,and was enforced selectively in a discriminatory manner by zoning officials.
our resolution of this appeal is guided by the supreme court recent decision in reed town of gilbert.applying the principles of content neutrality articulated in reed,we hold that the sign ordinance challenged in the plaintiffs complaint is a regulation that does not survive strict scrutiny.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment with respect to the plaintiffs first amendment challenge and remand that claim to the district court to award nominal damages to the plaintiffs and for consideration of other appropriate relief.however,we find no merit in the plaintiffs selective enforcement claim,and we affirm the court disposition of that claim.
because the city of norfolk amended the sign ordinance in october following the court decision in reed,we also conclude that the plaintiffs request for prospective relief based on the content restrictions in the prior ordinance is moot.on remand,the district court may consider whether the plaintiffs may bring a new claim challenging the constitutionality of the amended ordinance and seek any associated injunctive relief.
the city of norfolk the city adopted a zoning ordinance that included a chapter governing the placement and display of signs the former sign code see norfolk,code app.a.the city enacted the former sign code for several reasons,including to enhance and protect the physical appearance of all areas of the city,and to reduce the distractions,obstructions and hazards to pedestrian and auto traffic caused by the excessive number,size or height,inappropriate types of illumination,indiscriminate placement or unsafe construction of signs.id.
the former sign code applied to any sign within the city which is visible from any street,sidewalk or public or private common open space.id.however,as defined in the ordinance,the term sign did not encompass any flag or emblem of any nation,organization of nations,state,city,or any religious organization,or any works of art which in no way identify or specifically relate to a product or service.id.such exempted displays were not subject to regulation under the former sign code.
with respect to signs that were eligible for regulation,the former sign code generally required that individuals apply for a sign certificate verifying compliance with the code.id.upon the filing of such an application,the city was required to issue a sign certificate if the proposed sign complied with the provisions that applied in the zoning district where the sign was to be located.id.
in the i industrial zoning district in which plaintiff central radio company central radio property is located,the former sign code restricted the size of signs.id.the size restrictions varied depending on whether a sign was categorized as a temporary sign,which was permitted to be as large as square feet,a freestanding sign,which was permitted to be as large as square feet,or an other than freestanding sign,which was permitted to be as many square feet as the number of linear feet of building frontage facing a public street id.the city did not patrol its zoning districts for violations of size restrictions or other provisions of the former sign code,but did inspect displays in response to complaints made by members of the public.
the plaintiffs challenges to the city sign code relate to a protest of certain adverse action taken against central radio by the norfolk redevelopment and housing authority nrha.the nrha is a chartered political subdivision of virginia,and consists of an independent committee of seven members appointed by the norfolk city council.see ann.
in april,the nrha initiated condemnation proceedings against central radio and several other landowners,allegedly intending to take and transfer the various properties to old dominion university odu.central radio and the other landowners successfully opposed the taking in state court.although a trial court initially ruled in favor of the nrha,that ruling was reversed on appeal by the supreme court of virginia.pko ventures,llc norfolk redevelopment hous,holding that the nrha lacked the statutory authority to acquire property by eminent domain.accordingly,the condemnation proceeding against central radio was dismissed.norfolk redevelopment hous.auth.central radio,no,wl.
in march,while the appeal was pending in state court,central radio managers placed a square foot banner the banner on the side of central radio building facing hampton boulevard,a major,state highway.the banner depicted an american flag,central radio logo,a red circle with a slash across the words eminent domain abuse,and the following message in rows of capital letters years on this street years in norfolk workers threatened by eminent domain the plaintiffs intended that the banner be visible for several blocks along hampton boulevard and make a statement about central radio fight with the nrha,which would constitute a shout rather than a whisper.
an employee of odu complained about the banner to a city official,who notified the city zoning enforcement staff.the city official did not identify the source of the complaint to zoning officials.after investigating the matter,a zoning official informed central radio managers that the banner violated the applicable size restrictions set forth in the former sign code.at a later inspection,zoning officials noted that the plaintiffs had failed to bring the display into compliance with the former sign code,and ultimately issued central radio citations for displaying an oversized sign and for failing to obtain a sign certificate before installing the sign 
in may,the plaintiffs initiated a civil action to enjoin the city from enforcing the former sign code.the plaintiffs alleged that the former sign code was unconstitutional because it subjected their display to size and location restrictions,but exempted certain flag s or emblem s and works of art from any similar limitations.although they contended that the former sign code constituted a restriction subject to strict scrutiny,the plaintiffs argued in the alternative that the former sign code also failed to satisfy intermediate scrutiny.the plaintiffs further alleged that the former sign code provision requiring them to obtain a sign certificate before erecting a display effectuated an impermissible prior restraint on speech,and that the city selectively applied the former sign code to the plaintiffs display in a discriminatory manner.in addition to requesting declaratory relief and nominal damages,the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motions and,after discovery was completed,granted summary judgment in favor of the city.in doing so,the court concluded that the provisions in the former sign code exempting flags,emblems,and works of art were.applying intermediate scrutiny,the court held that the former sign code was a constitutional exercise of the city regulatory authority.further,the court held that the challenged sign ordinance exemptions were reasonably related to the city interests in promoting traffic safety and aesthetics,because such exempted displays are less likely to distract drivers than signs and are commonly designed to be aesthetically pleasing.in reaching this conclusion,the court also rejected the plaintiffs prior restraint and selective enforcement claims.after the court entered final judgment,the plaintiffs filed this appeal

following the parties supplemental briefing,the city filed a motion suggesting that certain of the plaintiffs requests for relief are now moot in light of the city decision in october to amend the former sign code to comply with reed.the current sign code the amended sign code no longer exempts certain flags,emblems,and works of art from regulation,but does specify that works of art and flags are examples of items which typically do not satisfy the code definition of sign.see norfolk,va,ordinance ex.a.the amended sign code also imposes a time limit on the city decision to issue or deny a sign certificate by deeming a request approved if the city has not acted within a prescribed period.id.b.the plaintiffs oppose the city request that portions of the appeal be dismissed as moot.
the parties main arguments on appeal concern whether the former sign code was a restriction on speech reviewed under intermediate scrutiny,or a restriction subject to strict scrutiny.as we explain below,we agree with the plaintiffs that,under reed,the former sign code was a restriction that can not withstand strict scrutiny.
we begin by considering the city contention that certain of the plaintiffs requests for relief are now moot because the amended sign code does not exclude flags,emblems,and works of art from the definition of sign.under the mootness doctrine,we do not have jurisdiction over a case if an actual controversy does not exist at the time of appeal.see brooks vassar,cir.as relevant here,w hen a legislature amends a statute,a case challenging the prior law can become moot even where of the statute at issue is within the power of the legislature,so long as reenactment does not appear probable.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the city appears to concede that the plaintiffs request for retrospective relief in the form of nominal damages,based on an alleged unconstitutional restriction on speech,is not moot.we agree.see covenant media of,llc city of charleston,cir holding that a plaintiff challenge to a ordinance was not moot,because the plaintiff sought nominal and compensatory damages.
we conclude,however,that the plaintiffs request for prospective injunctive relief is moot,because the challenged language of the former sign code exempting certain flags,emblems,and works of art from regulation is no longer in force.in light of the city submission that it amended the former sign code to comply with the court decision in reed,we are confident that there is little likelihood that the city will the prior version of the ordinance.am.legion post of durham,city of durham,cir.we therefore dismiss the portion of this appeal relating to the plaintiffs request for prospective relief on this claim.
we turn to consider whether the former sign code imposed a or a restriction on speech.in evaluating the content neutrality of a sign regulation restricting speech,we focus on the supreme court decision in reed town of gilbert.we recently observed that this decision conflicted with,and therefore abrogated,our circuit previous formulation for analyzing content neutrality,in which we had held that t he government purpose is the controlling consideration.cahaly larosa,cir quoting clatterbuck city of charlottesville,cir see,clatterbuck,at describing that we applied a pragmatic rather than formalistic approach to evaluating content neutrality under which a regulation is only if it distinguishes content with a censorial intent citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
as we explained in cahaly,the supreme court in reed rejected such an approach.instead,the court held that at the first step of the content neutrality analysis,the government justification or purpose in enacting a sign regulation is irrelevant.cahaly,at.accordingly,under the holding in reed,g overnment regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.reed.at.only when a regulation does not expressly draw distinctions based on a sign communicative content may we examine,at the second step of the reed analysis,whether the regulation can not be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,or was adopted by the government because of disagreement with the message the speech conveys.id.quoting ward rock against racism.
although we considered a sign ordinance with exemptions similar to those presented by this appeal in brown town of cary,cir,in that case we applied an analysis that is no longer valid due to the supreme court decision in reed.indeed,the panel in brown was bound by our earlier precedent,thereby moving directly to the second step of the reed analysis.see id.at determining that exemptions for public art and governmental or religious holiday decorations were reasonably related to government interests in traffic safety and aesthetics,justifying application of intermediate scrutiny.
now informed by the supreme court directives in reed,we begin our analysis by considering whether the city former sign code applie d to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.reed.at.based on reed,we hold that the city regulation was a restriction of speech.the former sign code exempted governmental or religious flags and emblems,but applied to private and secular flags and emblems.in addition,it exempted works of art that in no way identif ied or specifically relate d to a product or service,but it applied to art that referenced a product or service.on its face,the former sign code was because it applied or did not apply as a result of content,that is,the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.see also cahaly,at holding south carolina statute is regulation because it applies to calls with a consumer or political message but does not reach calls made for any other purpose solantic,llc city of neptune beach,cir applying the same test articulated in reed to a city sign code,and holding that an exemption applicable to flags and insignia only of a government,religious,charitable,fraternal,or other organization was plainly content based because some types of signs are extensively regulated while others are exempt from regulation based on the nature of the messages they seek to convey.
because the former sign code was a regulation of speech,we apply strict scrutiny in determining its constitutionality.reed.at.under this standard,the government must show that the regulation further ed a compelling interest and wa s narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.id.quotation omitted.
