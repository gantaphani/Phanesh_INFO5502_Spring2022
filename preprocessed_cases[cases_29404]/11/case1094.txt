diana kolev brought suit against euromotors auto gallery,motorcars west llc,hm gray family ii,gray family ii llc,bennett automotive i,bennett automotive ii the dealership and porsche cars north america,porsche,when the formerly known as used automobile that she purchased from the dealership developed serious mechanical problems during the warranty period and the dealership refused to honor her warranty claims.she alleges breach of implied and express warranties under the magnuson moss warranty act mmwa,and breach of contract and unconscionability under california law.
the district court granted the dealership petition to compel arbitration pursuant to the mandatory arbitration provision in the sales contract that kolev signed when she bought the car.it also stayed the action against porsche.after the arbitrator resolved most of the claims in favor of the dealership,the district court confirmed the arbitration award.we review de novo the district court order granting the petition to compel arbitration.see davis myers,cir.
kolev principal argument on appeal is that the magnuson moss warranty act mmwa,et,bars the provision mandating binding arbitration of her warranty claims against the dealership.although the text of the mmwa does not specifically address the validity of mandatory binding arbitration,congress expressly delegated rulemaking authority under the statute to the federal trade commission ftc.see a.pursuant to this authority,the ftc construed the mmwa as barring mandatory binding arbitration provisions covering written warranty agreements and issued a rule prohibiting judicial enforcement of such provisions with respect to consumer claims brought under the mmwa.see.
we apply a inquiry in reviewing agency constructions of statutes.see chevron natural resources defense council.the first step requires us to ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue in a way that renders its intention clear and unambiguously expressed.id.at.if we find that the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,then we proceed to the second step,and ask whether an interpretation by the agency to which congress has delegated rulemaking authority is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.if congress intent is not clear under the statute and if congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority,united states mead,u,then we must defer to the agency reasonable construction of the ambiguous statutory provision 
under the first prong of chevron,we use traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress expressed a clear intent on the issue in question.schneider chertoff,cir internal citations omitted.we agree with the fifth circuit that t he text of the mmwa does not specifically address binding arbitration,walton rose mobile homes llc,cir see also davis energy homes,cir congress failed to directly address binding arbitration anywhere in the text of the mmwa,and conclude that congress has not directly spoken to the precise question,chevron,at,whether the mmwa bars warranty provisions that mandate binding arbitration of warranty claims.
accordingly,we proceed to the second prong of the chevron inquiry,under which we ask whether the agency to which congress delegated rulemaking authority resolved the statutory ambiguity based on a permissible construction of the statute.at.in enacting the mmwa,congress expressly delegated authority to the ftc to prescribe rules setting forth minimum requirements for any informal dispute settlement procedure which is incorporated into the terms of a written warranty.a.pursuant to this authority,the ftc promulgated rule,which provides that d ecisions of any mechanism shall not be legally binding on any person,j,defining a mechanism as an informal dispute settlement procedure which is incorporated into the terms of a written warranty.e.if a consumer is dissatisfied with a mechanism decision or warrantor intended actions,or eventual performance,the rule states,then legal remedies,including use of small claims court,may be pursued.g.
when it published rule,the ftc explained 
several industry representatives contended that warrantors should be allowed to require consumers to resort to mechanisms whose decisions would be legally binding,binding arbitration.the rule does not allow this for two reasons.first,as the staff report indicates,congressional intent was that decisions of section mechanisms not be legally binding.second,even if binding mechanisms were contemplated by section of the act,the ftc is not prepared,at this point in time,to develop guidelines for a system in which consumers would commit themselves,at the time of product purchase,to resolve any difficulties in a binding,but,proceeding.the ftc is not now convinced that any guidelines which it set out could ensure sufficient protection for consumers.
the ftc explanation concluded that reference within the written warranty to any binding,remedy is prohibited by the rule and the act.id.at in,the ftc restated its position that mandatory binding arbitration clauses are invalid under the mmwa and affirmed that this interpretation continues to be correct.expressly declining to amend j to permit binding arbitration,the ftc concluded that rule will continue to prohibit warrantors from including binding arbitration clauses in their contracts with consumers that would require consumers to submit warranty disputes to binding arbitration.id.at.
there are three reasons why the ftc interpretation of the mmwa as precluding mandatory binding arbitration is a reasonable construction of the statute.first,the ftc sought in devising rule to implement congress intent,based on evidence from the legislative history of the mmwa.specifically,in its statement of basis and purpose for rule,the ftc cited to the house subcommittee staff report as evidence that c ongressional intent was that decisions of section mechanisms not be legally binding.at.the subcommittee staff report on which the ftc based its independent interpretation of congress intention makes clear that consumers must be made aware of their rights,including their right to pursue litigation,because otherwise the fate of aggrieved consumers usually rests with the and its willingness to live up to its promises.cong.rec.the ftc reliance on such legislative history in seeking to implement congress intent is the first reason that its rule barring judicial enforcement of mandatory binding arbitration agreements is a reasonable construction of the mmwa.
second,the ftc interpretation that the mmwa bars mandatory binding arbitration advances the statute purpose of protecting consumers from being forced into involuntary agreements that they can not negotiate.in enacting the mmwa,congress sought to address the extreme inequality in bargaining power that vendors wielded over consumers by providing consumers with access to reasonable and effective remedies for breaches of warranty,and by provid ing the federal trade commission ftc with means of better protecting consumers,at,reprinted in.the ftc,however,was not convinced that any guidelines which it set out could ensure sufficient protection for consumers.at.most important,the agency construed the statute as prohibiting vendors from including provisions that mandate arbitration of disputes over breaches of warranty before a dispute arises,in order to prevent them from depriving consumers of the right that it guaranteed them to litigate breaches of warranty.see,at,at an adverse decision in any informal dispute settlement proceeding would not be a bar to a civil action on the warranty involved in the proceeding.
third,we should accord particular deference to the ftc regulatory interpretation of the mmwa because the regulations represent a longstanding,consistent interpretation of the statute.walton,at king,dissenting.the supreme court has made clear that a court may accord great weight to the longstanding interpretation placed on a statute by an agency charged with its administration,nlrb bell aerospace.div.textron,because agency interpretations that are of long standing come before us with a certain credential of reasonableness,since it is rare that error would long persist.smiley citibank.in this case,the agency interpretation of the statute has persisted for more than years,ever since in the ftc promulgated rule shortly after the enactment of the mmwa.in,the ftc published a regulatory review statement reaffirming its interpretation of the mmwa to preclude mandatory binding arbitration agreements.although we summarized the ftc statement briefly above,it is worth quoting here at greater length 
the commission examined the legality and the merits of mandatory binding arbitration clauses in written consumer product warranties when it promulgated rule in.although several industry representatives at that time had recommended that the rule allow warrantors to require consumers to submit to binding arbitration,the commission rejected that view as being contrary to the congressional intent.
the commission based this decision on its analysis of the plain language of the warranty act.section a of the warranty act provides that if a warrantor establishes an informal dispute settlement mechanism that complies with rule and incorporates that informal dispute settlement mechanism in its written consumer product warranty,then t he consumer may not commence a civil action other than a class action unless he initially resorts to such procedure.this language clearly implies that a mechanism decision can not be legally binding,because if it were,it would bar later court action.the house report supports this interpretation by stating that a n adverse decision in any informal dispute settlement proceeding would not be a bar to a civil action on the warranty involved in the proceeding,at.
t he commission determined that reference within the written warranty to any binding,remedy is prohibited by the rule and the act.fr.the commission believes that this interpretation continues to be correct.therefore,the commission has determined not to amend j to allow for binding arbitration.rule will continue to prohibit warrantors from including binding arbitration clauses in their contracts with consumers that would require consumers to submit warranty disputes to binding arbitration.
fr,internal footnotes omitted.that a quarter century passed between the ftc initial construction of the mmwa as barring mandatory binding arbitration and its most recent reaffirmation of that conclusion merits that consistent ftc construction of the statute strong deference.moreover,that rule and its concomitant construction of the mmwa by the agency charged with the statute enforcement remains in effect to this day.
we reject the argument that the ftc construction is unreasonable in light of the supreme court repeated holdings that congress established a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements when in it enacted the federal arbitration act faa,years before adopting the magnuson moss warranty act in.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,see also hall street assocs.mattel,buckeye check cashing cardegna.
the faa provides in pertinent part that an arbitration agreement shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the supreme court held in.express mcmahon,that the faa mandate to enforce arbitration agreements,l ike any statutory directive,may be overridden by a contrary congressional command.id.at.
the fifth and eleventh circuits relied on mcmahon to conclude that the mmwa does not overcome the faa presumption that courts should enforce arbitration agreements.see walton,at,davis,at.the eleventh circuit held that the agency rule prohibiting mandatory binding arbitration was an impermissible construction of the statute,davis,at,while a fifth circuit panel majority,over a vigorous dissent by judge king,walton,at king,dissenting,asserted that it need not even consider the reasonableness of the ftc rule,because congress,through the faa presumption enacted nearly a before the mmwa,had directly spoken to the precise question whether a warrantor may mandate binding arbitration under the mmwa.id.at.
we disagree with the conclusions reached by the fifth and eleventh circuits for three reasons.first,as chief judge king noted in dissent,it is unprecedented to locate congress intent with respect to one statute by looking to a prior,less specific statute.id.at king,dissenting.where the directives of two statutes create an apparent conflict,to identify congressional intent in one statute by reference to a previously enacted and more general statute would violate two basic principles of statutory interpretation first,that later enacted statutes take priority over older ones,and second,that more specific statutes control more general ones.see william eskridge,et,legislation and statutory interpretation ed italics omitted.nor did the supreme court purport to settle the question in mcmahon,twelve years after the mmwa enactment it stated only that the faa established a rebuttable presumption in favor of arbitration that congress could override in any later statute by adopting a contrary congressional command.at.the fifth circuit erred in holding that the prior adoption of the faa was in itself enough to find that congress had in the mmwa directly spoken to the precise question whether mandatory binding arbitration provisions are enforceable under the mmwa.id.at.
second,as we explained above,the ftc reasonably construed the statute language,legislative history,and underlying purpose in concluding that reference within the written warranty to any binding,remedy is prohibited by the magnuson moss warranty act.with its regulatory review statement,the ftc again carefully considered its construction of the statute as prohibiting any binding,remedy,and concluded that this interpretation continues to be correct.it did so with full awareness that the supreme court had twelve years earlier in mcmahon set forth a rebuttable presumption in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements.we agree with the ftc longstanding interpretation of the statute,that it bars judicial enforcement of warranty provisions that mandate binding arbitration and that the mmwa evinces a contrary congressional command sufficient to override the faa presumption in favor of arbitration.mcmahon,at.more important,however,under chevron,we are bound by it.see at.
the third and final reason that the faa proarbitration presumption does not render unreasonable the ftc interpretation of the mmwa as barring mandatory binding arbitration is that the magnuson moss warranty act is different in four critical respects from every other federal statute that the supreme court has found does not rebut the faa presumption,including the sherman antitrust act of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of first,with respect to these other statutes,in none did an authorized agency construe the statute to bar mandatory binding arbitration.second,only in the mwwa and in none of these other statutes did congress say anything about informal,remedies,and do so in a way that would bar binding procedures such as mandatory arbitration.see a authorizing the ftc to prescribe rules setting forth minimum requirements for any informal dispute settlement procedure which is incorporated into the terms of a written warranty.
third,in the mmwa alone did congress explicitly preserve,in addition to informal dispute settlement mechanisms,a consumer right to press his claims under the statute in civil court.see a c requiring a consumer to resort to such informal dispute settlement procedure before pursuing any legal remedy emphasis added id.a c i no consumer may commence a civil action unless he initially resorts to such procedure emphasis added.fourth,only the mmwa sought as its primary purpose to protect consumers by prohibiting vendors from imposing binding,remedies.by contrast,the faa proarbitration policy,the court made especially clear just last term,is intended to expedite disputes through efficient,procedures and not to advance the interests of consumers.see at t mobility concepcion,slip,at the overarching purpose of the faa,evident in the text of,and,is to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings.emphasis added.
in sum,having found that the statute on its face is ambiguous as to whether mandatory binding arbitration provisions are valid under the mmwa,we conclude that the ftc construction that they are not is reasonable.we do so for the following reasons the ftc interpreted the statute consistent with its carefully reasoned understanding of the enacting congress intent,as evidenced by the statute language and legislative history the ftc construction advances the mmwa purpose to protect consumers from predatory warrantors and to provide them with fair and informal procedures that preserve their rights to enforce their claims for breach of warranty through civil litigation in the state or federal courts and the persistence of the ftc rule that the mmwa bars mandatory binding arbitration expressly reaffirmed more than a decade after the supreme court held that the faa mandates enforcement of agreements to arbitrate statutory claims absent contrary congressional command requires that the courts afford the agency construction particularly strong deference.because we are required to defer to the reasonable construction of a statute by the agency that congress has authorized to interpret it,we hold that the mmwa precludes enforcement of agreements such as porsche that require mandatory binding arbitration of consumer warranty claims.
in view of the conclusion we have reached above,we need not address kolev additional contentions that the arbitration clause was unconscionable under california law and that the district court abused its discretion by admitting and relying on the sales contract authenticated by a principal of the dealership and by compelling arbitration of her claims against the dealership while staying the action against porsche.
we hold that written warranty provisions that mandate binding arbitration are invalid under the mmwa and that the district court therefore erred in enforcing porsche warranty clause by compelling mandatory arbitration of kolev claims.accordingly,we reverse and remand to the district court as to all breach of warranty claims.
reversed and remanded.
in a departure from supreme court precedent,the prevailing view of our sister circuits,and applicable statutes,the majority opinion nullifies nearly every binding,warranty dispute remedy adopted by private parties in this circuit.the majority reaches this conclusion by conflating informal dispute settlement procedures idsms or mechanisms under the magnuson moss warranty act,et mmwa a narrow class of warranty dispute resolution procedures with any adr remedy adopted in a private contract.
here,we address whether ftc regulations proscribing the use of binding arbitration by mechanisms bar the use of a binding arbitration remedy to which kolev and a los angeles porsche dealership agreed.neither party contends that the dealership arbitration remedy is a mechanism.indeed,the arbitration remedy chosen by the parties is not,and has never purported to be,compliant with federal law regulating the creation and operation of mechanisms.more importantly,the ftc acknowledges that private parties may agree to pursue some avenue of redress other than the mechanism if they feel it is more appropriate,including binding arbitration.promulgation of rule,emphasis added.yet,the majority concludes that the ftc ban on mechanisms use of binding arbitration must apply to all warranty dispute remedies.this view finds no support in the text of the statute,administrative rules,ftc opinions,or judicial authority on the subject.
additionally,even if ftc regulations were applicable and could be read to prohibit binding arbitration of any warranty dispute arising under the mmwa,this view would be unreasonable in light of the presumption of arbitrability created by the federal arbitration act.see walton rose mobile homes llc,cir davis energy homes,cir.
ftc regulations regarding idsms under the mmwa do not apply to the binding arbitration remedy in this case 
the ftc regulatory authority under the mmwa 
the mmwa authorizes warrantors to create informal dispute settlement procedures called mechanisms.such mechanisms are unique adr procedures that prevent consumers from pursuing warranty claims in court without first exhausting the warrantor mechanism procedures.a.recognizing mechanisms and their potential benefits as an alternative to the judicial process,congress made such exhaustion a prerequisite to filing suit to encourage warrantors to establish procedures whereby consumer disputes are fairly and expeditiously settled.action interpreting the mmwa.congress charged the ftc with exclusive authority to prescribe rules setting forth minimum requirements for any idsm,monitor compliance with idsm regulations,investigate complaints,and take remedial measures against idsms.id.a.pursuant to this authority,the ftc promulgated rule.rule provides the minimum requirements for idsms authorized under the mmwa.see informal dispute settlement procedures,et.to qualify as an idsm,a program must be established by a warrantor,comply with rules set forth by the ftc,and be incorporated into a written warranty agreement as a prerequisite to litigation.a.
the ftc has also indicated that use of binding arbitration by idsms is prohibited by the mmwa and rule,because d ecisions of the mechanism shall not be legally binding on any person.id.j.addressing renewed requests that warrantors be permitted to use binding arbitration as an mechanism,the ftc explained 
the rule does not allow this for two reasons.first,congressional intent was that decisions of section mechanisms not be legally binding.second,even if binding mechanisms were contemplated by section of the act,the commission is not prepared,at this point in time,to develop guidelines for a system in which consumers would commit themselves,at the time of product purchase,to resolve any difficulties in a binding,but proceeding.
the dealership arbitration remedy is not an idsm 
it is clear from the record and the pleadings that the binding arbitration remedy,to which the parties agreed in this case,is not an idsm.the majority notion that the arbitration remedy is an idsm is made out of whole cloth.indeed,neither party alleges and there is no indication in the record that the arbitration remedy complies or has ever attempted to comply with the ftc extensive regulations for idsms in rule.see a b.to be sure,the arbitration remedy fits none of the statutory or regulatory requirements for an idsm.for example,the dealership does not describe the arbitration remedy as something that must be exhausted before pursuing litigation.see id.a c.the agreement provides that disputes will be resolved by neutral,binding arbitration and not by a court action t he arbitrator award shall be final and binding on all parties and any appeal,if permitted by the terms of the agreement,will be to a panel,not to a court of law.emphasis added.thus,instead of making arbitration a prerequisite to litigation under a of the mmwa,the agreement makes arbitration a binding alternative to litigation that operates completely outside the optional idms procedures available under the mmwa.
neither congress nor the ftc prohibits the use of binding,remedies as an alternative to idsms 
idsms authorized by the mmwa are only one of many alternative dispute resolution procedures available to private parties under federal law.in concluding that any binding,dispute resolution program is a mechanism under the mmwa,the majority adopts the errant reasoning of chief judge king in walton rose mobile homes,cir king,dissenting.writing in dissent,chief judge king concluded that no warrantor may use binding arbitration to settle warranty disputes,because the ftc prohibits the use of binding arbitration by mechanisms.id.this view conflates the word mechanism with all dispute resolution procedures,including arbitration.id.as explained above,this is a misreading of the statute and applicable ft
