we hold that the district court erred by dismissing raymond manzarek and doors touring,dti amended complaint because the underlying complaints raised at least the potential for coverage under the operative insurance policies.we further hold that the district court abused its discretion by not giving manzarek and dti an opportunity to amend their complaint.we have jurisdiction under.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
underlying lawsuits 
this insurance coverage and bad faith lawsuit arose out of two lawsuits underlying lawsuits filed in california state court against manzarek a founding member of the classic rock group the doors,dti,and the other members of manzarek band at the time of the filing of the lawsuits.john densmore the former drummer for the doors filed one of the underlying lawsuits densmore lawsuit.the parents of jim morrison the former vocalist for the doors and the parents of pamela courson morrison late wife together filed the other underlying lawsuit courson lawsuit.both underlying lawsuits alleged that manzarek and members of his band were liable for infringing on the doors name,trademark,and logo in conjunction with their planned national and international tours.both underlying lawsuits included allegations against manzarek and dti for the improper use of the doors logo in conjunction with the marketing of products and merchandise.additionally,the densmore lawsuit alleged that the breaches by manzarek and his band caused densmore to suffer economic damages as well as damage to his reputation and stature by causing people to believe that he was not,and is not,an integral and respected part of the doors band,or is one member who easily can be replaced by another drummer.
the state trial court consolidated the underlying lawsuits for trial but reserved some equitable claims for determination by the court.at trial,the jury found manzarek and the other defendants liable on some claims but awarded no damages.the record before us is not clear what result the state trial court reached on the equitable claims that it removed from the jury consideration.manzarek and dti defense fees and costs in the underlying lawsuits exceeded million.
b.the policies 
from may,to may,paul fire marine insurance company insured manzarek only under a commercial general liability policy manzarek policy.the manzarek policy was effective beginning on may,but paul did not issue it until october.from december,to december,paul insured manzarek,dti,and robert krieger under another commercial general liability policy dti policy.the dti policy was effective beginning on december,but paul did not issue it until february.it is not clear from our review of the record when paul actually delivered copies of the manzarek policy or the dti policy to its insureds,though the complaint in this action alleges that paul did not deliver the dti policy until sometime after february.
among other things,both of the commercial general liability policies policies insured against the occurrence of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury,and advertising injury.manzarek and dti argue,and paul concedes,that some of the alleged conduct falls within the advertising injury portion of the policies.that portion of the policies contains the following provisions 
advertising injury liability.we pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered advertising injury that 
results from the advertising of your products,your work,or your completed work and 
is caused by an advertising injury offense committed while this agreement is in effect.

but we wo consider information used to identify or record customers or supporters,such as a list of customers or supporters,to be an advertising idea.
advertising material means any covered material that 
is subject to copyright law and 
others use and intend to attract attention in their advertising.
both policies also contain a field of entertainment limitation endorsement fele which changes the insured commercial general liability protection and reduces coverage.in relevant part,the fele reduces coverage as follows 
field of entertainment.we wo cover personal injury or advertising injury that results from the content of,or the advertising or publicizing for,any properties or programs which are within your field of entertainment business.
properties or programs means any of your properties,products,programs,materials or other matter.

the ownership,operation maintenance or use of merchandising programs,advertising or publicity material,characters or ideas whether or not on your premises or in your possession at the time of the alleged offense.
as referenced above,both policies also insured against the occurrence of bodily injury.the policies define bodily injury to mean any physical harm,including sickness or disease,to the physical health of other persons.the policies include mental anguish,injury,or illness,and emotional distress in the definition of covered bodily injuries.
c.the instant action 
on february,manzarek and dti notified paul of the densmore lawsuit.paul responded by letter on february.that letter notified manzarek and dti that,although paul was still investigating coverage issues,its preliminarily determination was that the policies did not cover the densmore lawsuit.according to the complaint,paul delivered this letter before it issued the dti policy or delivered a copy of it to its insureds.paul did not issue the dti policy until february,two weeks after manzarek and dti tendered a copy of the densmore lawsuit to paul.the complaint also alleges that paul preliminarily denied coverage before it considered the language contained in either of the policies.
on march,paul notified manzarek and dti that both policies contained the fele.paul denied coverage and refused to defend the densmore lawsuit on that basis.on march,paul reiterated the applicability of the fele and notified manzarek and dti that the policies did not obligate it to defend or indemnify the densmore lawsuit.
thereafter,manzarek and dti tendered the courson lawsuit to paul.on may,paul advised its insureds that the policies did not provide coverage for the courson lawsuit.paul therefore denied coverage and declined to defend the courson lawsuit based on its interpretation of the fele.in the months that followed,manzarek and dti continued to demand a defense under the policies and paul persisted in its refusal to defend or indemnify its insureds.
manzarek and dti filed this coverage and bad faith lawsuit against paul in los angeles superior court approximately two years later.on april,manzarek and dti voluntarily amended their complaint.the amended complaint contained claims against paul for breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief.
paul removed the action to the united states district court on april.on april,paul filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court heard argument on paul motion to dismiss on may,and entered a docket entry granting the motion to dismiss that same day.the docket entry by the district court states that t he court grants the motion.defendants shall submit a proposed order.on may,paul provided the district court with a proposed order granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice.
the district court signed paul proposed order on may.the clerk entered the order on may.that order dismissed with prejudice manzarek and dti claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,holding that the fele was conspicuous,plain,clear,and unambiguous.consequently,the district court held that paul owed manzarek and dti no duty to defend or indemnify against the claims in the underlying lawsuits.additionally,the district court found that a mendment of plaintiffs first amended complaint would be futile because plaintiffs would be unable to allege facts that would alter these strictly legal determinations.
manzarek and dti appeal the district court order granting the motion to dismiss.manzarek and dti contend that the district court erred by holding that no duty to defend existed under the policies dismissing their claim for breach of contract and dismissing their claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.alternatively,manzarek and dti argue that the district court should have allowed them the opportunity to amend their complaint to state a viable claim for relief against paul.manzarek and dti argue that the district court abused its discretion by not giving them a chance to amend.

iii.discussion 
in this diversity case,we must apply california law when interpreting the policies.see aetna cas.sur,centennial ins,cir.interpretation of insurance contracts under california law requires us to employ general principles of contract interpretation.mackinnon truck ins,cal th,d,safeco ins.of am.robert,cal th,d.under california law,we are to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed.mackinnon,at see cal.
clear,explicit,and unambiguous contractual language governs.see boghos certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cal th,d,cal.in the event of an ambiguity,we must interpret contractual terms to protect the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.boghos,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.only if these rules do not resolve a claimed ambiguity do we resort to the rule that ambiguities are to be resolved against the insurer.id.
breach of contract 
manzarek and dti assert that the district court erred by dismissing their claim for breach of contract with prejudice because the allegations in the underlying lawsuits triggered a contractual duty to defend.for the reasons set forth below,we agree.
applicable law 
scope of duty to defend 
under california law,an insurer must defend its insured if the underlying complaint alleges the insured liability for damages potentially covered under the policy,or if the complaint might be amended to give rise to a liability that would be covered under the policy.montrose chem.superior court,cal th,d,citation omitted.the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.id.at.even if no damages are awarded,the duty to defend may still exist.id.the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.id.quoting horace mann ins.barbara,cal th,d.any doubt as to whether the facts establish the existence of the defense duty must be resolved in the insured favor.montrose chem,at.if any of the claims in the underlying complaint are covered,the insurer has a duty to defend the entire action.horace mann ins,at.the court may consider facts outside the complaint when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.id.at.
enforceability of coverage limitations 
i nsurance coverage is interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured,whereas exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer.mackinnon,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted bracketed text in original see mariscal old republic life ins,th,d,recognizing that exclusions are strictly interpreted against the insurer.an exclusionary clause must be conspicuous,plain and clear.mackinnon,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this rule applies with particular force when the coverage portion of the insurance policy would lead an insured to reasonably expect coverage for the claim purportedly excluded.id.the burden is on the insured to establish that the claim is within the basic scope of coverage and on the insurer to establish that the claim is specifically excluded.id.coverage may be limited by a valid endorsement and,if a conflict exists between the main body of the policy and an endorsement,the endorsement prevails.haynes farmers ins,cal th,d.
the district court signed and entered paul proposed order granting paul motion to dismiss the claim for breach of contract.the order states that t he fele was sufficiently conspicuous and notes that i n addition to being conspicuously referenced in the policy declarations and attached as a separate endorsement,the language of the fele was plain and clear.the district court then concluded that based on the plain and clear language of the fele,it was reasonable for paul to believe its insureds understood the limiting effect of the fele on advertising injury coverage under the policies.based on that conclusion,the district court dismissed the breach of contract claim with prejudice.
the fundamental problem with the district court decision is that it fails to apply the language of the fele to the factual allegations contained in the complaints filed in the underlying lawsuits.the fele excludes coverage for the advertising or publicizing for,any properties or programs which are within your field of entertainment business.contrary to the interpretation adopted by the district court,the definition of field of entertainment business is not broad enough to cover the entirety of the allegations in the underlying lawsuits.in relevant part,the policies define field of entertainment business as follows 
the creation,production,publication,distribution,exploitation,exhibition,advertising and publicizing of product or material in any and all media such as motion pictures of any kind and character,television programs,commercials or industrial or educational or training films,phonograph records,audio or video tapes,cds or cd roms,computer services or internet or web site pages,cassettes or discs,electrical transcriptions,music in sheet or other form,live performance,books or other publications.
