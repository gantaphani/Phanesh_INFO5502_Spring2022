introduction 
defendant forwarding services,appeals a judgment against it in favor of plaintiff bii finance company bii in the amount of,plus costs in the amount of and attorneys fees in the amount of.judgment was entered following a court trial.the parties waived the statement of decision.bii,the shipper assignee,prevailed on its claim that,the shipping carrier,was liable for delivering goods without requiring surrender by the purchaser of the original bills of lading.in this case,the purchaser had not paid for the goods.the judgment was also entered against primaline,primaline,the shipping carrier agent,pursuant to a default.primaline does not appeal.
a bill of lading that is consigned to order,without designating a named person,arguably may not be a negotiable document under california uniform commercial code section,subdivision.if it is not,the bill of lading nonetheless should be treated as a negotiable document under california uniform commercial code section,subdivision in this case.the trial court correctly found that was liable to bii,the holder by due negotiation of the bills of lading at issue,because delivered the goods covered by those bills at the instruction of a party who was not such a holder,to a party who also was not such a holder.in addition,there was substantial evidence to support the trial court finding that bii acceptance of partial payment from the party that received the goods did not relieve of liability for the remainder of the amount owed.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
background 
on june and,primaline,a shipping company that acted as agent for a california corporation,issued four bills of lading in favor of shineworld industrial limited shineworld,a hong kong manufacturer and exporter of garments.although the goods covered by the bills of lading cartons of jackets were to be shipped to the buyer,jacobs turner,jacobs turner in glasgow,scotland,the goods were consigned simply to order,without specifying any name or person.
jacobs turner agreed to pay by letter of credit approximately for the goods covered by the bills of lading.the amounts at issue were in hong kong dollars.here,the amounts are specified in united states dollars because the parties did so.those amounts are expressed in approximations,also because the parties did due to fluctuating exchange rates.shineworld assigned each bill of lading to bii,a commercial hong kong bank,for a loan of approximately.
the goods were placed on a vessel in early june and arrived in the united kingdom in july.while the goods were in transit,bii sent the shipping documents including the bills of lading to jacobs turner bank,clydesdale bank plc,in glasgow,scotland,and requested payment under the letter of credit.on june,clydesdale bank gave notice to bii that because the bank had found discrepancies between the letter of credit and the shipping documents sent to it by bii,the bank would not release the funds to bii until the buyer,jacobs turner,consented to a waiver of the discrepancies.bii then notified shineworld of the claimed discrepancies,and shineworld responded that it would contact jacobs turner about the matter.
shineworld apparently did not have any further communications with bii about the shipment.sometime later,in september,bii learned that the goods had been released to jacobs turner at shineworld direction,even though bii had not been paid for the goods.in fact,on july,shineworld had inexplicably sent a letter to primaline requesting that it release the goods to jacobs turner without requiring surrender of the original bills of lading.this request or instruction was not noted on the bills of lading because shineworld had already transferred them to bii.
as a result of the communication from shineworld,by its agent,primaline released the goods to jacobs turner on july,without the surrender of the original bills of lading.there is no indication that jacobs turner had waived the claimed discrepancies under the letter of credit or had paid for the goods.
had no knowledge that shineworld had assigned the original bills of lading to bii at the time released the goods to jacobs turner.bii did not know of shineworld letter instructing to release the goods to jacob turner until september,after the goods had been released,and had not authorized the release of the goods.
bii could not recover from shineworld because shineworld had no ascertainable assets.bii claimed against jacobs turner,which party asserted that the goods were defective,although there was a certificate from the inspector of the goods at the place of delivery that the goods were not defective.bii and jacobs turner agreed that,as a settlement between them,jacobs turner would pay to bii percent of the goods total agreed price,and that amount was paid.
after bii was told by that primaline had no authority to issue bills of lading as agent,bii brought an action in hong kong against primaline.that action was dismissed based on evidence produced by primaline that indicated that primaline acted as agent for.bii then sought the unpaid amount of the original contract price from u states in this case.
alleging causes of action for breach of contract and conversion,bii asserted that delivery of the goods to jacobs turner without the surrender of the original bills of lading was a misdelivery for which is liable in damages to bii.bii relied on the bills of lading that were consigned to order and on what it deemed to be the applicable law.contended that the bills of lading should be read to have permitted the delivery it made.also argued that the payment from jacobs turner constituted an accord and satisfaction,in effect releasing from any liability.
the trial court found that primaline acted as agent for defendant concedes this on appeal,that therefore the goods,that bii made proper efforts to mitigate its damages,and that therefore the unpaid portion of the obligation was not extinguished.the trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the unpaid amount,plus costs and attorneys fees.
appeals from the judgment.
discussion 
on appeal,argues that it is not liable to bii for delivering the goods to jacobs turner without requiring surrender of the original bills of lading because the bills of lading should be interpreted to give the option to require or not require such surrender without liability to the holder of the original bills of lading.also argues that bii acceptance from jacobs turner of percent of the agreed price of the goods constituted an accord and satisfaction and extinguished any obligation for the unpaid portion of the agreed price.
the judgment of the trial court is presumed correct.denham superior court cal d.where,as here,the findings were waived,we assume that the court found all facts necessary to support the judgment.tusher gabrielsen th,d.to the extent there is any disputed factual issue,we determine whether the trial court determination is supported by substantial evidence.winograd american broadcasting th,d.when the trial court determination is not based on conflicting evidence,we are confronted with questions of law that we review independently.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
the trial court decision that there was a misdelivery for which is liable is not dependent on conflicting evidence.therefore,we review that legal determination independently.we review the trial court decision that there was no accord and satisfaction on the basis of whether there was substantial evidence to support that conclusion.
the transaction 
bills of lading have long been used in international sales transactions as one means to protect the interests of sellers,who want assurance of being paid for goods shipped by a carrier,and buyers,who do not want to pay for goods until they arrive.they also are used as a means to facilitate credit arrangements and to reflect title in goods being shipped by a carrier.see gilmore black,the law of admiralty ed.
the bill of lading constitutes a receipt for the goods shipped,a contract for their carriage,and a document of title.pioneer fruit southern pac,internatio,yinka folawiyo,see also dolan,the law of letters of credit ed c colinvaux,carver carriage by sea ed,gilmore black,supra,at.it describes the goods shipped,identifies the shipper or consignor and the buyer consignee and directs the carrier to deliver the goods to a specified location or person.as a contract of carriage drafted by the carrier,a bill of lading is strictly construed against the carrier.see,hong kong islands line america,cir,and cases cited therein.
a negotiable bill of lading,in effect,requires delivery to the bearer of the bill or,if to the order of a named person,to that person.a person includes an individual or an organization.cal,subd.a nonnegotiable bill of lading is one in which the consignee is specified.see white summers,uniform commercial code ed,hansen storage,see also,schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed,at.if the bill of lading is negotiable,the holder of the original bill can negotiate it by indorsing and delivering it to another or,when it is indorsed in blank or to bearer,by delivery alone.cal,colinvaux,supra,at.an indorsee is the holder and,in effect,holds title to the goods covered by the bill,subd.b colinvaux,supra,at.
in a typical international transaction,once the buyer and seller have agreed on terms,the buyer in this case,jacobs turner obtains a letter of credit with its bank here,clydesdale bank in scotland in favor of the seller here,shineworld.the seller generally referred to as the shipper delivers the goods to a carrier here,through its agent primaline.the carrier issues a bill of lading,usually in duplicate sets,and gives the original bill of lading to the shipper.see dolan,supra,at.
the shipper issues a draft or other document directing the buyer to pay the purchase price to the shipper or the shipper nominee.the shipper or its nominee then presents the draft and the bill of lading made to the order of or indorsed to the buyer to the buyer bank for payment.see also gilmore black,supra,at.
the buyer bank compares the draft and bill of lading against the letter of credit to ensure there are no discrepancies between them.if none is found,the bank pays the shipper or its nominee and forwards the original bill of lading to the buyer,who presents it to the carrier to obtain delivery of the goods.if the bank finds discrepancies between the letter of credit and the shipper documents,as it did here,the bank notifies the shipper,who may ask the buyer to waive the discrepancies.if the buyer agrees to such a waiver,the bank pays the shipper and forwards the bill of lading to the buyer,who presents it to the carrier for delivery of the goods.if there is no waiver,the original bill of lading is returned to the shipper and the transaction is cancelled.dolan,supra,at c.
the transaction at issue in this case essentially was initiated as we describe,in that jacobs turner obtained a letter of credit to purchase goods from shineworld,shineworld delivered the goods to agent for shipment to jacobs turner,and through its agent,primaline issued bills of lading and gave them to shineworld.shineworld then indorsed the bills of lading to bii in exchange for a loan by bii to shineworld in the amount that was covered by the amount owed by the buyer,jacobs turner.therefore,bii,rather than shineworld,presented the original bills of lading to clydesdale bank for payment.when the bank found discrepancies that jacobs turner did not waive,the bank returned the original bills of lading to bii.
law applicable to bills of lading 
with regard to issues concerning the bills of lading at issue in this case,we apply as do the parties california law,in accordance with the terms of the bills of lading that were issued by,a california corporation see cal,subd.the bills of lading also incorporate by reference the carriage of goods by sea act,title united states code section et,and the international convention for the unification of certain rules of law relating to bills of lading signed at brussels,august,as amended by the protocol signed at brussels february,visby rules or rules.
although the federal bills of lading act,when applicable,preempts much of the application of division of the california uniform commercial code,art.vi,cl.cal,the act applies only to interstate and foreign commerce in which the goods travel through one of the states of the united states.see also national union fire ins.allite,citing white summers,supra,at.because the goods in this case did not travel through the united states,the federal bills of lading act does not supersede california law here.
negotiability of the documents 
california uniform commercial code section governs whether a document of title,such as a bill of lading,is negotiable or nonnegotiable.under subdivision,a bill of lading is negotiable a if by its terms the goods are to be delivered to the bearer or to the order of a named person or b where recognized in overseas trade,if it runs to a named person or assigns,subd.subdivision provides that a ny other document is nonnegotiable,subd.subdivision,however,provides that a nonnegotiable bill of lading must be conspicuously section marked nonnegotiable,and if it is not so marked,a holder of the document who purchased it for value supposing it to be negotiable may,at his option,treat such document as imposing upon the bailee the same liabilities he would have incurred had the document been negotiable,subd.
the bills of lading in this case were consigned to order.they were not to the order of any specific person or entity nor did they specifically provide for delivery of the goods to the bearer.therefore,the bills of lading do not appear to fall within the scope of subdivision as negotiable.
bii argues,however,that the to order bills of lading are negotiable because they may be interpreted as consigned to bearer,citing to california uniform commercial code section,subd.a.that section,which provides that a promise or order is payable to bearer if it d oes not state a payee,does not apply here.
section is found in division of the california uniform commercial code,which division governs specified commercial paper,rather than in division,which division governs documents of title such as bills of lading.the treatment of commercial paper in division of the california uniform commercial code does not override division treatment of documents of title such as the bills of lading in this case.see cal,com,west.ed.foll.
authorities in other jurisdictions suggest that there should be a broad interpretation of negotiability and that documents of title need not contain the exact words specified in uniform commercial code section for negotiability.see bank of new york amoco oil company,affd.cir in re george kerr,affd.cir.these authorities are distinguishable because they dealt with situations in which the word order was not used or not used precisely.none of those authorities involved a nonbearer instrument that did not specify the person to whom the order was made.
in one authority,hawkland,uniform commercial code series,section,article,page,it is stated,subsection specifies words of negotiability that must be included in the terms of a document of title in order to make the document negotiable.consequently,a document of title that fails to include words of negotiability in its terms is nonnegotiable.the statutory words of negotiability include that the order be to a named person.
despite the specific words of negotiability required by california uniform commercial code,section,subdivision,bii asserts the bills of lading were negotiable because president testified that a person in possession of an original bill of lading is entitled to possession of the goods it covers.although it does not appear that the intent of a party bears on negotiability under subdivision see,bank of new york amoco oil company,supra.at,the parties intent is relevant under subdivision to the treatment as negotiable of a nonnegotiable bill of lading that is not conspicuously marked nonnegotiable.
subdivision is a california addition to the uniform commercial code.see cal,com,west.ed.foll,hawkland,uniform commercial code series,supra,page.as noted above,that section provides that,if a nonnegotiable bill of lading is not conspicuously marked nonnegotiable,a holder who purchased the bi
