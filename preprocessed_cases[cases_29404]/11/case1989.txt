the appeal before this court presents the novel question whether options to renew a commercial lease are subject to eptl b,new york rule against perpetuities.we hold that the rule against perpetuities does not apply to options to renew leases.
plaintiff bleecker streets tenant is owner of a walkup on bleecker street,which was converted to cooperative ownership in september.plaintiff leased the building commercial space to defendant bleecker jones leasing company,defendant bleeker jones llc predecessor in interest.the lease agreement was contemporaneous with the conversion.
the lease,in relevant parts,provided for an initial lease term of years,with nine consecutive options to renew for a.each renewal option term was to commence on the first day of the calendar month immediately following the expiration of the immediate preceding term of this lease.the lessee could exercise the renewal options together or successively and by giving written notice to the lessor at least six months prior to the expiration date of the preceding term.if the lessee did not timely exercise a renewal option and the lessor did not provide notice of the existence of an option seven months prior to the date of each expiring,then each renewal option remained in effect until the lessor notified the lessee in writing of its right to exercise each option.the lessee then had days to exercise such renewal option.lastly,i f the term shall have expired,l essee shall remain in possession as a tenant until lessor complied with the notice requirements.the parties agree that,under these provisions,a renewal option could be exercised even after the original lease term had expired,during the tenancies resulting from the absence of written notice.
in august,the initial lease term expired.defendant bleeker jones did not exercise any lease option thereafter.it remained in possession as a tenant until plaintiff commenced this action in december,seeking to void the lease renewal options under eptl b and the common law rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation.defendants moved and plaintiff for summary judgment.
supreme court granted defendants motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint while denying that of plaintiff.the court concluded that the renewal options were appurtenant to the lease,exercisable during the lease term and,therefore,valid.the appellate division reversed,declaring the renewal options clause void under eptl b.the court determined that the lease term had expired prior to any renewal option having been exercised and,thus,concluded that the option could not be appurtenant to the lease.we now reverse.
no estate in property shall be valid unless it must vest,if at all,not later than years after one or more lives in being at the creation of the estate and any period of gestation involved eptl b.this prohibition against remote vesting codified the american rule symphony space pergola.traditionally,the rule sought to limit an owner right to control title of property indefinitely,commonly known as a landowner control see id.at metropolitan trans.auth.bruken realty.both in its early and modern forms,rules restricting future dispositions of property were founded on the principle that it is socially undesirable for property to be inalienable for an unreasonable period of time symphony space,at.the underlying objective of the rule remains to protect the alienability of property see nylegisann,at see also berg,options and the rule against perpetuities,cal.
under the common law,options to purchase land are subject to the rule against remote vesting symphony space,at see also leach,perpetuities in a nutshell,harv l rev.though scholars proposed that commercial transactions be exempted from the rule against perpetuities,in symphony space,the court held that eptl b applies to all options to purchase id.at.an option to purchase land grants to the holder the power to compel the owner of property to sell it whether the owner is willing to part with ownership or not bruken,at.if the option to purchase does not comply with the rule against perpetuities,that interest could be exercised,or vest,at a time remote to the acquisition of such right.as the bruken court noted,the option to purchase in buffalo seminary mccarthy dept,affd granted the holder an unlimited right to buy the owner land at any time id.at.it is that uncertainty of title which renders the property inalienable for an unreasonable period of time symphony space,at.the symphony space court reasoned inasmuch as the prohibition against remote vesting applies to both commercial and noncommercial options,it likewise follows that the legislature intended eptl b to apply to the commercial purchase options as well id.
the symphony space court also recognized that certain options to purchase land,options appurtenant or appendant to a lease,are not invalid under the rule against perpetuities if the option originates in one of the lease provisions,is not exercisable after lease expiration,and is incapable of separation from the lease id.at see also metropolitan transp.auth.v bruken realty,simes and smith,future interests ed.the court reasoned that such options encourage the possessory holder to invest in maintaining and developing the property by guaranteeing the option holder the ultimate benefit of any such investment.options appurtenant thus further the policy objects underlying the rule against remote vesting and are not contemplated by eptl.b symphony space,at.
we now turn to whether the eptl b applies to options to renew leases.
under the common law,it was well settled that agreements for perpetual options to renew leases have always been held valid leach,perpetuities in a nutshell.at accord,abbot,leases and the rule against perpetuities,yale,there seems to be no question that such an option is good burns city of new york,continual lease renewal covenants are valid it was the law in england and has been frequently stated by writers and in the opinions by the courts both in england and in this country hoff royal metal furniture,ad dept concluded that covenants for perpetual renewals are lawful and in general use see also alr berg,cal.at thus,because the rule of perpetuities has not applied to options to renew leases under the american common law and eptl b codifies the american common law,it follows that options to renew leases also fall outside of the scope of eptl b.
moreover,an option to renew,like a purchase option appurtenant to a lease,furthers the policy goals of the rule against remote vesting.at the same time,lease renewal options or covenants for perpetual lease renewals are wholly distinguishable from purchase options in two respects an option to renew a lease is exercisable pursuant to the lease agreement and,thus,inherently appurtenant to the lease and lacks the power to divest title of that property to the option holder.it also has been noted that these covenants are often part of commercial leases,rendering the lease more attractive and readily alienable than less so simes and smith,law of future interests,berg,cal.at.thus,lease renewal options appropriately remain valid.
here,the parties expressly agreed upon nine consecutive renewal options to the lease term,exercisable according to particular notice requirements.they are not inconsistent with the purpose of the rule against perpetuities because they continue the tenant possession of the property without interruption,thus encouraging the efficient use of the property.the dissent argues that excluding renewal options from the rule coverage will undermine the purposes of the rule,suggesting the possibility of a former tenant retaking possession of the property after its lease has expired dissenting op at.but our holding does not leave open this possibility,for an option exercisable by a former tenant no longer in possession is not a renewal option it is an option to enter into a new lease.in the present case,it is clear that from the lease that,so long as the renewal options existed,the tenant would remain a tenant,lawfully in possession of the property,at least on a month to month basis.there is no sound reason of policy to invalidate such a tenant option to renew.
accordingly,the order of the appellate division should be reversed,with costs,the motion of defendants bleecker jones llc and bleecker jones leasing company for summary judgment granted and judgment granted declaring in accordance with the opinion.

the majority holds that the rule against perpetuities does not apply to options to renew leases majority op at in new york because the rule of perpetuities did not appl y to options to renew leases under the american common law id.at.but the authorities cited by the majority do not demonstrate that options to renew leases enjoyed a blanket exemption from or were outside the purview of the rule against perpetuities under american common law.instead,these authorities show that an option to renew did not run afoul of the historic prohibition against remote vesting,subsequently codified in new york as eptl b,if appurtenant or appendant to the lease,and,in particular,if continuous a perpetual option or covenant to renew.because the option to renew at issue in this case was appurtenant to the lease see symphony space pergola props,i agree with the result reached by my colleagues in the majority,but i can not subscribe to their reasoning.
the majority correctly states that the common law enforced perpetual options to renew leases majority op at first emphasis added second emphasis in original.as professor william berg,explains,
i n the early years of the eighteenth century,
when the modern rule against perpetuities was in its 
formative stage,the highest court in england rendered 
a decision in which it held that a lessor covenant 
to renew a year lease perpetually was not violative of the rule.thereafter,an almost unbroken line of cases in england and america upheld covenants of that type berg,options and the rule against perpetuities,cal l rev,emphasis added.
in his view,a perpetual renewal covenant was not properly classified as an exception to the rule,as many experts claimed rather it was simply outside its province id.at because 
under the view that the rule is designed to destroy indirect restraints upon the practical alienability of property which are brought about by remote nonvested future interests,covenants to renew leases,without time limit,do not suspend the practical power to alienate land.so long as the value of the land does not drop to the point where the rental becomes prohibitive,the lessee always has in himself the legal as well as the practical power to convey that which is substantially a fee simple.on the other hand,when the lease becomes unprofitable,the lessee will give up his right to renew and the lessor will resume complete ownership id.emphasis added see also gray,the rule against perpetuities ed regarding perpetual leases as valid because they give lessees estates akin to fees simple defeasible upon conditions subsequent.
professor berg also noted that,for the lessor,a desire to retain ownership of the land as a good business investment might influence the granting of a lease with a perpetual covenant further o n some occasions the lessor might be motivated by a sentimental unwillingness to part with the land,but in any event it is difficult to twist the transaction so as to impute the desire to create an inalienable interest id.at.
the seminal english case referred to by professor hitchcock bro p c,er house of lords illustrates what a perpetual option to renew a lease looks like and how such a covenant comports with the policy underlying the rule against perpetuities.in,stapleton leased a property owned by bridges known as ember mill,which had fallen greatly out of repair id.at.the lease was for years,but provided 
that if the lessee,his executors,administrators,or assigns,or any of them,should,at any time thenafter,before the expiration of the term thereby demised,be minded to renew and take a further lease of the said premises that then,upon application made,at any time before the last six months of the said term,the appellant,his heirs or assigns,should grant such further lease as should by the lessee,his executors,administrators,or assigns,be desired,without any fine to be demanded therefore,and under the same rents and covenants only as in this lease id.
upon taking possession,stapleton and his partners set to work rebuilding and improving the property they tore down the old corn millhouse and erected a brick millhouse in its stead,as well as a millhouse and mills for manufacturing brass and iron and several other buildings.hitchcock,who by had acquired the whole interest in the premises from stapleton and his partners,reasonably expected to obtain a new lease id.at,but bridges resisted on various grounds.defending the investments made in the property,hitchcock argued that the covenant for perpetual renewal should be enforced by the courts because it was the only foundation and encouragement which the parties had,for expending so much money upon the premises as they had done id.the house of lords agreed.
next,the majority also relies on law review articles by edwin abbot,and professor barton leach to support the proposition that the rule against perpetuities never applied to leases to renew at common law.abbot hypothesizes a lease for over years which contains a covenant for renewal at the option of the lessee o r such a lease contains a covenant for a perpetual series of such renewals abbot,leases and the rule against perpetuities,yale l j.contrary to professor berg,he then states that there seems no escape from the conclusion that such an option if sustained form s an exception to the rule against perpetuities however,he declares,t here seems to be no question that such an option is good emphasis added.it has been consistently sustained over years in england.the great weight of authority in this country is to the same effect id.for english common law authority,abbot cites bridges,which,as previously discussed,involved a perpetual covenant to renew.
for american common law authority,abbot adverts to several cases,including three from new york robinson beard gomez gomez and hoff royal metal furniture ad dept,affd.as judge graffeo points out in her dissent,however,at the time these three cases were decided,new york had a statutory rather than a common law rule against perpetuities.this statutory rule was narrowly applied and excluded options dissenting op at see also symphony space,at p rior to,new york narrow statutory rule against remote vesting did not encompass options citing buffalo seminary mccarthy,th dept,affd.as a result,new york courts were not called upon to decide whether the rule against perpetuities was an obstacle to enforcing the options to renew in robinson,gomez and hoff.in any event,the options were appurtenant to the leases in each of these cases gomez and robinson involved options for successive terms of a period of years hoff,like bridges,involved a perpetual option to renew.
similarly,professor leach comments that in the united states it was well settled that perpetual options to renew leases have always been held valid leach,perpetuities in a nutshell,harv l rev,first emphasis added second emphasis in original see also note,options and the rule against perpetuities,u fla l rev,american jurisdictions today will uniformly protect the option appendant to purchase and the option appendant to renew from the rule against perpetuities camerlo howard johnson,holding that a perpetual lease option was valid under pennsylvania law and noting that t he weight of authority elsewhere holds that,absent a statutory prohibition,a perpetual lease or a right to perpetual renewal of a lease does not violate the rule against perpetuities or create a restraint on alienation citing abbot,leases and the rule against perpetuities,yale l j.the two cases adduced by the and burns city of new york both deal with perpetual options to renew a lease.
finally,the majority opines that an option to renew a lease is exercisable pursuant to the lease agreement and,thus,inherently appurtenant majority op at emphasis added.but there is no reason why an option to renew might not originate in an
