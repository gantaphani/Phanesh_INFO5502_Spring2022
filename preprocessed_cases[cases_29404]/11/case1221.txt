page,line,at,move northrop relies on powerine oil to begin a new paragraph.
page,line,insert the following text here,because the other terms used to describe flood were merely descriptive of floods,or synonymous for flood,rather than separate exclusions,the absence of whether driven by wind or not is not rendered surplusage in the primary policy,nor is it necessary to the excess policy definition,where the term flood is sufficiently broad to encompass the damage northrop suffered.see brodkin state farm fire casualty,d.holding exclusion applied to damage suffered by insureds,though the synonym corrosion or other descriptors was not included,because the plain meaning of the exclusion of leakage or seepage,wear,tear and deterioration covered the damage suffered see also smyth,d at holding that definition of business in primary policy as trade,profession,or occupation did not create an ambiguity,though business was defined in the umbrella policy as trade,occupation,profession or business.
page,line,at,move in addition to begin a new paragraph.
page,line,at,insert the following text neither has northrop cited any cases holding that hurricane storm surge is not within the meaning of a flood exclusion,or holding that the phrase whether driven by wind or not is necessary to signify that storm surge is included within a flood exclusion.
page,line,at,insert the following text moreover,even the definition of named windstorm noted that such storms can cause flood damage,only strengthening the argument that the lay interpretation of flood includes flooding caused by storm surge.
page,line,at,delete the following text neither the absence of the phrase whether driven by wind or not nor the terms wind and named windstorm in the excess policy render the excess policy ambiguous,and therefore we need not consider the extrinsic evidence presented by the parties.see fraley allstate ins,th,d,extrinsic evidence may be admitted to aid in the interpretation of an insurance policy only where the terms are ambiguous.
page,line,at,insert the following text despite the unambiguous policy language,however,we must preliminarily consider northrop extrinsic evidence to determine whether it creates an ambiguity.barris industries,worldvision,cir.for example,northrop points to a sentence in the underwriting detail provided to factory mutual by aon,which states s torm surge loss estimates are included in our windstorm analysis unless mentioned otherwise.this sentence,however,was included on a document specifically addressing only the risks of earthquakes and coastal windstorms striking covered northrop facilities,and,like the named windstorm definition in the primary policy,also described storm surge as flooding.the parties also cite inconclusive and conflicting evidence regarding the treatment of previous storm surge damage caused by hurricanes georges and isabel.neither claim implicated excess policy coverage and the evidence is of little relevance in construing this excess policy.we find the extrinsic evidence insufficient to render the contract susceptible to northrop proffered interpretation of flood as excluding flooding caused by storm surge.see id.
with these amendments,the panel has voted to deny appellee petition for panel rehearing and has recommended denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.the full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing en banc and no judge has requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.fed.
the petition for panel rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are denied.no further petitions for rehearing will be entertained.
factory mutual insurance company appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of northrop grumman corporation.northrop sued the insurance company after factory mutual denied coverage for water damage at northrop mississippi subsidiary caused by hurricane katrina.factory mutual argued that coverage for water damage was barred by an exclusion for flooding in the policy,but the district court held that the exclusion was ambiguous and construed it in favor of northrop.we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of northrop,and remand for a determination of whether california efficient proximate cause doctrine mandates coverage of the damage notwithstanding our interpretation of the contractual language.
facts and proceedings below 
a.the parties and the insurance policies at issue 
northrop grumman is a global defense contractor with approximately employees worldwide.its mississippi subsidiary,northrop grumman ship systems,is headquartered in pascagoula,mississippi and has operations throughout the gulf area.northrop maintains a risk management department,and is represented by aon risk services in the insurance marketplace.
aon was responsible for brokering northrop property insurance for april to april.in february,aon prepared and submitted an underwriting detail to prospective insurers.the underwriting detail explained that northrop sought blanket insurance for billion in properties,and proposed that the insurance be layered.the primary layer,termed all risk including earthquake,flood,boiler machinery,would provide comprehensive property insurance with a general limit of million,and certain,such as a million sublimit per flood occurrence.the excess layer,described as all risk including boiler machinery excluding earthquake and flood,would cover additional losses up to the billion total value of northrop property,but would not include earthquake or flood coverage.the suggested premiums were for the primary layer,and for the excess layer.
factory mutual received the underwriting detail and provided northrop with a quote for participation in the first million of the primary layer,and full participation in the excess layer.northrop accepted the quote and factory mutual transmitted the primary and excess policies to northrop.
the primary policy,derived from a hybrid mutual form was an all risk policy,insuring northrop against all risk of physical loss or damage to property unless otherwise excluded.the policy included a glossary section which defined various terms,including certain types of losses,such as flood,wind,and named windstorm.the policy defined flood as 
all physical loss or damage caused by or resulting from flood waters,rising waters,waves,tide or tidal water,surface waters,or the rising,overflowing,or breaking of boundaries of lakes,reservoirs,rivers,streams or other bodies of water,whether driven by wind or not,including spray and sewer resulting from any of the foregoing,all regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any other sequence of loss.
wind was defined as d irect action of wind including substance driven by wind.named windstorm was separately defined as 
t he direct action of wind including any substance driven by wind,flood when such wind or flood is associated with or occurs in conjunction with a storm or weather disturbance which is identified by name prior to loss by any meteorological authority such as the national weather service or national hurricane center.
the excess policy,which was derived from factual mutual own advantage form,was also an all risk policy.the excess policy provided northrop with billion of insurance in excess of the million covered by the primary policy,and insured northrop for all risks unless specifically excluded.the excess policy excluded loss or damage caused by various occurrences,including flood the flood exclusion.flood was defined as 
flood surface waters rising waters waves tide or tidal water the release of water,the rising,overflowing or breaking of boundaries of natural or bodies of water or the spray therefrom or sewer resulting from any of the foregoing regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any other sequence of loss.however,physical damage by fire,explosion or sprinkler leakage resulting from flood is not considered to be loss by flood within the terms and conditions of this policy.
neither named windstorm damage nor wind damage was defined or otherwise referenced in the excess policy.
hurricane katrina and the damage to northrop shipyards 
on august,hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast,making landfall near the border.katrina was one of the strongest storms to impact the coast of the united states in the past years,with wind speeds of up to nearly miles per hour and an accompanying storm surge that inundated parts of louisiana,alabama,and mississippi northrop ship building subsidiaries located in the gulf region were severely damaged by the storm.the majority of the loss occurred at the pascagoula,mississippi shipyards,where the storm surge was as high as feet.according to the shipyard manager,steve pierce,the pascagoula yard sustained water damage to transporters,translation cars,electrical systems,and other property,as well as wind damage to the roofs of the buildings.photographs on the day of the hurricane showed trucks in the shipyard halfway submerged in water,and pierce estimated that buildings were covered in six to ten feet of water in some parts of the shipyard.northrop preliminary estimates put the damage to its property as a result of the hurricane at,primarily attributable to the damage at the pascagoula shipyards.
northrop timely notified its insurers of the loss it suffered from hurricane katrina.factory mutual paid northrop million under the primary policy,but informed northrop that it was planning to examine the damages under the excess policy as two separate perils a loss caused by wind,which has no limitation on the amount of coverage,and a loss caused by flood,which was not covered at all due to the flood exclusion.
c.this litigation 
on november,northrop filed suit against factory mutual in california state court,demanding coverage for the water damage under the excess policy.factory mutual removed the case to the central district of california,and the parties filed for partial summary judgment on northrop cause of action for declaratory,whether the flood exclusion in the excess policy barred coverage for the water damage from hurricane katrina.
on august,the district court granted northrop motion for partial summary judgment.the court agreed with northrop that the flood exclusion was ambiguous because it did not plainly and clearly reference hurricanes or damage caused by wind.the court then deferred to what it found to be northrop reasonable interpretation of the flood it was limited to floods not caused by wind.
factory mutual filed an unopposed motion for entry of final judgment under.b.the district court found no cause for delay and granted the motion on november.factory mutual timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,under the same standards applied by the district court.we must determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,any genuine issues of material fact exist,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.fazio city and county of san francisco,cir.

though insurance contracts have special features,the general rules of contract interpretation still apply in california bank of the superior court,cal th,d,mackinnon truck ins,cal th,d.the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the mutual intent of the parties at the time the contract was formed.id.at citing cal.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,from the written provisions of the contract based on their ordinary and popular sense,unless a technical sense or special meaning is given to them by their usage.id.at citing cal.if the contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.aiu ins.superior court,cal d.ambiguous terms are generally construed against insurers,but a policy provision is ambiguous only if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions despite the plain meaning of its terms within the context of the policy as a whole.palmer truck ins,cal th,d,cal.we will not artificially create ambiguity where none exists.if a reasonable interpretation favors the insurer and any other interpretation would be strained,no compulsion exists to torture or twist the language of the policy.evans safeco life ins,cir quoting allstate ins.ellison,cir.
in this case,an examination of the written provisions of the excess policy,understood in their ordinary and popular sense,leads to the result that the flood exclusion encompasses the water damage to northrop shipyards.the first word used to define the term flood in the excess policy was flood.both lay and legal dictionaries characterize flood as an overflowing or inundation of water over usually dry land.see american heritage dictionary of the english language ed a n overflowing of water onto land that is normally dry collegiate dictionary ed a rising and overflowing of a body of water esp.onto normally dry land black law dictionary ed a n inundation of water over land not usually covered by it 
courts have endorsed these dictionary meanings of flood as the ordinary,plain meaning of the word.see,sher lafayette ins,so d,wl.april,the plain,ordinary,and generally prevailing meaning of the word flood is the overflow of a body of water causing a large amount of water to cover an area that is usually dry.kane royal ins.of,relying on dictionaries to define flood as an overflowing of water on an area normally dry stover united states,a flood is water which inundates an area of the surface of the earth where it ordinarily would not be expected to be,aff,cir.we follow the same approach here,and find that the water damage to northrop shipyards falls squarely within the ordinary and plain meaning of flood.the shipyards,which were covered in up to ten feet of water,unquestionably experienced an inundation of water over normally dry land,and therefore experienced a flood within the meaning of the excess policy.see kane,at the inundation of insureds normally dry land falls squarely within the generally accepted definitions of the term flood.moreover,the other terms used to define flood in the excess policy rising waters,waves,and tide or tidal water also describe the type of damage northrop experienced.see,leonard n
