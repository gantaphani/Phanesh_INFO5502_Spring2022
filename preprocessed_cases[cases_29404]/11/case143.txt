following a bench trial,the district court adjudged premier holidays international,and its principal,daniel delpiano,jointly and severally liable for fraud,breach of contract,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the court awarded microfinancial,and its subsidiary,leasecomm corporation hereafter collectively mfi damages in the amount of.the defendants appeal,assigning error to the denial of a motion to stay and to the admission of certain expert testimony.finding these assignments of error unpersuasive,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
the background facts are straightforward.mfi is a massachusetts corporation that operates a commercial finance business.on august,it entered into a business loan agreement with premier,a florida corporation engaged in the marketing of vacation packages.pursuant to the agreement,mfi extended a revolving line of credit and premier executed a promissory note secured by delpiano personal guaranty and by all outstanding consumer note agreements represented by premier to be notes executed by members of its vacation club and payable to it.the business loan agreement provided in substance that premier ability to draw down the line of credit at any given time would depend upon a formula that took into account the present value of consumer notes outstanding.
over the course of the next year,the parties entered into additional agreements that gradually increased the available line of credit.ultimately,mfi agreed to boost the credit line to,based on delpiano representation that premier held approximately consumer notes averaging each of which were current.to ensure that the proceeds of those notes would first be applied to pay premier debt to mfi,the parties established a facility,serviced by ncc business services and its successor,noble enterprises.under this arrangement,was to receive the payments made by premier customers on the consumer notes,deposit the funds into designated accounts,and disburse loan payments to mfi from those accounts as they became due.would then release any surplus funds to premier.
as the on the line of credit ballooned,mfi became increasingly concerned about the security of its loan.to allay this concern,premier provided additional collateral in july of.the additional collateral took the form of a financial performance bond underwritten by sentinel insurance company an independent insurer incorporated under the laws of bermuda.shortly after the bond was posted,mfi allowed premier to exhaust the entire line of credit.
on october,premier missed a required payment of.mfi asked premier for the funds.when premier failed to honor its obligation,mfi turned to sentinel,which defaulted on its bond.invoking diversity jurisdiction,see a,mfi then brought suit against sentinel in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,alleging breach of contract.in short order,mfi added premier and delpiano as defendants those parties,in turn,took the offensive and sued mfi in a georgia state court.mfi removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,see id,and asserted counterclaims for fraud,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and the like.that suit was subsequently transferred to massachusetts and consolidated with mfi original action.see id.a.
the case progressed slowly.much of the delay was attributable to the defendants discovery and to a variety of other stalling tactics.while the litigation inched along,the district court issued a pretrial order on april.that order required,inter alia,that each party give notice of any objection to the qualifications of the other parties experts on or before november.neither premier nor delpiano filed any such objection.
days before the scheduled trial date,the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the civil action.the motion made vague references to a grand jury investigation of delpiano and premier an investigation that supposedly was entwined with mfi claims against them.although the defendants voiced fifth amendment concerns,the district court summarily denied the motion.
after the defendants unsuccessfully sought shelter in the bankruptcy court,a bench trial commenced.the district court took testimony over two days,reserved decision,wrote a thoughtful rescript,and found in favor of mfi against both defendants on the fraud,contract,and good faith and fair dealing claims.microfinancial,premier holidays int l,slip op.at,unpublished.the court also dismissed with prejudice all the defendants claims against mfi.id.the court entered judgment for mfi in the amount of and this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the defendants assign error to the district court denial of their motion to stay and to the court decision to permit the testimony of a financial expert,gerald killion,anent the facility.we consider each remonstrance in turn.
a.the motion to stay.
the defendants make two arguments one procedural and one substantive concerning the lower court denial of their motion to stay.we start with their procedural argument that the district court erred in failing to issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law in connection with its ruling.this argument is jejune.
in staking out this position,the defendants posit that.a requires written findings of fact and conclusions of law in this sort of situation.the rule states in relevant part that in granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action.a.the defendants suggest that the term interlocutory injunctions includes motions to stay.this conveniently capacious interpretation blithely overlooks the rule admonition that f indings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under rule or or any other motion except as provided in subdivision c of this rule.id.emphasis supplied.subdivision c is not relevant to a motion for a stay it applies only to judgments made on partial findings during a bench trial.see.c.
the avowed purpose of adding this sentence to rule a was to remove any doubt that findings and conclusions are unnecessary upon decision of a motion.advisory committee note amendment.a plain reading of the added language places the defendants motion for a stay within the category of any other motion for which written findings of fact and conclusions of law are not required.
the case law confirms this intuition.numerous opinions make a clear distinction between an injunction and a stay.for example,in holding that the denial of a stay was not appealable under a,the supreme court stated that a n order by a federal court that relates only to the conduct or progress of the litigation before that court ordinarily is not considered an injunction.gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d.in the same context of appealability,this court has stated that the grant of a stay pending developments in a parallel action is neither final nor equivalent to an injunction.acton borden,cir.these decisions reinforce our conclusion that the plain language of rule a means what it says.
that ends this aspect of the matter.we hold,without serious question,that the district court did not err in eschewing written findings of fact and conclusions of law in connection with its ruling on the defendants motion to stay.
this brings us to the substance of the challenged ruling.it is apodictic that federal courts possess the inherent power to stay proceedings for prudential reasons.landis am.marquis fdic,cir.the pendency of a parallel or related criminal proceeding can constitute such a reason.see hewlett packard berg,cir.
the decision whether or not to stay civil litigation in deference to parallel criminal proceedings is discretionary.acton,at.accordingly,we review the denial of a motion to stay for abuse of discretion.arthurs stern,cir.a movant must carry a heavy burden to succeed in such an endeavor.see austin unarco,cir explaining that the movant must demonstrate a clear case of hardship to be entitled to a discretionary stay.
there is no question that a trial judge can facilitate the
