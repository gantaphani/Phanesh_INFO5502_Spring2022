plaintiff karl schumann,proceeding as a qui tam relator under the false claims act fca,et,and corresponding state laws,appeals the district court orders granting motions to dismiss by defendants bristol meyers squib company,du pont de nemours and company,and dupont pharmaceuticals company together,bms,and defendants astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp and astrazeneca lp together,az.schumann alleges defendants improperly induced medco health solutions,his employer,to offer certain of defendants drugs in its pharmacies and in health plans it managed did not include those inducements when calculating the best price for their drugs,and thus submitted inaccurate best price reports to the government overcharged the government based on those inaccurate best prices and underpaid rebates owed based on those inaccurate best prices.
the district court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over schumann claims because he did not have the requisite direct and independent knowledge to satisfy the original source exception to the fca public disclosure bar.as a result,the court dismissed schumann claims with prejudice.we will affirm.
background 
fca statutory framework 
as we have previously explained in great detail,the fca makes it unlawful to knowingly submit a fraudulent claim to the government.see,united states ex rel.paranich sorgnard,cir united states ex rel.dunleavy cnty.of,cir united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,prudential ins,cir.the qui tam provision of the fca,permits,in certain circumstances,suits by private parties on behalf of the united states against anyone submitting a false claim to the government.prior to,such suits were barred if the information on which they were based was already in the government possession.hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d.
in,congress amended the fca to encourage private plaintiffs relators,in fca parlance to bring civil cases if they had information that someone had defrauded the government.see false claims amendments act fcaa,stat.codified at graham cnty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,d.but,to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits,graham,at,congress added the public disclosure bar to withdraw jurisdiction over,among other things,suits based on information that had been previously disclosed unless the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.fcaa codified at e a see also united states ex rel.atkinson.shipbuilding,cir describing purpose behind fcaa and public disclosure bar.congress defined an original source as an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.fcaa codified at e b.
medicaid and related statutory framework 
under the medicaid drug rebate program,a participating drug manufacturer agrees to pay rebates to state medicaid programs in exchange for those programs covering the cost of a manufacturer drugs.see omnibus reconciliation act of,stat.codified as amended at see also astra usa,santa clara,d.the department of health and human services hhs determines the amount of the rebate using a statutory formula based on a manufacturer average and best prices for a particular drug.see,c.each manufacturer calculates these prices which is a complex enterprise requiring recourse to detailed information about the company sales and pricing,astra.at citing k and submits them to hhs each quarter,b.hhs may not disclose a manufacturer reported prices except in certain circumstances.astra.at citing b d.
pertinent here,a drug maker participating in medicaid must also comply with section of the public health service act,a.that section prohibits a manufacturer from charging certain programs that receive federal funds more than the average price for its drugs,as defined by the medicaid drug rebate program,less a specified rebate percentage.see astra.at.in addition,the federal statute aks prohibits a drug maker from knowingly offering any remuneration to induce others to cause the government to pay for its drugs.medicare and medicaid patient protection act,stat,codified at b 
at all relevant times,bms participated in medicaid drug rebate program with regard to its anticoagulant coumadin,and az participated in the program with regard to its proton pump inhibitors ppis nexium and prilosec.both companies also participated in the section program with those drugs,and sold those drugs to government health care programs.therefore,the companies were prohibited from,and subject to liability under the fca for,misreporting their average and best prices for those drugs,or the government based on those prices,and improperly inducing others to cause the government to pay for their drugs.see,united states ex rel.wilkins united health,cir finding fca claim properly pleaded where plaintiff alleged defendant claim for payment was false due to a violation of the aks hutchins wilentz,goldman spitzer,cir noting fca liability attaches to conduct that causes or would cause government economic loss.
facts and procedural history 
from to,schumann was vice president of pharmaceutical contracting for medco,a large national pharmacy benefit manager pbm.as a pbm,medco manages pharmacies and pharmacy benefits for health plans,including those offered by various federal and state government entities to qualifying employees,and contracts with drug makers,including bms and az,to offer their products in the health plans medco manages.health plans retain pbms such as medco to efficiently manage their benefit plans and to achieve cost savings by negotiating discounts or rebates from drug manufacturers,providing mail order prescription service to plan members,contracting with retail pharmacies for reimbursement when prescriptions are filled for plan members,and electronic processing and paying of claims.in re pharmacy benefit mgrs.antitrust,cir.as a result,medco had the power to determine whether bms and az products would be available to patients covered by plans it managed,to negotiate the price at which such products would be available,and to influence the average and best prices for bms and az products.
schumann filed his initial complaint under seal in the eastern district of pennsylvania on september,on behalf of the federal government,eleven states,and the district of columbia.schumann subsequently filed under seal a first amended complaint on november,and a second amended complaint on november.on june,after the government declined to intervene,the district court lifted the seal for all matters occurring on or after that date and accepted schumann third amended complaint tac for filing.
bms moved to dismiss the tac under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,arguing schumann was not an original source under the fca and had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.schumann responded by seeking leave to further amend his complaint to address the issues in bms motion and to avoid any delay resulting from a dismissal without prejudice.the court granted schumann request and denied bms motion as moot.schumann then filed the corrected fourth amended complaint cfac,the operative pleading.
in the cfac,schumann alleges that,from december until march,bms induced medco to make coumadin the exclusive anticoagulant in its pharmacies by paying sham data fees and rebates up to off coumadin wholesale price.schumann further alleges bms improperly omitted those payments when calculating medco cost for coumadin,thereby avoiding setting a new best price for the drug and inaccurately reporting its best price to the government.
schumann states that he learned of bms conduct through his job at medco.more precisely,he pleads facts indicating that he reviewed confidential agreements between medco and bms providing for data fees and rebates,discussed the history of those agreements with medco and bms officials,and negotiated extensions of those agreements including an increase in medco rebate.he further asserts that bms paid medco such high rebates and fees because it intended to provide kickbacks while evading applicable reporting statutes.
schumann further alleges that from through,az used improper rebates and payments to induce medco to offer prilosec and nexium as the exclusive ppis in medco pharmacies,and to prefer those drugs in the formularies of two health plans medco managed.specifically,schumann alleges az withheld prilosec rebates unless medco placed nexium on its preferred formulary,paid rebates on prilosec if medco preferred nexium over generic ppis,reduced medco cost of prilosec and nexium to match the cost of generics,and charged medco the cost of a generic if medco substituted prilosec for a generic prescription.in addition,schumann alleges az improperly paid medco and health plans it managed million under two agreements,via an educational grant to push prilosec,million to market nexium,and to subsidize use of the az program rational med.finally,schumann alleges az improperly failed to incorporate these rebates and payments into its calculations,and thereby submitted false reports and caused the government to overpay for az drugs.schumann states that he learned about az improper activity in his role at medco.specifically,he says he gained the knowledge by reviewing contracts between medco and az and internal medco documents describing the history of the companies dealings discussing rebates,formulary placement,agreements,and other payment vehicles with medco colleagues and az officials negotiating extensions of various agreements and structuring them to entice health plans managed by medco to favor az ppis and,at az behest,encouraging those plans to favor az ppis.in addition,he asserts that it was az intent to bribe medco and plans it managed to favor az ppis and to structure deals to evade reporting obligations.
based on these allegations,the cfac brings four fca claims against each defendant,under and inaccurate theories of liability first,schumann contends defendants knowingly presented or caused to be presented to the government false claims for payment.see a.second,he contends defendants knowingly made or used,or caused to be made or used,false records or statements that caused false claims to be paid or approved by the government.see id.a.third,he contends defendants knowingly conspired with medco and others to violate sections a and.see id.a.finally,he contends defendants avoided or decreased their obligations to pay the government by knowingly making or using false records or statements,or by causing such records to be made or used.see id.a.
defendants separately moved to dismiss the cfac with prejudice.bms again moved under rule b,arguing the fca public disclosure bar divested the court of jurisdiction,and both bms and az moved under rule b,arguing schumann had not pleaded the facts underlying his claims with sufficient particularity.schumann opposed both defendants motions.the court granted bms motion,finding that schumann claims against bms were substantially similar to prior public disclosures and that schumann lacked the requisite knowledge to be an original source under the fca.the court also found that amending the cfac would be futile and therefore dismissed schumann claims with prejudice.the court denied az motion,however,because it found that schumann had alleged az fraud with sufficient particularity.
schumann timely moved for reconsideration as to claims against bms,arguing that he satisfied the fca original source exception in support of his motion,schumann submitted a declaration purporting to add facts that he had omitted from the cfac.in pertinent part,he stated he had learned of bms conduct by reviewing existing agreements and internal documents in medco files,discussing them with medco colleagues,negotiating rebate and data fee agreements with bms,and comparing the terms of those agreements with others he had seen in his years in the industry.he further stated that in negotiations that had occurred before he arrived at medco,and in those in which he participated,bms officials had expressed concern about setting a new best price for coumadin.finally,he stated that he had deduced,based on his cumulative knowledge and the supposed irrationality of the terms to which bms had agreed,that bms was illegally paying kickbacks to medco and misreporting coumadin best price.in a written decision,the court declined to consider schumann supplemental declaration,because it was not new evidence,and denied his motion for reconsideration.
az then moved to dismiss the cfac under rule b.schumann opposed the motion and submitted a page declaration to further explain his duties at medco and how he learned about az allegedly inappropriate conduct.specifically,he described reviewing internal files and documents speaking with medco colleagues and officials from az and plans managed by medco participating in rebate and formulary negotiations with az and those plans and encouraging those plans to accept az inducements and to prefer its ppis.he also added that his knowledge of az dealings and his experience in the industry led him to conclude that az was paying kickbacks to medco and health plans it managed,and skirting its obligations.the court granted az motion,finding that schumann claims against az,like those against bms,were based on publicly disclosed information and that he was not an original source under the fca.the court also dismissed schumann claims against az with prejudice because it found further amendment of the cfac would be futile.schumann timely appealed dismissal of all claims in the cfac.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
schumann brought his fca claims in federal court pursuant to u.we have jurisdiction to review the district court final orders under.
standard of review 
this court exercises plenary review over a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.paranich,at citing stinson,at.
the parties agree that az motion to dismiss was a factual attack on jurisdiction,but they disagree about whether bms motion to dismiss was a facial or factual attack.the distinction is theoretically important because a court may consider matters outside the pleadings in a factual challenge,but must take the complaint at face value and construe it as true in a facial challenge.see atkinson,at citing gould electronics united states,cir.here,however,the distinction makes no difference as we detail below,neither the cfac allegations alone,nor those allegations plus schumann supplemental declarations,meet his burden to satisfy that he is an original source of his claims against either bms or.see atkinson,at noting relator burden to plead or prove jurisdiction.
original source 
we have previously expounded on what it means to have both direct and independent knowledge under the original source exception to the fca public disclosure bar.see stinson,at noting conjunctive and indicates direct and independent each impose distinct requirements.direct knowledge is knowledge obtained without any intervening agency,instrumentality,or influence immediate.atkinson,at quoting stinson,at.such knowledge has also been described as,seen with the relator own eyes,unmediated by anything but the relator own labor,and by the relator own efforts,and not by the labors of others,and not derivative of the information of others.paranich,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also stinson,at citing with approval cases finding information is not direct if learned from a whistleblowing insider or by stumbl ing across an interesting court file.the independent knowledge requirement means that knowledge of the fraud can not be merely dependent on a public disclosure.paranich,at quoting united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir.in other words,a relator who would not have learned of the information absent public disclosure does not have independent information under the fca.stinson,at.
we have also described the type of information a relator must know directly and independently.in stinson,for example,we explained that 
undoubtedly,it is not necessary for a relator to have all the relevant information in order to qualify as
