introduction 
starrag and,collectively starrag appeal from the district court order granting partial summary judgment and applying the per package liability limitation under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa to three machines shipped with maersk,that were damaged while being transported across a container yard operated by maersk pacific,a terminal operator.starrag argues that the package limitation can not apply to damage that occurred after maersk unloaded the machines from their ship,and that application of the limitation conflicts with the cogsa and a related statute,the harter act in addition,starrag claims that the term delivery in maersk combined transport bill of lading ctbl is ambiguous,and therefore should be read to restrict the package limitation to damage occurring after the machines were loaded onto the ship and before the cargo was unloaded.
we affirm the district court,holding maersk did not need to provide actual notice to starrag that the ctbl contractually extended the terms of cogsa outside of the tackle to tackle period contractually extending the package limitation does not conflict with the cogsa or the harter act and the district court properly interpreted the term delivery in a manner consistent with both maritime law and the terms of the short form sea short form and the ctbl.

discussion 
the cogsa limits damages against a carrier for loss or damage to goods in transit to,stating 
neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding per package lawful money of the united states,or in case of goods not shipped in packages,per customary freight unit,or the equivalent of that sum in other currency,unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.this declaration,if embodied in the bill of lading,shall be prima facie evidence,but shall not be conclusive on the carrier.
by agreement between the carrier,master,or agent of the carrier,and the shipper another maximum amount than that mentioned in this paragraph may be fixed provided,that such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named.in no event shall the carrier be liable for more than the amount of damage actually sustained.cogsa essentially,the package limitation presents the shipper with a choice to accept the liability limitation in exchange for a lower rate for shipping,or to declare a higher value and pay a higher rate.see norfolk southern railway kirby,d a s is common in the industry,kirby accepted a contractual liability limitation for icc below the machinery true value,resulting,presumably,in lower shipping rates.
ordinarily,the cogsa only applies from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.cogsa e see mori seiki usa,alligator triumph,cir by its own terms,cogsa limits liability for cargo damage to,if the damage occurs between the time the cargo is loaded on to the ship and the time it is discharged from the ship tackle to tackle.pan am.world airways,california stevedore ballast,cir noting cogsa applies from the time the ship tackle is hooked onto the cargo at the port of loading until the time when cargo is released from the tackle at the port of discharge.section of the cogsa explicitly states,however,that 
nothing contained in cogsa shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement,stipulation,condition,reservation,or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to or in connection with the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by sea.
cogsa.therefore,the cogsa expressly permits parties to a maritime shipping contract to provide for liability limitations beyond the tackle to tackle period for damage that occurs prior to loading or after unloading of the goods from the ship.
in this case,the short form begins by stating,t he contract evidenced by this waybill is subject to the exceptions,limitations,conditions and liberties including those relating to and set out in maersk sealand current combined transport bill of lading.the short form therefore incorporates by reference the ctbl language in paragraph also known as a period of responsibility clause,see sompo japan ins.of am.union pac,cir,stating that maersk liability shall be determined according to the cogsa w here loss or damage has occurred between the time of receipt of the goods by the carrier at the port of loading and the time of delivery by the carrier at the port of discharge,or during any prior or subsequent period of carriage by water as a matter of contract interpretation,this language extends cogsa liability limitation beyond its statutory terms to activities before and after the tackle to tackle period,including up to the time of delivery.
starrag main contention is that the failure of the short form that was provided to starrag to explicitly state that the ctbl that was merely made available to starrag contractually extends the cogsa package limitation through delivery of the goods causes it to conflict with the cogsa and therefore the package limitation can not be enforced.
a short form bill of lading may incorporate by reference the terms in a long form bill of lading without providing specific notice of those terms so long as the incorporated provisions are not special terms or exceptions that differ from the governing federal statutes.see comsource indep.foodservice union pac,cir citing encyclopaedia britannica,kong producer,cir.if a short form bill of lading fails to give notice of a term in a long form bill of lading that is inconsistent with a statute,a court may refuse to enfor
