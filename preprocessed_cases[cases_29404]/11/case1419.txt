appellant,betty k agencies,betty k,challenges the district court sua sponte order dismissing with prejudice its maritime claims against appellees tidal wave limited tidal wave and monada monada.because the district court dismissed the case with prejudice as a sanction for failure to answer a counterclaim and perfect service of process,without finding that betty k acted with willful or contumacious disregard for court rules,and without finding that lesser sanctions were somehow inadequate,we vacate the district court dismissal order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
betty k is in the business of transporting marine cargo between miami and nassau,bahamas.in,betty k entered into an agreement with tidal wave to charter the defendant monada,a cargo vessel.soon thereafter,and with days remaining in the charter period,the vessel engine failed,rendering the vessel inoperable for the remainder of the charter period.betty k requested from tidal wave in unearned charter hire and in advances made to the vessel while in service.tidal wave refused to return the requested funds,whereupon betty k commenced suit in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.
betty k sued the monada,in rem,and tidal wave,in personam,on april,and moved for an order directing issuance of a warrant of arrest.the next day,the district court issued a warrant of arrest for the vessel,but before the marshal could arrest the vessel,tidal wave filed an emergency motion stating that this vessel is voluntarily submitting to the court jurisdiction,and the disruption caused by an arrest is not necessary.at an emergency hearing before the district court,tidal wave agreed on behalf of the vessel to post an adequate security bond in lieu of arrest in the amount of.on april,the marshal,not surprisingly,returned the arrest warrant unexecuted,explaining defendant posted bond.court advised not to arrest.return unexecuted.
on april,tidal wave filed and served on betty k its answer,affirmative defenses,and counterclaims.it is undisputed that betty k did not file its answer to the counterclaim with the clerk of court the parties dispute whether betty k served its answer on tidal wave.betty k claims to have served counsel by hand with an answer to the counterclaim in court at the emergency hearing counsel for tidal wave denies this.no hearing was conducted nor were findings made by the district court as to whether an answer was served on tidal wave.
the parties continued to litigate their claims before the district court even after the date on which betty k answer was due,and no motion to compel an answer or dismiss was ever filed by any party.indeed,nothing in the record suggests that,during that time,the court or the litigants were aware of betty k failure to respond to tidal wave counterclaim.nevertheless,on july,the district court,sua sponte,entered its terse dismissal order stating 
plaintiff failed to respond as required by.and.a.in addition,the court notes that service was never perfected as to defendant movada sic.after reviewing the record and being otherwise advised of the premises,it is hereby ordered and adjudged that this action is dismissed with prejudice.
no further explanation was offered.
soon thereafter,on august,betty k,pursuant to rule b,timely filed a motion to vacate arguing that the district court mistakenly concluded,based on the docket entry reflecting incomplete service on the monada,that the vessel was not properly before the court,even though posting the bond established the district court in rem jurisdiction and,betty k committed excusable neglect by failing to file its answer with the court.betty k said that,in any event,the draconian remedy of dismissing with prejudice the entire complaint was the wrong remedy.the district court denied betty k motion to vacate,citing as its sole reason betty k failure to answer tidal wave counterclaim.in its entirety,the order read as follows 
this cause came before the court upon plaintiff betty k agencies,motion to vacate or,alternatively,to alter and amend final order of dismissal and denying all pending motions as moot,filed august.the court having carefully considered the case file and being duly advised,plaintiff motion is denied.
plaintiff avers in its emergency motion that the response to the defendants counterclaim was hand delivered at an emergency hearing held on april.plaintiff motion at.pursuant to.a,a party must serve a reply to a counterclaim within twenty days after service of the answer.all papers after the complaint required to be answered shall be filed with the clerk where the assigned judge is chambered either before service or within three business days,thereafter.plaintiff failed to provide any demonstrable evidence that it has complied with the.or the.moreover,the docket does not provide any evidence that the plaintiff filed and served its response to defendants counterclaim,as required.
it is therefore ordered and adjudged that plaintiff request for emergency motion to stay enforcement of order is hereby denied.
betty k has timely appealed both the dismissal order and the order denying plaintiff motion to vacate.

although the district court nowhere specified the authority upon which it relied to sua sponte dismiss betty k case,in these circumstances a court may dismiss a case with prejudice based on two possible sources of authority rule b,or the court inherent power to manage its docket.rule b provides for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court,a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.b.the supreme court also has held that t he authority of a court to dismiss sua sponte for lack of prosecution has generally been considered an inherent power,governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs link wabash,d.
although the plain language of rule b suggests that a court may act pursuant to that rule only when dismissing upon the motion of the defendant,and acts only on its inherent authority when dismissing sua sponte,many of our decisions elide this neat distinction.for example,in hildebrand honeywell,cir the former fifth circuit reviewed a dismissal upon motion,but stated that a court may sua sponte dismiss a case with prejudice under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.accord world thrust films,int l family entm t,cir reversing sua sponte dismissal for failure to comply with court rules,and citing rule b as the source of the district court authority lopez aransas county indep.sch,cir affirming sua sponte dismissal and stating that u nder rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure a case may be dismissed with prejudice and a lthough the rule is phrased in terms of dismissal on the motion of the defendant,it is clear that the power is inherent in the court and may be exercised sua sponte.at least one decision,however,has drawn a clear distinction between the two sources of authority rule b allows a defendant to seek the dismissal of an action in addition to the authority granted by rule b,a federal district court possesses the inherent authority to dismiss an action for want of prosecution gonzalez firestone tire rubber,cir.
this much,however,is clear a dismissal with prejudice,whether on motion or sua sponte,is an extreme sanction that may be properly imposed only when a party engages in a clear pattern of delay or willful contempt contumacious conduct and the district court specifically finds that lesser sanctions would not suffice.world thrust films,at accord gratton great am.commc,cir mingo sugar cane growers.of,cir cohen carnival cruise lines,cir goforth,at jones graham,cir gonzalez,at hildebrand,at boaz
