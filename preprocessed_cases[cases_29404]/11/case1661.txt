kanzen tetsu sdn.kanzen appeals the decision of the united states court of international trade sustaining the final affirmative antidumping duty determination issued by the department of commerce commerce.alloy piping,united states,d.kanzen argues that commerce was required to correct an alleged error in its final determination.we hold that commerce refusal to correct the alleged error was not arbitrary and capricious,because kanzen itself was the source of the error kanzen did not call attention to the error until after the issuance of the final determination and there was no showing that the error was or would have been apparent to commerce before it issued the final determination.we therefore affirm the decision of the court of international trade.
background 
commerce is required to impose antidumping duties on foreign merchandise that is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than its fair value.micron,united states.commerce determines antidumping duties by first calculating the dumping margin,which is the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.a koyo seiko united states.commerce is then obligated by statute to use the dumping margin as the basis for the assessment of countervailing or antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the antidumping determination and for deposits of estimated duties.koyo seiko,at quoting a c.a duty is then imposed if the international trade commission itc determines that an industry in the united states is materially injured,or is threatened with material injury or the establishment of an industry in the united states is materially retarded by the sale of foreign products at less than fair value.a.
the export price or constructed export price referred to in section a is the price charged by importers in the united states.micron,at.by statute,certain upward and downward adjustments must be made to the export price before calculating the dumping margin.pertinent to this appeal,commerce must reduce the export price by expenses that result from,and bear a direct relationship to,the sale,such as credit expenses.d b.hence,a large credit expense per sale will result in a lower export price and a greater dumping margin.
by statute,commerce must establish a procedure for the correction of ministerial errors that may occur in its final determinations 
the administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section.such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors.as used in this subsection,the term ministerial error includes errors in addition,subtraction,or other arithmetic function,clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying,duplication,or the like,and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.
pursuant to this statute,commerce has promulgated a regulation providing that a party to the proceeding to whom the secretary has disclosed calculations performed in connection with a final determination or the final results of a review may submit comments concerning any ministerial error in such calculations.c.under the regulation,parties must file comments concerning ministerial errors within five days of the disclosure of the final dumping margin calculations.id.c.parties can also apply for an extension,allowing them to file ministerial error comments five days after the publication of the final determination.id.c.the regulation further provides t he secretary will analyze any comments received and,if appropriate correct any ministerial error by amending the final determination.id.e.the definition of ministerial error is identical to that found in the statute an error in addition,subtraction,or other arithmetic function,clerical error resulting from inaccurate copying,duplication,or the like,and any other similar type of unintentional error which the secretary considers ministerial.id.f.neither the statute nor the regulation specifies whether the definition of ministerial error includes errors made by private parties in the proceeding.
on december,the private appellees in this action,alloy piping products,flowline division,markovitz enterprises,gerlin,and taylor forge stainless,filed a petition with commerce asking that it investigate the importation of pipe fittings from germany,italy,malaysia,and the philippines.commerce initiated the antidumping investigation on january,to determine whether pipe fittings imported from those countries should be assessed an antidumping duty.stainless steel pipe fittings from germany,italy,malaysia and the philippines,fed.reg,dep t commerce,initiation of antidumping duty investigations.on february,the itc determined that there was a reasonable indication that an industry in the united states was being materially injured by reason of imports of the subject merchandise from malaysia.alloy piping,d at.
as one of the importers from malaysia subject to the investigation,on may,kanzen submitted to commerce information on its sales in the united states in the form of a spreadsheet document.in this initial submission,kanzen left blank the spreadsheet fields for credit expenses related to united states sales.commerce twice required kanzen to submit supplemental responses,because,among other reasons,kanzen had either left blank certain fields in the spreadsheet or had entered negative figures or zero.commerce did not specifically mention the credit expense field.kanzen submitted its supplemental responses in the form of revised spreadsheets on june,and july.in both of these supplemental responses,the field for entry of credit expenses remained blank.it is not clear from the record whether the supplemental responses consisted of computer printouts or if they also included electronic databases,and if so,whether they were in microsoft excel or in some other format.
commerce issued a preliminary determination on august.commerce determined that it would not be practicable to investigate all four malaysian,and therefore limited its examination to the largest,kanzen.stainless steel pipe fittings from malaysia,fed.reg,commerce,preliminary determination.based on its investigation of kanzen,commerce preliminarily determine d that pipe fittings from malaysia are not being sold,nor are likely to be sold,in the united states at less than fair value.id.commerce estimated that the dumping margin was and therefore de minimis.id.at.commerce announced that it would verify all information relied upon in making the preliminary determination and postpone its final determination for days.
on august,at the request of commerce,kanzen submitted a final electronic database reporting its united states sales.commerce filing instructions recommended submitting databases in sas format,but also stated i f you do not have pc sas,contact the official in charge to determine other suitable formats.at.kanzen submitted its database in sas format and claims that,in order to do so,it had to convert its sales information from microsoft excel format to sas format.in this new submission,the credit expense for sales was now reported as per sale.kanzen claims that these entries were erroneous.kanzen alleges that it had originally entered in the excel database fields to stand for number not available,but that when it converted its database from the excel format to the sas format,a n sas conversion problem resulted in being converted into the numeric value.appellant br.at.although kanzen performed this conversion from excel to sas itself,and although the sas database remained in kanzen control prior to its final submission to commerce,kanzen did not notify commerce of this alleged error until after the issuance of the final determination.
after conducting and publishing a verification of kanzen sales information,receiving briefs from kanzen and from the private appellees in this action,inviting comments on its preliminary determination,and holding a public hearing on november,commerce made its final calculations available to kanzen on december.letter from kanzen to commerce of.these calculations included the entry of as a credit expense for sales that kanzen alleges was erroneous.however,kanzen did not,at this time,alert commerce that it believed the credit expense to be erroneous.commerce issued its final determination on december.stainless steel pipe fittings from malaysia,fed.reg,dep t commerce,final determination.commerce determined that kanzen was selling pipe fittings in the united states at less than fair value by a dumping margin of.id.at.
on december,one day after the publication of the final determination,kanzen filed its first request with commerce for the correction of alleged ministerial errors.kanzen claimed that the credit expense reported for of its united states sales was erroneous and argued that the error should be corrected pursuant to kanzen discovered the alleged error a fter reviewing the margin calculation program and kanzen home market and sales listings.appellant br.at.kanzen argued that under our decision in ntn bearing united states,commerce was required to correct inadvertent and obvious errors made by respondents.
commerce denied the request on january,on the ground that errors made by respondents did not fall under the regulatory definition of ministerial error,and distinguished our decision in ntn bearing on the ground that the alleged errors here were not brought to commerce attention before the final determination.at.kanzen repeated its request that commerce correct the alleged errors on february.commerce rejected this request on february,on the grounds that it had already determined that the alleged errors were not ministerial,and because pursuant to c,the request was untimely.at.
kanzen challenged commerce final determination in the court of international trade,urging that commerce erred in refusing to correct the alleged ministerial errors.kanzen also requested that the court supplement the administrative record with documents related to the alleged errors that were filed with commerce after the final determination.on for summary judgment on the administrative record,the court sustained commerce final determination in all respects and denied kanzen motion to supplement the administrative record.alloy piping,d at.
the court held that it would not supplement the record with materials submitted to commerce after the final determination,because the materials had no bearing on commerce findings and decisions in its final determination.if an error was committed,it will be manifest from the record as submitted.id.at quoting nsk united states.
the court then held that commerce was not required by statute to correct the alleged errors in kanzen final submitted database.although the relevant statute,e,and regulation,c,do not clarify whether the definition of ministerial error includes an error made by a respondent,it is a reasonable application of the statute for commerce to limit the correction of ministerial errors to those attributable to commerce.alloy piping,d at.
finally,the court noted that commerce policy was to correct errors attributable to respondents when such errors were called to commerce attention before the issuance of the final determination.id.at citing certain fresh cut flowers from colombia,fed.reg,dep t commerce.in the present case,the court found that kanzen did not call attention to the alleged errors in its united states sales database before the issuance of the final determination,and that commerce decision not to correct those errors was not an abuse of discretion.id.
kanzen timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the question presented here is whether commerce erred in refusing to correct an alleged error in its final determination on the ground that the respondent,rather than commerce,was the source of the error.we assume for purposes of this appeal that an error existed in the final determination.
when reviewing determinations made by commerce,this court applies anew the standard of review applied by the court of international trade in its review of the administrative record.koyo seiko,at internal citation omitted see also haselrig united states.we therefore uphold commerce determination unless it is arbitrary and capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i.
first,the appellant urges that e,entitled correction of ministerial errors,required commerce to correct the error.that section provides 
the administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section.such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors.as used in this subsection,the term ministerial error includes errors in addition,subtraction,or other arithmetic function,clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying,duplication,or the like,and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.
e emphasis added.commerce interpreted ministerial errors in the present case as not including errors made by respondents and refused to correct the alleged error in the database.the first issue then is whether commerce correctly interpreted the statute.
because the statute does not define ministerial,we presume that the word has its ordinary,established meaning,for which we may consult dictionaries.info.tech.applications united states.subsection e of the statute was enacted in.omnibus trade and competitiveness act of,stat,codified at e.the dictionary definitions available at that time define a ministerial act as one not involving discretion.some of these definitions do not limit the meaning of ministerial to government acts.for example,the fourth edition of black law dictionary defined ministerial act as,o ne which a person or board performs in a given state of facts in a prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority without regard to or exercise of his or their own judgment upon the propriety of the act being done.black law dictionary ed.black emphasis added.black provided a definition of ministerial as t hat which involves obedience to instructions,but demands no special discretion,judgment,or skill.id.webster third new international dictionary provided a definition of ministerial as of,relating to,or being an act that a person after ascertaining the existence of a specified state of facts performs in obedience to a mandate of legal authority without the exercise of personal judgment upon the propriety of the act and usu.without discretion in its performance.webster third new international dictionary webster emphasis added.
other definitions,however,defined ministerial as exclusively relating to the government.for example,webster defined ministerial as of,being,or having the characteristics of an act or duty belonging to the administration of the executive function in government and specifically prescribed by law as part of the official duties of an office.id.
in some circumstances,multiple dictionary definitions create an ambiguity,such that we must defer to the agency interpretation of the statute under the chevron doctrine.see,passenger boston me,d.here,however,in context,it is clear that congress intended to cover only an error committed by commerce itself,and there is no ambiguity in the statute.the statute requires commerce to establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations.e emphasis added.because it is commerce alone that produces the final determination,it is clear that congress intended ministerial errors to mean those errors belonging to the administration of the executive function in government.webster at.
the legislative history supports this interpretation.the report of the committee on ways and means included commentary on the new subsection 
it has come to the committee attention that certain final determinations contain clerical and other errors which are not corrected,under current procedures,unle
