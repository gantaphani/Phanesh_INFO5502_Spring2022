plaintiff bid for position,llc,appeals from a final judgment of noninfringement entered in its patent infringement suit against defendants google,and aol,llc.the,patent,describes a method for conducting a continuous auction,such as a consumers auction on the internet for goods or services,or a vendors auction for positions in an internet advertising display.the claimed method allows a bidder to select a position of priority in the auction and automatically adjusts the bidder bid so as to maintain that chosen priority status.the accused system is google internet advertising system,adwords,which runs continuous auctions to determine the placement of advertisements on google search results pages 
in the accused adwords system,advertisers choose keywords to trigger the display of their advertisements.when a keyword is used in a search performed on,adwords runs an auction to determine the order in which the advertisements will be placed next to the search results.each advertiser submits a bid in the form of a maximum cpc,the maximum price the advertiser is willing to pay each time its advertisement is clicked by a user of the search engine.adwords then multiplies each bid by a quality score,also known as the estimated click through rate ectr,which predicts the likelihood that a user searching for the designated keyword will click on the subject advertisement,based on a confidential algorithm that considers various historical factors.
the product of the bid maximum cpc and the quality score ectr yields an ad rank for each advertisement.the ad ranks are then used to sort and place advertisements in descending order on the corresponding results page.once the advertisements have been sorted,the actual cost paid by an advertiser per click is discounted to the lowest price the advertiser could have bid to achieve the same position,using a formula known as generalized auction.those computations are repeated each time a new search is conducted.
adwords also offers a position preference feature that allows advertisers to specify a preferred position or range of positions for the placement of their advertisements.the position preference feature enables advertisers to select a position or range of positions for adwords to target,such as position,positions through,or positions through.if the advertiser activates the position preference feature,adwords ensures that the advertisement will never appear below the lowest preferred position,although it may appear above the highest preferred position.adwords monitors the advertisement average position over a period of time,as auctions are triggered by relevant keyword searches,and it submits an adjusted proxy bid every hours as needed to keep the advertisement at or above the target position.other than the periodic substitution of a new proxy bid,the auctions are conducted in the same manner whether or not the position preference feature is activated.
the patent builds on prior art involving continuous auctions for priority placement in internet search results.an early search engine called offered auctions in which advertisers could compete for the top positions on the search results for any given keyword.the highest bidder would appear first in the search results,and each successive entry would be awarded to the next highest bidder.the purported novelty of the patent is that it enables bidders to pursue positions other than the highest available position.it does so by determining whether a bidder bid is too high for a specific position of priority that the bidder wishes to maintain in the auction.if it is,the system automatically reduces the bidder bid to avoid exceeding the amount necessary to maintain the bidder desired position of priority.if the bidder bid is too low for a specific position of priority that the bidder wishes to maintain,the system automatically increases the bidder bid,up to a maximum level set by the bidder.thus,even though the auction is continuous,the process allows the bidder to maintain a relatively constant position over time,as long as the bidder maximum bid is not exceeded.
the two claims at issue in this appeal are a method claim and a corresponding system claim.claim of the patent reads as follows emphases added 
a method for automatically managing an auction for determining relative priority for a service in a system wherein priority is based on the relative value of related bids,comprising 
receiving bid management data from a first bidder for managing bidding by the first bidder in the auction,the auction having at least two or more positions of priority,the received bid management data including information for selecting one of the two or more positions of priority that the first bidder wishes to maintain in the auction 
checking for if a second bidder holds the selected position of priority,and 
checking for whether a first bid from the first bidder exceeds a second bid from the second bidder in the auction for determining continuing priority for providing an ongoing service for the first and second bidder,wherein the relative position of priority for providing the service for the first bidder is dependent on whether the value of the first bid exceeds the value of the second bid,and wherein the relative position of priority for providing the service for the second bidder is dependent on whether the value of the second bid exceeds the value of the first bid 
according to the bid management data received from the first bidder,automatically incrementing the first bid to a value exceeding the second bid if the first bid does not exceed the second bid,to thereby maintain the selected position of priority for providing the service for the first bidder 
checking for whether the first bid is higher than needed to maintain the selected position of priority that the first bidder wishes to maintain in the auction,and 
if the first bid is higher than needed to maintain the selected position of priority that the first bidder wishes to maintain in the auction,automatically reducing the first bid to a minimum which allows the bidder to keep the selected position of priority.
claim,the system claim,is identical to claim in all relevant respects except that in the first subparagraph,claim reads,the received bid management data including selected one of the two or more positions of priority,while claim reads,the received bid management data including information for selecting one of the two or more positions of priority.
following a markman hearing,the district court issued a claim construction order on july.only three clauses in the claims are relevant to this appeal information for selecting one of the two or more positions of priority that the first bidder wishes to maintain in the auction claim and selected one of the two or more positions of priority that the first bidder wishes to maintain in the auction claim wherein the relative position of priority for providing the service for the first bidder is dependent upon whether the value of the first bid exceeds the value of the second bid and the auction for determining continuing priority for providing an ongoing service.
the district court interpreted the first clause to mean that the bidder,not the system,chooses the desired position of priority in the auction.the court found support for that conclusion in the claim language,which stated that the bid management data is received from the bidder and that it is the bidder who selects the position of priority to maintain in the auction.the court also pointed to the specification and the prosecution history as indicating that it is the bidder who enters the bid management data.
the dispute over the second clause turned entirely on the construction of the term value.plaintiff bid for position requested that the court construe that term to mean relative worth,utility,or importance.the district court,however,observed that value is used in reference to bid,and that bid was agreed to mean an offer of a price.the court therefore defined the value of a bid to mean simply the monetary amount set forth in the bid.
the district court construction of the third clause focused on the term continuing prio
