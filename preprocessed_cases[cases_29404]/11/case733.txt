in this civil rights action brought pursuant to,the plaintiffs raise a constitutional challenge to michigan alcohol distribution system,contending that state provisions differentiating between and wineries violate the commerce clause those regulations prohibit the direct shipment of alcoholic beverages from wineries,while allowing wineries to ship directly to consumers,provided that the wineries comply with certain minimal regulatory requirements.the plaintiffs,who include wine connoisseurs,wine journalists,and one small california winery that ships its wines to customers in other states,claim that this system is unconstitutional under the dormant commerce clause because it interferes with the free flow of interstate commerce by discriminating against wineries.the defendants,who include michigan officials referred to collectively in this opinion as the state and the intervening trade association,argue in response that michigan regulatory scheme is constitutional under the amendment to the federal constitution.
the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted the state motion and denied the plaintiffs motion.the plaintiffs then filed a motion to reconsider,arguing that the district court should have addressed to strike various evidence submitted by the two sides prior to the summary judgment decision the district court denied the motion to reconsider,noting that it had effectively denied the to strike as moot,because it did not consider the challenged evidence in deciding the summary judgment motions.
the plaintiffs now appeal both the grant of summary judgment and the denial of their motion to reconsider.for the reasons set out below,we conclude that the regulations in question are discriminatory in their application to wineries,in violation of the dormant commerce clause,and can not be justified as advancing the traditional core concerns of the amendment.we therefore reverse the district court judgment and remand the case with directions to the district court to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.
procedural and factual background 
michigan regulates alcohol sales under a system consumers must purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed retailers retailers must purchase them from licensed wholesalers and wholesalers must purchase them from licensed manufacturers.this system is similar to that used by most states.see vijay shankar,alcohol direct shipment laws.
the plaintiffs allege that michigan system discriminates against wineries in favor of wineries because it prevents wineries from shipping wine directly to michigan consumers,which wineries are allowed to do.as the district court correctly noted,this distinction between and wineries can only be understood by reading a number of provisions in conjunction with each other 
the distinction can be gleaned from various michigan liquor control commission regulations,which are codified within the michigan administrative code.states that a person shall not deliver,ship,or transport into this state beer,wine,or spirits without a license authorizing such action the only applicable license,an outstate seller of wine license,may according to d be obtained by a manufacturer which is located outside of this state,but in the united states,and which produces and bottles its own wine.however,under the holder of such a license may ship wine only to a licensed wholesaler at the address of the licensed premises except upon written order of the commission.in answers to interrogatories,a representative of the michigan liquor control commission indicates that a t present,there is no procedure whereby an retailer or winery can obtain a license or approval to deliver wine directly to michigan residents 
in contrast,the michigan liquor control commission indicates that the ability to deliver wine to the consumer is available to winemakers licensed in michigan,inasmuch as under the provisions of these licensees are permitted to sell at retail the wines they manufacture a licensed michigan winemaker may deliver their sic own products to customers without an sdm specially designated merchant license 
the plaintiffs contend that this differential treatment of and wineries violates the dormant commerce clause because it gives wineries a competitive advantage over wineries.wineries can,for example,bypass the price of a wholesaler and retailer,making wines relatively cheaper to the consumer and allowing them to realize more profit per bottle.in addition,the cost to an winery of the license that enables it to sell to a michigan wholesaler is,while a comparable michigan winery must pay only a license fee to qualify to ship wine directly to michigan customers.finally,for customers who desire home delivery,michigan wineries have a competitive advantage over wineries that can not ship directly to customers.in response,the state argues that the regulations to which an winery is subject more than offset,both in costs and burden,any nominal commercial advantage given by the ability to deliver directly to customers and characterizes the burden on wineries as de minimis.
in its order granting summary judgment to the state and denying summary judgment to the plaintiffs,the district court held that michigan direct shipment law is a permitted exercise of state power under of the amendment because it is not mere economic protectionism.in reaching this conclusion,the court found that michigan statutory scheme was designed to ensure the collection of taxes from wine manufacturers and to reduce the risk of alcohol falling into the hands of minors.
after this order had issued,the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider,asking the district court to rule on the motions to strike before granting either side summary judgment and to make specific findings of fact based on the record before reaching a final decision.the plaintiffs argued that the district court failure to rule on the motions to strike left the record devoid of evidence supporting the court conclusion that the direct shipment law furthers legitimate amendment purposes,and that the court had applied the incorrect legal standard in dismissing the complaint.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,saying that it had not considered the challenged evidence in ruling on the summary judgment motions and that the motions to strike were effectively denied as moot.
for the reasons set out below,we reverse the district court judgment,vacate the order granting summary judgment in the state favor,and remand the case for entry of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.
discussion 
the central question in this case is how the dormant commerce clause and the amendment interact to limit the ways in which a state can control alcohol sales and distribution.article i,section,clause of the united states constitution grants congress the power t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes the supreme court has long held that this affirmative grant of authority to congress also encompasses an implicit or dormant limitation on the authority of the states to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce.healy v.the beer institute,d citations omitted.
in,congress enacted the amendment,which repealed the amendment,thereby ending prohibition.section of the amendment prohibits t he transportation or importation into any state,territory or possession of the united states for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors,in violation of the laws thereof initially,the supreme court afforded the states nearly limitless power to regulate alcohol under the new amendment.see,ziffrin,reeves.the amendment sanctions the right of a state to legislate concerning intoxicating liquors brought from without,unfettered by the commerce clause.indianapolis brewing liquor control comm n.since the amendment the right of a state to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the commerce clause state bd.of equalization young market.
the state relied on these cases in the district court,but we find that reliance disingenuous at best because,as early as the,the supreme court signaled a break with this line of reasoning.in hostetter idlewild bon voyage liquor,d,a case involving the prohibition of liquor sales to departing international airline travelers,the court observed 
to draw a conclusion from this line of decisions ziffrin,young market,that the amendment has somehow operated to repeal the commerce clause wherever regulation of intoxicating liquors is concerned would,however,be an absurd oversimplification.if the commerce clause had been pro tanto repealed,then congress would be left with no regulatory power over interstate or foreign commerce in intoxicating liquor.such a conclusion would be patently bizarre and is demonstrably incorrect 
both the amendment and the commerce clause are parts of the same constitution.like other provisions of the constitution,each must be considered in the light of the other,and in the context of the issues and interests at stake in any concrete case.
the supreme court approach to cases involving the intersection of the commerce clause and the amendment has continued to develop since hostetter.in capital cities cable crisp,d,although not a liquor importation or commerce clause case,the court found that a state ban on alcohol advertising conflicted with regulations of the federal communications commission.the court applied a balancing test to determine whether the interests implicated by a state regulation are so closely related to the powers reserved by the amendment that the regulation may prevail,notwithstanding that its requirements directly conflict with express federal policies.id.at.the court concluded that the federal interest must prevail because the state banning of alcohol advertising did not directly relate to the core concerns of the amendment,to exercise control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.id.at.quotation omitted.
in subsequent cases,the supreme court has continued to analyze challenges to state alcohol laws by determining how closely related the law in question is to the core concerns of the amendment.shortly after capital cities was decided,the court issued bacchus imports dias,d,in which wholesalers challenged a hawaii excise tax exemption for certain locally produced alcoholic beverages.the state argued that the statute advanced legitimate state interests,that it imposed no patent discrimination against interstate trade,and that the effect on interstate commerce was minimal.id.at.the court rejected these defenses,finding that the legislation constitutes economic protectionism in every sense of the phrase,id.at,and noting that one thing is certain the central purpose of the amendment was not to empower states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.id.at.instead,the court considered whether the principles underlying the amendment are sufficiently implicated by the tax exemption to outweigh the commerce clause principles that would otherwise be offended.id.at.in bacchus,the state did not contest that the law purpose was to promote a local industry,so the court did not have to engage in the normal commerce clause analysis of whether the law was sufficiently closely related to the promotion of lawful interests to vitiate its discriminatory effect.instead,it found that the law discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause and was therefore unconstitutional.
since bacchus,the supreme court has been less than prolific in construing the content of the amendment core concerns,addressing the definition of core concerns only then only in a plurality opinion.in north dakota united states,d,the court had before it an intergovernmental immunity case,rather than a commerce clause challenge.at issue was whether north dakota reporting and labeling requirements were constitutional,despite interfering with contrary federal interests in selling liquor to military personnel.the court upheld the statute,finding that the state regulations fall within the core of the state power under the amendment because they were enacted i n the interest of promoting temperance,ensuring orderly market conditions,and raising revenue id.at.
but,because north dakota did not involve a commerce clause challenge,the analysis in the plurality opinion can not be taken to control the analysis in this case.that is,we do not interpret the in the interest of language to mean that a state need only be motivated by the core concerns of the amendment to shield its laws from constitutional scrutiny.under a commerce clause analysis,facially discriminatory laws are still subject to strict scrutiny,meaning that the state must demonstrate that no reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives are available to advance the same legitimate goals.see,hughes oklahoma,d finding that,a t a minimum,a statute that on its face discriminates against interstate commerce invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.likewise,the language in north dakota to the effect that the states have virtually complete control over the importation and sale of liquor,although heavily emphasized by the district court in this case,has little value in a case requiring a commerce clause analysis.because north dakota did not involve interpretation of the commerce clause,we reject the implication that a state virtually complete control over liquor regulation enables it to discriminate against interests in favor of interests.bacchus simply forbids such an analysis.
given this background,we can not endorse the district court characterization of the regulation in this case as a constitutionally benign product of the state system and,thus,a proper exercise of michigan amendment authority,despite the fact that such a system places a minor burden on interstate commerce.instead,we invoke justice scalia view,expressed in an opinion concurring in the supreme court majority decision striking down a state statute,in which he explained that 
the law invalidity is fully established by its facial discrimination against interstate commerce this is so despite the fact that the law regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages,since its discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the amendment.
healy beer institute,d scalia,concurring citations omitted.
the proper approach in this case,then,is to apply the traditional dormant commerce clause analysis and,if the provisions are unconstitutional under the commerce clause,to determine whether the state has shown that it has no reasonable nondiscriminatory means of advancing the core concerns of the amendment.
in reviewing challenges brought under the commerce clause,the supreme court has long held that statutes that facially discriminate are virtually per se invalid,citing as a clear example a law that overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at a state borders.philadelphia new jersey,d.however,a lower level of scrutiny is applied when a statute does not discriminate on its face 
where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits t he extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.
quoting pike bruce church,d.moreover,we have recognized the following test for determining whether state economic regulations violate the dormant commerce clause 
when a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce,or when its effect is to favor economic interests over interests,the supreme court has generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.when,however,a statute has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly,the supreme court has examined whether the state interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits.in eit
