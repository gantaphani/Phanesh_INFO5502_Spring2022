factual background 
appellants association des éleveurs de canards et du québec the canadian farmers and hvfg llc hudson valley are entities that raise ducks for slaughter and are producers and sellers of foie gras.appellant hot restaurant group,hot kitchen is a restaurant in california that sold foie gras before came into effect collectively,plaintiffs.
hudson valley and the canadian farmers raise moulard ducks.moulard ducks are a hybrid of muscovy male ducks and pekin female ducks.they are bred for their capacity of ingestion and fat storage in their livers.in addition to foie gras,hudson valley and the canadian farmers produce and sell breasts,legs,fat,bones,offal,and feathers from their moulard ducks.
generally,moulard ducks are raised for foie gras through the following process.the canadian farmers and hudson valley take ducks from the hatchery to breeding farms.there,the ducks are raised until they are fully grown,a process that generally takes eleven to thirteen weeks.for the first four weeks of their lives,the ducks eat pellets from feeding pans that are available to them hours a day.in the next stage,which lasts one to two months,the ducks eat different pellets from feeding pans that are available to them hours a day.for the next two weeks,the ducks continue to eat pellets from feeding pans that are available to them at only certain times during the day.in the final stage,called gavage,which lasts between ten to thirteen days,the ducks are by feeders who use a tube to deliver the feed to the crop sac at the base of the duck esophagus.
statutory background 
the statutory provision plaintiffs seek to enjoin,is within the statute entitled force fed birds.cal.health safety code et.section states a product may not be sold in california if it is the result of force feeding a bird for the purpose of enlarging the bird liver beyond normal size.id.section further provides a person may not force feed a bird for the purpose of enlarging the bird liver beyond normal size,or hire another person to do so.id.

procedural background 
the day after came into effect,plaintiffs filed a lawsuit to enjoin defendants appellees attorney general kamala harris,governor edmund brown,and the state of california collectively,the state from enforcing the statute.plaintiffs argue that is unconstitutional because it violates the due process clause and the commerce clause of the united states constitution.
plaintiffs applied ex parte for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.the district court denied the motion.plaintiffs then filed a motion for preliminary injunction.the district court denied the motion,and plaintiffs timely appealed.

b.the scope of 
we begin our analysis by addressing the parties dispute over the scope of.plaintiffs contend that the district court correctly concluded that prohibits the sale of all products from birds including duck breasts and down jackets.the state argues that covers only products that are the result of force feeding a bird to enlarge its liver beyond normal size,products made from an enlarged duck liver.we agree with the state interpretation.
the scope of a statute is a question of law,which we review de novo.in re lieberman,cir.in interpreting a state statute,we apply the state rules of statutory construction.id.at.under california law,a court must look first to the language of the statute and give effect to its plain meaning.id.if the intent of the legislature is not clear from the language of the statute,legislative history may be considered.id.
section states,a product may not be sold in california if it is the result of force feeding a bird for the purpose of enlarging the bird liver beyond normal size.cal.health safety code emphasis added.the phrase as a result of in its plain and ordinary sense means caused by and requires a showing of a causal connection,kwikset,cal th,d,quoting hall time,th,d troyk farmers,th,d interpreting phrase as a result of in statute according to its common usage,which means an element of causation.the plain meaning of is that it applies only to a product that is produced by force feeding a bird to enlarge its liver.
although we need not consider the legislative history,it supports our interpretation.the accompanying bill analysis for senate bill which proposed the legislation force fed birds,notes that the purpose of th e bill is intended to prohibit the force feeding of ducks and geese,force feeding is the common method used to produce foie gras,the author states that no other livestock product is produced via force feeding,comm.on bus.professions cal,analysis of as introduced,at emphasis added rules comm.cal,analysis of as amended may,at same further,foie gras is the only product produced via force feeding mentioned in the bill analyses.specifically,the bill analyses discuss the background of foie gras countries that have banned force feeding to produce foie gras grocers who have refused to purchase foie gras whether there are alternative methods of producing foie gras and support for,and against,the foie gras industry 
we conclude that is limited to products that are produced by force feeding a bird for the purpose of enlarging the bird liver beyond normal size it therefore does not prohibit the sale of duck breasts,down jackets,or other products from birds in the district court,plaintiffs evidence showed that foie gras was the only product that was produced by force feeding thus,the only product covered by at issue in this appeal is foie gras.
plaintiffs due process clause challenge 
plaintiffs contend that they raised a serious question that the statute violates their due process rights because the statute definition of force feeding is vague and the statute fails to give persons fair notice of what conduct is prohibited.we disagree on both points.
whether a statute or regulation is unconstitutionally vague is a question of law reviewed de novo.united states ninety five firearms,cir.it is well established that vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve first amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.united states mazurie,d.to be struck down for vagueness,a statute or regulation must fail to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.donovan royal logging,cir quoting united states dacus,cir.economic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test than criminal laws,great am.houseboat united states,cir quoting vill.of hoffman estates flip side hoffman estates,d.
the statute definition for force feeding is not vague.
section states,f orce feeding a bird means a process that causes the bird to consume more food than a typical bird of the same species would consume voluntarily.force feeding methods include,but are not limited to,delivering feed through a tube or other device inserted into the bird esophagus.cal.health safety code b.plaintiffs incorrectly contend that the statute definition of force feeding is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks an identifiable measurement of exactly how much food a bird can be fed.plaintiffs argument ignores key terms that define the process of force feeding.these terms demonstrate that the statute covers plaintiffs conduct in this case.
as plaintiffs evidence demonstrates,there are four feeding stages of moulard ducks.in the first three stages,ducks feed themselves from feeding pans that are available either hours a day or certain times during the day.but in the final stage,known as gavage,each duck is by a feeder using a tube to deliver the feed to the crop sac at the base of the duck esophagus.in fact,merriam webster defines gavage as the introduction of material into the stomach by a tube.during the gavage stage,the feeders dictate how much food the ducks are fed.
the specific example of force feeding under the statute feeding a bird using a tube so that the bird will consume more food than it would consume voluntarily is how plaintiffs feed their ducks during the gavage stage.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it held that plaintiffs failed to raise serious questions that,as applied to plaintiffs,the definition of force feeding is not vague.
the statute gives fair notice of prohibited conduct.
section states that a product may not be sold in california if it is the result of force feeding a bird for the purpose of enlarging the bird liver beyond normal size.cal.healthy safety code.according to plaintiffs,the term purpose refers to a farmer subjective intent in feeding his birds,and they are left to guess whether a farmer state of mind violated the statute.we disagree with plaintiffs reading of the statute.
the term for the purpose of in the statute modifies the phrase force feeding a bird.see am.small bus.league small bus,cir as a matter of syntax,the latter phrase most naturally modifies only the former phrase.the natural reading of force feeding a bird for the purpose of enlarging the bird liver beyond normal size is a description of the objective nature of the force feeding,rather than the subjective motive of the farmer.see watersheds project interior bd.of land appeals,cir holding that a statute phrase for the purpose of did not refer to subjective motives,but rather was an objective description of the conduct covered by the statute.here,plaintiffs do not contest that force feeding a bird through a tube inserted into the bird esophagus is for the purpose of enlarging the duck liver.
finally,plaintiffs description of as invidious because it imposes strict liability is without merit.c ivil penalties may be imposed without mens rea requirements because they are indeed civil,humanitarian law project treasury dep t,cir.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that plaintiffs failed to raise serious questions concerning their due process clause challenge 
plaintiffs commerce clause challenge 
plaintiffs argue that we should find that violates the commerce clause because the statute discriminates against interstate commerce and directly regulates interstate commerce.the district court held that plaintiffs failed to raise a serious question on the merits of their claim,and we agree.
although the commerce clause is by its text an affirmative grant of power to congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce,the clause has long been recognized as a limitation on the power of the states to enact laws imposing substantial burdens on such commerce.ass of optometrists opticians harris,cir quoting south central timber,wunnicke,d.this limitation on the states to regulate commerce is known as the dormant commerce clause.id.the primary purpose of the dormant commerce clause is to prohibit statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce by providing benefits to economic interests while burdening competitors.id.at quoting cts dynamics of,d,and dep t of revenue davis,d.
the supreme court has adopted a approach to analyzing state economic regulation under the commerce clause.brown forman distillers state liquor,d.
when a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce,or when its effect is to favor economic interests over interests,the court has generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.when,however,a statute has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly,the court has examined whether the state interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits.
id.at citations omitted the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that falls into the second tier because the statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce or directly regulate interstate commerce.
section is not discriminatory.
the supreme court has interpreted the commerce clause to invalidate local laws that impose commercial barriers or discriminate against an article of commerce by reason of its origin or destination out of state.c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d ass of optometrists,at explaining that discriminatory statutes seek economic protectionism and are designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors quoting dep t of revenue,at.conversely,a statute that treat s all private companies exactly the same does not discriminate against interstate commerce.united haulers ass n,at.this is so even when only businesses are burdened because there are no comparable businesses.exxon governor of maryland,d.
under,no entity can sell a product that is the result of force feeding a bird regardless of the product source or origin.cal.health safety code.as the district court correctly found,s ection economic impact does not depend on where the items were produced,but rather how they were produced.because bans the sale of both intrastate and interstate products that are the result of force feeding a bird,it is not discriminatory.see pac.nw.venison producers smitch,cir holding that a n import ban that simply effectuates a complete ban on commerce in certain items is not discriminatory,as long as the ban on commerce does not make distinctions based on the origin of the items empacadora de carnes de fresnillo,de curry,cir holding that a statute that treats both intrastate and interstate trade of horsemeat equally by way of a blanket prohibition can not be considered economic protectionism.
section does not directly regulate interstate commerce.
a statute is not invalid merely because it affects in some way the flow of commerce between the states.ass of optometrists,at quoting great atl.pac.tea cottrell,d.instead,a statute violates the dormant commerce clause per se when it directly regulates interstate commerce.ncaa miller,cir emphasis added.
plaintiffs argue that the district court should have found that directly regulates conduct because the statute a targets entities b bans foie gras unless all farmers comply with california standards c controls commerce outside of california and d will result in conflicting legislation.we disagree.
section is not aimed at producers.
plaintiffs contend that targets wholly extraterritorial activity because it is aimed in only one direction at producers.plaintiffs reason that is apparently directed at farmers who feed their ducks and geese outside california,because already prohibits businesses in california from force feeding birds.
plaintiffs misinterpret the interplay between the statutory provisions.plaintiffs assume that and are functionally equivalent,with targeting california entities and targeting entities.in truth,serves an entirely different purpose than.section prohibits entities from force feeding birds in california.but for,a california producer could force feed ducks in california,and then sell foie gras outside of california.section,however,does not prohibit the sale of products produced by force feeding birds.that is where comes in.section applies to both california entities and entities and precludes sales within california of products produced by force feeding birds regardless of where the force feeding occurred.otherwise,california entities could obtain foie gras produced and sell it in california.thus,plaintiffs assertion that is directed solely at producers is incorrect.
plaintiffs have not shown that constitutes a total ban on foie gras or that a nationally uniform production method is required for foie gras.
plaintiffs rely on schollenberger pennsylvania,to argue that has directly regulated interstate commerce because it has stopped the free flow of foie gras between states.in schollenberger,the supreme court invalided an import and sale ban on oleomargarine margarine that carried criminal penalties.id.at.it held that the absolute prohibition of an unadulterated,healthy,and pure article violated the commerce clause.id.at.
plaintiffs would have us assume,without evidentiary support,that amounts to a flat ban on foie gras.plaintiffs declarations do not demonstrate that foie gras may be produced only by force feeding.the district court found that the evidence may ultimately show that section only precludes a more profitable method of operation force feeding birds for the purpose of enlarging its liver rather than affecting the interstate flow of goods.it may be that plaintiffs are precluded from using force feeding to produce foie gras,but the dormant commerce clause does not guarantee plaintiffs their preferred method of operation.ass of optometrists,at.at this stage in the proceedings,plaintiffs have not shown that the effect of is a complete import and sales ban on foie gras.
moreover,in schollenberger the supreme court emphasized that congress actively regulated the industry of oleomargine.at.congress had given a definition of the meaning of oleomargarine,and ha d imposed a special tax on the manufacturers of the article,on wholesale dealers and upon retail dealers.id.at.see also cloverleaf butter patterson.stating that t he manufacture and distribution of process and renovated butter is a substantial industry which,because of its activity,can not be effectively regulated by isolated competing states.
in a different context,we have recognized that a state regulation of a nationally uniform business can have extraterritorial effects.in ncaa miller,we considered the constitutionality of a nevada statute that imposed standards for how the ncaa,an interstate organization,could run its enforcement proceedings.at.f or the ncaa to accomplish its goals,its enforcement procedures must be applied and uniformly on a national basis.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the national uniformity required by the ncaa meant that the ncaa could not adopt nevada procedures for nevada,and alternative procedures for its business in other states.id.at.as a result,to avoid liability under nevada statute,the ncaa would have to apply nevada procedures to enforcement proceedings throughout the country.id.we concluded that nevada statute directly regulated interstate commerce.id.
plaintiffs argue that the need for national uniformity for the foie gras market is evidenced by the federal poultry products inspection act ppia requirement that ducks undergo several stages of federal inspection the ppia ensures that poultry products distributed to the public are wholesome,not adulterated,and properly marked,labeled,and packaged.plaintiffs contend that the ppia provides a comprehensive set of detailed regulations that includes standards indicating that ducks will be to create foie gras.the standards to which plaintiffs refer,however,merely state that goose liver and duck liver foie gras fat liver are obtained exclusively from specially fed and fattened ge
