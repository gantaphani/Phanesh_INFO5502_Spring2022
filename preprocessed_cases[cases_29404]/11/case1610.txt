this case involves the tariff classification of plywood imported into the united states from brazil by timber products timber.timber appeals the final decision of the united states court of international trade,following a trial,that the united states bureau of customs and border protection customs correctly classified timber plywood entries under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus timber prods.united states,d.int l trade timber iii.that subheading imposes a duty of ad valorem.harmonized tariff schedule,htsus.timber had urged classification under htsus subheading,which covers plywood w ith at least one outer ply of the following tropical woods virola.entries under that subheading are.harmonized tariff schedule,htsus.
it is undisputed that,under htsus,the common meaning of virola is limited to the botanical genus virola spp.before the court of international trade,timber sought to establish that virola has a broader commercial designation within the plywood trade that encompasses many different woods,including the sumauma,faveira,amesclao,brazilian white,white virola virola spp.and edaiply faveria woods listed on its entry invoices timber thus sought to establish a commercial designation for virola that would encompass each of the species listed on its invoices,thereby qualifying its plywood for treatment.in sustaining customs classification of timber plywood in timber iii,the court of international trade held that timber had failed to establish a commercial designation for virola.we affirm.
background 
plywood consists of three or more wooden sheets pressed together,with each sheet referred to as a ply.one outer ply is called the face ply the other outer ply is called the backing the middle ply or plies comprise the core.although these component plies may present different species of wood,plywood is identified based on the species found on its face ply.
between july and december,timber imported the plywood at issue into the united states from brazil.however,due to the particular nature of the manufacturing and exporting processes in brazil,in which various species of wood are first mixed together and then sorted by quality rather than species,the exact botanical identity of the face ply of timber imported plywood was unknown.thus,the names appearing on the entry documents for timber plywood imports did not necessarily reflect the botanical species on the face plies,since timber could not determine this information.timber shipping and entry documents,though,listed the subject merchandise as sumauma pentanda plywood,faveira parkia spp.plywood,amesclao burseaefolia plywood,brazilian white rotary cut plywood,white virola plywood,white virola virola spp.plywood,and edaiply faveira parkia spp.
virola refers to a botanical genus consisting of approximately to different species of tropical hardwood.the term virola spp.denotes all species of the genus virola.virola is also a commercial term used within the plywood trade.see timber iii,d at.the terms sumauma,faveira,edaiply faveira,amesclao,and brazilian white are each trade or common terms for various species of tropical hardwood from botanical genera other than virola.id.
when timber plywood was imported,plywood with an outer ply of tropical hardwood such as virola was classified under htsus subheading and therefore.id.in contrast,plywood with an outer ply of other nonconiferous wood was classified under htsus subheading and subject to a duty of ad valorem.id.
timber sought to classify its merchandise as virola under subheading in order to receive treatment under that provision.timber argued to customs that there was an established commercial designation for the term virola in subheading that extended beyond the botanical genus virola and that encompassed various types of wood,including the types of wood listed on its entries.more specifically,timber argued that the term virola is a commercial designation in the plywood trade for a group of approximately near species of tropical hardwood with similar physical properties,including density and hardness.customs,however,disagreed and liquidated the plywood under subheading,the residual provision that requires an duty ad valorem.id.
after customs denied protests filed by timber in accordance with,timber filed suit in the court of international trade.in due course,ruling on the parties for summary judgment,the court held that customs had correctly classified the merchandise at issue under subheading rather than subheading.the court did so after concluding that timber had failed to adequately prove its asserted commercial designation for virola.timber prods.united states,d.int l trade timber i.in reaching that conclusion,the court ruled that timber was required to prove a commercial meaning for virola that applied throughout every trade contemplated by the htsus.in other words,timber had to demonstrate that its proposed commercial designation applied not only throughout the plywood industry,but also throughout every other trade that imported virola.id.at.
timber appealed the decision in timber i to this court.on appeal,we held that the court of international trade had erred in its commercial designation analysis by requiring evidence from beyond the plywood industry.we stated that the relevant trade for analyzing whether a tariff term has an established commercial meaning is determined by the merchandise before the court in a particular case,not by all merchandise to which the tariff term might apply.timber prods.united states,timber ii.accordingly,we vacated the decision of the court of international trade and remanded the case to the court with the instruction that it consider whether timber had proven a commercial designation of virola within the plywood trade alone,and whether the subject merchandise was within that commercial designation.id.at.
the law relating to commercial designation is well settled.the proper interpretation of a tariff classification provision is a question of law.mita copystar am.united states.when a tariff term is not defined in either the htsus or its legislative history,the term correct meaning is presumed to be its common meaning in the absence of evidence to the contrary.rohm haas united states.one who argues that a tariff term should not be given its common meaning must prove that there is a different commercial meaning in existence which is definite,uniform,and general throughout the trade.id.quoting moscahlades united states.the concept of commercial designation was intended to apply to cases where the trade designation is so universal and well understood that the congress,and all the trade,are supposed to have been fully acquainted with the practice at the time the law was enacted.id.quoting jas.akeroyd united states.cust.proof of commercial designation is a question of fact that must be established in each case.id.finally,if the statute indicates a clear congressional intent,this unambiguous intent must always prevail over any commercial designation.see united states stone downer.cust.the burden of proof rests on the party claiming the commercial designation,which must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states brandenstein.
on remand,and following a trial,the court of international trade held that timber had failed to prove its commercial designation for virola.timber iii,d at.although it found no clear legislative intent that would preclude a commercial designation analysis,the court determined that timber had failed to prove its proposed commercial designation for virola because the testimonial and documentary evidence revealed a commercial meaning for the term that was general,but neither uniform nor definite.
preliminarily,the court observed that it was not entirely clear what definition of virola plywood timber wishes to adopt.timber iii,d at.noting what had been argued in timber i,the court stated that it was unclear whether timber was urging that the commercial meaning for virola plywood encompassed a group of approximately near species of tropical hardwood with similar physical properties,or a broader definition encompassing hardwood plywood made
