benq america corporation benq appeals the final decision of the united states court of international trade in benq america united states,d.int l trade benq.in its decision,the court denied benq motion for summary judgment and granted the government for summary judgment.in so doing,the court upheld the ruling of the bureau of customs and border protection customs classifying certain liquid crystal display lcd monitors imported by benq from china in under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus.benq had protested the classification,arguing that the monitors should be classified under subheading of the htsus.because we conclude that the court of international trade erred in not conducting a principal use analysis with respect to the imported goods,we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of the government and remand the case to the court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the products at issue are lcd monitors with screens measuring inches on the diagonal.the monitors are equipped with five different types of connectors for receiving data a pin analog video connector a dvi d digital video connector an svideo connector a composite connector and usb ports.the analog video and dvi d digital video connectors can receive signals from a personal computer,whereas the and composite connectors can receive video signals from devices such as dvd players and vcrs.the usb ports allow the monitors to be connected to digital cameras and other devices.the monitors are imported with a stand for use on a desktop but can also be mounted on a wall.benq imported the monitors,dell flat panel color monitors,for benq corporation,a taiwanese company that manufactured the monitors for dell.
upon importation,benq entered the monitors under htsus heading,subheading,both of which are part of section xvi of the htsus.subheading is a provision for 
automatic data processing machines and units thereof magnetic or optical readers,machines for transcribing data onto data media in coded form and machines for processing such data,not elsewhere specified or included input or output units,whether or not containing storage units in the same housing other display units other other 
in due course,customs classified and reliquidated the monitors under htsus heading,subheading,dutiable at ad valorem,and assessed duties on the monitors at that rate.heading and subheading also are part of htsus section xvi.subheading provides for 
reception apparatus for television,whether or not incorporating radiobroadcast receivers or sound or video recording or reproducing apparatus video monitors and video projectors video monitors color with a flat panel screen other other 
benq filed a timely protest of customs reclassification,arguing that the monitors are of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data processing adp system and thus classifiable under subheading pursuant to notes b and c of chapter of the htsus.after customs failed to take action on the protest,the protest was deemed denied.
benq filed suit in the court of international trade under a to contest the denial of its protest.after designating the action a test case to control the outcome of at least one other action,the court entertained the parties respective motions for summary judgment.in its motion,benq argued that the court should apply a principal function analysis under note to htsus section xvi.note provides that,u nless the context otherwise requires,composite machines consisting of two or more machines fitted together to form a whole and other machines designed for the purpose of performing two or more complementary or alternative functions are to be classified as if consisting only of that component or as being that machine which performs the principal function.according to benq,the principal function of the delltm monitors is to serve as a monitor for a computer or an automatic data processing machine.hence,they should be classified under htsus subheading,as benq claimed at the time of importation.
for its part,the government urged that,in order for the delltm monitors to be classified in heading,benq must satisfy the criteria of note b to chapter,which requires a principal use analysis pursuant to htsus additional rule of interpretation ari a.chapter,note b a states that a unit can be classified under heading if it is of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data processing system.ari a states in relevant part that,i n the absence of special language or context which otherwise requires a a tariff classification controlled by use other than actual use is to be determined in accordance with the use in the united states at,or immediately prior to,the date of importation,of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong,and the controlling use is the principal use.such an analysis,the government contended,compelled the conclusion that the dell monitors could not be classified under htsus subheading because benq did not present evidence regarding the class or kind of goods to which the monitors belong.the government also pointed to an explanatory note to heading limiting display units of automatic data processing machines to those machines that are capable of accepting a signal only from the central processing unit of an automatic data processing machine world customs,harmonized commodity description coding system,explanatory notes explanatory notes.in the government view,the explanatory note provided additional support for its position that the monitors should not be classified under heading because the delltm monitors accept signals from sources other than automatic data processing machines.according to the government,the monitors were properly classified in heading,a provision encompassing video monitors.
the court of international trade granted the government motion and denied benq motion,holding that customs had properly classified the monitors under htsus heading.benq,d at.the court,however,followed an approach somewhat different from that urged by either benq or the government.instead of employing either a principal use or principal function analysis,the court relied on note e to chapter,htsus,and the explanatory notes to heading.the court determined that the delltm monitors can perform a specific function other than data processing,that function being serving as a video monitor for a video source.id.at.this ability,the court concluded,meant that the monitors could not be classified under heading because note e provides that m achines performing a specific function other than data processing and incorporating or working in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine are to be classified in the headings appropriate to their respective functions or,failing that,in residual headings.note e to chapter,htsus.since the dell monitors are admittedly capable of connection to a video source for use as video monitors,the court reasoned that they can perform a specific function other than data processing and thus had to be classified,not under heading,but under the heading appropriate to their respective function benq,d at quoting note e to chapter,htsus.that heading,according to the court,was the broad eo nomine heading reception apparatus for television,whether or not incorporating radiobroadcast receivers or sound or video recording or reproducing apparatus video monitors and video projectors because the monitors are video monitors.thus,the court upheld customs classification of the monitors under subheading.the court rejected benq reliance on note to section xvi on the ground that the note includes the express proviso that it applies u nless the context otherwise requires.id.at.the terms of heading and the relevant chapter notes,the court found,plainly constitute a context which otherwise requires,overriding the general default rule in note to section xvi.id.at.

discussion 
whether particular imported merchandise has been classified under an appropriate tariff provision generally entails a process ascertaining the proper meaning of specific terms within the tariff provision,and determining whether the merchandise at issue comes within the description of such terms as properly construed.intel singapore,united states.the first step is a question of law that is reviewed de novo the second is a question of fact that is reviewed for clear error.id.the issue in this case presents a question of law specifically,whether,in determining the htsus subheading under which the dell monitors should be classified,the court of international trade improperly relied upon certain provisions of the htsus.

benq first argument on appeal is one that the government does not dispute that the trial court erred in relying on note e to chapter,htsus,to exclude the monitors from heading.according to benq,note e applies only in two distinct situations in the case of a machine incorporating an adp machine and performing a specific function other than data processing or in the case of a machine presented with an adp machine and intended to work in conjunction with the adp to perform a specific function other than data processing,as set forth in the explanatory note to chapter,note at the time of importation benq monitors did not incorporate an adp machine,did not work in conjunction with an adp to perform a function other than data processing,and were not presented with an adp machine.therefore,benq argues and the government agrees,the court reliance on chapter,note e,was in error.
the government also concedes benq second argument that the court of international trade erroneously relied on the first clause of an explanatory note to heading to exclude benq monitors from that heading.benq argues that the first clause of the explanatory note to heading,which requires that a display unit of an adp be capable of accepting a signal only from the central processing unit of an adp,conflicts with the statutory language of note b a to chapter,which states that a unit can be classified under heading if,amongst other things,it is of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data processing system.chapter,note b a emphasis added.see appellee br.to the extent that the explanatory notes to heading at support the trial court reading of note e,we believe that the explanatory notes may conflict with note b and,accordingly,do not govern here.
benq principal argument is that the court of international trade should have determined,and that we should now determine,the principal function of the dell monitors,as required by section xvi,note,htsus.benq urges that the monitors principal function is serving as an output display unit of an adp system,and that the monitors thus should be classified in heading as units of adps.appellant br.benq argues that section xvi,note,prevails over chapter,note b a,and the principal use analysis under ari a,because the chapter note relates to only one of the competing headings,whereas both chapter and chapter fall within section xvi.benq also argues that ari applies i n the absence of special language or context which otherwise requires and that section xvi,note provides such special language or context.benq requests that we perform a principal function analysis through an application of the factors set forth in united states carborundum,f d,even though those factors are typically used to establish whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind for purposes of a principal use analysis.in the alternative,benq argues that we should remand the case to the court of international trade for it to perform a principal function analysis.
the government responds that we should affirm the court of international trade decision for several alternative reasons.first,the government points out that benq has admitted that the monitors are capable of connection to a video source as video monitors.benq,d at.thus,the government contends,the monitors fall squarely under heading,which is a broad eo nomine provision covering,inter alia,video monitors.
next,the government argues that benq has not established that the monitors should be classified in heading,which is directed to automatic data processing machines and units thereof.benq,the government observes,does not argue that the monitors are adp machines,but instead that they are units thereof.as noted above,chapter,note b,provides statutory requirements for units of adp systems,requiring at note b a that such units be of a kind solely or principally used in an adp system.the government argues,and benq does not dispute,that chapter,note b,invokes a principal use analysis under ari a.see primal lite,united states,grp.italglass,united states.int l trade,reconsideration granted in part by.int l trade thus,
chapter,note b,lists three features which,if present,indicate that,pursuant to note c,a unit is to be regarded as being a part of a complete adp system under heading.notes b and c to chapter of the htsus state 
b automatic data processing machines may be in the form of systems consisting of a variable number of separate units.subject to paragraph e below,a unit is to be regarded as being a part of a complete system if it meets all the following conditions 
a it is of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data processing system 
b it is connectable to the central processing unit either directly or through one or more other units and 
c it is able to accept or deliver data in a form codes or signals which can be used by the system.
c separately presented units of an automatic data processing machine are to be classified in heading.
as already seen,note e,which is referenced in note b,states 
e machines performing a specific function other than data processing and incorporating or working in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine are to be classified in the headings appropriate to their respective functions or,failing that,in residual headings.
as noted above,the court of international trade did not perform an analysis under chapter,note b,because the court concluded that note e and the explanatory note to heading prohibited classification in heading.benq,d at.the parties take the position that the court reliance on note e and the relevant explanatory note was erroneous,and we agree.note e is limited to m achines performing a specific function other than data processing and incorporating or working in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine.the delltm monitors do not incorporate adp machines,but rather are separate and distinct units.additionally,the government does not appear to dispute that when performing a specific function other than data processing,such as when the monitors are serving as video monitors for other devices such as dvd players and vcrs,the monitors are working in conjunction with those other devices,not with an automatic data processing machine further,to the extent that the explanatory note to heading prohibits classification in heading for those machines that are not capable of accepting a signal only from the central processing unit of an automatic data processing machine,it contra
