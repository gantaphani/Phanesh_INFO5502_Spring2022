factual and procedural background 
dominik and sabine unterberger own a distributors,doing business as carma importers carma that distributes beverages and other items in maarten and other caribbean islands.in,the unterbergers approached red bull gmbh,an austrian company red bull austria,seeking the right to distribute its red bull energy drink in maarten and nearby islands.at the time,red bull austria had no distributors in the caribbean.in july,eva fischer of red bull austria asked unterberger for the names of the islands for which carma would like the sole distribution rights,and unterberger named,in addition to maarten,several islands in the immediate vicinity barts,eustatius,anguilla,saba,kitts and nevis.fischer responded with a fax message,stating that carma could distribute to maarten,eustatius,anguilla,saba,kitts,and nevis.carma began selling red bull energy drink in september.sales of red bull went extremely well in the first year.
in,after about nine months of doing business with red bull austria,the unterbergers met with eva fischer during a trip to germany.during that meeting,they asked her to reconfirm our terms.according to dominik unterberger unterberger,fischer said,listen,you guys are doing a very good job,and why would you,red bull austria,terminate anybody who is doing such a good job 
on april,red bull austria informed carma that,due to rapid expansion to over countries,it was restructuring its business,with immediate effect,so that the caribbean and central american countries would now be covered by our red bull north america operation,which would mean increased support and faster service.we are currently handing over all the files to the and red bull north america and ed torres area manager for the caribbean and central america will contact you in due course to set up individual business meetings and assess the current and future business with your companies.
carma continued to distribute red bull energy drink,dealing with red bull north america rbna.on august,in a memorandum advising unterberger of a price adjustment,rbna area manager wrote 
carma importers will have selling authorization for the territory of maarten and based on geographic proximity the islands of anguilla,saba and barths only.under no circumstances will carma importers entertain or engage in any sales activity outside of these areas.any deviation in this policy will result in the immediate ceasing of shipments and prompt termination of any relationship between rbna and carma importers.
sales continued to increase in and.on september and,rbna pichler vice president,elias dunia the new manager for the region,joel jelderks general manager for the caribbean,and dana montenegro a marketing consultant visited carma maarten office for the first time the market visit,to introduce the new area manager,assess how things were going and so on.rbna suggested various marketing activities,and told unterberger they thought he was doing a great job.on september,dunia forwarded rbna report on the market visit,for unterberger review and comment.under main issues,the report listed the current inventory,distribution levels,sales volume and unit prices,and also stated the following 
no significant rb marketing activity,except for some radio support in the island,in the past year,and 
carma has no distribution contract,only a letter of agreement with rb austria from.
the report then listed eleven next steps,including an evaluation of the sales potential for the remainder of the year and determining a forecast developing a promotional support program and a plan for and a special offer of free case in from september to december.the next steps also included distribution contract to be produced after legal consultation by rbna,and additional coverage to islands such as anguilla,barts,antigua,nevis,kitts,saba to be considered.
unterberger responded to rbna report,stating in an to dunia on september that there are a few things that we would like to add.among these items was the importance of carma importers receiving a proper contract is based primarily on the situation at hand.after we reestablish ourselves it is imperative that we have the surrounding islands assigned to us officially.dunia response on september stated they would work out a plan together to address support needs for future development in the market,and that marcus is working on the contract documents and will advise us all as soon as they are ready.
no contracts documents were forthcoming,however.according to unterberger,carma immediately began working on the next steps,but,except for providing the free case in deal,rbna performed none of the next steps to which it had agreed.within a few weeks,dunia began to discourage unterberger with n egative letters.when unterberger persuaded the sponsor of the heineken regatta,a big event in maarten,to allow carma to work with them,dunia said that carma work does not justify any amount amount of sponsoring.
eventually,on march,rbna terminated its business relationship with carma.in june,unterberger wrote a letter to red bull austria,seeking an appointment during an upcoming trip to germany,to find out the actual reasons for the decision made.in recounting the history of its dealings with red bull austria and rbna,unterberger observed that everything was going very well after the september market visit,until we inquired when we were to finally receive our long awaited contract.red bull austria was always reluctant to give us a contract due to the upcoming change over to red bull north america.
on march,the unterbergers and carma sued rbna for breach of contract and multiple other causes of action rbna obtained summary adjudication in its favor of many of the claims,including those for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the parties went to trial on carma claims for breach of contract.at the close of carma,the trial court granted rbna motion for nonsuit under code of civil procedure section,finding there was no evidence of a contract between carma and red bull gmbh or an assignment to red bull north america.
judgment was entered in rbna favor on march.the earlier notice of appeal filed by carma and the unterbergers is treated as having been filed immediately after entry of judgment.cal.rules of court,rule e.
discussion 
a.the trial court did not err in granting rbna motion for nonsuit.
carma contends it had a contract with red bull written,partly oral,and partly implied by the exclusive right to distribute red bull energy drink in maarten and neighboring islands,and that the contract could not be terminated without good cause carma further contends red bull austria assigned its contract to rbna,and rbna further expanded the contract by agreements made during the september market visit and reduced to writing in rbna report on the market visit carma claims rbna breached the contract when it terminated its relationship with carma on march,because it had no good cause to do so.
essential to carma claim is evidence that the arrangement between red bull austria and carma was not terminable at will,but instead could be terminated only for good cause,and that rbna assumed the obligations of red bull austria contract with carma,including the alleged oral promise that carma would be terminated only for good cause.carma claim fails,because it presented no evidence from which a jury could draw a conclusion favorable to carma on either point.
first,it has been held that,where there was no agreement that dist
