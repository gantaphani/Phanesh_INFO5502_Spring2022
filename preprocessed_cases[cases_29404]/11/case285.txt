starbucks corporation and starbucks brands,llc together,starbucks,appeal from a judgment entered on june,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,following a bench trial,in favor of,wolfe borough coffee,black bear micro roastery black bear.the district court found that starbucks failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief on its federal trademark infringement,dilution,and unfair competition claims brought pursuant to the lanham act,state trademark dilution claims brought pursuant to new york bus.law and unfair competition claim under new york common law.we vacate,in part,the district court decision and remand for further proceedings on the issue of whether starbucks demonstrated a likelihood of dilution by blurring under federal trademark law.in all other respects,the judgment of the learned district court is affirmed.
background 
preliminary facts 
starbucks,a company primarily engaged in the sale of coffee products,was founded in seattle,washington in.since its founding,starbucks has grown to over retail locations in the united states,canada,and foreign countries and territories.in addition to operating its retail stores,starbucks supplies its coffees to hundreds of restaurants,supermarkets,airlines,sport and entertainment venues,motion picture theaters,hotels,and cruise ship lines.starbucks also maintains an internet site that generates over hits per week from visitors.
in conducting all of its commercial activities,starbucks prominently displays its registered starbucks marks the starbucks marks on its products and areas of business.the starbucks marks include,inter alia,the tradename starbucks and its logo,which is circular and generally contains a graphic of a siren encompassed by the phrase starbucks coffee.starbucks has been the subject of trademark registrations continuously since and has approximately trademark registrations.starbucks also has foreign trademark registrations in countries.
from fiscal years to,starbucks spent over million on advertising,promotion,and marketing activities.these promotional activities included television and radio commercials,print advertising,and displays,and prominently feature d or,in the case of radio,mention ed the starbucks marks,which starbucks considers to be critical to the maintenance of its positive public image and identity.starbucks also enhanced its commercial presence by permitting the use of its products and retail stores in hollywood films and popular television programs.these films and programs contained scenes in which the starbucks marks were also prominently displayed.
as may be expected from its spending substantial time,effort and money advertising and promoting the starbucks marks throughout the united states and elsewhere,starbucks devotes substantial effort to policing its registered starbucks marks.starbucks has a regular practice of using watch services and other methods to identify potential infringers of the starbucks marks,and it routinely sends cease and desist letters and,if necessary,commences litigation in support of these efforts.
black bear,also a company engaged in the sale of coffee products,has its principal place of business in tuftonboro,new hampshire.in contrast to starbucks,black bear is a relatively small company owned by jim clark and his wife.it is a business that manufactures and sells roasted coffee beans and related goods via mail order,internet order,and at a limited number of new england supermarkets.black bear also sold coffee products from a retail outlet called the den,in portsmouth,new hampshire.to help operate its business,black bear hires some employees,such as one girl who comes in two days a week and helps with packaging,but black bear is otherwise operated by and jim clark,with the occasional help of their two daughters.
in april,black bear began selling a dark roasted blend of coffee called charbucks blend and later mister charbucks together,the charbucks marks.charbucks blend was sold in a packaging that showed a picture of a black bear above the large font black bear micro roastery.the package informed consumers that the coffee was roasted and air quenched in new hampshire and,in fairly large font,that you wanted it dark you got it dark mister charbucks was sold in a packaging that showed a picture of a man walking above the large font mister charbucks.the package also informed consumers that the coffee was roasted in new hampshire by the black bear micro roastery and that the coffee was roasted to the extreme for those who like the extreme.
not long after making its first sale of charbucks blend,in august,starbucks demanded that black bear cease use of the charbucks marks.having felt wrongly threatened by starbucks,and believing that w e had done anything wrong,black bear ultimately decided to continue selling its charbucks blend and mister charbucks.clark later testified,m y main objection was that basically this was a large corporation coming at me and saying,telling us what to do,and,oh,by the way you going to pay for it,too s ome of the requests that they were making were really off the wall.
complaint and trial 
after failed negotiations with black bear,on july,starbucks filed a complaint in the district court,alleging trademark dilution in violation of c,trademark infringement in violation of unfair competition in violation of a trademark dilution in violation of new york bus.law deceptive acts and business practices and false advertising in violation of new york bus.law,and unfair competition in violation of new york common law 
a bench trial was held on march,and march.among the evidence proffered during trial,starbucks introduced the testimony of warren mitofsky mitofsky,a scientist in the field of consumer research and polling.his testimony explained the results of his survey,which concluded in part that t he number one association of the name charbucks in the minds of consumers is with the brand starbucks and that t he name charbucks creates many negative associations in the mind of the consumer when it comes to describing coffee.mitofsky testified that the surveyed sample of persons were designed to be representative of the united states and that he believed a telephone survey of adults in the united states would do a good job of random sampling.mitofsky summarized the scope of his survey well,if you want to know the reaction to the name charbucks,then the telephone is perfectly adequate.if you want to measure the reaction or the familiarity with other visual cues,then it not the right method.
on december,the district court issued an opinion and order ruling in favor of black bear and dismissing starbucks complaint.among its findings,the court determined that there was neither actual dilution to establish a violation of the federal trademark laws nor any likelihood of dilution to establish a violation of new york trademark laws.the court also found that starbucks failed to prove its trademark infringement and unfair competition claims because there was no likelihood that consumers would confuse the charbucks marks for the starbucks marks.
subsequent proceedings 
starbucks appealed the district court judgment,and,while the appeal was pending,congress amended the trademark laws by passing the trademark dilution revision act of the tdra.see starbucks wolfe borough coffee,cir per curiam.the tdra was in response to the supreme court decision in moseley v secret catalogue,d,in which the supreme court held that the federal trademark dilution act required a showing of actual dilution in order to establish a dilution claim.see starbucks,at.the tdra amended the federal trademark dilution act to provide,inter alia,that the owner of a famous,distinctive mark is entitled to an injunction against the use of a mark that is likely to cause dilution of the famous mark.c.in light of the change in law,we vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded for further proceedings.starbucks,at.in so doing,we noted that a lthough the district court also considered whether starbucks had shown a likelihood of dilution under new york bus.law,it is not clear that that statute is coextensive with the amended statute.id.
on remand,the district court accepted additional briefing from both parties.both parties agreed that no further evidentiary proceedings were required.on june,the district court again entered judgment in favor of black bear,substantially the same reasons detailed in the court december decision but with additional analysis with respect to the federal dilution starbucks failed to demonstrate an entitlement to relief on its federal and state claims.starbucks timely appealed the district court june,judgment.
on appeal,starbucks primarily argues that the district court erred in finding that the charbucks marks are not likely to dilute the starbucks marks under federal and state law and that the district court erred in its factual findings and balancing of the relevant factors for determination of likelihood of confusion with respect to starbucks infringement and unfair competition claims.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we ordinarily review a district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law and its resolution of mixed questions of law and fact de novo.see design strategy,davis,cir.in the trademark context,we review the district court determinations as to each separate factor in polaroid multifactor test,see polaroid polarad elecs,cir,for clear error,while the court ultimate balancing of those factors is a matter of law subject to de novo review,see star indus.bacardi,cir.
federal trademark dilution 
under federal law,an owner of a famous,distinctive mark is entitled to an injunction against the user of a mark that is likely to cause dilution of the famous mark.starbucks wolfe borough coffee,cir per curiam quoting c.although the requirement that the mark be famous and distinctive significantly limits the pool of marks that may receive dilution protection,see savin savin group,cir,that the starbucks marks are famous within the meaning of c is not disputed by the parties in this case.rather,the focus of this appeal is on dilution itself.as specified by statute,federal dilution is actionable in two situations dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment.c.
dilution by blurring 
dilution by blurring is an association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark,c b,and may be found regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion,of competition,or of actual economic injury,c see also deere mtd products,cir nabisco,pf brands,cir.some classic examples of blurring include hypothetical anomalies as dupont shoes,buick aspirin tablets,schlitz varnish,kodak pianos,bulova gowns,and so forth.see mead data,toyota motor sales,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also id.stating that the primary concern in blurring actions is preventing the whittling away of an established trademark selling power through its unauthorized use by others.
federal law specifies six factors for the courts to consider in determining whether there is dilution by blurring 
i the degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.
ii the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark.
iii the extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark.
iv the degree of recognition of the famous mark.
v whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the famous mark.
vi any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.
c b i vi itc punchgini,cir.the district court found that the second,third,and fourth factors favored starbucks,and those findings are not challenged in this appeal.
with respect to the first degree of similarity between the district court did not clearly err in finding that the charbucks marks were minimally similar to the starbucks marks.although ch arbucks is similar to st arbucks in sound and spelling,it is evident from the record that the charbucks they are presented to minimally similar to the starbucks marks.the charbucks line of products are presented as either mister charbucks or charbucks blend in packaging that displays the black bear name in no subtle manner,and the packaging also makes clear that black bear is a micro roastery located in new hampshire.see playtex,at considering the differences in the ways the marks are presented in determining similarity in dilution action star,at in assessing similarity in the infringement context,courts look to the overall impression created by the logos and the context in which they are found and consider the totality of factors that could cause confusion among prospective purchasers.internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,black bear package design for charbucks coffee is different in imagery,color,and format from starbucks logo and signage.for example,either a graphic of a bear or a male person is associated with charbucks,and those marks are not comparable to the starbucks graphic of a siren in pose,shape,gender,or overall impression.indeed,the starbucks siren appears nowhere on the charbucks package.to the extent the charbucks marks are presented to the public through black bear website,the dissimilarity between the marks is still evident as the charbucks brand of coffee is accompanied by black bear domain name,www.blackbear coffee.com,and other products,such as shirts and cups,displaying black bear name.
furthermore,we note that it is unlikely that charbucks will appear to consumers outside the context of its normal use,since charbucks is not directly identifiable with the actual product,coffee beans.nabisco pf brands,cir observing that pepperidge farm famous goldfish mark may be identified outside of the packaging because the goldfish cracker itself is the famous mark.the term charbucks appears only on the packaging and on black bear mediums in which the charbucks marks similarity with starbucks is demonstratively starbucks has not identified any other method by which the charbucks marks likely would be presented to the public outside the context of its normal use.id.at m any consumers of the defendant crackers will not see the box they will find cheddar cheese crackers served in a dish at a bar or restaurant or friend house,looking very much like the familiar pepperidge farm goldfish product.to be sure,consumers may simply refer to mister charbucks or charbucks blend in conversation however,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that the mister prefix or blend suffix lessened the similarity between the charbucks marks and the starbucks marks in the court overall assessment of similarity 
inasmuch as starbucks argues that the district court clearly erred in concluding that charbucks is not a identifier of black bear products,we find starbucks argument to be unpersuasive.starbucks asserts that the district court should have ignored the term mister or blend before or after charbucks in assessing the degree of similarity factor because those terms are generic and too weak to serve a function.this argument to ignore relevant evidence is unfounded in the law.see c b accord report,at,reprinted in,emphasizing that a court is permitted to consider all relevant factors in determining the presence of dilution by blurring.and in any event,even if the core term charbucks were used to identify a product as a term,such finding would not be dispositive of the district court overall assessment of the degree of similarity.see playtex,at.in this case,the district court reasons for a finding of minimal similarity between the charbucks marks and the starbucks marks were well supported by the record,as explained above.
upon its finding that the marks were not substantially similar,however,the district court concluded that t his dissimilarity alone is sufficient to defeat starbucks blurring claim,and in any event,this factor at a minimum weighs strongly against starbucks in the dilution analysis.we conclude that the district court erred to the extent it required substantial similarity between the marks,and,in this connection,we note that the court may also have placed undue significance on the similarity factor in determining the likelihood of dilution in its alternative analysis.
prior to the tdra,this court has held that a plaintiff can not prevail on a state or federal dilution claim unless the marks at issue are very or substantially similar.playtex,at.notably,under the law,the federal statute provided a remedy for dilution of famous marks but did not define dilution,much less inform the courts of the importance of similarity in the dilution analysis.
the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable,to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark 
c.our adoption of a substantially similar requirement for federal dilution claims,see playtex,at,can likely be attributed to the lack of guidance under the former federal statute and the existence of a substantially similar requirement under state dilution statutes,which were better defined,see generally federal express federal espresso,cir mead data,at.
the federal dilution statute,however,provides us with a compelling reason to discard the substantially similar requirement for federal trademark dilution actions.the current federal statute defines dilution by blurring as an association arising from the similarity between a mark and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark,and the statute lists six factors for determining the existence of an actionable claim for blurring.c b.although similarity is an integral element in the definition of blurring,we find it significant that the federal dilution statute does not use the words very or substantial in connection with the similarity factor to be considered in examining a federal dilution claim.see c bonime avaya,cir in determining the proper interpretation of a statute,this court will look first to the plain language of a statute and interpret it by its ordinary,common meaning.internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,one of the six statutory factors informing the inquiry as to whether the allegedly diluting mark impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark is t he degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.c b i emphasis added.consideration of a degree of similarity as a factor in determining the likelihood of dilution does not lend itself to a requirement that the similarity between the subject marks must be substantial for a dilution claim to succeed.see bonime,at.moreover,were we to adhere to a substantial similarity requirement for all dilution by blurring claims,the significance of the remaining five factors would be materially diminished because they would have no relevance unless the degree of similarity between the marks are initially determined to be substantial.such requirement of substantial similarity is at odds with the federal dilution statute,which lists degree of similarity as one of several factors in determining blurring.see united states kozeny,cir statutory enactments should be read so as to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted compare c b ii providing t he degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark as one of the factors to be considered in determining dilution,with ebay,cir comparing federal dilution law with california dilution law and noting that the similarity requirement in a dilution action may be less stringent in circumstances in which the senior marks is highly distinctive and the junior mark is being used for a closely related product.internal quotation marks omitted accordingly,the district court erred to the extent it focused on the absence of substantial similarity between the charbucks marks and the starbucks marks to dispose of starbucks dilution claim.we note that the court error likely affected its view of the importance of the other factors in analyzing the blurring claim,which must ultimately focus on whether an association,arising from the similarity between the subject marks,impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.c b,at see supra note.
turning to the remaining two disputed factors whether the user of the mark intended to create an association with the famous mark,and whether there is evidence of any actual association between the mark and the famous conclude that the district court also erred in considering these factors.
the district court determined that black bear possessed the requisite intent to associate charbucks with starbucks but that this factor did not weigh in favor of starbucks because black bear did not act in bad faith.the determination of an intent to associate,however,does not require the additional consideration of whether bad faith corresponded with that intent.the plain language of section c requires only the consideration of w hether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the famous mark.see c b v see also kozeny,at we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,where,as here,the allegedly diluting mark was created with an intent to associate with the famous mark,this factor favors a finding of a likelihood of dilution.
the district court also determined that there was not an actual association favoring starbucks in the dilution analysis.starbucks,however,submitted the results of a telephone survey where of consumers responded that starbucks was the possible source of charbucks.the survey also showed that of consumers responded starbucks to the question w hat is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the name charbucks.in rejecting starbucks claim of actual association,the district court referred to evidence supporting the absence of actual confusion to conclude that the evidence is insufficient to make the factor weigh in starbucks favor to any significant degree.internal quotation marks and original alteration omitted.this was error,as the absence of actual or even of a likelihood of confusion does not undermine evidence of trademark dilution.see c b accord nabisco,at stating that while a showing of consumer confusion is relevant in determining dilution by blurring,the absence of confusion has no probative value in the dilution analysis.
accordingly,in light of the foregoing,we remand to the district court for consideration of starbucks claim of trademark dilution by blurring under c b.
dilution by tarnishment 
dilution by tarnishment is an association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.c c.a trademark may be tarnished when it is linked to products of shoddy quality,or is portrayed in an unwholesome or unsavory context,with the result that the public will associate the lack of quality or lack of prestige in the defendant goods with the plaintiff unrelated goods.hormel foods jim henson productions,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a trademark may also be diluted by tarnishment if the mark loses its ability to serve as a wholesome identifier of plaintiff product.accord chemical,cir finding that use of exterminator slogan where there life,there bugs tarnished the use of beer company slogan where there life,there bud.steinway sons robert demars friends,finding that use of to sell beverage handles tarnished musical instrument company use of its name of steinway sons eastman kodak rakow.finding that comedian stage name kodak tarnished the mark of the eastman kodak company because the comedian act includes humor that relates to bodily functions and sex and uses crude,language repeatedly internal quotation marks omitted dallas cowboys cheerleaders,pussycat cinema.finding that pornographic depiction of a dallas cowboys cheerleader in an adult film tarnished the professional mark of the dallas cowboys cheerleaders,aff,cir.
starbucks argues that the district court erred by failing to find that charbucks damages the positive reputation of starbucks by evoking both starbucks and negative impressions in consumers,including the image of bitter,coffee.starbucks reasons that it has shown dilution by tarnishment because,pursuant to its survey,of persons surveyed immediately associated charbucks with starbucks and of those surveyed who associated charbucks with starbucks indicated that they would have a negative impression of a coffee named charbucks.we are unpersuaded by starbucks reasoning.
to the extent starbucks relies on the survey,a mere association between charbucks and starbucks,coupled with a negative impression of the name charbucks,is insufficient to establish a likelihood of dilution by tarnishment.that a consumer may associate a junior mark with a famous mark says little of whether the consumer views the junior mark as harming the reputation of the famous mark.the more relevant question,for purposes of tarnishment,would have been how a hypothetical coffee named either mister charbucks or charbucks blend would affect the positive impressions about the coffee sold by starbucks.we will not assume that a purportedly junior mark will likely harm the reputation of the famous mark by mere association when the survey conducted by the party claiming dilution could have easily enlightened us on the matter.indeed,it may even have been that charbucks would strengthen the positive impressions of starbucks because it brings to the attention of consumers that the char is absent in star bucks,and,therefore,of the two bucks,starbucks is the and more appealing product.juxtaposition may bring to light more appealing aspects of a name that otherwise would not have been brought to the attention of ordinary observers.
starbucks also argues that charbucks is a pejorative term for starbucks coffee,and,therefore,the charbucks name has negative associations that consumers are likely to associate with starbucks coffee.although the term charbucks was once used pejoratively during the in boston,massachusetts,black bear is not propagating that negative meaning but,rather,is redefining charbucks to promote a positive image for its brand of coffee.black bear sells charbucks as its own product,and,consistent with its intent on profiting from selling charbucks,the charbucks line of coffee is of v ery high quality.it our life.we put everything into it.in short,black bear is promoting charbucks and not referring to it in a way as to harm the reputation of starbucks coffees.deere,at stating that the likelihood of dilution by tarnishment means the possibility that consumers will come to attribute unfavorable characteristics to a mark and ultimately associate the mark with inferior goods and services.
moreover,that the charbucks line of coffee is marketed as a product of v ery high quality as starbucks also purports its coffee to inconsistent with the concept of tarnishment.see hormel foods,at citing cases finding tarnishment where challenged marks were either seamy or substantially of lesser quality than the famous mark.certainly,the similarity between charbucks and starbucks in that they are both v ery high quality coffees may be relevant in determining dilution,see c b,c c,but such similarity in this case undercuts the claim that charbucks harms the reputation of starbucks.see deere mtd,cir tarnishment generally arises when the plaintiff trademark is linked to products of shoddy quality,or is portrayed in an unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke unflattering thoughts about the owner product.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in rejecting starbucks claim of dilution by tarnishment.
the parody exception 
even if its use of charbucks constituted dilution by either blurring or tarnishment,black bear appears to argue in the alternative that charbucks is a parody and thus falls under an exception to c.section c,which was added in pursuant to the tdra,specifies that the following uses of a mark shall not be actionable as dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment 
a any fair use,including a nominative or descriptive fair use,or facilitation of such fair use,of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person own goods or services,including use in connection with 
i advertising or promotion that permits consumers to compare goods or services or 
ii identifying and parodying,criticizing,or commenting upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner.
b all forms of news reporting and news commentary.
c any noncommercial use of a mark.
c emphasis added.
as evident from the statutory language,black bear use of the charbucks marks can not qualify under the parody exception because the charbucks marks are used as a designation of source for black bear own goods,the charbucks line of coffee.see c a.although black bear cites to several cases in support of its argument that the parody exception may still apply even if the parody were used to identify the source of the defendants goods,those cases were decided before the tdra and are thus inapposite to the extent they are inconsistent with the amended section c.see louis vuitton malletier haute diggity dog,llc,cir.
inasmuch as black bear argument may be construed as advocating for consideration of parody in determining the likelihood of dilution by as is recognized by the fourth circuit,see id.at need not adopt or reject louis vuitton parody holding.we conclude that black bear use of the charbucks marks is not a parody of the kind which would favor black bear in the dilution analysis even if we were to adopt the fourth circuit rule.
in the fourth circuit louis vuitton case,louis vuitton malletier famous maker of luxury luggage,handbags,and,inter alia,a trademark dilution claim against haute diggity dog,llc,a manufacturer of pet toys that named its products to parody elegant brands of products such as perfume,cars,shoes,sparkling wine,and handbags.id.at.among its parodies,haute diggity dog,llc chewy vuiton product was alleged by louis vuitton malletier as infringing and dilutive of the louis vuitton mark.id.at.
addressing the dilution claim,the fourth circuit initially noted that the fair use exception for parodies as specified in c a does not extend to parodies used as a trademark p arodying a famous mark is protected by the fair use defense only if the parody is not a designation of source for the person own goods or services.louis vuitton,at.the fourth circuit then held,however,that the defendant use of a parody may still be considered in determining whether the of a famous mark has proved its claim that the defendant use of a parody mark is likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous mark,whether the plaintiff has proved a likelihood of dilution by blurring under c b.id.at.in justifying its consideration of a parody element in conducting the blurring analysis under section c b,the fourth circuit explained 
f actor v whether the defendant intended to create an association with the famous mark and factor vi whether there exists an actual association between the defendant mark and the famous mark directly invite inquiries into the defendant intent in using the parody,the defendant actual use of the parody,and the effect that its use has on the famous mark.while a parody intentionally creates an association with the famous mark in order to be a parody,it also intentionally communicates,if it is successful,that it is not the famous mark,but rather a satire of the famous mark.that the defendant is using its mark as a parody is therefore relevant in the consideration of these statutory factors.
similarly,factors i,ii,and iv the degree of similarity between the two marks,the degree of distinctiveness of the famous mark,and its directly implicated by consideration of the fact that the defendant mark is a successful parody.indeed,by making the famous mark an object of the parody,a successful parody might actually enhance the famous mark distinctiveness by making it an icon.the brunt of the joke becomes yet more famous.
id.internal citations omitted.the fourth circuit then concluded that chewy vuiton did not dilute louis vuitton primarily because chewy vuiton convey ed the message that it was not in fact a source of louis vuitton products a s a parody,it separated itself from the louis vuitton marks in order to make fun of them.id.at b ecause louis vuitton mark is particularly strong and distinctive,it becomes more likely that a successful parody will not impair the distinctiveness of the mark.
here,unlike in louis vuitton,black bear use of the charbucks marks is,at most,a subtle satire of the starbucks marks.although we recognize some humor in char bucks as a reference to the dark roast of the starbucks coffees,black bear claim of humor fails to demonstrate such a clear parody as to qualify under the fourth circuit rule.as the owner of black bear affirmed during his testimony,t he inspiration for the term charbucks comes directly from starbucks tendency to roast its products more darkly than that of other major roasters.the owner of black bear further testified that the charbucks line of products is the darkest roasted coffee that we do and is of v ery high quality.thus,the charbucks parody is promoted not as a satire or irreverent commentary of starbucks but,rather,as a beacon to identify charbucks as a coffee that competes at the same level and quality as starbucks in producing coffees.see harley davidson,grottanelli,cir p arodic use is sharply limited in circumstances where an alleged parody of a competitor mark is used to sell a competing product.louis vuitton,at permitting parodic use where the parody marketed its products to a significantly different class of consumers than the famous mark id.the louis vuitton handbag is provided for the most elegant and celebrity,to proudly display to the public and the press,whereas the imitation chewy vuiton handbag is designed to mock the celebrity and be used by a dog.
therefore,because the charbucks marks do not effect an increase in public identification of the starbucks marks with starbucks,the purported charbucks parody plays no part in undermining a finding of dilution under the fourth circuit rule.see generally hormel foods,at louis vuitton,at a parody relies upon a difference from the original mark,presumably a humorous difference,in order to produce its desired effect.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we conclude that black bear incantation of parody does nothing to shield it from starbucks dilution claim in this case.
state trademark dilution 
new york law provides that a l ikelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name shall be a ground for injunctive relief notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods or services.bus.law.similar to federal trademark dilution law under c,section has been interpreted to provide for protection against both dilution by blurring and tarnishment.see hormel foods,at.unlike federal trademark dilution law,however,new york trademark dilution law does not require a mark to be famous for protection against dilution to apply.compare c,with bus.law.nor are the factors that are considered for determining dilution by blurring under new york law coextensive with the factors for determining dilution by blurring under federal law.compare new york stock exchange,new york,new york hotel llc,cir to determine the likelihood of blurring,we have looked to six factors,including i the similarity of the marks ii the similarity of the products covered iii the sophistication of the consumers iv the existence of predatory intent v the renown of the senior mark and vi the renown of the junior mark,with c b i vi.most important to the distinction here,new york law does not permit a dilution claim unless the marks are substantially similar.see playtex,at a plaintiff can not prevail on a new york state or federal dilution claim unless the marks at issue are very or substantially similar.
because we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the charbucks marks are not substantially similar to the starbucks marks,the court did not err in denying starbucks relief under new york dilution law.moreover,for the reasons stated supra,part ii b dilution by tarnishment,we agree with the district court that starbucks failed to establish dilution by tarnishment under new york law.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not err in finding that there was no likelihood of dilution under new york law in this case.
trademark infringement and unfair competition claims 
to prevail on a trademark infringement and unfair competition claim under,a,in addition to demonstrating that the plaintiff mark is protected,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant use of the allegedly infringing mark would likely cause confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of the defendant goods with plaintiff goods.savin,at the crucial issue in an action for trademark infringement is whether there is any likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be misled,or indeed simply confused,as to the source of the goods in question.internal quotation marks omitted star,at in order to be confused,a consumer need not believe that the owner of the mark actually produced the item and placed it on the market.the public belief that the mark owner sponsored or otherwise approved the use of the trademark satisfies the confusion requirement.quoting dallas cowboys cheerleaders,at internal quotation marks omitted 
in determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion,we apply the balancing test introduced in polaroid polarad elecs,cir.the eight factors are strength of the trademark similarity of the marks proximity of the products and their competitiveness with one another evidence that the senior user may bridge the gap by developing a product for sale in the market of the alleged infringer product evidence of actual consumer confusion evidence that the imitative mark was adopted in bad faith respective quality of the products and sophistication of consumers in the relevant market.star,at.the application of the polaroid test is not mechanical,but rather,focuses on the ultimate question of whether,looking at the products in their totality,consumers are likely to be confused.see also id.at a plaintiff must prove a probability of confusion,not a mere possibility,affecting numerous ordinary prudent purchasers in order to establish a likelihood of confusion internal quotation marks omitted gruner jahr usa publ g meredith,cir.
here,that the starbucks marks are strong ones first factor,that the parties use their respective marks in connection with the sale of coffee products third factor,and that there is no competitive gap to be bridged between the relevant commercial activities of the parties fourth factor are not disputed.whether these factors should favor starbucks,however,is contested to some extent by black bear.specifically,although black bear accepts that the third factor favors starbucks in determining the likelihood of confusion,black bear argues that the first and fourth factors do not favor starbucks in the determination of a likelihood of confusion 
we agree with black bear first argument that the bridging the gap factor is irrelevant and thus should not favor starbucks where,as here,the two products are in direct competition with each other.star,at explaining that when products are in direct competition,there is really no gap to bridge,and the bridging factor is irrelevant to the polaroid analysis.thus,in this respect,we find error in the district court polaroid analysis.of course,we hasten to add that this error was inconsequential because the district court ultimately concluded that it was not likely that charbucks would be confused with starbucks.
we reject black bear second argument,however,that the particularly strong starbucks marks should weigh against the likelihood of confusion.in so arguing,black bear ignores the rule that a strong mark would be a factor favoring the trademark plaintiff.hormel foods,at emphasis added id.the more deeply a plaintiff mark is embedded in the consumer mind,the more likely it is that the defendant mark will conjure up the image of the plaintiff product instead of that of the jun
