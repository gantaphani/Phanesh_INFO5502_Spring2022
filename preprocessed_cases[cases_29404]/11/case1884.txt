center trust duties as a landlord 
center trust owned the mall in which the restaurant was a tenant.all landowners,including landlords,must use reasonable care to protect people who come onto their property,caci.for landlords,reasonable care ordinarily involves making sure the property is safe at the beginning of the tenancy,and repairing any hazards the landlord learns about later.as the court explained in mata mata th,d disapproved in part on another ground in delgado trax bar grill cal th,d.
because a landlord has relinquished possessory interest in the land,his or her duty of care to third parties injured on the land is attenuated as compared with the tenant who enjoys possession and control.thus,before liability may be thrust on a landlord for a third party injury due to a dangerous condition on the land,the plaintiff must show that the landlord had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition in question,plus the right and ability to cure the condition.
limiting a landlord obligations releases it from needing to engage in potentially intrusive oversight of the property,thus permitting the tenant to enjoy its tenancy unmolested.a landlord move to evict a defaulting tenant unsettles their relationship,however,requiring a rebalancing of their rights and duties.stone argued in the trial court that center trust duty of care should have expanded to include inspecting the restaurant,during which it would have discovered a water leak.center trust contends nothing should have changed,however,leaving it with no duty to inspect the restaurant or protect its tenant customers.uccello laudenslayer d.landlord ordinarily not liable to a tenant guests and invitees for dangerous conditions which arise on the property after the tenant occupies it see also chee amanda goldt property management th,d miller and starr,cal.real estate ed.from the jury verdict for stone,we infer the jury found center trust breached a duty to her.we conclude center trust did have a duty,but the trial got off onto the wrong track because the court did not adequately define that duty scope.
the court instructed the jury that a landlord must act reasonably to correct defects it knew,or should have known,about.christensen superior court cal d,d,duty legal question for court.the court did not,however,mention any duty to inspect.we conclude it should have instructed such a duty existed during the eviction proceedings.unlawful detainer actions substitute for a landlord to avoid,in part,the conflict and possible violence of a landlord trying on its own initiative to physically evict a defaulting tenant.unlawful detainer suits do not,however,bar contact between a landlord and tenant.moreover,as a general proposition litigation does not excuse a landlord turning a blind eye to conditions on its property.center trust knew defaulting tenants sometimes neglected property.furthermore,center trust knew the restaurant was violating its lease by running an dance club on the premises.despite knowing of the restaurant lease violations and aware of possible neglect of the premise physical condition,center trust did not inspect its property.
it is one thing for a landlord to leave a tenant alone who is complying with its lease.it is entirely different,however,for a landlord to ignore a defaulting tenant possible neglect of property.neglected property endangers the public,and a landlord detachment frustrates the public policy of keeping property in good repair and safe.to strike the right balance between safety and disfavored,we hold that center trust duty to inspect attached upon entry of the judgment of possession in the unlawful detainer action and included reasonable periodic inspections thereafter.biakanja irving cal d,important factors to consider in finding a duty of care are foreseeability of harm and preventing future harm.upon entry of judgment,a tenant incentive to maintain a property dissipates because continued maintenance likely benefits only the landlord.to protect the public,the incentive to maintain the property must not be an orphan abandoned by a tenant and ignored by a shortly reoccupying landlord.entry of judgment provides a workable bright line for the parties to know where responsibility lies,and aligns that responsibility with the parties reordered incentives.mora baker commodities,d.the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk and the likelihood of injury will affect the determination of what constitutes a reasonable inspection.
not only did center trust have the duty to inspect,it had the right.martinez bank of america th,d,is instructive.there,the court found that during prosecution of unlawful detainer proceedings,a landlord did not have the right,and therefore had no duty,to inspect property over the tenant objection.martinez,at,d.martinez implies,however,that upon entry of a judgment of possession,the property owner has both the right and duty to inspect.it states,until a judgment was obtained and satisfied in that unlawful detainer proceeding,the property owner did not have the ability to directly and promptly control conditions existing on the property occupied by the tenant.citation.for that reason,the property owner had no duty to third parties on the property.martinez,at,d but see leakes shamoun d.landlord has less control over tenant who is not doing something as basic as paying rent.here,the lease explicitly gave center trust the right to inspect if the restaurant defaulted.the eviction proceedings reaffirmed that power and right,and transformed center trust from a landlord disinterested about the restaurant conditions to a landlord on the verge of recovering its property and who could not ign
