the department of alcoholic beverage control the department appeals from the superior court order denying the department request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin miller brewing company miller from giving consumers cash rebates on the purchase of beer when the consumers buy certain nonalcoholic products.
according to the department,miller promotional campaign,which the department refers to as a contingent rebate scheme,violates business and professions code section hereafter section and california code of regulations,title,section hereafter rule.we disagree.
as we will explain,almost years ago section was construed by this court to allow cash rebates on the purchase of alcoholic beverages.since then,the legislature has amended section without altering that construction of the statute,thus acquiescing in the court interpretation of legislative intent.nothing in the language of section supports the department position that the legislature intent to allow direct cash rebates on the purchase of alcoholic beverages does not extend to cash rebates contingent upon the purchase of nonalcoholic products.and,because the provisions of rule can not exceed the scope of its enabling statute,section,the department can not rely on rule to prohibit contingent rebate promotional campaigns.
accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment,denying the request for a preliminary injunction to stop miller rebate campaign.
background 
miller rebate promotion gives coupons to consumers for or off of the purchase of one of miller beer products if the consumers purchase specified nonalcoholic products,such as ground beef,pickles,soda,or buns.for example,one promotion offers off the purchase of foster beer,which is distributed by miller,when the consumer purchases a pound or more of shrimp.some of the coupons may be redeemed instantly at the time of purchase,while others must be mailed in to obtain the rebate.the department refers to the promotion as a contingent rebate program because the rebate on the purchase of beer is contingent upon the consumer purchase of a nonalcoholic item.
the department sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against miller,alleging that the campaign violates section,which provides in pertinent part a no licensee shall,directly or indirectly,give any premium,gift,or free goods in connection with the sale or distribution of any alcoholic beverage,except as provided by rules that shall be adopted by the department to implement this section or as authorized by this division.b no rule of the department may permit a licensee to give any premium,gift,or free goods of greater than inconsequential value in connection with the sale or distribution of beer.with respect to beer,premiums,gifts,or free goods,including advertising specialties that have no significant utilitarian value other than advertising,shall be deemed to have greater than inconsequential value if they cost more than cents per unit,or cost more than fifteen dollars in the aggregate for all those items given by a single supplier to a single retail premises per calendar year.
in the department view,the contingent rebates are premiums within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and thus are prohibited because they exceed the limit imposed by subdivision b of section.the department also argues that rule prohibits miller promotion.
relying on this court decision in gonzales department of alcoholic bev.control d.hereafter gonzales,the superior court ruled that the cash rebates offered by miller are not premiums,and therefore are not prohibited by section.the court also held the rebates are not barred by the department interpretation of rule because the department does not have the authority to issue a regulation exceeding the scope of the enabling statute.
discussion 
in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction,the superior court must consider the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial,and weigh the interim harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is denied against the interim harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted.cohen board of supervisors cal d.ordinarily,an order denying a preliminary injunction is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.ibid.however,where as here the factor of the likelihood of prevailing on the merits depends upon a question of law or the construction of a statute,rather than upon evidence to be introduced at a subsequent full trial,the standard of review is whether the superior court correctly interpreted and applied the law,which we review de novo.efstratis first northern bank th,d garamendi executive life ins.th,d.
the department does not assert that the contingent rebate coupons are gifts or free goods within the meaning of section.rather,it contends the superior court erred in relying on gonzales,supra,d,for the proposition that,as a matter of law,the contingent rebates offered by miller are not premiums within the meaning of section.
gonzales addressed whether section prohibited a winegrower from offering,via newspaper advertisements,a cash rebate to purchasers of certain types of wine.gonzales,supra,d at.at the time,section simply provided no licensee shall,directly or indirectly,give any premium,gift,or free goods in connection with the sale of any alcoholic beverage.any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.stats,ch.
gonzales observed that the rebate was not a gift because,in order to receive it,one had to purchase wine.it was not free goods because goods does not ordinarily mean money.gonzales,supra,d at.the parties disputed whether the rebate was a premium,which term is not defined in section.gonzales acknowledged that the word premium may be defined in various ways,some of which would include,and some of which would exclude,a rebate.id.at.for example,if a premium is defined as something given without charge or at less than the usual price with the purchase of a product or a service,then a rebate arguably falls within the definition of premium.ibid.
after reviewing the statutory history of the alcoholic beverage control act the act,gonzales discovered that the legislature had distinguished between rebates and premiums for many years and had not used these terms interchangeably in section.gonzales,supra,d at.concluding the legislature intended the words to have different meanings and did not intend to include a rebate as a premium for purposes of the statute id.at,gonzales held that a rebate of money,in the form of a refund of a portion of the retail price paid for an alcoholic beverage does not constitute a premium within the meaning of section and is therefore not made unlawful by that statute.id.at.
the department asserts that,when gonzales was decided in,section did not include prohibitions regarding the total business of merchandising alcohol,there was no concept or definition of inconsequential value,and there was no statutory bases for the promulgation of rules as currently exists in the code of regulations.thus,according to the department,gonzales did not have the benefit or guidance of the complex statutory authority that exists today.
apparently,the department believes these statutory changes undermine or affect the basis for the decision in gonzales,but it fails to explain why this is so.that the amended statute now permits the giving of premiums,gifts,and free goods that do not exceed a specifically defined inconsequential value,subd.b does not alter the meaning of these terms.nor is the meaning affected by the fact that licensees are now precluded from giving such items in connection with the distribution of alcohol in addition to the sale of alcohol,subd.a.
the interpretation of premium in gonzales was based on the legislative history of section and the act,and did not hinge upon the amount of the rebate in that case,the fact the statute did not address merchandising,or the department supposed lack of authority when gonzales was decided the department has failed to demonstrate that the later amendments to which it alludes have any bearing on the interpretation of the statutory term premium.
