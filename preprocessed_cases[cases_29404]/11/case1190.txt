kaiser foundation health plan,kaiser sued abbott laboratories,abbott and geneva pharmaceuticals geneva for violations of the sherman antitrust act and analogous provisions of california law.kaiser brought a claim under section one of the sherman act against both abbott and geneva,and a claim under section two against only abbott.a multidistrict litigation federal district court in florida allowed kaiser section one claim to go to trial.the suit was transferred to a federal district court in california for trial on that claim.the jury returned a verdict against kaiser.the district court in florida granted summary judgment against kaiser on its section two claim.
we affirm the judgment entered on the jury verdict on kaiser section one claim.we reverse summary judgment on kaiser section two claim and remand for further proceedings.
regulatory background 
the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et,governs the sale and manufacture of prescription drugs in the united states.any entity seeking to distribute a new prescription drug must file a new drug application nda with the food and drug administration fda.the application must include full reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use.b a.upon approval by the fda,a drug may be manufactured and sold in the united states.drugs approved by the fda under the nda process are commonly referred to as drugs.
drugs are typically protected by patents at the time of their approval by the fda,and for a number of years thereafter.a patent holder has the exclusive right to make,use and sell the patented invention during the life of the patent.a.a manufacturer of a drug protected by a patent is able to sell the drug at monopoly prices.
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,commonly referred to as the act or,was passed to facilitate the approval of generic versions of drugs.under,a manufacturer seeking fda approval of a new drug must file with its nda the patent number and expiration date of 
any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application or which claims a method of using such drug and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture,use,or sale of the drug.
id.b.the drug and its associate patent or patents are then published in the approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations,commonly referred to as the orange book.
under,a drug manufacturer seeking fda approval for a generic version of a drug may file an abbreviated new drug application anda showing that its proposed generic drug is the bioequivalent of an already approved drug.id.j.the anda shall contain,with respect to patents for the already approved drug listed in the orange book,
a certification 
i that such patent information has not been filed,
ii that such patent has expired,
iii of the date on which such patent will expire,or 
iv that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.
id.j a vii.such a certification is referred to as a paragraph i,paragraph ii,paragraph iii,or paragraph iv certification.the first anda applicant for approval of a generic version of a particular drug who makes a paragraph iv certification is guaranteed a period of exclusive distribution of the generic drug if that drug is approved by the fda.the period begins either on the date the applicant notifies the fda of its first commercial marketing of the generic drug,or on the date of the judicial decision holding the patent invalid or not infringed,whichever is earlier.id.j b iv.
an anda applicant who makes a paragraph iv certification must notify the patent holder of that certification.id.j b.if an anda contains a paragraph iv certification,fda approval of the proposed generic drug must be made effective immediately unless an action is brought for infringement of the patent that is the subject of the certification within days of the patent holder receiving notice of the certification.id.j b iii.if a patent holder brings suit within days,fda approval will not become effective until thirty months after the receipt of the notice,subject to certain exceptions.id.this delay is commonly referred to as the automatic stay.an exception to the automatic stay is a final court decision in the patent holder infringement suit that the patent is invalid or not infringed.in the event of such a court decision,fda approval shall be made effective on the date on which the court enters judgment reflecting the decision if the court decision is less than thirty months after receipt of the notice id.j b iii i.
if a patent holder fails to bring an infringement suit within days of receipt of a paragraph iv notification,it loses the right to the automatic stay of fda approval of the proposed generic drug.however,the patent holder does not lose the right to bring an infringement suit against the generic drug manufacturer the patent holder simply loses the right to bring the infringement suit under.a patent holder who misses the day deadline for bringing a infringement suit suffers two significant disadvantages.first,the patent holder can not bring an infringement suit immediately upon the filing of the anda it must wait until the generic drug is sold commercially.see e.see generally merck kgaa integra lifesciences i,d.second,there is no automatic stay barring the fda from approving the generic drug.once approved,its manufacturer may sell the generic drug during the pendency of any infringement suit brought by the patent holder.
ii.factual background and procedural history 
kaiser is a health care provider that buys large quantities of prescription drugs.abbott is a large developer and manufacturer of drugs.geneva is a large developer and manufacturer of generic drugs.
abbott sought and obtained fda approval through the nda process to sell terazosin hydrochloride as a drug to treat hypertension and enlarged prostate.abbott began selling terazosin hydrochloride,in tablet and capsule form,under the brand name hytrin in.the sale of hytrin was extremely lucrative.in,hytrin generated million in sales,accounting for more than twenty percent of abbott domestic sales of pharmaceutical products.
abbott submitted three patents,described below,for inclusion in the orange book in connection with its nda for terazosin hydrochloride.
patent the patent was filed on october,and issued on may.it protected terazosin hydrochloride.the patent expired on may.no generic drug manufacturer ever challenged the validity of the patent or sought to market a generic terazosin hydrochloride product before its expiration.
patent the patent,a divisional application of the patent,was filed on january,and issued on september.it protected a pharmaceutical composition of terazosin hydrochloride for treating hypertension and a method for treating hypertension with the drug.the patent was scheduled to expire on september.in separate litigation,abbott argued that the uruguay round agreements act extended the patent term until january.the federal circuit rejected abbott argument and held that the patent had expired on october.see abbott labs.novopharm.no generic drug manufacturer ever challenged the validity of the patent or sought to market a generic terazosin hydrochloride product before october.however,geneva and two other generic drug manufacturers filed andas before january,certifying under paragraph iii that the patent had expired on october.
patent the patent was filed on september,and issued on february.it protected dihydrate terazosin hydrochloride,its pharmaceutical composition,and a method for treating hypertension with dihydrate terazosin hydrochloride.the patent expired on february.no generic drug manufacturer ever challenged the validity of the patent.
just as the and patents were about to expire,or had expired,abbott filed three more patents for terazosin hydrochloride.they were as follows.
patent the patent was filed on july,and issued on march.it protected a crystalline polymorph of terazosin hydrochloride with a certain diffraction pattern form ii.the patent was listed in the march supplement to the orange book,and was scheduled to expire on april.
patent the patent was filed on may,and issued on may.it protected a crystalline polymorph of terazosin hydrochloride with a different diffraction pattern form iii.the patent was listed in the orange book on may,and was scheduled to expire on april.
patent the patent was filed on october,and issued on april.it protected a crystalline polymorph of terazosin hydrochloride with a different diffraction pattern form iv and a process for preparing terazosin hydrochloride dihydrate using form iv.the patent was submitted to the fda for listing in the orange book on april,and was scheduled to expire on april.
geneva began work on a generic version of hytrin in and subsequently filed two andas related to terazosin hydrochloride.geneva filed its first anda in january,for a tablet form of generic terazosin hydrochloride tablet anda.in december,geneva filed its second anda for a capsule form of generic terazosin hydrochloride capsule anda.between and,geneva made six paragraph iv certifications related to these andas and provided notice to abbott for each certification.we describe the certifications in turn.
first,on january,geneva provided abbott notice of a paragraph iv certification for its tablet anda with respect to the patent.it asserted that its proposed generic terazosin hydrochloride would not infringe the patent because its product was anhydrous without water rather than dihydrate including water terazosin hyrdochloride.
second,on october,geneva provided abbott notice of a paragraph iv certification for its tablet anda with respect to the patent.it asserted that the patent expired on october.geneva proposed to sell generic terazosin hydrochloride after october,but before january,the date abbott claimed its patent expired.
third,also on october,geneva provided abbott notice of a paragraph iv certification for its tablet anda with respect to the patent.it asserted that its proposed generic terazosin hydrochloride would not infringe the patent because its product used an anhydrous form of terzosin hyrdochloride different from the form iii claimed in the patent.
fourth,on february,geneva provided abbott notice of a paragraph iv certification for its capsule anda with respect to the patent.it asserted that its proposed generic terazosin hydrochloride would not infringe the patent because its product contained form iv terazosin hydrochloride rather than the form ii claimed in the patent.abbott patent claiming form iv terazosin hydrochloride was not issued until april,a month and a half after geneva paragraph iv certification.
finally,on april,geneva provided abbott notice of two paragraph iv certifications with respect to the patent.one certification supplemented geneva tablet anda and the other supplemented geneva capsule anda.geneva conceded that these two proposed products infringed the part of the patent that protected form iv terazosin hydrochloride,but it asserted this part of the patent was invalid under b.section b bars patents on inventions that already have been patented,described in a printed publication,or sold in the united states more than one year before the patent application.the bar on patents for inventions previously sold in the united states is commonly referred to as the bar.
abbott filed timely suits under in response to five of geneva six paragraph iv certifications.in those five suits,abbott received the automatic stay of fda approval.however,abbott neglected to file a timely suit under in response to geneva paragraph iv certification with respect to the patent for the capsule form of generic terazosin hydrochloride.the fda proceeded to evaluate geneva capsule anda.geneva received final fda approval to market its capsule form of terazosin hydrochloride on march.at the time of the fda approval,there had been no judicial determination of the validity of the patent.
between and,seven generic drug manufacturers filed andas seeking fda approval of generic terazosin hydrochloride accompanied by paragraph iv certifications.in chronological order of their andas,those manufacturers were in addition to geneva novopharm,zenith,invamed,lemmon pharmacal,and mylan pharmaceuticals.abbott filed infringement suits in response to all of the andas,with the exception of geneva capsule anda that infringed the patent.all told,abbott filed seventeen patent infringement suits during this period in an attempt to preserve its hytrin market monopoly.
on april,two days after the fda approved geneva capsule anda,abbott and geneva entered into a contract.in brief,geneva agreed to keep its generic capsule form of terazosin hydrochloride off the market until the earliest of the sale of generic terazosin hydrochloride by another generic manufacturer,the expiration date of the patent february,or a final unappealable judgment holding the patent invalid.in return,abbott agreed to pay geneva million dollars per month during this period.if a final but appealable judgment holding the patent invalid was rendered during the period,abbott would pay the million per month into escrow until the earliest of the three events occurred.
abbott and zenith had entered into a comparable contract the day before,on march.like geneva,zenith had filed an anda in june seeking approval of a generic terazosin hydrochloride drug.zenith successfully opposed two patent infringement suits brought by abbott under its patent.see abbott labs.zenith,zenith.abbott then submitted its and patents for inclusion in the orange book.in march,the fda informed zenith that it would have to amend its anda to provide a paragraph iv certification with respect to these patents.zenith declined to do so.instead,it filed suit against abbott alleging that the and patents had been improperly listed in the orange book and seeking an injunction requiring that they be delisted.abbott counterclaimed for infringement.
in brief,zenith agreed in its contract with abbott to dismiss its delisting suit and not to sell any form of terazosin hydrochloride until another generic manufacturer began to sell generic terazosin hydrochloride or until the patent expired february,whichever occurred first.in return,abbott agreed to dismiss its counterclaim and to pay zenith million immediately,million after three months,and million every three months thereafter until march,unless excused earlier by the terms of the contract.valley drug geneva,cir.
among the seventeen suits brought by abbott was an infringement suit under against geneva,novopharm and invamed alleging infringement of the patent,which protected form iv terazosin hydrochloride.the suit against geneva was based on its tablet anda rather than its capsule anda.all three defendants contended that the patent was invalid under the bar of b.it was undisputed that there had been at least three sales of form iv terazosin hydrochloride more than a year prior to the date abbott filed its patent.abbott labs.geneva,geneva ii.at the time of the prior sales,neither the buyers nor the sellers knew that the terazosin hydrochloride sold was form iv.however,the district court held that whether the parties to the prior sales were aware that the product contained form iv terazosin hydrochloride was immaterial for purposes of the bar of b.abbott labs.geneva,wl.the federal circuit affirmed,agreeing with the district court that the parties knowledge was irrelevant under b,and holding the patent invalid.geneva ii,at.
after the federal circuit held that abbott patent was invalid,abbott terminated its contracts with geneva and zenith.geneva then entered the market with its generic capsule form of terazosin hydrochloride.before geneva entered the market,kaiser had been buying hytrin from abbott for between and cents per tablet.after geneva entered the market,abbott offered to sell hytrin to kaiser at cents per tablet.kaiser declined abbott offer.instead,it began purchasing generic terazosin hyrdochloride from geneva.
on march,kaiser filed suit against abbott and geneva in the central district of california.kaiser brought two claims under the sherman act,and claims under the analogous provisions of california cartwright act,california business professional code et.for simplicity sake,we will refer only to kaiser claims under the sherman act.kaiser brought a claim against abbott and geneva under section one of the sherman act,and a monopolization claim against only abbott under section two.in,kaiser suit was transferred to the district court for the southern district of florida the mdl court under.kaiser had not sued zenith as part of its section one claim,but plaintiffs in other section one suits transferred to the mdl court had done so.
the mdl court granted partial summary judgment to kaiser on its claim,holding that abbott and geneva agreement constituted a per se violation of section one.in re terazosin hydrochloride antitrust,d,in re antitrust litig.i.it later granted summary judgment to abbott on kaiser section two monopolization claim,holding that the doctrine immunized abbott patent and litigation activity.in re terazosin hydrochloride antitrust,d,in re antitrust litig.ii.the eleventh circuit reversed the district court finding of a per se violation under section one.valley drug,at.it remanded to the district court,indicating that the district court might be able to find a per se violation if it reframed its analysis.id.at.on remand,the district court again found a per se violation of section one.in re terazosin hydrochloride antitrust,d,in re antitrust litig.iii.at that point,all plaintiffs except kaiser settled their section one claims.
the mdl court then transferred kaiser entire suit back to the central district of california.kaiser section one claim went to trial on the issue of causation and damages.the jury was asked to decide whether abbott and geneva contract had delayed geneva commercial sale of generic terazosin hydrochloride,and,if so,whether kaiser had suffered damages as a result of the delay.after an trial,the jury found that the contract had not caused any delay and that kaiser had therefore suffered no injury.
kaiser appeals.first,kaiser appeals the entry of judgment on the jury verdict on its section one claim,contending that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings.second,kaiser appeals the mdl court grant of summary judgment to abbott on its section two claim.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the california district court judgment on the jury verdict on kaiser section one claim.we reverse the mdl court grant of summary judgment on kaiser section two claim.
iii.standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.cascade health solutions peacehealth,cir.we review the trial court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.hoffman constr.prot,cir.
iv.discussion 
section one claim 
section one of the sherman act makes unlawful e very contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.the mdl court held that abbott and geneva agreement was a per se violation of section one before transferring the case back to the california district court for trial.we do not revisit that holding.
trial court evidentiary rulings 
kaiser challenges several evidentiary rulings made by the district court during the trial of kaiser section one claim against abbott and geneva.we reverse an evidentiary ruling only if we find that the district court abused its discretion and that the error was prejudicial.columbia pictures television,krypton broad.of birmingham,cir.we hold that all of kaiser evidentiary challenges fail and affirm the district court entry of judgment against kaiser.
kaiser first challenges a ruling that prevented it from discovering privileged opinions of geneva counsel.kaiser sought these opinions in order to counter what kaiser portrayed as geneva defense.abbott and geneva presented evidence at trial that their agreement did not delay geneva marketing of its generic terazosin hydrochloride drug because geneva did not want to risk bringing its product to market without the protection of an appellate decision holding the patent invalid.if abbott had prevailed in the litigation and geneva had already sold its generic version of the drug,geneva would have faced potentially disastrous damages.
the privilege which protects communications may not be used both as a sword and a shield.where a party raises a claim which in fairness requires disclosure of the protected communication,the privilege may be implicitly waived.chevron pennzoil,cir citing united states bilzerian,cir.see also united states amlani,cir.kaiser contends that geneva was advised by its counsel to avoid taking its product to market without the protection of an appellate decision on abbott patent,and that this alleged advice of counsel was used as a sword in the section one litigation.therefore,according to kaiser,geneva could not use the privilege as a shield to conceal the actual advice given by counsel.
if,as kaiser argues,geneva defense was based on the advice of its attorneys,kaiser should have had access to those otherwise privileged communications.however,we agree with the district court that geneva did not actually rely on an defense at trial.geneva presented evidence that regardless of the assurances from geneva counsel and from geneva parent company counsel that geneva would likely prevail in the litigation,geneva board of directors did not want to undertake the business risk of marketing its generic terazosin hydrochloride drug so long as the validity of the patent had not been authoritatively determined.thus,geneva defense at trial was not that it acted based on advice of counsel.instead,its defense was that it acted without regard to,or even contrary to,what counsel advised.therefore,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny kaiser access to geneva privileged communications.see home indem.lane powell moss miller,cir.
abbott patent litigation 
kaiser next challenges the district court decision excluding evidence of abbott conduct in seeking the patent.kaiser hoped to use the evidence to demonstrate that abbott had not acted in good faith when applying for the patent,that geneva knew about the nature of abbott conduct,and that geneva therefore had no reason to believe that abbott would prevail in the patent litigation.the court excluded this evidence because of the mdl court ruling that there was no evidence of misconduct in abbott patent prosecution and litigation activity,because the evidence was irrelevant to geneva liability,and because the prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially outweighed its probative value.
abbott patent application and its litigation defending the patent validity were only marginally relevant to kaiser section one causation and damages trial.but see mci commc ns v.at t,cir allowing evidence of behavior protected under to be introduced for other relevant purposes.even though abbott might have acted improperly in seeking the patent,as we discuss in a moment,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.
cumulative effect of other evidentiary decisions 
finally,kaiser challenges a series of exclusions that it argues compound the prejudice it suffered from the other two evidentiary rulings it challenges.even viewed cumulatively,the exclusions do not constitute abuse of the district court broad discretion on evidentiary matters,and we find no prejudice.see harper city of los angeles,cir.
abbott and geneva 
because we affirm the district court entry of judgment for abbott and geneva on kaiser section one claim,we need not address abbott and geneva of the mdl court holding that the contract was a per se violation.
section two monopolization claim 
section two of the sherman act makes it unlawful to monopolize,or attempt to monopolize trade or commerce among the several states.kaiser pursues both monopolization and attempted monopolization claims against abbott.for a successful section two monopolization claim,a plaintiff must establish the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.united states grinnell,d.for a successful attempted monopolization claim,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.spectrum sports,mcquillan,d.
the holder of a patent enjoys a lawful monopoly to prevent others from making,using,offering for sale,or selling the patented invention during the term of the patent.a.abbott initial monopoly in the terazosin hydrochloride market is not at issue.rather,kaiser contends that abbott improperly tried to extend its patent monopoly by filing sham lawsuits in order to delay the entry of generic competition,and by fraudulently obtaining an invalid patent for the same purpose.
even though kaiser must ultimately prove the existence of a sham by clear and convincing evidence,it need only show that there is a genuine issue of material fact to avoid summary judgment.see anderson liberty lobby,d.this determination is made through the prism of the clear and convincing evidentiary standard.id.at.there is no antitrust exception to the standard set forth in federal rule of civil procedure.
the doctrine allows private citizens to exercise their first amendment rights to petition the government without fear of antitrust liability.see eastern presidents conference noerr motor freight,d noerr united mine workers of am.pennington,d pennington.the supreme court has explained,in light of the government power to act in its representative capacity and to take actions that operate to restrain trade,we reasoned that the sherman act does not punish political activity through which the people freely inform the government of their wishes.prof l real estate investors,columbia pictures,d all alterations in original quoting noerr,at.originally immunized only petitions to legislative officials,but the supreme court extended immunity to petitions to administrative agencies and courts.cal.motor transp.trucking unlimited,d.
an entity loses immunity from liability if its conduct falls within the sham exception to the doctrine.that is,t here may be situations in which a publicity campaign,ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action,is a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor and the application of the sherman act would be justified.noerr,at.the court has elaborated 
the sham exception to noerr encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental opposed to the outcome of that an anticompetitive weapon.a classic example is the filing of frivolous objections to the license application of a competitor,with no expectation of achieving denial of the license but simply in order to impose expense and delay.a sham situation involves a defendant whose activities are not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action at all,not one who genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result,but does so through improper means.

sosa directv,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the third situation described in sosa knowing fraud upon or intentional misrepresentations to a a particular meaning in patent infringement suits.in such suits,the fraud or misrepresentation may have been directed to the federal patent and trademark office pto,not merely to a court.in walker process equipment,food machinery chemical,d,the court held that an entity that obtains a patent fraudulently and then uses that patent to exclude a competitor from the market through infringement suits is not protected by.this exception to is commonly called walker process fraud.see also nobelpharma ab implant innovations,a patentee who brings an infringement suit may be subject to antitrust liability for the effects of that suit if the alleged infringer the antitrust plaintiff proves that the asserted patent was obtained through knowing and willful fraud within the meaning of walker process equipment.
application of the sham exception 
kaiser contends that two versions of the sham exception to immunity apply in this case.first,kaiser contends that abbott seventeen patent infringement suits against generic manufacturers of terazosin hydrochloride between and constituted sham litigation.second,kaiser contends that abbott obtained its patent by walker process fraud and that its infringement suits based on the patent therefore were a sham.the mdl district court granted summary judgment to abbott,holding that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to either contention,thereby upholding abbott defense of immunity.
for the reasons that follow,we reverse the mdl court grant of summary judgment.we agree with the mdl court conclusion that kaiser has not produced evidence that would allow it to avoid summary judgment on its claim of sham litigation.however,we disagree with the mdl court conclusion that kaiser has not produced sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment on its claim of walker process fraud.
sham litigation 
kaiser contends that abbott seventeen infringement suits against the seven manufacturers of generic terazosin hydrochloride constitute sham litigation.kaiser argues that abbott litigation was an attempt to use the judicial process,rather than favorable judicial outcomes,to extend improperly its terazosin hydrochloride monopoly.see omni outdoor,at.
we discussed the sham litigation exception to at length in industries contra costa county building construction trades council,cir.we took pains in to reconcile the supreme court opinions in professional real estate investors,columbia pictures industries,d,and california motor transport trucking unlimited,d,both of which dealt with the sham litigation exception to.we wrote 
we reconcile these cases by reading them as applying to different situations.professional real estate investors provides a strict analysis to assess whether a single action constitutes sham petitioning.this inquiry is essentially retrospective if the suit turns out to have objective merit,the plaintiff ca proceed to inquire into subjective purposes,and the action is perforce not a sham.
california motor transport deals with the case where the defendant is accused of bringing a whole series of legal proceedings.litigation is invariably costly,distracting and having to defend a whole series of such proceedings can inflict a crushing burden on a business.california motor transport thus recognized that the filing of a whole series of lawsuits and other legal actions without regard to the merits has far more serious implications than filing a single action,and can serve as a very effective restraint on trade.when dealing with a series of lawsuits,the question is not whether any one of them has may turn out to,just as a matter of whether they are brought pursuant to a policy of starting legal proceedings without regard to the merits and for the purpose of injuring a market rival.the inquiry in such cases is prospective were the legal filings made,not out of a genuine interest in redressing grievances,but as part of a pattern or practice of successive filings undertaken essentially for purposes of harassment 
at internal citation omitted.
kaiser asks us to apply the california motor transport test for sham litigation,as we described that test in,because abbott brought a series of legal proceedings.abbott objects to our application of and california motor transport on the ground that kaiser asked the mdl court to apply only the professional real estate investors test.we need not decide whether kaiser has waived its argument that the california motor transport test applies,for even under that test kaiser loses its sham litigation claim.
the mdl court carefully analyzed each of the seventeen suits brought by abbott against the generic manufacturers.in re antitrust litig.ii,d at.abbott won seven of the seventeen suits.it lost the other ten,but in each of the ten cases it had a plausible argument on which it could have prevailed.
two of the ten suits depended on whether a infringement suit could be brought based on a patent that was not listed in the orange book.this was a question of first impression.the district court held against abbott,but only after detailed and careful analysis.zenith.at.two more of the suits depended on whether the uruguay round agreements act of extended the life of abbott patent for three years.the mdl court wrote,the uruguay round treaty was new,the provision had not been the subject of prior interpretation,and abbott argument,while hypertechnical,passed the straight face test.in re antitrust litig.ii,d at.
the last six suits were all infringement suits brought by abbott to enforce its patent.the mdl court viewed these suits as presenting the closest question.id.at.the same issue was litigated in all six of these the bar of b invalidated abbott patent on form iv terazosin hydrochloride.abbott admitted that form iv terazosin hydrochloride had been sold more than a year before abbott sought its patent,but it argued that the bar did not apply because neither the seller nor the buyer knew that form iv terazosin hydrochloride had been sold.the federal circuit ultimately resolved all six suits by holding that the sellers and buyers knowledge was irrelevant to the bar.geneva ii,at.the court decision was influenced by the supreme court decision in pfaff wells electronics,d,which was rendered after abbott filed its suits.
there is insufficient evidence in this record to allow a jury to conclude that abbott seventeen suits constituted sham litigation within the meaning of the exception to.it is true that abbott was litigious,but to some degree its litigiousness was a product of.abbott filed suit quickly in order to preserve its rights under,but it did not persist in litigating when it became obvious that the suits were baseless.further,the volume of abbott suits was dependent on the number of generic companies attempting to enter the terazosin hydrochloride marketplace,a matter over which abbott had no control.
walker process fraud 
kaiser contends that abbott obtained its patent through walker process fraud.the district court concluded that kaiser had not presented any evidence to support its walker process fraud contention.in re antitrust litig.ii,d at.we disagree.
t he enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the patent office may be violative of of the sherman act walker process,at.t o strip a patentee of its exemption from the antitrust laws because of its attempting to enforce its patent monopoly,an antitrust plaintiff is first required to prove that the patentee obtained the patent by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts to the pto.nobelpharma ab,at quoting walker process,at.alterations in original.the plaintiff in the patent infringement suit must also have been aware of the fraud when bringing suit.id.at.an antitrust plaintiff must produce independent and clear evidence of deceptive intent on the part of the patentee together with a clear showing that the patent would not have issued but for the misrepresentation or omission.id.at.direct evidence of intent to deceive or mislead the pto is rarely available but may be inferred from clear and convincing evidence of the surrounding circumstances.purdue pharma endo pharms,internal quotation marks omitted.
the patentee good faith before the pto would furnish a complete defense.walker process,at.this includes an honest mistake as to the effect of prior art upon technical fraud.id.inequitable conduct may render a patent invalid,but it is not enough to bring a patentee conduct within the walker process exception to immunity.see nobelpharma ab,at inequitable conduct is thus an equitable defense in a patent infringement action and serves as a shield,while a more serious finding of fraud potentially exposes a patentee to antitrust liability and thus serves as a sword.n o patent will be granted on an application in connection with which fraud on the pto was practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was violated through bad faith or intentional misconduct.
rule of the pto specifies that a patent applicant has a duty to disclose to the pto all information known to that individual to be material to patentability as defined in this section.a.materiality is broadly defined under the rule i nformation is material to patentability when it establishes,by itself or in combination with other information,a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim or it refutes,or is inconsistent with,a position the applicant takes in a sserting an argument of patentability.id.b,b ii.a patent may not issue if the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country,more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states.b.
kaiser claims that abbott committed walker process fraud in seeking its patent.kaiser points to two pieces of information that it contends were material to the b bar but that abbott failed to provide to the pto in connection with its application for the patent.
first,kaiser points to abbott failure to provide with its patent application an english translation of an earlier japanese patent application for form iv terazosin hydrochloride.abbott applied for its patent on october.more than a year earlier,in march,the sumika fine chemical company published a japanese patent application the sumika reference disclosing seven crystal forms of terazosin hydrochloride.it is undisputed that one of the crystal forms in the sumika reference was the form iv terazosin hydrochloride described in abbott application for the patent.thus,if the patent examiner had fully understood the sumika reference,he would have concluded that abbott patent application should have been denied because it was described in a printed publication in a foreign country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states.b.
abbott submitted a pto form in connection with its patent application for form iv terazosin hydrochloride.the form indicated that an english translation of the sumika reference was included in the application.however,the patent examiner testified in his deposition that the english translation was not,in fact,included in the application.the examiner had written abstract only in the file,thereby indicating that only an abstract,rather than an english translation of the entire reference,had been provided.
the abbott attorney who prepared and submitted the application for the patent testified in a deposition that he had intended to submit the english translation of the sumika reference with the application,but that he could not remember actually having done so 
q what was your general practice at the time in having your secretary fill out form how did you generally do that in the time frame 
a generally by giving her a stack of copies of the references.
q and that is what you did in this instance 
a i do recall.
q do you recall whether or not you included the english translation of the sumika reference in the documents that you gave to your secretary to fill out form 
a i just answered no,i do recall whether that document was in that collection.
q did you submit an translation of japanese patent application to the united states patent office during the prosecution of the application upon which the patent was issued 
a that was certainly my intent and 
q well,did you do that 
a do i recall specifically doing that no.
the patent examiner could not read japanese.however,he could read
