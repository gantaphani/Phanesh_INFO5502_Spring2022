at the outset,it is important to clearly delineate the scope of the issues on appeal.appellant alleged in her complaint that respondent notices were inadequate under the act and that it was a violation of the act to charge rent and late fees after termination of appellant right to use her storage unit.her unfair business practice and clra claims,the sole claims raised on appeal are based on those alleged violations of the act.critically,appellant did not allege in her complaint that the rent and late fees could not be charged under the lease agreement,and her unfair business practice and clra claims are not based on violation of the lease agreement.the lease agreement was not attached to the complaint instead,it was placed into the record by respondent,as an attachment to a declaration in support of the motion for summary.appellant did not argue below,in opposing summary,that imposition of the rent and late fees was in violation of the lease agreement.and the only argument adequately raised on appeal is that the trial court erred in concluding respondent did not violate the act by continuing to charge rent and late fees after mailing the notice of lien sale.appellant makes no reasoned argument that respondent violated the lease agreement by continuing to charge rent and late fees her briefs contain no discussion of the language of the lease agreement,and she cites no statutory or case authority that the notice of lien sale had the effect of terminating her obligation to pay rent and late fees under the agreement appellant has,thus,forfeited any such contentions.badie bank of america th,dietz meisenheimer herron th.
in determining whether respondent conduct violated the act,we apply rules of statutory construction.the goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.citation.often,the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent.citation.however,when the statutory language is itself ambiguous,we must examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.citation.when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.rothschild tyco internat.us,th.
