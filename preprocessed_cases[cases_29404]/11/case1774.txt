the complaint alleged causes of action for claim and delivery,breach of contract,conversion,unjust enrichment,fraudulent transfer,fraud,misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of fiduciary duty,and injunctive relief,including an injunction to enforce the noncompete clause.
weinstock filed a motion to strike from the complaint the allegations regarding the noncompete clause,arguing that the clause was void and unenforceable under california law,and was not saved by a statutory exception applicable to a noncompete agreement executed upon the dissolution of an individual interest in a limited liability company in opposition,nls argued that the noncompete clause was enforceable under business and professions code section as it was executed by weinstock as part of the transfer of malta assets and goodwill to nls.the trial court denied the motion to strike on the grounds set forth in the opposition papers.
weinstock,malta,medico,and svatik filed a first amended against nls,crosson,and other individuals,contending among other causes of action that the breached the operating agreement,breached weinstock employment contract,and breached their fiduciary duties by diluting weinstock,malta,and medico interests in nls.
ii.discovery disputes 
in late july,nls filed an ex parte motion to set dates for weinstock deposition,stating that weinstock had failed to appear for a deposition set for the first week in july.the trial court ordered weinstock to appear for his deposition no later than the first week of september,and in a further order extended the deadline to september,at weinstock request.weinstock eventually appeared for his deposition on october,but the deposition was adjourned when weinstock counsel was called away.nls issued a notice of continued deposition for february,but weinstock objected and failed to appear.weinstock also objected to some written discovery requests by nls regarding tmr use or other business activities after his termination,arguing in part that he was not required to respond because the noncompete clause was not enforceable.
in april,the trial court issued three separate discovery orders.on april,the court denied nls motion to compel weinstock deposition,but ordered weinstock to appear for his deposition between may and.on april,the court granted in part nls motion to compel documents with production due by may.on april,the court granted in part nls motion to compel responses to interrogatories,requiring weinstock to provide supplemental responses by may,but denied nls accompanying motion to deem matters admitted.
weinstock moved for a protective order,arguing in part that the noncompete clause was void ab initio and he was therefore not required to respond to related discovery.on may,the trial court denied weinstock request for a stay of its discovery orders and set a hearing for may.weinstock did not produce the documents or provide supplemental responses by the deadlines in the discovery orders.on may,nls filed a motion for terminating sanctions against weinstock for failure to comply with discovery orders.the trial court set the motion for terminating sanctions to be heard concurrently with weinstock motion for a protective order.the trial court denied the motion for protective order on may,continued the hearing on nls motion for terminating sanctions,and continued weinstock deposition to the week commencing june.weinstock filed another motion for a protective order,arguing much of the discovery at issue can not be obtained unless and until nls obtains an adjudication that the covenant not to complete i s enforceable.
iii.issue sanctions 
on june,the trial court entered an order denying nls motion for terminating sanctions.the court stated the less drastic award of issue sanctions will better serve the objects of discovery and is more appropriate in these circumstances.accordingly,the court orders that the following issues will be deemed established for all purposes in this litigation and any jury will be so instructed defendant and ronald weinstock weinstock knowingly breached his employment contract with nls,on and after march,as alleged in the complaint,including,without limitation,the provision in that contract,and engaged in unfair competition,by soliciting persons and entities known by him,as a result of his employment by nls,to be actual customers and vendors of nls as well as persons and entities who were potential customers and vendors of nls,thereby engaging in direct competition with nls in the nationwide market,that weinstock employment agreement with nls,including,without limitation,its provision,is enforceable,that weinstock utilized the tmrd machine in doing so,that in doing so,weinstock has utilized the tmrd machine without the proper supervision of a physician,and as a direct result of weinstock breach of his employment contract and his unfair competition,nls suffered damages the court adopts this issue sanction because the court finds that the discovery ordered by the court which weinstock has failed to make was relevant to nls breach of contract cause of action and its unfair competition cause of action.on reflection,the court finds it appropriate,in light of weinstock continued violation of the court discovery orders that the issue sanction expressly include that the employment contract between weinstock and nls,including the provision,is enforceable.as a result,there would be no trial regarding the enforceability of the clause.
the court provided that the june,order would become effective on june,unless weinstock produced documents and responded to interrogatories before that date.weinstock did not do so.
after weinstock failed to appear for his deposition,reset for june,nls filed another motion for terminating sanctions.in a june,order,the court concluded weinstock has violated numerous court orders regarding his discovery obligations,showing an arrogant and contemptuous disregard for the orders of this court.although the court concluded there is more than enough factual and legal basis for granting terminating sanctions,the order gave weinstock one last opportunity to appear for a deposition on july.weinstock appeared for the deposition but refused to answer nearly questions.
iv.preliminary injunction 
on december,nls filed a motion for preliminary injunction against weinstock,relying on the issue sanctions and the noncompete clause.the motion included evidence in the form of declarations that after his termination,weinstock had competed with nls by soliciting tmr business,was administering tmr treatments,some without physician supervision,was soliciting potential investors for his posttermination business,and in a declaration filed with an amended notice of motion used a december,episode of the fx cable network series to depict himself as the inventor of the tmr device.the declarations also stated that weinstock competitive conduct impaired nls efforts to locate new investors and raise investment capital.in opposition,weinstock argued that the noncompete clause was void under section and that the issue sanctions order was invalid 
on january,the trial court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction,having provided the parties with a written tentative ruling.the court minute order adopted its tentative ruling,and stated,t he issues set forth in the june,minute order the issue sanctions were and are deemed established for all purpose s in this litigation,including this motion for preliminary injunction here,in light of the issues deemed established for all purposes pursuant to the court order of june,plaintiff has met its burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits.the court noted that if the plaintiff makes a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits,the judge has the discretion to issue the injunction even if the plaintiff has not shown that the balance of harm tips in its favor.although weinstock would suffer somewhat greater harm if the preliminary injunction were issued than nls would suffer if the injunction were not issued,the court concluded t he court finds that the likelihood that the plaintiff will ultimately prevail in the litigation is sufficiently great that it substantially reduces the severity of the harm the plaintiff must show to prevail on the motion.citation.thus,the court will exercise its discretion to grant the injunction.
an order filed january,entered a preliminary injunction providing as follows it is hereby ordered that during the pendency of this action,weinstock and his agents,servants,employees,and all persons and entities in active concert and participation with him including without limitation malta,medico,svatik,and any agents,servants,or employees of any of them or of the weinstock group,are hereby enjoined and restrained from engaging,directly or indirectly,in any activity in competition with nls,including without limitation a the provision or marketing of tmr devices or services,b solicitation of new,potential or existing customers of tmr treatments or devices,or c manufacturing tmr devices or similar devices intended for use in providing pain relief treatments.
terminating sanctions 
nls filed a motion for terminating sanctions on january.on february,the trial court granted the motion,striking weinstock answer and entering weinstock default to the first amended complaint,and dismissing with prejudice weinstock first amended.the court found that weinstock willfully and consistently failed to make discovery,including weinstock continued refusal at his deposition on january and to answer questions the court had ordered him to answer in response to nls motion to compel.the court later denied weinstock motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.
weinstock,malta,medico,svatik and wow filed a timely notice of appeal and,four days later,filed a petition for writ of supersedeas seeking a stay of enforcement of the preliminary injunction,which this court denied on april,
discussion 
weinstock contends that the trial court erred when it issued the preliminary injunction in reliance on the issue sanctions.he also argues that the issue sanctions exceeded the court authority and were excessive.finally,weinstein argues that the preliminary injunction was overbroad.
a n order granting a preliminary injunction is immediately and separately appealable.jacobs cabo,western farm service,th,code civ,subd.a.in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,a court must weigh two interrelated factors the likelihood that the moving party will ultimately prevail on the merits and the relative interim harm to the parties from issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.citation.the trial court determination must be guided by a mix of the and factors the greater the plaintiff showing on one,the less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.citation.of course,t he scope of available preliminary relief is necessarily limited by the scope of the relief likely to be obtained at trial on the merits.citation.butt state of california cal th.
