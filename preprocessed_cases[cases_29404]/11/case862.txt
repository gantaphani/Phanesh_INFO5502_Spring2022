enterprises,owner of the cajun club of the town of joseph,wisconsin,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the town upholding the constitutionality of two town ordinances.argues that ordinance,which regulates the manner in which nude dancers perform in any sexually oriented business,and ordinance,which prohibits establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages from permitting nude dancing on the premises,violate the first and fourteenth amendments.we conclude that the record supports the town claim that the ordinances are not an attempt to regulate the expressive content of nude dancing,but that the town had a reasonable basis for believing that the ordinances will reduce the undesirable secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses,and therefore,we affirm.
background 
in,the town board board of the town of joseph town,an unincorporated town in wisconsin,began to consider whether to regulate sexually oriented businesses located within its borders.the board collected sixteen studies regarding the relationships between sexually oriented businesses and property values,crime statistics,public health risks,illegal sexual activities such as prostitution,and organized crime.these studies,undertaken in various communities throughout the country,demonstrated a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and negative secondary effects.the board also consulted a number of judicial opinions from other jurisdictions that address adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses.further,the board considered police reports of calls made in regards to each licensed liquor establishment in joseph for the period of through,furnished by the croix county sheriff department.the sheriff informed the board that the sheriff department had received far more calls regarding the cajun club the town sole sexually oriented business licensed to sell alcoholic beverages than we have for the other liquor establishment in the town of joseph that do es not offer sexually oriented entertainment such as nude dancing.the studies,judicial opinions,and police reports were available to members of the board for their consideration.
in june,the board adopted ordinance,which was codified under the town code,chapter,entitled sexually oriented businesses.sexually oriented businesses,as defined by,include business es featuring adult entertainment.adult entertainment,as defined by,is any live performance,display or dance of any type which has as a significant or substantial portion characterized by an emphasis on viewing of specified anatomical areas.according to,s pecified anatomical areas include 
a.the human male genitals in a discernible turgid state,even if fully and opaquely covered or 
less than completely and opaquely covered human genitals,pubic region,anus,anal cleft or cleavage or 
less than completely and opaquely covered nipples or areolas of the human female breast.
ordinance,published in section a,prohibits sexually oriented businesses from allowing any 
person,employee,entertainer or patron to have any physical contact with any entertainer on the premises of a sexually oriented business during any performance all performances shall occur on a stage or table that is elevated at least inches above the immediate floor level and shall not be less than feet from any area occupied by any patron.
further,b prohibits the sale,use or consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of a sexually oriented business.
the board stated in that its motivation for passing this ordinance was that it 
finds that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities and concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the town board there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them,causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values and,whereas,the town board desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and,whereas it is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment,but to address the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.
concurrent with the adoption of ordinance,the board adopted ordinance,codified under chapter,article vi of the town code,entitled nude dancing in licensed establishments prohibited.ordinance applies to a ny establishment licensed by the town board to sell alcohol beverages.under ordinance,
i t is unlawful for any person to perform or engage in any live act,demonstration,dance or exhibition on the premises of a licensed establishment which 
shows genitals,pubic area,vulva,anus,anal cleft or cleavage with less than a fully opaque covering.
shows the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple and areola.
shows the human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state,even if fully and opaquely covered.
the board expressed its intent in regards to ordinance by stating in section that 
the town board is aware,based on the experiences of other communities,that bars and taverns,in which live,totally nude,erotic dancing occurs may and do generate secondary effects which the town board believes are detrimental to the public health,safety and welfare the town board desires to minimize,prevent and control these adverse effects the town board has determined that the enactment of an ordinance prohibiting live,totally nude,erotic dancing in bars and taverns licensed to serve alcoholic beverages promotes the goal of minimizing,preventing and controlling the negative secondary effects associated with such activity.
the plaintiff in this action,enterprises,operates the cajun club club of joseph.the club enjoys a joseph liquor license and,for years,has served alcohol and offered,topless dance entertainment.it is uncontested that is a sexually oriented business subject to ordinances and,as its dancers expose specified anatomical areas.filed a complaint in the united states district court,western district of wisconsin,pursuant to,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that the ordinances are unconstitutional.the complaint alleged that the board did not rely on adequate evidence to demonstrate the necessity of the ordinances to combat adverse secondary effects that the ordinances prohibit more expression than is necessary to combat any adverse secondary effects that might be caused by adult entertainment and further that ordinance expressly conditions the grant of a liquor license,a government benefit,on the surrender of the constitutional right to freedom of expression.
the town moved for summary judgment,arguing that the board relied on an adequate evidentiary foundation to reasonably believe that the ordinances would reduce adverse secondary effects.in support of its motion,the town submitted an affidavit by the city clerk attesting to the board access to the studies,cases,and police reports relied upon in its deliberations,and further that every member of the board spent time reviewing the materials.the town also submitted an affidavit by the county sheriff attesting to the fact that more police calls were made in regards to the club than any other liquor establishment in the town.
in its opposition to the town motion,questioned the board conclusion that the ordinances would have the effect of minimizing adverse secondary effects.argued that the board did not actually review or rely on the studies and cases that it gathered.presented a study by bryant paul,daniel linz bradley shafer that finds the majority of the studies the board collected fundamentally unsound,and methodologically flawed,and also submitted an affidavit of daniel linz that discusses the study.further argued that the board findings are contrary to the locality actual experience,and,in support,referred to a study of the county where the club is located that states that croix county has not experienced any major problems with adult entertainment establishments.in addition,submitted an affidavit stating that
