background 
the merchandise at issue consists of daimlerchrysler trucks from the and model years.daimlerchrysler assembled the cargo boxes for the trucks at a plant in celeya,mexico,and assembled the complete trucks in lago alberto,mexico.assembly at both sites involved sheet metal components sent from the united states.as part of the assembly process,daimlerchrysler subjected the truck cab and cargo box to a complicated treatment process.this process began with the application of a series of coatings to prevent corrosion and similar damage collectively known as the primer coats.after baking the components to set the primer coats,daimlerchrysler applied the final two color coat and a clear coat collectively known as the top coats.because it believed that the painting process was incidental to assembly,daimlerchrysler sought a partial duty exemption under htsus.
applying its regulation,which distinguishes between decorative and preservative painting,customs found that daimlerchrysler application of the top coats did not qualify for treatment because it was appearance related and therefore not incidental to assembly.daimlerchrysler subsequently filed suit in the court of international trade challenging customs ruling.that court affirmed customs ruling.daimlerchrysler,wl,slip op.at.with respect to whether the top coats were preservative or decorative,the court of international trade found that,as a whole,the coatings were primarily intended to preserve.id.at.for analytical purposes,however,it divided daimlerchrysler process into two distinct operations based on the use of the term operations in subheading,separating the application of the primer coats from the application of the top coats because of the intervening baking step.id.at.although the court found that the top coats provided some preservative feature,it further found that they were designed primarily to enhance the appearance of the vehicle and to impart to it distinctive features or characteristics,such as color,gloss,and distinctness of image.id.at emphasis added.consequently,it concluded that daimlerchrysler painting process did not qualify for the duty exemption under subheading.id.at.
daimlerchrysler filed a timely appeal to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the interpretation of htsus is an issue of law and therefore subject to de novo review.see rollerblade,united states.in addition,we review the related regulations promulgated by customs by applying the analysis of chevron natural resources defense council,d.see haggar i,at.first,if we determine that congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,then that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.second,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
subheading provides treatment for 
articles assembled abroad in whole or in part of fabricated components,the product of the united states,which a were exported in condition ready for assembly without further fabrication,b have not lost their physical,identity in such articles by change in form,shape or otherwise,and c have not been advanced in value or improved in condition abroad except by being assembled and except by operations incidental to the assembly process such as cleaning,lubricating and painting.
htsus emphasis added.with respect to painting,the relevant regulation draws a distinction between preservative and decorative painting.it treats the former as an operation incidental to the assembly process,b,but treats painting primarily intended to enhance the appearance of an article or to impart distinctive features or characteristics as an operation not incidental to the assembly process.c.
the issue on appeal is whether daimlerchrysler painting process,including the application of the primer coats and top coats,qualifies for treatment.particularly,we must decide whether subheading unambiguously includes painting as an operation incidental to assembly.see chevron,at.if,however,subheading is ambiguous with respect to painting,we must determine whether customs regulation,which distinguishes between preservative and decorative painting,is based on a permissible construction of the statute.see id.at.
subheading as well as its reference to painting have been the subject of prior cases.in general motors united states,this court specifically addressed the application of subheading c of the tariff schedules of the united states to a painting operation the facts in general motors mirror those here general motors sought a partial duty exemption for painting on vehicles assembled in mexico.the issue was whether painting operations fall within the scope of operations incidental to the assembly process such as cleaning,lubricating,and painting.id.at.in construing the plain language of the statute,this court found that the statute reference to painting is simply an exemplar of an operation which is potentially incidental to the assembly process,not a definitive statement that all painting operations,no matter how extensive,are allowed under item c.id.the court based its holding in large part on language in the legislative history indicating that operations were if of a minor nature incidental to the assembly process,at,reprinted in.thus,rather than focusing on painting as a whole,the court evaluated whether the application of a top coat was a minor or incidental operation.relying on an evaluation of factors outlined in united states mast industries,the general motors court found that painting was not an operation of a minor nature and therefore not incidental to the assembly process.consequently,it reversed the court of international trade decision granting general motors a partial duty exemption.
subsequent to the general motors decision,the united states supreme court addressed the application and interpretation of htsus in haggar i.in that case,haggar sent cut fabric,thread,buttons,and zippers to mexico for final assembly into pants.upon completion,the pants went through a permapressing operation before being shipped back to the united states.based on the performance of the permapressing operation,customs refused to grant haggar a partial duty exemption.the primary issue before the court was whether customs regulations implementing the htsus were entitled to judicial deference more particularly,whether they were subject to the analysis required by chevron.in answering that question in the affirmative,the court specifically considered htsus and noted that it established two different categories of operations incidental to specific and unambiguous and the other general and ambiguous.the statute under which respondent claims an exemption gives direction not only by stating a general policy to grant the partial exemption where only assembly and incidental operations were abroad but also by determining some specifics of the policy finding that painting,for example,is incidental to assembly.haggar i,at.the court continued that f or purposes of the chevron analysis,the statute is ambiguous nonetheless,ambiguous in that the agency must use its discretion to determine how best to implement the policy in those cases not covered by the statute specific terms.id.emphasis added.in sum,the court read htsus as having two categories an unambiguous category including the specifically enumerated operations such as cleaning,lubricating,and painting,and an ambiguous cate
