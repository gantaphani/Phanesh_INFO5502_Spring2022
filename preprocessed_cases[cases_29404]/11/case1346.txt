level communications,llc and liebert corporation entered into a contract in to purchase several uninterruptible power supply ups systems for level new york city data center.the ups systems contain batteries to provide power during outages.when the batteries for the new york order were delayed by the batteries manufacturer not liebert,level pressured liebert to come up with an alternative solution.in response,liebert located another set of batteries and sold them to level as a supplement to the existing order.
level eventually discovered that the additional batteries were approximately two years old when liebert sold them.the contract,level argued,required all equipment sold by liebert,including ups system batteries,to be new.liebert,however,concluded the contract did not apply to the batteries and rejected level demand to indemnify it against any losses on account of the old batteries.
level sued liebert and liebert agent,alleging breach of contract and various tort claims.the district court ruled as a matter of law that the batteries at issue in this case were covered by the contract and instructed the jury accordingly.the jury found for level on all claims.
on appeal from the jury verdict,liebert argues the district court erred in construing the contract to apply to the batteries at issue in this case.we conclude the contract is ambiguous on whether it applies to the batteries,and thus liebert should have been allowed to present extrinsic evidence and argue to the jury that the contract does not cover the batteries.the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
accordingly,we vacate the jury verdict and reverse and remand for new trial.
background 
factual history 
during a jury trial,the parties presented the following evidence.
equipment for telecommunications data centers 
level creates telecommunications kind of data form the internet backbone.to operate its networks,level builds data facilities,known as centers,about every miles.each center,typically located in a metropolitan area,represents an facility that level can lease to companies whose businesses rely heavily on internet connectivity.
by leasing one of level centers,a customer can install its computers and take advantage of level networks.because damage to computers can lead to loss of data,which carries potentially disastrous consequences for the center lessees,level offers a host of protections.a high quality center comes equipped with raised floors and powerful air conditioning units to prevent overheating surge protectors to guard against equipment damage from sudden spikes in the power supply and power generators to ensure against loss of power from a utility.
most critically,level installs in each center multiple ups systems.ups systems,as their name suggests,guarantee that absolutely no loss of power occurs.in the event of a power outage from the utility company,power generators take over,but only after the initial to seconds that it takes for them to start.in this short interval,when no other power source is available,a ups system ensures that all critical components of a example,data storage to receive power.not surprisingly,one of ups systems main components are their batteries,which contain the power these systems need to function.
liebert manufactures various equipment used in centers.among other things,liebert manufactures ups systems,although not the accompanying batteries.those are produced by gnb technologies gnb,among other battery manufacturers.is liebert authorized sales representative and represented liebert in its business transactions with level.
the agreement between level and liebert 
in december,level and liebert signed a basic purchase agreement agreement for buying liebert hardware,referred to as the products in the agreement.aplt.app.the products to which the agreement applies and other terms and conditions relevant thereto shall be described in a product and pricing attachment to be executed by the parties hereto the p p attachments.id.the p p attachment accompanying the agreement lists various hardware,including ups systems.the batteries,however,are not specifically mentioned as one of the products,although without a battery a ups system loses its functionality.
the agreement also contains liebert general warranty for the products.liebert represents and warrants that all products purchased and delivered hereunder shall be new,of good quality and workmanship,and shall be free from defects in material and workmanship.id.at.but the warranty for accessories shall be limited to those provided by such third parties.id.emphasis added.the agreement does not define the term accessories.
after entering into the agreement,level purchased from liebert somewhere between and ups systems in the first half of alone.all of these orders included batteries,which were shipped from the battery manufacturer directly to level job sites.at the sites,level contractors installed the batteries and connected them to liebert ups systems.in every order,the batteries were brand new.
july order for ups systems and batteries 
in and,in the midst of the boom when demand for facilities was high,level was developing a project in a new york city building,known as the mondo condo.an building,the mondo condo was to provide several centers on different floors,each leased to a different customer.this case centers around equipment ordered for the seventh floor.
for that floor,on july,level ordered from liebert a number of ups systems.as part of this order,level also purchased ups system batteries rated for minutes of time,which is the specification indicating how long a battery can carry power to a ups system in the event of a power outage.as with all previous orders,liebert was to ship the ups systems and the battery manufacturer was to ship the batteries directly to the mondo condo,where level contractor would assemble them.
keith driscoll,a employee,handled sales for the mondo condo site.on september,at a weekly meeting between level and liebert,driscoll informed anthony sirotka,level project manager for the mondo condo,that the batteries order would be delayed until march.the battery manufacturer was about six months behind in production because of the boom.sirotka became very upset,shouted and cursed at driscoll,and demanded that driscoll find replacement batteries within a matter of hours.according to driscoll testimony,sirotka even suggested that a time shorter than minutes would suffice if driscoll could quickly locate replacement batteries.but sirotka and other level representatives testified that driscoll was the one to suggest a shorter,alternative.
still on september,right after the meeting,driscoll was able to locate four batteries to replace the delayed order of batteries.the batteries were in storage after a cancelled order,and some were up to two years old,but driscoll also learned the batteries were in good condition.immediately after he located the batteries,driscoll sent an email to sirotka.in that email,driscoll noted the deduct to change the battery from gnb minute to the minute gnb,and also mentioned t his new battery can be on site in four weeks.id.at.
although sirotka and driscoll both testified that sirotka had never asked about the replacement batteries age or storage conditions,their testimonies diverge regarding what driscoll had disclosed about the batteries.according to driscoll testimony,he had specifically told sirotka on september well as repeating the same to sirotka and other level representatives during the conference the batteries were coming from storage because of a cancelled order,and were up to two years old but in good condition.sirotka,on the other hand,testified driscoll had never explained the batteries were anything but,coming to level directly from the manufacturer.in fact,sirotka and his two managers at level all testified they had understood driscoll use of the word new in reference to the batteries to mean the batteries would be,just like all other batteries level had been ordering from liebert.
approximately two weeks later,on october,driscoll sent sirotka another email.in the email,driscoll explained level two options regarding the batteries.he told sirotka,if you sic intention is to use both batteries,you will need to buy these in addition to the original order,quoting a total price of.id.at.if,on the other hand,level want s to just replace the battery it will be a deduct,just as driscoll had explained in the september email.id.sirotka response instructed driscoll to order the minute batteries asap and to retain our original order for the minute batteries which will need to be installed when they arrive.id.
based on this email exchange,driscoll understood the batteries to represent merely a temporary solution,to be replaced with the batteries when they arrive.that understanding was consistent with what driscoll subsequently learned in the september conference call with level representatives,during which they discussed the temporary nature of the batteries solution.moreover,driscoll recalled that level representatives,in a later meeting,conceded that the batteries were always considered to be temporary.sirotka and the other level representatives,however,testified that the solution was permanent.whatever the true state of affairs,there is no evidence that level ever communicated to liebert its understanding that the solution was meant to be permanent.the only email instructing driscoll to add the batteries to the original order and explaining the batteries will need to be installed when they arrive,id.at the batteries were temporary.
after receiving sirotka instruction to order the batteries in addition to the order,driscoll faxed him a formal quotation for the batteries.sirotka immediately signed the quotation and,several weeks later,submitted a corresponding purchase order,finalizing the transaction for level to receive two sets of batteries.never before in the course of business between level and liebert did the parties face a situation requiring a replacement order of batteries for a ups system.
both sets of batteries arrive 
the batteries arrived at the mondo condo in november and december.without inquiring why these batteries,unlike batteries in all previous orders from liebert,did not arrive directly from the manufacturer,level installed them on the seventh floor.the floor then stood vacant until november,when level leased it to lehman brothers holdings.
while the floor still stood vacant,in march the original,batteries arrived from the manufacturer.there is no indication these batteries were anything other than.level did not,however,swap the batteries for the batteries,but instead put them into storage,where they remained through the time of the trial.
lehman brothers,after leasing the seventh floor of the mondo condo,tested the installed batteries.the test revealed the batteries retained only percent of their rated capacity,well below the percent industry standard.unsatisfied with the batteries,lehman brothers demanded that level replace them.level,in turn,asked liebert to pay for the replacement.liebert refused to accept responsibility for the batteries.
procedural history 
level sued liebert for breach of contract,alleging liebert failed to provide new batteries and to indemnify level in connection with the batteries.level also alleged intentional misrepresentation,fraudulent concealment,and negligent misrepresentation claims against both liebert and.
before trial,both defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.in ruling against them,the district court concluded,as a matter of law,that the agreement between level and liebert applied to the batteries at issue in the case.in other words,the term products in the agreement encompassed batteries as well as ups systems.consistent with that interpretation,the district court,over liebert objection,instructed the jury as follows the term products,as used in the agreement,included batteries that liebert sold to level.therefore,liebert obligation to provide new and good quality products applied to the batteries at issue in this case.id.at.
the jury awarded level damages in the amount of on breach of contract,fraudulent concealment,and negligent misrepresentation claims.in addition,level received in punitive damages on the fraudulent concealment claim.while finding that level proved its claim for intentional misrepresentation,the jury concluded level did not prove that the claim caused damages.
liebert now appeals the jury verdict on breach of contract,fraudulent concealment,and negligent misrepresentation claims.level does not on the intentional misrepresentation claim.
ii.analysis 
liebert argues the agreement does not apply to ups system batteries,the economic loss rule precludes level negligent misrepresentation claim,the fraudulent concealment claim should have been dismissed because liebert owed level no duty to disclose the batteries were not new,and the punitive damages award should be stricken.in essence,liebert asks us to reverse the jury verdict on all claims and direct a judgment in its favor.
our reading of the agreement reveals an ambiguity regarding whether the batteries at issue in this case were products.for this reason,the interpretation question should have been submitted to the jury.the district court contrary conclusion,construing the agreement as a matter of law,was therefore incorrect.and because the error was not harmless,we order a retrial.because we disagree with liebert argument that level tort claims should have been dismissed as a matter of law,the retrial should include the breach of contract,fraudulent concealment,and negligent misrepresentation claims.
we address the agreement first and then turn to liebert arguments related to tort claims.
interpreting the agreement 
the district court interpreted the agreement as a matter of law and instructed the jury accordingly.thus,the first issue on appeal is at bottom a question of contract interpretation,one which we review de novo under applicable law.allison bank,cir.de novo review is particularly appropriate when,as here,the district court interpretation of the contract turned on an analysis of the language and an application of the principles of contract interpretation,rather than upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.milk n more,beavert,cir.likewise,we review de novo legal objections to the jury instructions.daniel ben keith,cir.
colorado law of contract interpretation 
under colorado law,contracts should be interpreted consistently with the principles of contractual interpretation.allstate ins.huizar.courts must examine contractual terms and attempt to determine the intent of the parties.east ridge of fort collins,llc larimer weld irrigation.what courts are after is the parties mutual intent.pepcol denver union.absent an indication the parties chose to deviate from plain meaning,the instrument language must be examined and construed in harmony with the plain and generally accepted meaning of the words used.east ridge,at.in other words,common usage prevails,and strained constructions should be avoided.allstate,at.

application the agreement is ambiguous 
examining the agreement,we conclude it does not unambiguously apply to the batteries at issue in the case.in explaining our reasoning,we consider batteries ordered with a ups system and batteries ordered separately that could provide a temporary source of power while the original but delayed batteries are being delivered.the possibility that batteries might be ordered separately,as a temporary solution,convinces us the agreement is ambiguous with respect to the batteries at issue in this case.
batteries purchased as part of a ups system 
the agreement applies to products,defined as hardware that shall be described in a product and pricing attachment the p p attachment.aplt.app.the p p attachment lists several hardware items.among them are ups systems.ups system batteries,however,are not specifically mentioned.
this omission raises the following question.where the p p attachment reads uninterruptible power supply systems,which ending applies including batteries or batteries not included what,in other words,was the common usage,the plain and generally accepted meaning of the words used,east ridge,at,that would have been mutually understood by liebert and level when they entered into the agreement 
at least with respect to batteries ordered as part of complete ups systems,the agreement term products might encompass the batteries.three pieces of extrinsic evidence suggest as much.first,the parties prior course of dealings shows that batteries were likely understood to be a component of ups systems sold under the agreement.in the first half of,level purchased between and ups systems from liebert.each order came with,batteries,just as one would expect if batteries were products,which liebert expressly warrantied under the agreement to be delivered new.ordinary course of business between liebert and level thus strongly suggests the parties understood ups systems and batteries to go together.the ups system,after all,can not function properly without this key component.
second,a standard quotation that liebert would send to level describes different components included with a purchase of a ups system.one of these components is a biggest component,in fact,representing just under half of the cost of a complete ups system.
finally,as one of level representatives testified,the batteries and the ups are one in the same t hey useless unless together.aplt.app.just as one does not expect to buy a car only to discover the battery is missing,one apparently does not buy ups systems without batteries.thus,when one buys a ups system,one may be justified in assuming a battery accompanies the system.
all three items of extrinsic evidence,especially taken together,suggest the agreement applies to batteries ordered as part of complete ups systems.
in the face of this,liebert categorically maintains that the agreement unambiguously excludes ups batteries.we disagree.liebert starts with the canon of construction that expression in a contract of one or more things of a class implies exclusion of all not expressed.elliott joyce.because ups systems are listed and batteries are not,liebert argues,batteries are not products.but this principle of interpreting written unius est exclusio not support liebert argument.far from being just one thing in the class of items that includes ups systems and other similar products,batteries form an integral part of a ups system.the batteries themselves are thus in a completely different class of components constituting a complete ups system.by mentioning ups systems,the agreement may be understood as implicitly mentioning all of the components.the expressio unius principle finds no application here.
liebert further contends language elsewhere in the agreement shows that ups system batteries can not be products,as the term is defined in the agreement.the agreement,in addition to general warranties for all products,describes limited warranties for ups systems.by its terms,the limited warranty is void if user allows any battery for the liebert product to discharge below the minimum battery voltage cutoff point.aplt.app.to liebert,this language leads to an inescapable are something different than a liebert product.but to us,the quoted an undefined term liebert product rather than the key defined term product does not support the conclusion that the agreement unambiguously excludes batteries from the term products.the quoted language is simply beside the point.
accordingly,we reject liebert categorical argument that batteries,as a matter of law,are never products.but in rejecting liebert argument,we do not mean to accept the the batteries are unambiguously products,to which the agreement would apply.rather,as the following discussion illustrates,the issue is ambiguous and must be decided by the jury.
temporary replacement batteries 
that batteries ordered and delivered in the ordinary course of business between level and liebert may constitute products under the agreement does not resolve this case.what makes the issue in this case different from the ordinary course of the parties business are the unusual circumstances surrounding the transaction.these circumstances underscore the relevant ambiguity in the agreement.
because of an unexpected delay in manufacturing batteries amidst the boom in,level had to order two sets of batteries.the first delayed.level then asked liebert to locate batteries that could be delivered close to the original batteries scheduled delivery date.for the additional set,level even settled for batteries instead of its standard specification,which called for batteries with at least minutes of time.
if the replacement batteries were meant as a permanent displacing the original batteries and permanently installed together with the original order of ups the extrinsic evidence we have already discussed might at least suggest the agreement applied to the batteries.the case would be analogous to ordering a watch at a jewelry store to be ready in two days,only to find out two days later that the watch is not ready because the store has not received a battery meant to go with the watch.if a customer asks the store to forget the original battery and find a replacement that day perhaps a battery with slightly different specifications,the customer may be justified in expecting the whole thing,including the replacement battery,to be new.the same applies to replacement ups system batteries meant to become a permanent replacement.
but not so in the case of a temporary solution.to continue with the watch analogy,suppose the store tells the customer that the original battery,although delayed,is sure to arrive within a week.meanwhile,the customer instead can have a temporary battery with less power installed,which the store will swap for the battery in a week.this represents a temporary solution.in this circumstance,it no longer follows that the replacement battery ought to be new.all that the replacement battery is meant to do is enable the customer to enjoy the watch while waiting for the original battery to arrive.the temporary replacement battery,for example,may have only half of its power left.the customer may well not care,so long as the battery contains enough power to last until the original battery arrives.
the agreement is ambiguous on whether batteries,intended as only a temporary solution,would constitute products.the parties prior course of dealings does not shed any light on this question,and neither does the quotation sheet listing all of ups systems components,which obviously does not anticipate level having to purchase two sets of batteries.thus,the district court judge should have let the jury determine the meaning of the agreement on this issue,with the parties introducing extrinsic evidence.
like liebert,although at the polar opposite end,level argues no ambiguity exists,and the agreement clearly applies to any set of batteries level purchases from liebert.we are not persuaded.first,level argues items need not actually be listed in the p p attachment to qualify as products.the agreement contains a general provision,instructing that a ll listings of items shall not be taken to be exclusive,but shall include other items,whether similar or dissimilar to those listed,as the context reasonably requires.aplt.app.level argues that context reasonably requires that any battery purchased from liebert be considered a product.
this argument fails because a more specific provision in the requirement that products be described in the p p the effect of the general provision on which level relies.see,at.moreover,as the relevant context that supposedly requires all batteries to be products,level marshals the parties course of prior dealings.but as we have already explained,that course of dealings does not address the unique situation in this case.
second,level argues the batteries must be products because they were purchased via a purchase order submitted to liebert.to be sure,the agreement does say that a ll purchases of products by level shall be made by means of purchase orders.aplt.app.but we can not logically infer the flip all items ordered via a purchase order are necessarily products.
lastly,level argues that all items sold by liebert to level are either products,which the agreement warrants to be new,or accessories,which under the agreement receive only the warranty provided by the third party.because ups system batteries are not accessories,the argument goes,they must be products.
we agree that ups system batteries,constituting an essential component of a functioning ups system,are not accessories,as the word is commonly understood.an item is an accessory only when it represents a thing of secondary or subordinate importance,an object or device that is not essential in itself but that adds to the beauty,convenience,or effectiveness of something else.webster third new international dictionary see also black law dictionary ed defining accessory as s omething of secondary or subordinate importance.rather than merely adding to the effectiveness of a ups system,a battery is an essential component,without which there can be no effectiveness.to conclude otherwise would require a strained construction that in the absence of evidence showing the parties intended such a construction,should be avoided.allstate,at.
but level is wrong to erect a false dichotomy between products and accessories,as if no other choices exist.temporary replacement batteries may well be neither products nor accessories the parties,when they entered into the agreement,may not have contemplated a situation needing a replacement solution ever to arise.
we therefore hold the agreement does not unambiguously answer whether the batteries should be considered products.on remand,this question becomes one of fact,to be answered by the jury.
not a harmless error 
we next turn to whether the erroneous jury instruction constitutes harmless error.we conclude it does not.
where an appellate court determines that the district court has given a legally erroneous jury instruction,the judgment must be reversed if the jury might have based its verdict on the erroneously given instruction.wankier crown equip,cir quotations omitted,emphasis added see also dillard sons,burnup sims comtec,cir noting we must reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial if the jury might have based its verdict on an erroneous instruction.the might have threshold,as its language suggests,requires reversal even if that possibility is very unlikely.wankier,at quotations and alterations omitted,emphasis added.only when the erroneous instruction could not have changed the result of the case can we say the error is harmless and does not require reversal.world wide ass of specialty programs pure,cir quotation omitted.
this inquiry is necessarily hypothetical.we do not know precisely how the jury would have resolved a case in the absence of an erroneous instruction.this is why the test is not whether the jury did base its verdict on an erroneous instruction,only whether it might have done so.
the jury awarded level the same amount of damages on its breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and fraudulent concealment claims.to determine whether the erroneous jury instruction might have affected the jury verdict,we must analyze each claim separately.in other words,to conclude the error is not harmless,we must determine the error might have affected the jury verdict on each of the three claims.
breach of contract 
in instructing the jury the agreement applied to the batteries at issue in this case,the district court virtually assured that the jury would find for level on the breach of contract claim.to prevail on that claim,level was required to prove the defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff to supply batteries of a specified duration and quality to indemnify the plaintiff against claims based on the performance of those batteries,and the defendant failed to supply batteries of a specified duration or quality,or it failed to indemnify the plaintiff against claims.aplt.app.jury instructions.because the parties did not dispute that level and liebert did in fact sign the agreement and that liebert failed to supply new batteries or to indemnify level against a claim by lehman brothers,the district court instruction effectively directed the jury to find that both of the above elements are satisfied.
indeed,the only real dispute between the parties was and remains whether the batteries constituted products,as the term is defined in the agreement.the district court instruction resolved this dispute in level favor.accordingly,the jury might have based indeed,very likely did base its breach of contract verdict on the erroneous instruction.
negligent misrepresentation 
to recover under the negligent misrepresentation theory,level had to prove liebert gave false information to level,in the course of their business,in a business transaction,liebert was negligent in obtaining or communicating the information,liebert gave the information with the intent that level would act in reliance or knowing that level would act in reliance on the information,level relied on the information,and the reliance caused damages.id.at jury instructions.we agree with liebert that the erroneous jury instruction might have affected the jury resolution of at least three elements.
to prove liebert had supplied false information to level in connection with the sale of the batteries,level relied exclusively on two pieces of evidence.first,level pointed to the september,email from driscoll to level sirotka,in which driscoll referred to the batteries at issue as this new battery.id.at.but the email contained references to both the original order of batteries and the suggested solution for level to purchase batteries.the phrase new battery could well mean one of at least two driscoll was describing the batteries as or he was simply referring to the new batteries as opposed to the old batteries,using new to indicate which of the two sets of batteries he was describing.
second,level highlighted one of its representative testimony that liebert came up with a new battery alternative.id.at.the representative,likely relying on the same ambiguous usage of the word new,said driscoll had stated the batteries were new.id.
to find that liebert gave level false information about the batteries,the jury must have interpreted driscoll reference to this new battery as stating that the batteries were in fact.this conclusion,however,was by no means obvious and required the jury to interpret the ambiguous statement in light of other evidence in the case.among other things the jury already knew was that the agreement required the batteries to be new they were so instructed by the judge.armed with this knowledge,they naturally inferred that driscoll falsely misrepresented the batteries to be new.the jury,therefore,might have based,at least partly,its conclusion that liebert had supplied level with false information on the erroneous instruction.
moreover,the jury instruction that the batteries were products under the thus had to be have affected the jury conclusion regarding two other elements liebert intent for level to rely on the false information and level actual reliance.if,as the jury was instructed,the agreement required the batteries to be new,then the jury conclusion was unremarkable.driscoll said new,probably intending for level to believe the batteries fit the agreement specification.and level likely relied on the same statement because it was expecting the batteries to be new.all were easy findings for the jury to make.
without the erroneous instruction,however,the findings would have been much harder to make.if the jury were free to conclude the agreement did not apply to the batteries at issue in this case,then it would no longer necessarily follow that driscoll misrepresentation assuming it was a misrepresentation intended to induce level to act a certain way.nor would it necessarily follow that level relied on the misrepresentation.if,in other words,the jury were to conclude the agreement did not apply to batteries meant as only a temporary solution,the jury might not have imputed to liebert the intent to cause reliance,or actual reliance to level.
in sum,whether the jury believed the agreement applied to the batteries might have guided its resolution of at least three elements of the negligent misrepresentation claim.because each element is necessary to prove the claim,the jury might have based its verdict on the erroneous instruction.
fraudulent concealment 
to prevail on its fraudulent concealment claim,level had to prove the following elements liebert concealed a past or present fact it had a duty to disclose,the fact was material,liebert concealed the fact with the intent of creating a false impression in the mind of level,intent that level take a course of action that it might not have taken if it knew the true facts,level took such action or decided not to act relying on the concealed information,the reliance was justified,and the reliance caused damages.aplt.app.jury instructions.
unlike the previous claim,which looks to what was communicated,this cause of action focuses on what liebert did not disclose to level.specifically,level argued driscoll should have disclosed that the batteries were not new,of which driscoll was well aware.as with the negligent misrepresentation claim,however,the jury,free from the erroneous instruction,might have decided several elements in liebert favor.
the intent for level to rely and its actual reliance are similar to several elements of the negligent misrepresentation claim.for the reasons we have just discussed,the jury might have decided them in liebert favor had it not been instructed that the batteries were covered under the agreement.
liebert makes an even stronger case regarding the materiality element.whether the batteries are products under the agreement speaks directly to what level could reasonably expect liebert to facts,in other words,were or were not material.if,as the jury was instructed,the agreement covered the batteries at issue in this case,then the jury could easily infer that whether the batteries were new constituted a material fact,which liebert had the duty to disclose.if,on the other hand,the jury were free to conclude the agreement did not cover temporary replacement batteries,then the jury might well have reasoned the age of the batteries to be immaterial.all that may have mattered to level in the latter scenario was whether the batteries would last long enough to fill a delay in the delivery of the original,batteries.the jury thus might have based its resolution of the materiality element on the erroneous instruction.
likewise,the jury might have relied on the erroneous instruction to find that liebert concealed a material fact intending to create a false,put differently,intending to mislead level.if the batteries,like all products under the agreement,had to be new,then the jury could infer from driscoll failure to disclose the batteries age liebert intent to mislead level into thinking the batteries were in fact new,in compliance with the agreement warranty provision.but if the agreement did not apply to the batteries,then the jury might have concluded driscoll represented nothing more than an innocent omission of a fact not deemed relevant.
finally,whether level reliance on the concealment was justifiable also relates to the inquiry into what the agreement did and did not cover.when we posit the batteries were products and must have been new under the agreement,level could justifiably conclude they were in fact new,absent liebert warning to the contrary.if,however,we let the jury conclude the batteries were not covered under the agreement,then the jury is free to conclude level simply assumed,without good reason,the batteries were new.level reliance on the concealment,in other words,might not have been justified.the jury might have found this element in level favor based on the erroneous instruction.
as with the negligent misrepresentation claim,all elements of fraudulent concealment must be found for level in order for it to prevail.that the jury might have based on the erroneous jury instruction its determination of several of the elements demonstrates the error might have affected the jury verdict on this claim.
in sum,the district court erred in instructing the jury the batteries at issue in this case were products under the agreement.the jury must have been allowed to construe the agreement,ambiguous on this question,for itself.and because the jury might have based on the erroneous instruction its verdict in favor of level on all claims,the error is not harmless and requires a remand.
b.other issues 
liebert also argues the economic loss rule precludes the negligent misrepresentation claim,no duty to disclose the batteries age existed to support the fraudulent concealment claim,and the punitive damages award was improper.we disagree with the first two arguments and,in light of the remand for retrial,need not reach the third.
negligent misrepresentation the economic loss rule 
whether the economic loss rule applies to bar level negligent misrepresentation claim is an issue of law that we review de novo.visionary academy medtronic,cir.
broadly speaking,the economic loss rule is intended to maintain the boundary between contract law and tort law.town of alma azco,see generally id.at describing in detail the rule origins.accordingly,under colorado law,the proper focus in an analysis under the economic loss rule is on the source of the duties alleged to have been breached.grynberg agri tech.boiled down,the rule prohibits a party suffering only economic loss from the breach of an express or implied contractual duty to assert a tort claim for such a breach absent an independent duty of care under tort law.id.emphasis added.an independent duty of care under tort law thus serves as the boundary between contract and tort law,permitting only those tort claims that allege such a duty has been breached.see excavating yacht club ii homeowners ass n.
