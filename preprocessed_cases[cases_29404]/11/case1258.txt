this case arises from a commercial property insurance policy caliber one indemnity company caliber one issued to the defendant wade cook financial corporation cook.its trustee diana the district court summary judgment under washington law that the insurance contract between cook and caliber one limited earthquake coverage to,subject to a deductible calculated as a percentage of the total insured value of the property affected by an earthquake rather than of the claimed earthquake loss.cook also appeals the district court refusal to consider affidavits submitted in connection with its motion for reconsideration.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
in,cook purchased a comprehensive commercial property insurance policy from caliber one that,among its various terms and conditions,provided million in earthquake coverage for various buildings cook owned.in,its insurance broker,crump insurance services,crump told caliber one that cook wanted to renew the policy under exactly the same terms as the initial policy.contrary to cook asserted intent and apparently unbeknownst to it,the policy caliber one issued and cook accepted contained only a sublimit for earthquake coverage.caliber one acknowledges that the reduction in earthquake coverage from million to was simply the result of a clerical error in the preparation of that policy.
in,cook sought to renew the policy once again,on the same terms and conditions as the policy.consequently,the mistaken earthquake sublimit carried through to the renewal policy.caliber one gave cook through crump a quotation confirmation including the earthquake sublimit,and cook accept ed the quote and expressed its wish to have the agreement bound.the final insurance policy in effect from december to december therefore had a stated earthquake coverage limit of.also relevant to this appeal,the insurance policy provided that in the event of a claim,cook would be responsible for a deductible earthquake per occurrence,minimum.
on february,cook corporate headquarters in tukwila,washington,suffered significant damage as a result of a large earthquake in the puget sound area.losses,according to cook,were in excess of million.after cook submitted a claim,caliber one discovered the sublimit and traced it to the much earlier clerical error.it notified cook of the limit and stated its intent to seek declaratory judgment that its liability would be only that lesser amount.moreover,caliber one notified cook that its claim would be subject to a deductible of,calculated as of the total insured value tiv of the damaged corporate headquarters building.cook contended that the deductible was only about,calculated as of the loss suffered rather than of the tiv.
both parties sought summary judgment in the federal district court as to the amount of coverage and the meaning of deductible.the district court determined that the sublimit was unambiguous and declined to consider extrinsic evidence to contradict that amount.the court also rejected cook claim of mutual mistake,and refused to reform the contract on the ground that crump,cook insurance broker,knew about the sublimit and its knowledge was imputed to cook.as to the definition of deductible,the district court held that the term was ambiguous,rejecting cook argument that the term plainly referred to the amount of loss.relying on evidence submitted by caliber one to elucidate the meaning of deductible,including documents crump drafted referring to the deductible as of tiv,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of caliber one.
cook moved for reconsideration and offered two declarations from crump employees.cook argued that these declarations supported its mutual mistake claim and directly contradicted the district court finding that crump knew of the mistake in the earthquake sublimit.the district court refused to reconsider its earlier summary judgment or the new declarations,concluding that cook could not satisfy the strict test for admission of new evidence.

discussion 
earthquake sublimit 
the district court erred in holding the mutual mistake doctrine inapplicable,precluding cook from obtaining reformation of the contract.under washington law,a mutual mistake occurs when the parties,although sharing an identical intent when they formed a written document,did not express that intent in the document.seattle prof l eng g employees ass boeing,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.cook claims that a mutual mistake occurred when the contract for the term failed to express the parties identical intent that the earthquake sublimit provide million in coverage.
negligence in failing to observe that a writing does not express what has been assented to is not a bar to reformation of a contract when the reformation claim is based upon mutual mistake.mut.sav.bank hedreen.here,cook was negligent in failing to confirm that the terms of the contract were the same as those in the contract and were in turn correctly restated in the contract.caliber one was similarly negligent in failing to catch the mistake in the contract,which cook claims caliber one unwittingly repeated in the policy.
the most reasonable inference to be drawn is that both caliber one and cook intended the terms of the original contract to carry over into the contracts governing policy years and.because caliber one has provided no contemporaneous evidence to refute the reasonable inference that both parties shared an identical intent that the contract provide million in earthquake coverage,and because the parties mutual mistake in providing only in coverage does relate to a basic assumption on which both parties relied when making the contract,denaxas sandstone court of bellevue,reformation is warranted.see denny,sec.union title ins.
caliber one argues that cook had constructive knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to the alleged mistake,denaxas,at,and is not entitled to reformation because cook belief was actually in accord with the stated sublimit in the contract and thus not mistaken.however,there is no evidence that crump actually knew that the sublimit had been reduced from the original had crump compared the original policy with the policy,the discrepancy would have surfaced.moreover,although crump acted as cook agent in securing insurance,see orsi aetna insurance,crump role in renewing cook insurance contract with caliber one insofar as the earthquake sublimit is concerned was ministerial.unlike the project architect in denaxas,who had actual knowledge of the true square footage and who had the authority to create a project that would fit the available land,there is no evidence that crump had the unilateral discretion to accept a change in the earthquake sublimit coverage.crump was merely obeying cook instructions to renew on the terms caliber one had previously provided,which both cook and crump assumed were the same as those set forth in the policy.see roderick timber willapa harbor cedar,cited in denaxas,at.
importantly,caliber one has admitted that both parties intended the original and first renewal insurance contracts to provide million in earthquake coverage and that the change to was simply a clerical error.accordingly,the parties here are unlike the seller and purchaser in denaxas,whose respective intentions differed as to the formulation of a price offer based on square footage.denaxas,at.the parties contractual intentions were identical,and even though cook or crump may bear some responsibility for not discovering caliber one error,that does not preclude reformation for mutual mistake.see hedreen,at stating that mere carelessness,however,is not necessarily a defense to an action for reformation and that i f negligence were a defense to a reformation claim,then reformation would almost never be available as a remedy because negligence generally results from mistake internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
