in this case,we consider the extent of the harris county bail bond board authority and the constitutionality of board rules that restrict solicitation of bail bond customers.at issue are several restrictions prohibiting the solicitation of bail bond business from an individual with an outstanding arrest warrant the rule,within hours after the execution of an arrest warrant the rule,or between the hours of and monday through saturday,and before noon or after on sunday the rule.we hold that the legislative grant of authority in the bail bond act is sufficiently broad to permit the board promulgation of the contested solicitation rules.we further hold that the rule withstands constitutional scrutiny,but the and rules violate the plaintiffs first amendment rights.accordingly,we affirm in part,and reverse in part,the court of appeals judgment.
background 
bail bondsmen solicit business in harris county in a number of ways.a particularly useful tool for identifying potential customers is the harris county justice information management system subscriber access program jims,an online service bondsmen use to access information about open warrants and incarcerations,including the names,addresses,and phone numbers of individuals with outstanding warrants.bondsmen use jims information to call bondable citizens,informing them that a warrant has been issued for their arrest or that a relative has been jailed but is eligible for bond.access to the jims system is widely available.jims information is obtainable on a basis to anyone who subscribes with the harris county clerk office.sheriff department employees also disclose jims information to attorneys and members of the public who call in to inquire about pending warrants.harris county has a policy of waiting hours after an arrest warrant issuance to post the warrant information on jims,which allows law enforcement officers the opportunity to execute warrants before jims information becomes available to the public.
in the late,members of the harris county bail bond board began receiving complaints from agencies,peace officers,citizens,and bail bondsmen concerning certain bail bond solicitation practices.specifically,there was concern that bondsmen were calling the targets of unexecuted warrants,effectively tipping them off to an officer arrival and increasing the risks of flight,destruction of evidence,and harm to crime victims and arresting officers.there were also citizen complaints about telephone solicitation from bondsmen during hours,particularly of repetitive phone calls during the first hours following a family member arrest.finally,some bail bondsmen complained that such solicitation practices undermined the effectiveness of traditional advertising,threatened their businesses,and decreased profitability.
in response to these complaints,the board passed local rules and governing solicitation of bail bond business in harris county,effective march.local rule,known as the rule,prohibits unsolicited contact of an individual with an outstanding warrant local rule places time restrictions on solicitation of bond business after an arrest has been made,prohibiting any solicitation within the first hours after an arrest and,after hours has lapsed,prohibiting solicitation between the hours of and monday through saturday,and before noon or after on sunday rule contains an exemption for bondsmen who have an existing business relationship with an individual requiring a bond,and rule exempts bondsmen who have a prior or existing business relationship with such an individual.
soon after the local rules were promulgated,agents of a competing bonding company filed complaints with the board alleging that carl pruett was openly violating the rules.the first complaint alleged violations of rule based on telephone solicitation of bail bond business during hours and within hours after an arrest.the second alleged a violation of both rules and based on a telephone solicitation during hours of an individual with an outstanding arrest warrant,in response to which the individual fled the area.at the board hearing on these complaints,pruett acknowledged that his company violated rules and,but he contended the rules were ultra vires and unconstitutional.the board rejected pruett challenge and suspended his license for seven days on each complaint.
pruett and national american insurance company collectively,pruett,the insurance and surety company for which pruett acts as an agent,filed this suit against the board for declaratory and injunctive relief pruett challenged the board power to promulgate rules and,and further claimed the rules restrictions on commercial speech violate the first amendment.the parties filed for summary judgment.the trial court granted pruett motion and permanently enjoined enforcement of the rules.the court of appeals affirmed in part,and reversed in part,the trial court judgment.the court determined that the board acted within its authority in promulgating the solicitation rules.id.the court further upheld the constitutionality of rule ban on solicitation and rule prohibition of solicitation during,but concluded that the portion of rule prohibiting bondsmen with no prior or existing business relationship from soliciting individuals within hours of an arrest is an unconstitutional restraint on free speech.id.at.we granted the parties petitions for review to consider the parameters of the board authority and the constitutional issues raised.
ii.the bail bond board authority 
pruett claims the board adoption of rules and exceeded the powers the bail bond act at the time expressly enumerated and was thus ultra vires.specifically,pruett contends the legislature did not grant the board authority to regulate solicitation practices until the legislature amendments to the occupations code,which did not take effect until over six months after the local rules were passed.we conclude,however,that the occupations code as it existed when the local rules were promulgated authorized the board to regulate the solicitation of bail bond business,and the board did not act ultra vires in passing the rules.
an agency may adopt only such rules as are authorized by and consistent with its statutory authority.comm of lone star gas.such authority may be either expressly conferred by statute or implied from other powers and duties given or imposed by statute.id.in deciding whether a particular administrative agency has exceeded its powers,the determinative factor is whether the rule provisions are in harmony with the general objectives of the act involved.gerst oak cliff sav.loan ass n,see citizens bank of bryan first state bank,hearne.thus,we turn to the provisions of the bail bond act in deciding the scope of the board authority.see.section of the occupations code,both now and when rules and were promulgated,defines the board administrative authority,in pertinent part,as follows 
a board shall 
exercise powers incidental or necessary to the administration of this chapter 
supervise and regulate each phase of the bonding business in the county 
adopt and post rules necessary to implement this chapter.
id,emphasis added.the occupations code requires all applicants for a bail bonding license to file a declaration that the applicant will comply with this chapter and the rules adopted by the board,id.b b emphasis added,and grants the board discretionary power to revoke or suspend a license if the license holder violates this chapter or a rule adopted by the board under this chapter,id.emphasis added.multiple sections of the code incorporate rules as grounds for denying,revoking,or refusing to renew a license.see,id.thus,it would appear that the legislature explicitly conferred broad regulatory powers on the board.
pruett does not necessarily contend otherwise,but claims the board powers can not extend to the imposition of new,burdens on bondsmen that the legislature did not expressly authorize.because the only prohibition on solicitation contained in the code when rules and were passed concerned solicitation of business inside jails,prisons,and police stations,pruett contends the board had no power to otherwise restrict bail bond solicitation.see id,c.the fact that the legislature subsequently amended the occupations code to broaden the prohibition on solicitation,pruett contends,confirms that the board authority had theretofore been restricted.pruett also claims a amendment to the definition of the term bonding business narrowed the board power and foreclosed its regulation of bail bond solicitation.we disagree.
first,section grants the board broad authority to supervise and regulate each phase of the bonding business,whether or not,as pruett posits,the authority conferred by subsections and is limited to existing statutory provisions within this chapter.id.when a statute expressly authorizes an agency to regulate an industry,it implies the authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to accomplish that purpose.see dallas county bail bond bd.stein,writ denied.in stein,the court rejected the argument that the local bail bond board had exceeded its authority by enacting a local rule prohibiting licensed bondsmen from employing persons with a prior felony conviction,even though the bail bond act does not regulate employees of bondsmen.id.at.by conferring upon an agency the power to make rules and regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of an act,the court reasoned,the legislature forecloses the argument that it intended to spell out the details of regulating an industry.id.at citing.liquor control bd.super sav.stamp,antonio,writ ref cited with approval in gerst,at see also black dallas county bail bond,no writ holding that the broad grant of authority to supervise and regulate all phases of the bonding business impliedly authorizes the board to enact rules on any phase of the business.
the authorities pruett relies upon for a restricted interpretation of the board powers are distinguishable in that they were either based upon a narrower grant of authority in a predecessor statute,bexar county bail bond bd.deckard,antonio,no writ,involved powers explicitly limited by statute,camacho samaniego,or interfered with detailed licensing regimes established by the legislature,austin harris county bail bond,dist,writ denied.here,the scope of the board explicit power is unambiguously broad,and pruett can point to no part of the occupations code that would appear to single out solicitation as an impermissible area of agency.camacho,at noting that the board was not authorized to collect a bail bond approval fee because the texas code of criminal procedure expressly prohibited imposition of costs by officers.bail bond solicitation practices fall squarely within a phase of the bonding business,which the legislature expressly authorized the board to regulate.see.it is true,as pruett asserts,that courts have held bail bond boards may not add to licensing requirements in light of the extremely detailed licensing regime that the legislature established.walstad dallas county bail bond,no pet.castaneda gonzalez,christi,no pet.fire cas.harris county bail bond,dist,writ ref d deckard,at see also op.att y no.op.att y no.but a board attempt to alter or add to licensing requirements specified in the bail bond act is not the same as a board regulation of bondsmen once they are licensed.the act grants the board broad power to supervise and regulate each phase of the bonding business and to suspend a license if the holder violates this chapter or a rule adopted by the board under this chapter.c.furthermore,the board may exercise powers incidental or necessary to the administration of the bonding business under the occupations code.id.solicitation of potential bail bond customers comprises a phase of the bonding business,and suspension of a license for failure to comply with the board rules concerning solicitation does not add to the requirements for licensure under the bail bond act.
pruett points to the legislature subsequent expansion of the prohibition on solicitation beyond building s in which prisoners are processed or confined as evidence that the board powers were theretofore restricted.however,we agree with the court of appeals that the legislature subsequent amendment of the occupations code is of little assistance in determining the scope of the board authority when rules and were passed.at.we ascertain legislative intent concerning the board authority from the plain and common meaning of the statute granting such authority.see fitzgerald advanced spine fixation,argonaut ins.baker.that another session of the legislature decided to incorporate into the bail bond act broader statewide restrictions on bail bond solicitation does not mean that the board lacked the power to regulate solicitation under the legislature prior broad grant.see rowan oil.employment comm n,stating one session of the legislature does not have the power to construe the acts or to declare the intent of a past session ervin state,stating we give little weight to subsequent enactments in interpreting the prior law.our decision in cash america international,bennett,does not indicate otherwise,as pruett contends.there,as here,we looked to the statutory language in deciding whether the texas pawnshop act provided an exclusive or an alternative remedy for disputes between pledgors and pawnbrokers concerning lost pledged property,noting simply that subsequent amendments to the act indicated continued legislative unwillingness to supplant common law remedies.id.at.
pruett also contends amendments to the bail bond act definition of bonding business demonstrate legislative intent to narrow the board regulatory power.before,the bail bond act defined a bonding business as the occupation in which a bondsman is engaged.act of may,ch.laws.the occupations code was codified in,and the definition of bonding business was changed to the execution of a bail bond by a bail bond surety.act of may,ch.laws.according to pruett,making a phone call is not the same as signing a piece of paper,and the only bonding business the board was authorized to regulate when the local rules were passed concerned phases of the bonding business that involve execution of bonds.we reject pruett argument for a number of reasons.first,house bill,which codified the bail bond act into the occupations code,was intended as a recodification only,not as a substantive change in the law.see.laws.because the differences in the definitional language are not irreconcilable,we presume the legislature intended the same meaning.see city of austin southwestern bell.moreover,we agree with the court of appeals that solicitation of bail bond customers is a necessary first step in a bail bond execution,and is thus a phase of the bonding business,which the board has the express power to regulate.at.
finally,pruett contends the local rules violate the texas public information act formerly known as the texas open records act in that they prevent access to information that is in the public interest to know,including jims information about open warrants and incarcerations.see.gov t code.pruett asserts standing to raise the point as a vendor on behalf of his current and prospective customers and in his own right as a bondsman.however,as to pruett individual challenge,the rules do not prohibit him or other bondsmen from accessing public information,nor does pruett contend that he has been denied access to that information.similarly,to the extent pruett claims standing on the public behalf,the rules do not deny the public access to warrant information.as we have noted,jims information is available to the public either by subscription or by calling the sheriff department.
we conclude that the board did not act ultra vires or exceed its authority in promulgating local rules and,and now turn to pruett constitutional challenge.
iii.pruett first amendment challenge 
pruett contends harris county local rules and deny his first amendment right to commercial speech.in a parallel proceeding,pruett brought a similar challenge to the state statute governing bail bond solicitation that the legislature enacted after the disputed local rules were passed.see pruett harris county bail bond,cir.that statute,section of the texas occupations code,contains substantially the same prohibitions that appear in the local rules.in pruett,the fifth circuit held unconstitutional section restrictions on solicitation of individuals with open warrants and within hours after an arrest warrant execution,but upheld the prohibition on solicitation during hours.id.at.because the prohibitions before us are virtually identical,we look to the fifth circuit analysis for guidance 
the parties agree that the speech the local rules restrict is commercial in nature and must be constitutionally gauged under the supreme court analysis in central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d commercial speech is generally afforded less constitutional protection than other forms of constitutionally guaranteed expression.id.at.the government may ban misleading or deceptive commercial speech,as well as speech that relates to illegal activity.id.at.but when,as here,the commercial speech is neither illegal nor misleading,the government power is more circumscribed.id.at.for the rules to withstand constitutional scrutiny,the board must assert a substantial interest that the solicitation restrictions are designed to achieve,the restrictions must directly or materially advance that interest,and the restrictions must be narrowly drawn they can not survive if the interest that the board asserts could be served as well by a more limited restriction.see id.at.
pruett contends that,in applying central hudson,we may consider only information that was before the board at the time it passed the rules.in pruett,the fifth circuit rejected that contention,stating,central hudson does not require that evidence used to satisfy its strictures exist the state must at least articulate regulatory objectives to be served.but that does mean the state can proffer only reasons locatable in the legislative record.pruett,at.the supreme court has held that the proponent of a commercial speech restriction failed to meet its burden under central hudson when the record was devoid of even anecdotal evidence justifying the restriction.edenfield fane,d.but the supreme court has numerous times accepted and analyzed various forms of anecdotal evidence,outside studies,and general literature in evaluating the central hudson factors.see.bar went for it,d edenfield,at.in florida bar,the supreme court observed that even in a case applying strict scrutiny it had allowed regulators to justify restrictions based solely on history,consensus,and simple common sense.bar,at.quoting burson freeman,d.accordingly,we will consider the entire record in evaluating the constitutionality of the board rules.see pruett,at.
rule restriction 
rule prohibits unsolicited contact of individuals with outstanding arrest warrants unless the bondsman has an existing business relationship with the individual requiring the bond.the rule does not apply to solicitation of bond business arising from warrants issued by a municipality or a justice of the peace,warrants the board terms misdemeanor warrants.section b of the occupations code,which the fifth circuit declared unconstitutional in pruett,contains virtually the same prohibition and exemptions id.at.
according to the board,the interests rule is designed to protect are reduction of flight risk for felony and misdemeanor offenders protection of officers,victims,and the public from harm during an arrest prevention of retribution against victims or witnesses and preservation of evidence that might otherwise be destroyed if a suspect is tipped off to an impending arrest.in pruett,the board asserted the same interests as justification for section b.id.at.we agree with the board,and the fifth circuit conclusion in pruett,that these asserted interests are substantial.see united states salerno,d the government interest in preventing crime by arrestees is both legitimate and compelling.in pruett,the fifth circuit concluded that section b virtually identical restriction was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to meet first amendment demands.pruett,at.we believe rule suffers the same infirmity.
central hudson does not require the government to employ the means to accomplish its purpose,but does require a good fit between the means and the goals.id.at citing speaks kruse,cir.in pruett,the fifth circuit noted that section b prohibition has no temporal limitation,making it inherently constitutionally suspect.id.at.at the same time,the evidence in pruett indicated that extending the jims posting delay to or hours after an arrest warrant is issued would greatly alleviate harris county stated concerns.id.at.the court in pruett further emphasized that harris county itself,through the sheriff department and other county agencies,notifies thousands of individuals each year of outstanding warrants against them,and concluded that harris county can not give such notice itself and then claim that restricting notice by others is necessary to the safety of its officers and the public and the prevention of flight.id.the court acknowledged that the sheriff department only notified individuals who were charged with misdemeanors,some of whom would come within the statute exclusion for class c misdemeanors,but concluded the statutory prohibition could be more narrowly drawn to allow solicitation of certain class a and class b misdemeanor targets who posed no assaultive threat and were not likely to run,such as writers,drivers on suspended licenses,and certain dwi offenders.id.section b temporal and prohibitive breadth,the court concluded,did not meet the first amendment demand and thus violated pruett rights.id.at.
the board does not attempt to distinguish the pruett analysis based on any substantive distinction between the local rules and the provisions of the occupations code analyzed in that case.rather,the board contends that it lacks the power to institute the more narrowly drawn regulations that the fifth circuit suggested.according to the board,it is the district clerk who is in charge of implementing the jims blackout period,and the sheriff department that is in charge of screening targets for notification of certain class c and class b misdemeanor warrants.but whether or not the board itself can implement an extended jims blackout or control the sheriff screening process,we conclude that rule is nevertheless constitutionally deficient because it fails,in its present form,to advance the board interest in safety in a material way.the government bears the burden not only to demonstrate that the harms it seeks to avoid are real,but that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.edenfield,at.this requirement is critical,else a state could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression.id.at.the supreme court has declined to uphold regulations that only indirectly advance the state interest involved.central hudson,at.in city of cincinnati discovery network,for example,the supreme court held that a city ban on newsracks containing commercial handbills,which did not apply to news racks containing newspapers,lacked a reasonable fit between the city asserted interest in safety and esthetics and the means chosen to serve that interest,d.the court concluded the city had shown insufficient justification for the discrimination against the respondents use of newsracks that are no more harmful than the permitted newsracks and no greater an eyesore than the newsracks permitted to remain on cincinnati sidewalks.id.at.likewise,in rubin coors brewing,d,the supreme court concluded that a federal regulation prohibiting beer labels from displaying alcohol content could not materially advance the government interest in avoiding strength wars among brewers because of the overall irrationality of the regulatory scheme.id.at.that scheme prohibited some methods of advertising beer strength and not others,while mandating exactly the same form of for wine and spirits.id.at.the court acknowledged that the government goal was valid,but concluded that the irrationality of its unique and puzzling regulatory framework ensure d that the ban w ould fail to achieve that end.id.at.
