facts and procedural history 
scottsdale insurance company scottsdale issued a commercial property and general liability insurance policy to its insured,the cuban club,for the period of october,to october.this policy included a building and personal property coverage form,which contained a provision requiring scottsdale,as the insurer,to provide northside bank of tampa northside,as a mortgagee of the cuban club property,with ten days notice prior to any cancellation by scottsdale of the policy in order to finance the cost of scottsdale policy,the cuban club entered into a premium financing arrangement with premium financing specialists,pfs,whereby pfs would initially pay the insurance premium and,in turn,the cuban club would make payments to pfs.the premium finance agreement included a power of attorney authorizing pfs to cancel the scottsdale policy in the event of the cuban club failure to make its required payments to pfs.when the cuban club failed to make its december payment to pfs,pfs mailed a notice of cancellation to scottsdale on december.scottsdale received the notice on january.in accordance with the policy provision requiring notice of any cancellation to the mortgagee,scottsdale provided notice to northside of the policy cancellation on january.
prior to the notice to northside,on january,kathleen miller was injured on the cuban club property.kathleen and rod miller the millers sued the cuban club for damages arising from kathleen miller injuries,and obtained a judgment against the cuban club for approximately.the cuban club assigned to the millers all of its rights as the named insured under its policy with scottsdale.the millers then filed suit against scottsdale,alleging that the insurance policy provided coverage for the millers judgment against the cuban club.scottsdale removed the case from state court to federal court and asserted that the policy had been canceled on january,prior to kathleen miller injury.in response,the millers argued that the policy remained in effect and that cancellation could not have taken effect prior to the expiration of the period required for notice to the mortgagee,northside.
the federal district court agreed with scottsdale and granted scottsdale motion for summary judgment.in its order,the district court concluded that although the policy expressly requires scottsdale to provide written notice to northside ten days before the effective date of cancellation,the notice requirement exists for the exclusive benefit of northside and it fails to invalidate pfs cancellation of the cuban club insurance on january.miller scottsdale ins,order filed,hereinafter cited as order.the district court also recognized that this case involved an unsettled issue of florida law,and in its order suggested certification of the question to this court in the event of an appeal.order at the millers appealed the federal district court decision to the eleventh circuit court of appeals,and the eleventh circuit subsequently issued an opinion in miller scottsdale ins,cir,certifying the statutory cancellation issue to this court.
this court has repeatedly stated that w hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.dep t of revenue new sea escape cruises,so d,quoting douglass,mcrainey,so.further,we are without power to construe an unambiguous statute in a way which would extend,modify,or limit,its express terms or its reasonable and obvious implications.to do so would be an abrogation of legislative power.mclaughlin state,so d,quoting holly auld,so d.
