the primary issue in this case is whether the government may suspend the permit of a business engaged in activity protected by the first amendment as a sanction when the business violates a regulation.we conclude suspension of the license is not an improper prior restraint,is constitutionally permissible,and the government is not limited to imposing a fine.we also reject the argument that the suspension process utilized here violated the appellant constitutional guarantee of due process.

between april and january,the police conducted a number of undercover inspections at déjà vu.they observed at least violations of the or rule involving a number of different entertainers.krontz was sent written warning letters notifying him of the violations on may,august and october.on october,krontz attorney and representative met with san diego police vice officers to discuss the violations.they were informed of three additional inspections and further violations,some of which occurred on the center stage and could not have been overlooked by déjà vu management.krontz was sent written notice of these violations and a summary of the october meeting.
after additional violations involving multiple entertainers were found during inspections in early january,the city notified krontz his nude entertainment permit would be suspended for days based on the numerous and ongoing violations.the city also informed him of his right to an administrative hearing.municipal code.krontz requested a hearing.
the hearing officer concluded all but three of the violations were proven and that t he preponderance of evidence suggests déjà vu made every effort to appear to be taking the no touch and six foot rules seriously but at the same time in daily practice tolerated violations on a regular basis unless the police department got involved and notified it of violations.the hearing officer,based on mitigating circumstances,reduced the suspension to seven days.
krontz challenged the suspension by timely filing a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in superior court.the court denied the petition and krontz appealed.
discussion 
ipermit suspension 
krontz contends suspending his permit amounts to an invalid prior restraint,is an unconstitutional time,place,and manner restriction or is a constitutionally impermissible injunction violating the first amendment of the united states constitution 
nude or entertainment is expressive activity that falls within the ambit of the first amendment.see city of erie pap,d erie barnes glen theatre,d barnes morris municipal court cal d.however,nude dancing falls only within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection.erie,supra,at.see also barnes,supra,at.nude dancing of the kind sought to be performed here is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment,though we view it as only marginally so.
a city can enact time,place,and manner regulations on an adult entertainment business based on the secondary effects of nude entertainment such as increased crime in a neighborhood.see erie,supra.hansen,to strip or not to strip the demise of nude dancing and erotic expression through cumulative regulations.thus,the courts have upheld restrictions on the location of nude entertainment establishments through zoning laws see city of national city wiener cal th,d,licensing requirements genusa city of peoria cir,schultz city of cumberland cir,essence,city of fed.heights cir,and restrictions such as the and rules enacted in san diego see tily,city of newport beach th,d hang on,city of arlington cir.
a prior restraint 
notably,krontz does not challenge the or rules or challenge the requirement that he obtain a permit to operate a nude entertainment business.nor does krontz challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings he allowed violations of the and rules at déjà vu.instead,krontz argues the sanction of permit suspension is an improper prior restraint because it not only prevents the activity violations of the and rules,it also prevents any expressive activity that is protected by the first amendment.he argues the city is limited to imposing a fine.
the term prior restraint is used to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding certain communications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.alexander united states,d,italics omitted.a licensing scheme may constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint if it puts unbridled discretion in the hands of government officials charged with granting or denying licenses or allows the decision maker unlimited time to render a decision on the matter affecting the license to be constitutional,licensing schemes for adult entertainment establishments must contain sufficient procedural safeguards.freedman state of maryland,d essence,city of federal heights,supra,fly fish,city of cocoa beach cir,déjà vu of cincinnati,union tp.bd.of trustees cir.if a licensing scheme meets the procedural requirements,then it is analyzed to determine whether it is a constitutional time,place,and manner restriction.hatch,keep on rockin in the free world a first amendment analysis of entertainment permit schemes,colum.arts,broadway books,roberts.
prior restraints must be distinguished from subsequent punishments.alexander united states,supra,at.thus,an individual may be punished for distributing obscene materials even though the punishment may affect the individual future protected speech.id.at.see also city of paducah investment entertainment,cir.a bookstore may be closed under a nuisance statute if the owner has permitted it to be used for illicit sexual activity.arcara cloud books,d arcara.in arcara,where the court upheld the closure of a bookstore under a nuisance statute,the court rejected an argument the closure order was an unconstitutional prior restraint,explaining the order would impose no restraint at all on the dissemination of particular materials,since respondents are free to carry on their bookselling business at another location,even if such locations are difficult to find.second,the closure order sought would not be imposed on the basis of an advance determination that the distribution of particular materials is,the imposition of the closure order has nothing to do with any expressive conduct at all.id.at,fn.the court emphasized the closure sanction was directed at unlawful conduct having nothing to do with books or other expressive activity bookselling in an establishment used for prostitution does not confer first amendment coverage to defeat a valid statute aimed at penalizing and terminating illegal uses of premises.id.at.similarly,nude dancing in an establishment where krontz allowed violations of valid regulations the and rules does not confer first amendment coverage to defeat the regulations,which are aimed at penalizing and terminating the illegal conduct,not the expressive activity,on the premises.
an adult entertainment license may be constitutionally revoked when the licensee has violated valid provisions of a licensing ordinance.genusa city of peoria,supra,lleh,wichita county cir,lleh i tily,city of newport beach,supra,th,d upholding revocation provisions applicable to adult entertainment business and rejecting as extreme,unsupported,and incorrect the position of the nude entertainment establishment that the first amendment prohibits revocation of its permits schultz city of cumberland,supra,the government may regulate the conditions under which operators and performers may stage adult entertainment,and in accordance,it may withhold or revoke a license pending compliance with legitimate time,place or manner requirements admiral theatre city of chicago,a prohibition on future protected speech as a punishment for past speech that has been adjudicated to be illegal is constitutionally permissible italics omitted barry city of oceanside d.a municipality may deny a license to an adult entertainment business as a public nuisance if it describes with certainty what constitutes a public nuisance.suspending a license as a sanction for violating regulations furthers the government interest in obtaining compliance with the regulations.see millennium rests.group,city of dallas d,millennium,noting regulation in that case failed to further the governmental interest of assuring law abiding licensees because no showing of the licensee knowledge,culpable state of mind or even negligence was required before suspension or revocation of the license city of elko abed,upholding denial of an adult entertainment license for specified periods of time to persons convicted of enumerated sex offenses and distinguishing cases involving motion picture theaters and bookstores on the basis nude dancing receives a lesser degree of first amendment protection.
krontz relies on vance universal amusement,d vance for the proposition government efforts to preclude someone from engaging in constitutionally protected activity because of previous illegal activity have been held to be impermissible prior restraints.vance does not support this proposition.the question presented in vance was whether a texas public nuisance statute was unconstitutional because it authorized a prior restraint of indefinite duration on the exhibition of films that had not been fully adjudicated to be obscene and without any guarantee of prompt judicial review of a preliminary finding of probable obscenity.id.at.the supreme court found the texas statute lacked the necessary procedural safeguards,in particular a prompt judicial determination of obscenity.in contrast here,krontz does not challenge the adequacy of the procedural safeguards and at issue here is the imposition of a sanction after a finding krontz had violated regulations and had prompt judicial determination of the violations.see lleh i,supra,distinguishing the fifth circuit decision universal amusement,vance cir which was affirmed in vance on the basis,inter alia,that case involved an injunction prior to the determination of a violation while lleh i involved license revocation after a violation had been determined to have occurred.
krontz also misplaces reliance on millennium,supra,d.he states the court in millennium permanently enjoined enforcement of a dallas ordinance that authorized the revocation of a nude entertainment business license based on past dance performances that crossed the line from lawful to unlawful.he quotes the following language from millennium 
the continuing validity of the fifth circuit decision in vance and its relevance to erotic dancing was expressly acknowledged last year in chief judge buchmeyer opinion in lleh,wichita county,d lleh ii,which struck down an injunction provision in a local ordinance governing erotic dancing on the authority of vance,on the ground that it would constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint of free expression entitled to protection under the first amendment.millennium,supra,at,fn.
the actual holding in millennium was that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the government could revoke the license without a showing of knowledge,culpable state of mind or even negligence on the part of the license holder as to two convictions of its employees for public lewdness occurring over a period of a year.the court concluded the strict liability feature of the ordinance is constitutionally suspect because it does not relate to or further the governmental interest of assuring law abiding licensees.millennium,supra,d at.the millennium court did not hold that a nude entertainment business license could not be revoked based on past conduct.indeed,the opinion suggests that if the dallas ordinance had required a culpable state of mind of the business owner,the license revocation provision would have been upheld 
as we pointed out above,krontz does not dispute he violated valid regulations relating to his permit the or rule.nor does he challenge the ordinance as being void for vagueness or lacking necessary procedural safeguards in other words,krontz challenge is not to a prior restraint but to a punishment.we reject krontz characterization of the suspension as an unconstitutional prior restraint.
b time,place and manner restriction 
krontz contends the regulation,to the extent it allows the suspension of a permit for a nude entertainment establishment,is an invalid time,place or manner regulation.
the constitutional analysis of regulations that impact expressive activity differ depending on whether the regulation is content based or content neutral for regulations the courts apply a strict scrutiny level of review while the courts apply an intermediate level of scrutiny for content neutral regulations.turner broadcasting system fcc,d turner.deciding whether a particular regulation is content based or content neutral is not always a simple task.ibid.the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of agreement or disagreement with the message it conveys.ward rock against racism,d.the purpose,or justification,of a regulation will often be evident on its face.turner,supra,at.as a general rule,laws that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed are content based by contrast,laws that confer benefits or impose burdens on speech without reference to the ideas or views expressed are in most instances content neutral.id.at.
municipal code section is content neutral on its face.section applies to any businesses that are required to have a permit,including those not afforded any first amendment protection,such as auto dismantlers and pawn brokers.there is no language in the section referring to ideas,views,or the content of expressive activity section provides for suspension of a permit if a permitee violates any law or regulation pertaining to the permitted business.
when a regulation is content neutral,a restriction on expressive activity will be found to be valid if the regulation is within the power of the government to enact it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest the government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free speech and the restriction is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the governmental interest.united states,d department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.th,d tily,city of newport beach,supra,th,d johnson,fourth annual review of gender and sexuality constitutional law chapter nude dancing,geo.gender,threesome entertainment strittmather d.this test is often referred to as the test.millennium,supra,d,morris municipal court,supra,cal d.
krontz concedes an ordinance authorizing permit suspension is within the city constitutional police power and,presumably,it could further the governmental interest of gaining compliance with various predicate regulations.thus,krontz concedes the first two prongs of the test are met.
krontz contends the third government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free not met because the underlying governmental interest is obtaining compliance with the predicate regulations that directly suppress specific elements of that protected expression.we disagree.the governmental interest of obtaining compliance with laws and regulations relating to the permitted business is unrelated to the suppression of speech since section applies to all businesses requiring a permit,not just those engaged in expression protected by the first amendment and it applies to any violation,not just those related to expressive activity.further,the underlying violations and not involve protected activity.the rules are justified by the governmental interest in reducing the negative secondary effects of businesses,including criminal activity such as prostitution,pandering,drug dealing,and violence against persons and property in the areas surrounding an business see municipal ordinance,amending chapter iii,div.to municipal code.the courts have held this is a governmental interest that is unrelated to the suppression of speech.see,kev,kitsap county cir,hang on,city of arlington,supra,threesome entertainment strittmather,supra,d,tily,city of newport beach,supra,th,d.
the fourth prong of the test requires the restriction to be no greater than necessary to further the governmental interest.krontz argues the regulation is invalid because it suppresses all expression so its impact on protected expressive activity is far more than incidental,that is,during the period of suspension,no protected expressive conduct nude dancing may occur at déjà vu.he suggests the city was limited to imposing a fine.however,the supreme court has rejected the argument that a challenged regulation is unnecessary,and hence invalid,because there are less alternatives ward rock against racism,supra,d see also united states albertini,d nor are such regulations invalid simply because there is some imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on speech see also city of national city wiener,supra,cal th,d,s o long as the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government interest,the regulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government interest could be adequately served by some alternative.the requirement that a regulation be narrowly tailored is satisfied so long as the government asserted interest would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.dream palace county of maricopa cir,ward rock against racism,supra,d.
here,the governmental interest behind municipal code section is to ensure the permitee complies with applicable laws and regulations.a regulatory sanction of suspension certainly furthers the goal of obtaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that goal would be achieved less effectively absent the availability of the sanction.the suspension imposed here was of a very limited duration.we also note a fine could be less effective at achieving the government goal of compliance with regulations since a business owner could pass along the fine to his or her customers as a cost of doing business and continue to engage in violations.additionally,while krontz business may be closed as a venue for nude entertainment during the period of suspension,the closure does not prohibit nude entertainment at other venues or prohibit the dancers from performing their expressive activities at those other venues.
we conclude the city regulation allowing suspension of a permit is a valid time,place,or manner restriction.
c injunction 
alternatively,krontz objects to the suspension of his license as being an improper injunction limiting future activity that is protected by the first amendment.we find no merit to this argument.at issue here is not an injunction but an ordinance that is subject to analysis as a time,place,and manner restriction.see madsen women health center,d.as we have explained above,the regulation is valid and constitutional.
d california constitution 
krontz contends the california constitution liberty of speech clause cal.const.art.i,a provides broader protection than the first amendment.he relies on morris municipal court,supra,cal d,footnote,where the court stated,e ven a performance that involves the barest minimum of protected expression is entitled to full first amendment protection.
the california supreme court in morris,however,was only interpreting the first amendment based on united states supreme court precedent.since the morris decision,the united states supreme court and the cases interpreting its decisions have repeatedly stated nude entertainment receives a lesser degree of first amendment protection than other speech that is,although receiving first amendment protection,nude entertainment falls only within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection.erie,supra,at.barnes,supra,at.n ude dancing of the kind sought to be performed here is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the first amendment,though we view it as only marginally so.had morris been decided today,we have no doubt that it would have recognized the limitations on the first amendment protection extended by the united states supreme court.
further,in los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles cal th,d,the california supreme court stated our formulation of the time,place,and manner test used in california was fashioned from a long line of united states supreme court cases citation and analysis of speech regulation under california constitution article i,section a,employs time,place and manner restrictions measured by federal constitutional standards.id.at,fn,d,italics added.
we reject krontz arguments the california constitution grants broader protection and that the regulation here is unconstitutional under the california constitution.
due process 
krontz contends the city permit suspension process violates due process because he received untimely notice of the charges.he contends the inordinate delay in affording him an opportunity to appear before an impartial to contest those charges,prejudiced his ability to defend the allegations.
the facts,as found by the hearing officer,indicate the police department did not routinely report violations to the establishment or the entertainer on the day they occurred.most violations were reported to krontz within two weeks,although there was one delay of more than days and another delay of days between the date of the violation and notice to krontz.the hearing officer noted krontz took prompt action after each written notification of violations,including terminating dancers,terminating a manager,posting signs,requiring dancers to sign an acknowledgement of the operating regulations for nude dancers,and reconfiguring an area of the establishment.the hearing officer noted the delays between the violations and notice to krontz made it difficult for krontz to investigate the violation and take corrective action.
however,the hearing officer also found the violations continued over a month period,krontz could have taken additional steps to control the entertainers behavior,and there was no evidence krontz or his employees ever intervened or took disciplinary or corrective action except after krontz received a written warning.the hearing officer concluded that when the police were not present krontz tolerated entertainers crossing the line and that tolerating the violations was the norm.
due process requires that when the government seeks to deprive a person of property,it must provide the individual with notice and an opportunity to be heard.petrillo bay area rapid transit dist.d.when an individual claims governmental delay in imposing sanctions has violated the guarantee of due process,the individual bears the burden of establishing actual prejudice.see people belton th,d.
here,the suspension was not imposed based on a discrete violation but on persistent violations occurring over an extended period.krontz had ample notice of repeated violations at déjà vu.the city sent him warning letters in may,august and october,each detailing multiple violations.police officers also met with krontz representative and attorney on october,where it informed them of additional violations,and sent krontz a written summary of the meeting and the additional violations.the city did not seek suspension until january,after additio
