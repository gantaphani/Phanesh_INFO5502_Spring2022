background 
factual.the patent 
the patent entitled spread spectrum digital screening was invented by an individual named adam pinard and is currently assigned to,a patent holding company.the patent,which issued on november,discloses a type of screening mask that can be used in commercial printing software and includes claims drawn to a spread spectrum digital screening mask,methods and systems for using the mask,and binary reproductions of a continuous tone image that have certain claimed characteristics.
the technology involved relates to digital,which describes as a process used in the commercial printing industry to convert a continuous tone image,such as a photograph,into a image consisting of a pattern of minute dots that,when viewed at a suitable distance,appears to recreate the continuous tone image.appellant br.newspapers,for example,are printed in.
the patent contains four sets of claims 
claims,which claim a digital screening mask 
claims,which claim methods of using the digital screening mask 
claim,which claims a system that uses the digital screening mask and 
claims,which claim binary reproductions having certain characteristics.
according to,the screening masks described in the patent result in images that are less susceptible to dot gain and dot loss and thus more commercially viable than the prior art.appellant br.
kodak staccato software 
kodak manufactures,uses,and licenses the allegedly infringing products under the brand name staccato.the kodak customers are licensed to use the staccato software products.according to kodak,it has licensed copies of the software in the united states,and the kodak customers represent only nine licenses.appellees br.
although the kodak customers are licensed to use the staccato software,they are not involved in making it.according to,the kodak customers use kodak digital screening masks and systems to generate images which are typically etched onto a printing plate.the plate is then installed in a printing press,which applies ink onto the plate and then rolls it onto a media,thereby transferring the image onto the media.appellant br.alleges that the kodak customers manufacture and sell their own binary reproductions in the form of image reproductions.id.
procedural history 
on february,filed suit against kodak and the kodak customers in the northern district of illinois alleging infringement of the patent.also named a kodak competitor,heidelberg,and its customer,hafner printing,as defendants both of which were later dismissed from the litigation in the complaint,alleges that kodak makes,uses,and sells software that directly infringes claims,and of the patent and actively induces its customers to infringe claims,and of the patent.with respect to the kodak customers,alleges that they infringe the patent by using kodak infringing products and manufacturing binary reproductions that independently infringe claim of the patent.specifically,alleges,the kodak customers directly infringe at least claims,and of the patent by making,using,selling,offering for sale infringing products methods.joint appendix at.
kodak and three of its customers genesis,johns byrne,and graphic partners counterclaimed seeking declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid and not infringed.in addition,one of kodak customers,johns byrne,filed a against kodak for indemnification.in the,johns byrne alleged that it uses the staccato product in only one type of job,printing a white base on plastic and that this use amounts to perhaps or of johns byrne business,and can be accomplished with other software.at 
on april,kodak filed a motion to sever the case against it from the other defendants transfer the case against it to the western district of new york and stay the case against the kodak customers in the northern district of illinois.the kodak customers joined in kodak motion.
on september,the district court granted kodak motion in full.specifically,the court severed claims against kodak from the claims against its competitor,heidelberg,on grounds that the actions did not arise from a common transaction or occurrence severed claims against kodak from its claims against the kodak customers stayed the case against the kodak customers pending resolution of case against kodak and transferred the case against kodak to the western district of new york pursuant to a,concluding that it is a more convenient forum and that the interest of justice favored the transfer appeals only from the portion of the district court order granting the stay.
with respect to the motion to stay,the district court found that the kodak customers were merely peripheral to the action against kodak,would add nothing to plaintiff infringement action against kodak,and were named as defendants solely to establish venue in the northern district of illinois.accordingly,the court stayed action against the kodak customers pending the resolution of the case against kodak in new york.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that,if the action against kodak proceeds and kodak staccato product is found to have infringed the patent,and each of kodak customers are found to have used staccato in their processes,they will also have infringed the patent.district court opinion,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court found that,because the customers merely use the kodak product,they have nothing substantive to offer during plaintiffs action against kodak and likely do not even understand how the product software actually works and will not be helpful to determine whether kodak staccato product infringes the patent.id.

discussion 
argues that the stay order is a final appealable order and that the district court abused its discretion in granting the stay because its decision was based on an incorrect finding that the printer defendants were mere customers of kodak and peripheral to the litigation.appellant br.asserts that there are three independent bases for jurisdiction in this court.first,contends that the stay is appealable as a final order under.second,it argues that jurisdiction is proper under the customer suit exception to the rule discussed in kahn general motors.finally,argues that the stay is appealable under because the district court effectively issued an injunction barring from proceeding against the printer defendants.appellant br.
in response,kodak argues that this court should dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction because the stay was not a final judgment under,and none of the exceptions to the finality requirement applies the customer suit exception articulated in kahn does not apply and the stay did not involve an injunction and thus is not appealable under a.in the alternative,kodak argues that,if the court finds jurisdiction,it should affirm on grounds that the district court acted within its discretion in granting the stay.
for the reasons set forth below,we find kodak primary arguments.because the stay was not a final appealable order,we lack jurisdiction over appeal.
a.the stay is not a final judgment under.
under the final judgment rule,parties may only appeal a final decision of a district court.a.a final decision is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.noting that the policy is one against piecemeal litigation.
here,the district court stayed case against the kodak customers pending resolution of its case against kodak.because the stay does not dispose of claims against the kodak customers or the pending counterclaims,and therefore was not a final judgment,the court lacks jurisdiction under.argues,however,that the district court order is final because it put effectively out of federal court and under the supreme court decision in gillespie united states steel,d,it was practically final.we disagree.
is not out of federal court 
generally,a stay is not considered a final appealable order.a stay order is appealable,however,if it puts the plaintiff effectively out of court.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.in moses cone,the supreme court held that an order staying litigation in federal court pending resolution of a case in state court that would have res judicata effect on the federal action put the plaintiff effectively out of court.id.noting that the stay order amounts to a dismissal of the suit.
this court similarly has held that a stay may be an appealable order when it effectively puts the parties out of the district court,either permanently because it terminates the action as a practical matter,or,as some courts have held,for a protracted or indefinite period.gould control laser,citation omitted.in gould,the district court granted a stay pending reexamination.id.on appeal,we found that the stay was not for such a protracted or indefinite period as to render its issuance an abuse of discretion and that it did not terminate the action but merely shifted to the pto an issue patent claim validity involved in the dispute before the district court.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we distinguished moses cone on grounds that a stay pending reexamination normally does not foreclose review on the merits by a federal court.id.at district court and pto decisions on the merits are both reviewable by this court.we have,however,recognized a narrow exception where such a stay effectively disposes of the district court action.slip track,metal lite.in slip track,we found that,under the facts of that case,a stay pending the outcome of pto reexamination proceedings was appealable because it was possible that the appellants would be unable to raise the issue of priority of invention in any forum.id.noting that,during reexamination,slip track could not swear behind a patent claiming the same invention and that the district court will have no occasion to consider the issue of priority of invention following the resolution of the pto proceeding.
here,argues that,by granting the stay,the district court effectively dismissed the case against the printer defendants.according to,the stay is indefinite because it will remain in limbo for an indeterminable and substantial period of years.appellant reply.in support of this argument,points to the fact that the median time to trial in the western district of new york is almost five years and kodak moved to stay the new york case pending reexamination,possibly delaying its day in court even further.indeed,as noted,the new york court recently granted kodak motion to stay pending reexamination the new york stay.given this potentially lengthy period of time,submits that the district court order puts it effectively out of court with respect to the printer defendants.appellant br.
in response,kodak argues that reliance on the out of court line of cases is misguided because those cases only apply where a stay surrenders federal court jurisdiction to a state court or administrative body.appellees br.we agree.see slip track,at f ederal courts have often found jurisdiction to review stays in favor of state court suits when the state court judgment would have a fully preclusive effect on the federal action or moot the federal action entirely.stays in favor of administrative proceedings are similarly reviewed on an effectively out of court standard.internal citations omitted.here,the stay does not have the effect of surrendering the federal action to state court or to an administrative body.instead,has the ability to pursue its case against kodak in federal court in new york.and,importantly,the stay is not indefinite the proceedings against the kodak customers in illinois will resume to the extent necessary after the action against kodak in new york is resolved although the propriety of the recently granted new york stay is not before this court on appeal,it is not indefinite and does not render out of federal court.see gould,at noting that stays to enable reexamination do not foreclose review on the merits by a federal court.indeed,it contemplates that discovery will proceed when the reexamination is complete and allows preparations for foreign discovery to begin.accordingly,the new york court decision to impose a discretionary stay pending reexamination does not alter this court analysis with respect to ability to pursue its claims in federal court.
to the extent argues that the stay is indefinite due to the pace of litigation in the western district of new york,such delay inherent in the federal court system is not the type of protracted or indefinite delay contemplated in gould.as noted above,gould was concerned with effectively foreclosing federal court jurisdiction,not with a change in the location of that jurisdiction or with orders relating to the priority of issues to be litigated in federal court on judicial efficiency grounds.here,case against kodak was immediately transferred to another district court,not to a state court or administrative body.and,unlike the situation in slip track,where the stay meant that the appellant would never have its day in court with respect to priority issues,here,has not shown that any issue will go unresolved by a federal court due to the stay see slip track,at.accordingly,is not cast out of federal court.
the stay is not final under gillespie.
next relies upon a supreme court decision gillespie united states steel corporation,d for the proposition that the stay should be considered final.in gillespie,the court noted that,a decision final within the meaning of does not necessarily mean the last order possible to be made in a case.at.citation omitted.on the unique facts presented in gillespie,which involved a wrongful death claim under the jones act,the ohio wrongful death statute,and general maritime law,the court found that immediate appellate review of an interlocutory order was permissible because the effect of the trial court ruling,which struck certain claims from the complaint,was fundamental to the further conduct of the case.id.at.the court noted that,in deciding the question of finality the most important competing considerations are the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review on the one hand and the danger of denying justice by delay on the other.id.at.citation omitted.
in a subsequent decision,the supreme court severely limited gillespie as a basis for accepting an appeal from an interlocutory decision.copelands,cnv,citing coopers lybrand livesay,d.in coopers lybrand,the supreme court indicated that its decision in gillespie 
upheld an exercise of appellate jurisdiction of what it considered a marginally final order that disposed of an unsettled issue of national significance because review of that issue unquestionably implemented the same policy congress sought to promote in b,and the arguable finality issue had not been presented to this court until argument on the merits,thereby ensuring that none of the policies of judicial economy served by the finality requirement would be achieved were the case sent back with the important issue undecid
