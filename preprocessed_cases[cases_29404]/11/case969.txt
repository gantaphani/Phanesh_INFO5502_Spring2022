sokol associates,sa appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of techsonic industries,techsonic and johnson outdoors,johnson on sa claim for breach of a sales representative agreement.we affirm.
background 
sa,the sole appellant in this matter,is a minnesota corporation that serves as an independent sales representative to manufacturers of hunting,fishing,and marine products.sa is a to sokol and associates,a sole proprietorship under which paul sokol conducted the same type of business.although sokol created both entities and they have similar names,they are legally distinct.
appellee techsonic is an alabama corporation that manufactures fishing and marine products,such as fishfinders,under a variety of brand names.in may,appellee johnson,a marketer of outdoor recreation products,acquired techsonic from teleflex incorporated teleflex.until may,techsonic was a wholly owned subsidiary of teleflex.teleflex is not a party to this lawsuit.
in,techsonic purchased zercom marine zercom,a company that also manufactured marine products.sokol had been involved in the founding of zercom.as a result of zercom acquisition,techsonic entered into a sales representative agreement the agreement with whereby sokol,doing business as,would sell products to customers within a specific geographic area and to certain customers.the agreement contained a provision invoking minnesota state law.the agreement stated,in pertinent part 
the representative shall faithfully,diligently and to the best of its ability endeavor to promote and extend the sales of the company zercom marine branded products the products which are presently those products described in exhibit 
the agreement had a term and allowed techsonic to terminate the agreement prior to the end of that period only if breached a material term of the contract and failed to cure the breach within ninety days.techsonic had the right to discontinue the sale of products that were no longer economically viable.was to earn a five percent commission on all of zercom sales.the agreement did not explicitly provide for modification sa contends the parties anticipated modifications with respect to the product lines to be sold by.techsonic president charles stott signed the agreement on behalf of techsonic and sokol signed it on behalf of.
in the fall of,techsonic acquired fisheye,a marine products brand.shortly thereafter,stott verbally assigned the right to sell fisheye products and set a commission rate of five percent for those sales.
beginning in november,techsonic and engaged in negotiations regarding the sale of humminbird products.humminbird is another brand of marine products manufactured by techsonic.in august,dave overstreet,a regional sales manager for teleflex,informed sokol that would be gaining responsibility for selling humminbird products.overstreet states that one of the main reasons why teleflex decided that would take over for the previous sales representatives with respect to selling humminbird products,was the fact that techsonic and were party to a agreement,which agreement did not expire until.records reflect began to sell humminbird products in october.
also in october,teleflex proposed a written contract to the agreement.tom douglass,a vice president with teleflex,copied john cinis and techsonic president stott on the proposal.the products covered by the agreement and the commissions to be applied to sales were listed in exhibits a and c attached to the contract,which were dated october,and referenced in the contract main text.the products listed in exhibit a included the zercom,fisheye,and humminbird brands.the agreement specified that either party could terminate the agreement with thirty days notice.initially rejected the proposal and further negotiations ensued.
during the course of the negotiations,requested a letter confirming the relationship between the agreement with techsonic and the proposed agreement with teleflex.on january,douglass sent a letter which stated,in part 
to confirm our conversation in regards to the old new contract,teleflex marine agrees that your original contract for representation of zercom,which was written as a result of the acquisition of zercom by techsonic industries,will continue in effect for its duration as stated in that contract.
the new contract,dated october,supplements your original contract.changes in territory and commission paid,as agreed by you,john cinis and me,are stated in exhibits a and c of the new contract.these exhibits are dated january.
the exhibits were enclosed with the letter.
sa contends sokol received assurances that the agreement was a matter of housekeeping and would not affect the agreement.however,failed to obtain any further written assurances regarding either contract.notably,did not obtain,or even request,written confirmation that the term of the agreement governed humminbird products,which were not expressly listed in the agreement.
ultimately made no changes to the proposed agreement,and sokol signed and returned the agreement on february.sa notes that at the time sokol executed the agreement,the exhibits were not attached.sa does not contest,however,that sokol received the exhibits attached to douglass letter or that the main text of the agreement referenced exhibits.
on april,assigned the agreement to sa,a newly formed corporate entity.techsonic agreed to the assignment.did not assign the agreement.thus,none of the parties to this,johnson,or parties to the agreement between and teleflex 
as of,techsonic had discontinued both fisheye and zercom product lines.sa has not alleged bad faith in those discontinuations and has not pursued claims for breach of contract on those grounds.sa continued to sell humminbird products and to receive commissions from techsonic until july.
on may,johnson acquired techsonic from teleflex.the stock purchase agreement finalizing the transaction specifically listed the agreement as part of the purchase,describing the contract as sales representative agreement dated december,between techsonic and sokol and and associates territories were changed in.
after it acquired techsonic,johnson notified sa that it would be realigning its sales force.in june,johnson told sa to discontinue its sales of humminbird products.at that time,humminbird was the only product line sa sold for techsonic or johnson.october,johnson gave sa thirty days notice of its intent to terminate sa as a sales representative for techsonic.
sa filed suit in state court,and johnson and techsonic removed the case to the district court for the district of minnesota.sa alleged that the agreement had been modified to apply to sa sales of humminbird products,and therefore its representation of humminbird was subject to the agreement term.thus,sa claimed johnson and techsonic breached the agreement by wrongfully terminating the contract before the expiration of the term.sa also asserted a claim under the minnesota sales representative act,alleging wrongful termination of the agreement without good cause and proper notice.techsonic and johnson moved for summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment on behalf of techsonic and johnson.among other findings,the district court found that sa had not presented sufficient evidence of modification of the agreement to create a genuine issue for trial.because sa only asserted claims based upon the agreement,and modification of the contract was necessary to establish the claims,failure to provide sufficient evidence of modification necessarily resulted in summary judgment for techsonic and johnson.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
although the factual background of this case is somewhat convoluted and involves changing parties,multiple products,and two written agreements,there is one basic question before the court is there a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the agreement was modified so that its term applies to the sale of humminbird products sa claims rest solely upon an alleged breach of the agreement,and the text of that agreement limits its application to zercom products therefore,unless there was a modification,sa has no cause of action.sa alleges
