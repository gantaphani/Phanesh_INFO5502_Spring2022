california has two statutes that prohibit the seller of a water treatment device from making performance or benefit claims that the device affects health or the safety of drinking water,unless the device has been certified by the state department of health services health and safety code section,subdivision a,and business and professions code section,subdivision c 
in this appeal we conclude that these two statutes do not violate the federal constitution dormant commerce clause or first amendment,as applied to health claims made by defendant puritec,llc puritec on its internet website concerning uncertified water treatment devices it offers for sale to california consumers.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
background 
puritec is a nevada company that sells water treatment devices internationally,including to california consumers.puritec primary method of advertising is its internet website website.
since,the state of california the state has required that sellers of water treatment devices to california consumers that make health claims regarding those devices have those devices certified by the department of health services dhs.pursuant to regulation,dhs considers a health claim to be any claim that a water treatment device reduces or removes from the water an organic,inorganic or microbiological contaminant,as defined by the state primary drinking water standards from the health and safety code or the national primary drinking water standards from the federal safe drinking water act or environmental protection agency standards.see health,tit.
when dhs determines that a vendor or manufacturer is making health claims for an uncertified water treatment device,it sends a notice of violation that details prohibited conduct and requests correction within days.pursuant to a consumer complaint in august,dhs examined puritec website and determined that the company was making health claims as to several uncertified water treatment devices.dhs sent puritec a notice of violation in october.over the following year,puritec assured dhs that it would change its website to comply with california law,but it dragged its feet along the way.
in october,the state filed a complaint against puritec and its owners james and mead,both of whom were subsequently dismissed.the complaint alleged that puritec had violated health and safety code section,subdivision a,and business and professions code section,subdivision c,by making performance and health claims for uncertified water treatment devices on its website,and that this activity also constituted unfair competition under business and professions code section.the complaint sought civil penalties and injunctive relief.
puritec answered and,contending,among other things,that the application of health and safety code section,subdivision a,and business and professions code section,subdivision c,to its website violated the federal constitution dormant commerce clause and first amendment 
in a bench trial,the trial court granted judgment for the state.the court imposed civil penalties against puritec and ordered puritec to make changes to its website.
discussion 
standard of review and statutes at issue 
this appeal asks whether health and safety code section,subdivision a hereafter,health and safety code section a and business and professions code section,subdivision c hereafter,business and professions code section c,as applied to health claims made on puritec website regarding uncertified water treatment devices,are constitutional under the federal constitution dormant commerce clause and first amendment.this appeal is limited to these constitutional challenges.puritec has not challenged in its briefing the specific form of the injunction or any other specific relief that the trial court granted,and therefore has forfeited any claims in these regards.see bonshire thompson th,fn,d.
puritec concedes that the essential facts are undisputed.puritec also concedes that it sold water treatment devices in california,and that its website contained certain statements that the state contended violated california law.as such,this appeal presents questions of law that we determine independently.reader digest franchise tax bd.th,d.
health and safety code section a specifies as pertinent 
a no water treatment device that makes product performance claims or product benefit claims that the device affects health or the safety of drinking water,shall be sold or otherwise distributed that has not been certified by dhs or another applicable entity water treatment devices not offered for sale or distribution based on claims of improvement in the healthfulness of drinking water need not be certified pursuant to this section.
business and professions code section c specifies as relevant 
it is unlawful for any person to do any of the following in connection with the sale,lease,rental,or other disposition of water treatment devices 
c make product performance claims or product benefit claims that the device affects health or the safety of drinking water,unless the device has been certified by the dhs pursuant to article commencing with section of the health and safety code.
dormant commerce clause 
the federal constitution commerce clause grants congress the authority t o regulate commerce among the several states,art.i,cl.this grant of authority to congress also encompasses an implicit or dormant limitation on the authority of states to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce.healy v.the beer institute,fn,d healy ferguson friendfinders,th,d ferguson bronco wine jolly th,d bronco.
a approach is generally used to determine whether state legislation has violated the dormant commerce clause.distillers liquor auth,d bronco,supra,th at,d ferguson,supra,th at,d.
under the first tier,which employs a strict scrutiny review,a state statute is invalid if it discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of economic interests,or if its practical effect is to directly control commerce wholly outside the regulating state.bronco,supra,th at,d ferguson,supra,th at,d,supra,at.healy,supra,at.
under the second tier,which is used to evaluate state legislation that does not discriminate against interstate commerce or directly control it,a balancing test is employed where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church,d pike,supra,at.ferguson,supra,th at,d.
in applying the approach here,puritec does not argue,nor could it,that health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of california commerce.the two statutes apply equally to and actors.see ferguson,supra,th at,d.
instead,under the approach,puritec contends that the practical effect of these two statutes is to directly control website content because they force the seller of water treatment devices to make all of its website advertising conform to california law.in other words,these two statutes force such sellers to remove all health claims for uncertified devices from their websites because california consumers may see those claims.
we do not see the practical effect of health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c as directly controlling commerce wholly outside california.healy,supra,at.bronco,supra,th at,d ferguson,supra,th at,d.these two statutes directly regulate website advertising that is targeted at california consumers.if sellers of water treatment devices decide to conform all of their website advertising to california law,that is a voluntary business decision,not a mandatory legal one.as the trial court factually found,in findings not challenged by puritec on appeal,technology exists to separate a california website from the row website established by a company such as puritec puritec could and can easily structure its websites to inform california customers at the point of sale the check out page of the website that its devices are not certified by the state of california,and that no health or safety claims relative to drinking water can be made under california law about puritec devices.all this can be accomplished without interfering with puritec sales of its devices to customers.any interference with sales can also be eliminated,the state suggests,by a simple footnote on the puritec website that the device has not been submitted for certification in california,as required by california law,to make health or safety claims to california consumers.
puritec likens its position to that of the business entity in healy.in healy,the united states supreme court invalidated under the dormant commerce clause a connecticut statute that prohibited a business entity from charging more in connecticut than it did in three bordering states.the court concluded that the statute directly controlled commerce occurring wholly outside connecticut because of the inevitable effect the statute would have on the prices charged by the entity in its sales in the other states.said healy a state may not adopt legislation that has the practical effect of establishing a scale of prices for use in other states.healy,supra,at.
healy is inapposite.as we have explained,health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c do not have the practical effect of establishing their health claim requirements as the law in other states for website advertising of water treatment devices.as the trial court found,a separate california website or a separate part of the general puritec website can be established that informs california customers that puritec devices have not been certified by california and therefore no health or safety claims regarding drinking water can be made under california law about those devices.
puritec also seeks support in a group of federal decisions that has struck down on dormant commerce clause grounds state laws that purported to criminalize the dissemination of sexually explicit material harmful to minors over the internet.see psinet,chapman cir psinet american booksellers foundation dean cir american civil liberties union johnson cir cyberspace communications,engler d american libraries ass pataki.pataki.
these federal cases,too,are inapposite.four distinctions appear.
first,the statutes at issue in the federal cases sought to regulate the internet itself.see ferguson,supra,th at,d.the two statutes before us do not have such grand designs.they do not seek to regulate the internet itself,but only misleading advertising on the internet regarding specifically identified commercial products.
second,the mind of the statutes in these federal the internet dissemination of sexually explicit material harmful to one to question their general applicability in the dormant commerce clause arena.
third,relying on these federal cases,puritec argues that a state can not regulate internet activity that is not located in or targeted at the state.as we have seen,puritec has targeted its website advertising at california consumers.
and lastly,these federal cases recognize that because there is no effective way to limit access to online materials geographically,a website owner operating legally in california,for example,would have to comply with the statute at issue to avoid liability.see psinet,supra,at,discussing pataki,supra.at.consequently,the statute would directly control commerce occurring wholly outside the statute respective state jurisdiction.as we explained above,however,health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c do not directly control commerce occurring wholly outside california.furthermore,while the display of sexual material over the internet can not be geographically isolated,the display of health and safety claims of water treatment devices over the internet can be.as we have seen,puritec website s can inform california consumers that puritec devices have not been certified by california and therefore no health or safety claims about those devices concerning drinking water can be made under california law.
this last point about internet geographical ubiquity,however,raises three related points regarding the practical effect of the certification requirements of health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c.
the first point is puritec argument that,given the internet ubiquitous geographical nature,california consumers can not be shielded from uncertified health claims made on other portions of puritec website or on another puritec website.consequently,puritec again notes,the practical effect of health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c will force sellers of water treatment devices who advertise on the internet to make all of their website advertising conform to california law thus,these two statutes directly control commerce wholly outside california.we disagree.
as the trial court correctly recognized,the state of california may not regulate the content of puritec website even if it is possible or even likely that a california resident can access that website.that california consumers can not be shielded from health claims made on puritec website,however,is not puritec concern,so long as puritec informs california consumers on that website or directs california consumers to the california website that puritec devices have not been certified by california and therefore no health or safety claims about those devices concerning drinking water can be made under california law.to borrow loosely from an old saying,you can lead a california customer to consumer warnings about water treatment devices,but you ca make him heed them.that is all that is required of puritec as a practical matter.
the second point flows from the first.puritec argues that conforming to california law will be next to impossible if other states adopt website advertising schemes different from those of california.as we have just explained,puritec does not have to conform all of its website advertising to california law it need only inform california customers that its devices have not been certified by california and therefore no health or safety claims regarding drinking water can be made under california law about those devices.the same approach can be used regarding the respective relevant laws from other states.
puritec then argues,as the third point,that it can not be expected to create completely different websites targeted at every state.again,there is no need to create completely different websites targeted at every state.there is only a need to inform customers from particular states about the relevant law of those states.these kinds of consumer warnings are seen routinely in national print advertisements.an internet website can surely be as accommodating.as our state high court has explained,the federal system contemplates that individual states may adopt distinct policies to protect their own residents and generally may apply those policies to businesses that choose to conduct business within that state.citations.it follows from this basic characteristic of our federal system that,at least as a general matter,a company that conducts business in numerous states ordinarily is required to make itself aware of and comply with the law of a state in which it chooses to do business.kearney salomon smith barney,cal th,d.
we conclude that health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c,as applied to puritec internet website advertising,are not unconstitutional under the approach to dormant commerce clause analysis because they do not have the practical effect of directly controlling commerce wholly outside california.
puritec contends that health and safety code section a and business and professions code section c are also invalid under the approach to dormant commerce clause analysis because their burden on interstate commerce significantly outweighs any legitimate local benefit.
as noted,the approach can be stated as follows where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only in
