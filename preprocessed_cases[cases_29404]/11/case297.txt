background 
davidoff has been a brand for luxury goods for personal consumption since.in,davidoff launched davidoff cool water,a cologne for men,followed by a cool water fragrance for women in.davidoff holds valid uncontested trademarks for all of the cool water products at issue in this case.the cool water fragrances are manufactured and marketed by coty coty and its subsidiaries,under license from davidoff.
davidoff and coty together have developed a comprehensive quality assurance and program.part of this program involves the placement of a unique production code on the bottom of each cool water fragrance bottle and on the bottom of its corresponding package.as its name suggests,the upc is a code unique to each unit.embedded within the code is a variety of information about that particular unit,such as the time and place of production,the production line,ingredients used.
davidoff use of the upc plays an important role in fighting counterfeits.because of the high expense involved in placing a unique number on each unit,counterfeiters will generally either omit such a number from their packaging or repeatedly use sets of fake numbers on a series of counterfeit units.the upc system therefore facilitates the spotting of counterfeit units by allowing investigators to make a determination based on the absence of a upc on the packaging or the use of a repeating and,thus,fake upc number.also,the identification of a fake upc number allows investigators to search for other fakes merely by identifying products bearing the same fake number.furthermore,davidoff own investigators are not the only recipients of these benefits.davidoff regularly instructs its retailers and officers of customs and border protection customs in the use of the upc system and relays information regarding fake upc numbers known to be used by counterfeiters.armed with this knowledge,customs and retailers are more easily able to check cool water shipments and set aside suspected counterfeits.
use of the upc system also assists davidoff ability to protect its brand against quality slippage in genuine authorized products.when a quality problem surfaces,the upc identifies the place of manufacture,the batch which produced the defect,and other identifying information.this information helps davidoff both to recall already distributed product that may share the defect and to prevent further recurrence of the defect.the ability derived from the use of the upc helps davidoff assure that its marks will not appear on defective product and thus preserve and protect the value of its trademarks.
in an effort to maintain the prestige of its brand,davidoff limits sales of cool water products to luxury retailers and has declined to sell to cvs.though not an authorized retailer,cvs is nonetheless able to secure stock of cool water from outside of davidoff normal distribution channels.davidoff products are among cvs fragrances.some of the cool water fragrances sold by cvs have been found to be counterfeit.in addition,some of the cool water stock purchased by cvs that is not counterfeit consists of goods,meaning goods that are manufactured under authorization from the trademark owner,are legally purchased outside the united states from authorized distributors,and are then imported by persons other than the trademark holder and without the markholder permission.olympus united states,cir.
on two occasions,in and,davidoff discovered that counterfeit cool water products were being sold at cvs.on both occasions,davidoff sent letters to cvs and provided information to cvs on how to identify counterfeits based on the product upc.cvs assured davidoff that it would conduct an inventory review,remove all counterfeit products,and source only from authorized distributors.despite these assurances,davidoff discovered in that cvs was continuing to sell counterfeit cool water fragrances.davidoff then brought this action against cvs alleging,inter alia,trademark infringement,unfair competition,and trademark dilution in violation of sections and a and c of the lanham act,a and c davidoff original complaint sought relief only as to cvs marketing of counterfeit davidoff products.on december,the district court granted a temporary restraining order and authorized davidoff to inspect all undistributed products in cvs inventory bearing the davidoff mark.
during the course of this inspection,davidoff discovered that,in the case of items in cvs inventory,the upcs on the packages and labels affixed to the bottle had been removed the codes had been removed through a variety of techniques,including cutting the portion of the box or label exhibiting the upc,using chemicals to wipe away the upc on the label,and grinding away the bottom of the bottles to remove the upc.it was apparent in many instances that the packaging had been opened.
on february,davidoff amended its complaint to include also claims for relief based upon cvs sale of davidoff products with the upc removed.on march,cvs voluntarily agreed to halt the sale of counterfeit davidoff products,but not the products with the codes removed.davidoff then moved for a preliminary injunction forbidding the sale of all its trademarked goods with code removed.the court granted davidoff motion.zino davidoff sa cvs,wl july.the court reasoned that removal of the codes from davidoff trademarked product impaired davidoff marks by interfering with the trademark owner ability to identify counterfeit goods and to control the quality of its legitimate products by identifying and recalling defective products.the court thus concluded that davidoff was likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claims on the theory that cvs sale of davidoff trademarked products with the codes removed constituted trademark infringement.cvs brought this appeal.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.almontaser city dep t of,cir.
in cases involving claims of trademark infringement and dilution,as in other types of cases,a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate the likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of such an injunction,and either a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation plus a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.

trademark infringement 
cvs contends that the district court erred in ruling that davidoff is likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claims.cvs asserts that the goods with the codes removed are,genuine davidoff goods sold by davidoff through authorized channels in other countries and subsequently imported by others into the united states.because these goods are sold in their original packaging with the davidoff trademarks clearly visible and unaltered,cvs contends that the removal of the codes does not negate their genuineness or constitute infringement.cvs argument misses the point.the fact that the goods in question may be goods does not furnish cvs with a valid defense.the question before us is not whether,or under what circumstances,the sale of goods infri
