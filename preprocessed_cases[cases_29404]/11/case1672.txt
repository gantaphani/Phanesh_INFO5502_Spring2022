background 
ta chen is a taiwanese producer and exporter of steel pipe.through august,ta chen sold steel pipe through a distributor,sun stainless,sun.from september to july,sun was owned by frank mcclane,a former minority shareholder of ta chen,and managed by ken mayes,a former consultant to ta chen.ta chen had custody of sun signature stamp as well as unlimited access to sun accounts receivable,accounts payable,and inventory and pricing information.ta chen also participated in negotiations of sun sales of steel pipe.ta chen,however,had no equity ownership in sun.on july,mcclane sold of sun stock to picol international picol,a foreign corporation,and the remaining to masaru kimura,thereby fully divesting himself of ownership.
in,certain producers of steel pipe petitioners filed an antidumping petition with commerce alleging that steel pipe imported from taiwan was being sold domestically at a lower price than it was being sold under similar conditions in taiwan.on january,commerce initiated an administrative review of certain steel pipe imported from taiwan covering a period from to.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews.dep t commerce.on january,commerce initiated a second review covering a period from to.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews.dep t commerce.on february,commerce initiated a third review covering a period from december,through november.initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty administrative reviews and request for revocation in part.dep t commerce.the three reviews were conducted concurrently,and preliminary determinations for all three were published during the first half of.see certain welded stainless steel pipe from taiwan preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative reviews.dep t commerce may,combined first and second review preliminary results certain welded stainless steel pipe from taiwan preliminary results of administrative review.dep t commerce,third review preliminary results.the third review is the subject of this appeal.
during the first review,petitioners called commerce attention to ta chen potential affiliation with sun and certain other parties under the then existing tariff act.see certain welded stainless steel pipe from taiwan final results of administrative review,dep t commerce june,first and second review final results.at that time,ta chen denied the allegations of affiliation and provided no information concerning its relationship with sun.ta chen later argued before commerce that it was not affiliated with sun during the period of review because under the law at the time,foreign exporters were affiliated with their customers only if the exporter owned at least of the customer.first and second review final results.at see also repealed by,title ii i,stat.petitioners renewed their allegations in a submission filed with commerce on july,and presented additional information regarding ta chen potential affiliation with sun.first and second review final results.at.ta chen again denied the allegations.id.
effective january,congress modified trade law and broadened the definition of affiliated persons.see uruguay round agreements act uraa,stat.compare,with.under the new definition,if an exporter has operational control over its customer,the exporter is affiliated regardless of ownership.see.the third antidumping review of ta chen was initiated under this broadened standard.as part of the third review,commerce issued a general questionnaire to ta chen concerning affiliated importers,giving ta chen notice of the broader definition of affiliated parties.ta chen response to the questionnaire,however,did not include information about sun.first and second review final results.at.commerce then issued a supplemental questionnaire to ta chen specifically requesting information regarding its affiliation with sun.in response,ta chen provided some of the requested information sun financial statement,for example but did not provide any information regarding sales data.third review preliminary results.at.

during the remand review,commerce issued another questionnaire seeking sun sales data.ta chen forwarded the questionnaire to sun,asked sun to complete it,and offered any and all assistance in answering it.on november,sun counsel notified ta chen that sun would not cooperate with the commerce inquiry because it had been closed since and had no operations in the united states,making a response too burdensome and costly.sun counsel stated,however,that he would urge sun to reconsider.after ta chen successfully sought two extensions of time to submit the requested information to commerce,sun counsel notified ta chen that sun still would not cooperate with the request.the following day ta chen informed commerce that further attempts to retrieve the sun data would be futile.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review a decision of the court of international trade evaluating an antidumping determination by commerce by reapplying the statutory standard of review that the court of international trade applied in reviewing the administrative record.mitsubishi heavy,united states.commerce special expertise in administering the law entitles its decisions to deference from the courts.see,micron,united states,torrington united states,see also chevron usa,res.def.council,d.we will uphold commerce determination unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b i micron,at.substantial evidence has been defined as more than a mere scintilla,as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.to determine if substantial evidence exists,we review the record as a whole,including evidence that supports as well as evidence that fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.atl.sugar,united states.
ta chen contention that the imposition of adverse facts available was an abuse of discretion is a misstatement of the proper standard of review.while certain appeals from antidumping duty proceedings follow the arbitrary,capricious,abuse of discretion standard,this appeal reviews a final determination by commerce under other than a determination reviewable under a.see a b iii.therefore,we review the decision under the substantial evidence standard of section b b i as opposed to the arbitrary,capricious,abuse of discretion standard of section b a.
imposition of partial adverse facts available 
ta chen argues three distinct errors in commerce imposition of partial adverse facts available.first,it argues that the record does not support the factual finding that it was affiliated with sun.second,it contends that the court of international trade impermissibly affirmed commerce decision on grounds not invoked by commerce.finally,it argues that commerce violated by not notifying ta chen of deficiencies in its information gathering efforts before imposing partial adverse facts available.the government responds by arguing that the court of international trade properly affirmed commerce decision because commerce decision to impose partial adverse facts available is supported by substantial evidence of record.the government also contends that the court of international trade did not affirm commerce decision on alternative grounds,but decided the case on the same grounds invoked by the agency.finally,the government argues that commerce complied with because commerce was not required to notify ta chen that its complete failure to respond was deemed.
ta chen affiliation with sun 
ta chen argues that commerce erroneously imposed partial adverse facts available upon ta chen based on unsupported speculation that ta chen was affiliated with sun successor,picol.we disagree with that characterization of commerce decision.substantial evidence supports the factual determination that ta chen and sun were affiliated during the relevant period of review.affiliated persons includes any group in which one person controls another.see g.a person shall be considered to control another person if the person is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other person.id.commerce factual determination is supported by evidence that sun was owned by a former minority shareholder of ta chen and managed by a former ta chen consultant,and ta chen had custody of sun signature stamp and full access to sun accounting and pricing information.
contrary to ta chen arguments,commerce did not impose partial adverse facts available upon ta chen because ta chen was related to picol in.rather,commerce did so because ta chen was affiliated with sun during the period of review and then subsequently failed to act to the best of its ability to provide information on sun sales.ta chen bore the burden of creating an accurate record.see zenith elecs.united states,the burden of production belongs to the party in possession of the necessary information.ta chen was on notice as early as that its relationship with sun was raised before commerce by the petitioners in the first review period.while it is true that a respondent to a commerce inquiry only has an obligation to produce data requested by commerce,see b,it is reasonable in this case for commerce to expect ta chen to preserve its records in the event that commerce itself would request them,which it actually did in october.when sun was sold without preserving the records of sun sales,ta chen bore the risk that commerce would request the sales data previously alleged to be evidence of dumping activity.thus,we will not disturb commerce decision to apply partial adverse facts available on ta chen because of its former affiliation with sun and its subsequent inability to procure sun sales data.
the basis for the court of international trade decision 
ta chen argues that the court of international trade impermissibly affirmed commerce decision on grounds not articulated by commerce.we disagree.ta chen notes that a fundamental rule of administrative law is that a reviewing court,in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make,must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.sec chenery.but see fleshman west,noting that a court may affirm on a new ground if the new ground is not a determination which the agency alone is authorized to make killip office of pers,noting that a court may affirm on a different interpretation of a statute or regulation when upholding the board decision does not depend upon making a determination of fact not previously made by the board.here,however,the court of international trade did not affirm commerce decision on alternative grounds.in its remand results,commerce explained its decision to use an adverse inference against ta chen as follows 
i t has already been established that ta chen had operational control over sun and had access to its sales and pricing data.ta chen knew that sun sales were an issue both in the administrative review and in this litigation and that there was a possibility that ta chen would be requested to provide those records once again accordingly,ta chen should have taken steps to obtain and preserve the relevant records.it can not now rely on the fact that sun is no longer in business to justify its failure to produce the necessary documentation.
remand results,slip op.at.the court of international trade opinion reflects that it approved the grounds invoked by commerce 
ta chen does not and can not contest the fact it had operational control of sun.the court of international trade previously found commerce affiliation finding supported by substantial evidence due to the numerous connections between ta chen and sun.it is reasonable for the department to conclude that this operational control gave ta chen access to sun records.this conclusion is further supported by the fact that ta chen was able to provide other confidential records from sun,such as sun federal income tax records.it is also reasonable for commerce to expect ta chen to maintain any relevant records pending the final outcome of the administrative review.in order to comply to the best of its ability,ta chen should have preserved sun information in the event that its sales were classified as constructed export price sales.
ta chen ii,slip op.at internal citations omitted.
ta chen compares one sentence in ta chen ii to one sentence in the remand results for the proposition that the court of international trade affirmed the commerce decision on alternative grounds.in the remand results,commerce noted that ta chen had notice that its relationship with sun in particular,raised a question with the department as to affiliation at least as early as october.remand results,slip op.at.the court of international trade opinion states that a s early as july,ta chen knew its relationship with sun was at issue because the petitioners had called it to the department attention in the first administrative review.ta chen ii,slip op.at.while the different opinions cite different dates regarding when ta chen knew that its relationship with sun was an issue before commerce,the court of international trade reasoning is not inconsistent with the grounds invoked by commerce.commerce found that ta chen was on notice at least as early as october,while the court of international trade pinned the date as july.those time periods are not mutually exclusive.moreover,reliance on ta chen notification in october the same year that picol closed would be sufficient to uphold commerce decision.because both commerce and the court of international trade considered the notice of affiliation as just one factor in their conclusion that ta chen failed to act to the best of its ability to provide information on sun sales,we conclude that the court of international trade did not deviate from its duty to review only the decision made by commerce.
commerce compliance with 
ta chen argues that commerce violated by failing to notify ta chen of any deficiencies in ta chen efforts to induce picol cooperation before imposing partial adverse facts available.we disagree with ta chen interpretation of the statute.the pertinent subsection,entitled deficient submissions,provides in part 
if the administering authority or the commission determines that a response to a request for information under this subtitle does not comply with the request,the administering authority or the commission as the case may be shall promptly inform the person submitting the response of the nature of the deficiency and shall,to the extent practicable,provide that person with an opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency in light of the time limits established for the completion of investigations or reviews under this subtitle.
d.the court of international trade in ta chen i remanded commerce first attempt to impose adverse facts available upon ta chen because commerce failed to comply with the statute by not providing adequate notice to ta chen that it was required to furnish sun sales data.ta chen i,at.upon remand,commerce issued a questionnaire to ta chen specifically seeking sun sales data.following issuance of the specific questionnaire and the remand results,the court of international trade in ta chen ii found no violation of the statute.ta chen ii,slip op.at.
we find no error in the court of international trade application of the statute to the facts in this case.after being given a specific chance to get sun sales data,ta chen completely failed to provide commerce the data.commerce granted ta chen two extensions of time to try to get the information,but ta chen counsel eventually informed commerce that further efforts would be futile.under such circumstances where,following an opportunity to gather more information,a party informs commerce that it will not provide the information requested,commerce is not required to give another formal notice that the complete failure to respond does not comply with the request.ta chen knew that the nature of the deficiency was its complete failure to respond.the statute only applies when a response to a request is deemed to not comply.a failure to respond is not the same as a response as required by the statute.therefore,commerce was under no statutory duty to formally tell ta chen that its failure to respond was deficient.
selection of the dumping margin 
ta chen argues that the dumping margin was unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise not in accordance with the law for several distinct reasons.specifically,ta chen contends that the margin selected was aberrant and not representative,and commerce impermissibly selected the high margin solely for deterrence.the government argues that commerce properly derived the dumping margin from ta chen sales during the period of review and corroborated the rate by comparing the relevant sale to ta chen other sales in terms of price,quantity and product.
the factual basis for the selected dumping margin 
as this court recognized in de cecco di filippo fara martino united states,de cecco,the statute leaves much to agency discretion in making determinations.see also group united states,the secretary has broad discretion in executing the law.in the case of uncooperative respondents,the discretion granted by the statute appears to be particularly great,allowing commerce to select among an enumeration of secondary sources as a basis for its adverse factual inferences.see b.in cases in which the respondent fails to provide commerce with the most recent pricing data,it is within commerce discretion to presume that the highest prior margin reflects the current margins.see rhone poulenc,united states.
it is undisputed that ta chen made a sale with a dumping margin.ta chen argues that the selected sale represented only of ta chen sales during the period of review and was thus aberrant.ta chen cites de cecco for the proposition that commerce may not select an aberrant dumping margin when applying adverse facts available upon a respondent.de cecco is distinguishable from this case.in de cecco,the court of international trade rejected commerce application of a dumping margin because that margin was thoroughly discredited and uncorroborated by commerce own investigation.de cecco,at.here,the dumping margin is corroborated by actual sales data,and ta chen admits that it is reflective of some,albeit a small portion,of ta chen actual sales.so long as the data is corroborated,commerce acts within its discretion when choosing which sources and facts it will rely on to support an adverse inference.id.
the motivation behind the selection of the dumping margin 
ta chen also argues that commerce selected the dumping margin solely for deterrence,contrary to this court holding in d l supply united states.in d l supply,a chinese exporter of iron castings was subject to several administrative reviews of commerce dumping orders.the exporter cooperated with commerce from through by answering commerce antidumping questionnaires.for the review,commerce calculated a dumping margin.while commerce was still conducting the administrative review for,it initiated an administrative review for.that year,the exporter did not cooperate with commerce investigation.without the actual sales data for,commerce selected a dumping margin using the best information available bia rate,which was the precursor to the current adverse inference from facts otherwise available rule.commerce used the rate of,as it was the highest antidumping duty rate from any prior administrative review.id.at.
upon a challenge in the court of international trade,the court found that the rate for the review was erroneous and remanded the cases for both years.commerce then recalculated the rate for,but nevertheless used the rate for the period under the bia rule.commerce argued to this court that it could use a subsequently invalidated dumping margin as the basis for calculating the bia rate because the bia rate is supposed to be sufficiently high to induce respondents to cooperate with commerce dumping investigations.this court reversed,holding that i nformation that has conclusively been determined to be inaccurate does not qualify as the best information under any test id.at.this court further held that commerce could not select a rate based solely on commerce interest in inducing foreign exporters to cooperate with commerce investigations.rather,the rate must have some relationship to commercial practices in the particular industry.id.at.
this case is distinguishable from d l supply.here,unlike the exporter in d l supply,the dumping margin selected by commerce was corroborated by ta chen sales data.while commerce may have chosen the rate with an eye toward deterrence,commerce acts within its discretion so long as the rate chosen has a relationship to the actual sales information available.since d l supply,this court recognized that commerce may consider deterrence when selecting an adverse inference dumping margin.
it is clear from congress imposition of the corroboration requirement in c that it intended for an adverse facts available rate to be a reasonably accurate estimate of the respondent actual rate,albeit with some increase intended as a deterrent to.congress could not have intended for commerce discretion to include the ability to select unreasonably high rates with no relationship to the respondent actual dumping margin.obviously a higher adverse margin creates a stronger deterrent,but congress tempered deterrent value with the corroboration requirement.it could only have done so to prevent the petition rate or other adverse inference rate,when unreasonable,from prevailing and to block any temptation by commerce to overreach reality in seeking to maximize deterrence.
de cecco,at.because commerce selected a dumping margin within the range of ta chen actual sales data,we can not conclude that commerce overreached reality.thus,we will not disturb commerce selection of the dumping margin.
conclusion 
commerce decision is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with the law.commerce properly decided to apply partial adverse facts available upon ta chen for its failure to preserve sun sales data.furthermore,commerce acted within its discretion when it selected the highest available dumping margin reflected in the actual sales data before it.therefore,we affirm the decision of the court of international trade.
i respectfully dissent.the decision of the united states department of commerce commerce is not in accordance with law.i would therefore reverse the decision of the court of international trade cit,which affirmed commerce decision.in affirming the cit judgment,the panel majority holds that commerce was authorized to impose adverse facts against ta chen because ta chen failed to furnish commerce with the united states sales data of another company,one of its former distributors,sun stainless,sun.when commerce specifically requested that ta chen provide sun sales data,on november,sun had been sold to a foreign corporation,and had ceased conducting business in the united states.see ta chen stainless steel pipe,united states,slip,wl,at cit,ta chen ii.according to the majority,ta chen bore the risk of this outcome because ta chen failed to obtain and preserve sun resale data before commerce ever requested it.ante at.the majority reaches this determination despite the fact that the pertinent statutes authorize commerce to impose an adverse inference only after an importer fails to comply to the best of its ability with a request for information,b,and only after commerce has provided the importer with an opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency,d.the majority concludes that commerce may penalize importers for failure to engage in divination.i disagree with this conclusion and the reasoning from which it materializes.
section b authorizes commerce to assess an importer response to a request for information.in response to a request by commerce,importers must use their best efforts to provide the requested information.commerce may impose an adverse inference only if an importer fails to respond with best efforts,b,and fails to remedy or explain the deficiency,d.neither statute authorizes commerce to impose an adverse inference on the grounds that an importer failed to predict a future request and take affirmative steps to obtain information before commerce requested it.but this is precisely what commerce ta chen.see fag italia united states,holding that the absence of a statutory prohibition can not serve as a source of commerce authority in antidumping cases.
a careful review of the sequence of events demonstrates that commerce exceeded the scope of its statutory authority by imposing adverse facts against ta chen.in,domestic stainless steel pipe producers the petitioners filed an antidumping petition with commerce.the petitioners alleged that certain welded stainless steel pipe from taiwan was being dumped,or sold to united states customers at less than fair value.commerce investigated.it determined that welded stainless steel pipe from taiwan was being sold at less than fair value,and issued an antidumping order.certain welded stainless steel pipe from taiwan.dep t commerce,amended final determination and antidumping duty order.commerce initiated three administrative reviews covering three separate periods june to november the first review period,december to november the second review period,and december to november the third review period.
in december,when commerce published notice of the opportunity to request an administrative review for the dumping order for the third review period,ta chen requested a review.see antidumping or countervailing duty order,finding,or suspended investigation,dep t commerce.the third administrative review period,extending from december to november,is at issue in this appeal.ta chen made no sales to sun during this period.in fact,ta chen made no sales to sun after august however,certain of ta chen sales to sun were included in the third review period because ta chen shipped merchandise to sun in the united states during that time frame.ta chen stainless steel pipe,united states,slip,wl,at.int l trade,ta chen i.
in,in proceedings pertaining to the first administrative review,the petitioners represented to commerce that ta chen and sun were potentially affiliated.ta chen ii,at.affiliation is significant because,although dumping margins are ordinarily calculated with respect to the difference in price between what a foreign exporter charges in its home market and the price it charges in the united states,of title of the united states code includes certain affiliates in the statutory definition of exporter.the price at which such affiliates resell the merchandise in the united states constitutes the constructive export price,and is used to calculate the exporter dumping margin.see a b.thus,if an exporter such as ta chen sells a product to an affiliate at an inflated price,the exporter will be held accountable for dumping if the affiliate charges upon resale.
for the first two review periods,the petitioners alleged affiliation.ta chen denied affiliation,and commerce neither questioned ta chen regarding its affiliation with sun nor requested sun resale data.during those first two review periods,ta chen owned no equity in sun.under commerce interpretation of the statute applicable at that time,a finding that a party was sufficiently affiliated with an exporter to warrant use of that party sales price as the constructive export price required equity ownership.consequently,although commerce later changed its position under commerce interpretation of the relevant statute during the first two review periods,ta chen and sun were not affiliated.see ta chen stainless steel pipe,united states,slip,wl,at cit,ta chen iv explaining that commerce previously interpreted to require equity ownership for an affiliate relationship,and holding that commerce was free to change its interpretation subject to the requirements that it explain the reason for its change in position and that its new position must be consistent with the statute see also ta chen stainless steel pipe,united states,slip,wl,at cit,holding that although the previous statute permits examination of factors other than equity ownership,commerce must explain the reason for its departure from past practice,which required equity ownership for affiliation,and remanding to provide commerce an opportunity to explain the reason for its departure.
during the third period of review,the statute regarding affiliation changed.congress enacted the uruguay round agreements act uraa,which became effective on january,one month into the third review period.the uraa broadened the circumstances under which the dumping margins of exporters would be determined based upon the constructive export price of their united states affiliates.see g providing that control is sufficient to render parties affiliated,and that a person shall be considered to control another person if the person is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other person.the scope of g appears broader than the statute because control may exist without equity ownership however,commerce had interpreted the statute to require equity ownership even though that statutory language was also susceptible to a broader definition.thus,when the uraa initially became effective one month into the third review period,customs interpretation of the meaning of affiliated parties had not yet been promulgated and it was as of yet unclear how the agency would interpret the new statutory standard.
two and a half years after the uraa became effective,commerce issued a final rule codifying the agency interpretation of control,sufficient to render an entity an affiliated under the uraa.see.under commerce interpretation,as codified in,corporate or family groupings franchise or joint venture agreements debt financing and close supplier relationships,will not provide a basis for finding affiliation based on operational control,unless the relationship has the potential to impact decisions concerning the production,pricing or cost of the subject merchandise.id.this regulation did not become effective until july,almost two years after the end of the third review period.see antidumping duties countervailing duties,dep t commerce may,final rules.for administrative reviews such as the third review period at issue,which were initiated after the uraa became effective but prior to the effective date of the rules,commerce stated that the regulation would serve as a restatement of its interpretation of the requirements of the uraa.
commerce determined that during the third review period,sun met its new interpretation of an affiliated person under the uraa.but it was not until january,that commerce informed ta chen of this determination.in fact,commerce failed to inform ta chen that it considered sun an affiliate during the third period of review,or that it might consider sun an affiliate during the third period of review,until after ta chen affiliation with sun unquestionably ended.
on february,commerce first issued ta chen a general questionnaire regarding affiliated importers.this questionnaire quoted the newly enacted statutory definition of affiliated persons.it did not,however,offer additional guidance regarding commerce interpretation of the scope of this statutory standard,nor did the questionnaire refer to sun.ta chen response listed other companies as affiliates,but did not include sun.
on october,commerce first requested information about sun,in particular.commerce issued a supplemental questionnaire requesting that ta chen p lease explain in detail your relationship,past and present,with all entities known as sun.the panel majority states that in response to this questionnaire,ta chen did not provide any information regarding sales data.ante at.this statement implies that commerce supplemental questionnaire requested sun sales data.that implication is clearly erroneous.the supplemental questionnaire made no such request.indeed,as the court of international trade noted,commerce never specifically requested this sales information,prior to its first attempt to impose adverse facts against ta chen.ta chen i at.
moreover,after receiving ta chen response to the first supplemental questionnaire,commerce apparently issued a second supplemental questionnaire on december.id.at.the cit found that in this second supplemental questionnaire,commerce specifically told ta chen that it had not yet decided how to classify ta chen sales.id.commerce failed to ask specifically for sun sales data in this questionnaire,despite issuing preliminary results two weeks later,on january,in which commerce determined that sun was an affiliate.
commerce issued both supplemental questionnaires after the deadline for ta chen to submit unsolicited factual information.id.commerce failed,in either questionnaire,specifically to request sun sales data.in fact,the cit stated that commerce appears to have tried to avoid giving ta chen a belated chance to amend.id.because commerce failed to notify ta chen that the agency considered sun an affiliate,the cit reversed commerce imposition of adverse facts and remanded the matter to give ta chen an opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency pursuant to d.ta chen i at stating that commerce has an obligation to make the questions affected by affiliation issues clear,in light of its own recognition that affiliation is a complex concept.
thus,commerce did not make clear to ta chen from the outset of the third administrative review that it considered sun an affiliate,or even a potential affiliate,under the new statutory and regulatory definition.although i agree with the panel majority and the cit that substantial evidence supports commerce determination that sun and ta chen were affiliated within the meaning of g for the early part of the third review period,i do not agree that any statutory or regulatory authority authorizes the imposition of an adverse inference against ta chen for ta chen failure to predict that commerce would reach this determination.see ta chen i at in this case ta chen had a good basis to argue that it did not control sun and it made that argument to commerce.for the first seven months of the third review period,from december to july,a former minority shareholder of ta chen,frank mcclane,owned sun.during this time,ta chen had custody of sun signature stamp,and access to its accounts receivable and payable,inventory,and pricing information.ta chen also participated in negotiations of sun sales of steel pipe during this time.from this,a reasonable could infer that ta chen exercised influence sufficient to constitute control over sun pricing.
had commerce requested sun sales data from ta chen during this period of affiliation,ta chen would have had to produce it or suffer the imposition of an adverse inference.it is unreasonable,however,to assume that if an affiliation exists at one time,it necessarily continues indefinitely.ak steel united states,reversing imposition of countervailing duties because although korean government exercised the requisite control to benefit its steel industry at one time,commerce has not pointed to evidence from which it is reasonable to infer that the government control continued into the period of investigation.in this case,the affiliation ended.it ended before commerce ever requested sun resale data from ta chen.
on july,with almost six months remaining in the third period of review,mcclane sold a controlling interest in sun to a foreign corporation,picol international picol.ta chen ii at.commerce did not publish a notice of initiation for review in this case until february,almost seven months after sun was sold and its affiliation with ta chen was severed.see ta chen i at.after commerce issued the initial questionnaire and the two supplemental questionnaires described of which specifically requested sun sales information despite the new but potentially inapplicable statutory definition of issued preliminary results for the third review period in which it determined that sun and ta chen were affiliated.commerce then determined that ta chen had failed to act to the best of its ability to provide information on sun sales,and imposed the highest dumping margin from facts otherwise available for those sales.
ta chen appealed.on appeal,the cit affirmed the finding of affiliation.ta chen i at the court finds that commerce determination that ta chen controlled sun is supported by substantial evidence.the court remanded,however,because it found that commerce erred in imposing adverse facts without providing adequate notice that commerce would classify ta chen sales to sun as constructive export price sales.id.at.according to the court,commerce failed to satisfy its statutory obligation to provide respondents with a chance to remedy deficient submissions,id.citing d,because commerce never specifically requested sun resale data,and,by the time ta chen learned that commerce would classify ta chen and sun as affiliates,the time to submit unsolicited information had passed,id.the court explained that 
i f a respondent reasonably believes it is not affiliated with its reseller then it has a reason not to submit information on the subject reseller sales until commerce tells the respondent that it wants the information on the particular reseller or until commerce questions are clear enough that the respondent knows what it should submit.in this situation where a new statute was not fully explained and commerce suspected that it would make a finding of affiliation between the importer and the reseller,it should have placed the respondent on notice,specifically requested information on that reseller sales,and requested any other information necessary to the constructive export price calculation.if commerce wishes to place the full burden of error of an affiliation assessment on the respondent,at a minimum it must make that clear,otherwise this is simply another instance of error which respondents must have an opportunity to correct under d.
on remand,commerce specifically requested sun resale data for the first time.this request occurred on november,more than four years after the former minority shareholder in ta chen had sold sun to picol.ta chen forwarded commerce request for sun sales data to picol,but picol declined to provide sun sales data.in a letter dated november,picol attorney stated that sun was closed on september,and no longer conducted business in the united states.the letter stated that because answering commerce requests is burdensome and costly,his client would not cooperate with commerce inquiry.ta chen requested that picol reconsider answering commerce request,and submitted a response to commerce explaining that sun had undergone a subsequent buyout after mcclane sold it in and requesting an extension in the hope that we hear back a more positive response from sun.commerce granted ta chen two extensions of time.on december,the day after commerce granted the second extension,ta chen forwarded commerce a second letter from picol attorney.that letter states my client advises me today that he will not respond to the commerce questionnaire for the same reason as i indicated to you in my prior letter dated november.at that point,ta chen informed commerce that further pressing on this matter appears to be futile.
commerce concluded that ta chen had failed to comply to the best of its ability in providing the requested sun sales data because ta chen failed to provide the data itself.commerce did not inform ta chen of any insufficiency in the efforts ta chen made to comply with the request after receiving it.rather,commerce concluded that ta chen should have taken steps to obtain and preserve the relevant records before commerce requested them.certain welded stainless steel pipe from taiwan,final results of redetermination pursuant to court remand,slip at dep t commerce,remand results.commerce concluded that ta chen should have taken these affirmative steps in anticipation of a potential future request because ta chen had notice that its relationship with sun in particular,raised a question with the department as to affiliation at least as early as october.id.at.
commerce determination was contrary to law.by october date on which the agency reasoned that ta chen had notice that it should preserve sun sales had already been sold to picol.the record is devoid of evidence to support an inference that sun and ta chen were affiliated after that sale.nor does it contain evidence suggesting that ta chen had any access to sun resale data in october,or in november when commerce first specifically requested it.nevertheless,on remand,commerce imposed adverse facts against ta chen in calculating the applicable dumping margin.
ta chen appealed to the cit for the second time.this time,the court affirmed commerce determination in its entirety.see generally ta chen ii.in the prior appeal,the cit held that commerce acted contrary to law by failing to notify ta chen that it was accountable for producing sun resale data.this time,however,the court held that ta chen could be held accountable for failing to produce the data because a s early as july,ta chen knew its relationship with sun was at issue because the petitioners had called it to the department attention in the first administrative review.ta chen ii at.therefore,the cit affirmed commerce determination that ta chen failed to act to the best of its ability in responding to commerce information request,not because of any insufficiency in ta chen response to the request once it issued,but because in order to comply to the best of its ability,ta chen should have preserved sun information in the event that its sales were classified as constructive export price sales.id.emphasis added.
the cit reached this conclusion despite a complete lack of evidence suggesting that ta chen ever possessed that information to begin with.commerce appears to have recognized this it held that ta chen efforts were deficient because ta chen failed to obtain and preserve sun sales data.remand results at emphasis added.thus,the cit affirmed commerce determination only by diverging from the crucial facts as commerce found them,in violation of sec chenery.
next,despite concluding in the previous appeal that commerce erred in failing to follow its statutory mandate to provide ta chen with the chance to remedy deficiencies in its response,this time the cit determined that commerce was under no obligation to afford ta chen a chance to remedy the deficiency.ta chen ii at.the court held that commerce need not provide ta chen with the chance to remedy the deficiency in its response.this is so,it concluded,because d is inapplicable in remand proceedings where time is of the essence,and because the chance to remedy errors would have made no difference part of ta chen deficiency was that it could have done more to preserve the information on sun sales when it clearly had control of the information.id.
the cit erred in affirming commerce determination,as does the panel majority.commerce imposition of adverse facts was contrary to law.the cit reached a contrary conclusion by impermissibly reading the applicable statutes.it issued a decision that contravenes both the law and the reasoning by which the court was guided in ta chen consequently,on appeal,this court should have reversed and remanded.but rather than analyzing the pertinent statutory language to determine whether commerce acted within the bounds of its statutory it did panel majority skips the technicalities of statutory interpretation,and affirms on the basis that it is reasonable in this case for commerce to expect ta chen to preserve its records in the event that commerce itself would request them ante at.grave error infects this determination at every turn.
the majority begins by noting that commerce imposed adverse facts against ta chen because ta chen was affiliated with sun during the period of review and then subsequently failed to act to the best of its ability to provide information on sun sales.ante at emphasis added.but as we shall see,the record contains no evidence of any failure on the part of ta chen subsequent to the period of review.it certainly contains no evidence of any failure on the part of ta chen subsequent to commerce request for sun resale data.to the contrary,the majority conclusion necessarily rests on the assumption that ta chen should have obtained and preserved sun resale data before sun was sold.the sale to picol occurred on july,six months before the end of the period of review,more than one year before commerce determine
