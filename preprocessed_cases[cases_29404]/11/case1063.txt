kyle kimoto kimoto appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to the federal trade commission ftc,and its order permanently enjoining kimoto from engaging in a variety of marketing tactics,and ordering him to pay restitution.the district court found that vertek kimoto wholly controlled company had committed multiple violations of the ftc act,through its misleading advertising,and further found that kimoto was both personally involved in the practices and knew that the advertising was misleading or was recklessly indifferent as to that possibility.on this basis the district court permanently enjoined kimoto personally from engaging in a variety of advertising practices and ordered him to pay restitution.
on appeal,kimoto argues that the ftc presented insufficient evidence of his involvement in vertek violations of the ftc act to personally enjoin him or require him to pay restitution.specifically,kimoto argues that he can not be held liable for vertek schemes related to the marketing of what are styled the line of credit scheme,the grant connect scheme,the work from home scheme,and the acai total burn scheme,because the campaigns were not launched until after kimoto was imprisoned as a result of prior violations of the ftc act committed through a different company.kimoto further argues that he can not be individually liable for vertek misdeeds under the electronic fund transfer act efta,codified in part at.finally,kimoto claims that the district court injunction barring him from engaging in what are described as marketing,continuity programs,preauthorized electronic fund transfers,the use of testimonials,and marketing or selling products related to grants,credit,business opportunities,diet supplements,or nutraceuticals is overly broad.
we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the ftc in part,and vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to the ftc solely with respect to the acai total burn scheme.
factual and procedural background 
kimoto fraudulent business practices have drawn ftc scrutiny for over a decade,and have resulted in three distinct enforcement actions against him.kimoto various schemes have employed several unifying features in each,kimoto lured consumers with a deceptively advertised headline product,and then enrolled them in upsells,or free trials that required consumers to undergo a burdensome cancellation process in order to avoid inadequately disclosed recurring monthly fees.
two such schemes provide the relevant background for this appeal.in,the ftc brought an enforcement action against kimoto and one of his companies,assail.ftc assail,cir.the ftc alleged that kimoto enticed customers with an offer to purchase a preapproved mastercard through assail,but that when they tried to do so assail provided them either with applications for debit cards,or with unusable plastic cards bearing an unauthorized reproduction of the mastercard logo.id.when customers accepted the offer for the ostensible credit cards,assail also enrolled them in additional free trials that ceased to be free after an introductory period.id.assail then charged consumers recurring fees both for the credit cards and for the free trials,and erected a variety of barriers to effective cancellation.id.on appeal,the fifth circuit held that kimoto,through assail,committed multiple,egregious violations of the ftc act.id.at.the district court in assail imposed a permanent injunction barring kimoto from engaging in telemarketing and also ordered kimoto to pay million in restitution.subsequently,the ftc initiated criminal charges against kimoto for his role in the assail scheme.united states kimoto,cir.
apparently undeterred by the injunction,kimoto moved to las vegas and formed a corporate entity to engage in internet marketing schemes,which eventually became the vertek group,llc.to avoid regulatory scrutiny,kimoto entrusted his,juliette kimoto,with legal ownership of the entity.according to kimoto,this structure had the added and intended benefit of permitting her to profit from the company in the event that kimoto was incarcerated.
although kimoto was the titular owner of vertek,kimoto organized and ran the company.kimoto hired many of the employees who had been involved in the assail scheme,including michael henriksen and tasha jn paul.kimoto also arranged for michael henriksen brother business,global gold,to be the first product provider for the scheme and recruited two more assail veterans,randy and james gray through their business consulting and staffing company gray,llp to help with the logistics of accepting transactions on the internet with his team in place,kimoto directed and participated in the development of several deceptive marketing campaigns.
a.the line of credit scheme 
one of vertek first schemes involved the marketing of a unsecured credit line with promises such as no credit check no employment verification no security deposit bankruptcy no problem approval guaranteed the advertisements failed to mention that consumers could only use the line of credit to make purchases from global gold online store consumers who clicked on the advertisements would be taken to landing pages,which were deceptive websites where consumers could sign up for the scheme.consumers entered personal data on two screens,which contained check boxes indicating that the customers agreed to certain terms and conditions,as well as a privacy policy.
a section entitled offer details appeared in small print further down the page,below the submit button.the details stated that customers would be charged a monthly fee if they did not cancel the service,and that they would be automatically signed up for additional programs,each of which had its own free trial period,followed by recurring monthly charges.
the terms and conditions suggested that consumers would receive a traditional credit card.hidden deep in the fine print,however,the terms and conditions noted that the line of credit could only be used to purchase merchandise exclusively at the global gold credit services web site.the terms and conditions also noted,more than twenty paragraphs into the fine print that the consumer accepted enrollment for up to additional promotional product offers 
consumers who signed up for the line of credit often believed that they would receive a credit card,and also complained that they never agreed to be charged for the upsells.when consumers tried to cancel,global gold customer service operation made it exceedingly difficult,needlessly transferring customers to different websites or phone numbers,even though all of the calls ended up in the same service center.the scheme ran from june until may,when the ftc shut it down.during that time,after considerable effort on their parts,approximately percent of subscribers cancelled their subscriptions.
b.the grant connect scheme 
like the line of credit scheme,the grant connect scheme relied on misleading advertising and hidden upsells.the grant connect landing pages featured pictures of president obama and vice president biden,or of a scantily clad female model holding cash.the pages stated that billions of dollars in government grants were available to individuals to help them with their financial situation,including funding home purchases,child care,debt consolidation,medical costs,and other personal expenses.the sites offered an easy to use program to instantly find the grant that right for you,and included phony testimonials from individuals claiming that they had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in government grants.
the landing pages used the same deceptive ordering process as the line of credit scheme.the inconspicuous offer details included an initial processing fee along with automatic recurring monthly charges of,as well as enrollment in two additional offers with their own trial periods and monthly charges.
customers who purchased grant connect were directed to the grant connect website,where they discovered that most government grants can not be used for personal expenses.despite this fact,global gold representatives who also handled calls related to the grant connect scheme told users they could find grants for things like expanding a business,buying a home,and other personal expenses.the grant connect scheme began in march.by the time the ftc shut down the site in may,and after considerable effort on their parts,more than percent of grant connect customers had cancelled their memberships.
c.the work from home scheme 
the work from home scheme operated along similar lines.misleading advertisements promised that consumers could make a substantial income quickly and easily while working from home.one such program,marketed as domain processing or one hour wealth builder,claimed that users could immediately begin earning hundreds to thousands of dollars a day,in just a few minutes of their spare time,through buying and selling expired internet domain names.indeed,the site claimed that users could make a year working for fewer than four hours a day.a different program,my search cash,offered a free trial kit for an easy to use system to make or more a year using ebay and google.
not only were these earning claims unsubstantiated,the sites also included false testimonials extolling the simplicity of making money using the systems.the work from home scheme used the same ordering process,and also included two free trials.the work from home scheme began in march and continued until the ftc took over the sites in july.by the time the ftc stepped in,after considerable effort on their parts,approximately percent of customers who signed up for the offers had cancelled.
kimoto trial and incarceration 
kimoto criminal trial for his involvement in the assail scheme began in late march.kimoto,at.after a trial,the jury convicted kimoto on one count of conspiracy,one count of mail fraud,and twelve counts of wire fraud.id.at.during his trial and his subsequent incarceration,kimoto ceased to actively participate in vertek daily activities.
e.the acai total burn scheme 
the final version of vertek scheme involved the marketing of acai berries,a popular nutritional supplement.consumers were told that acai total burn would help them build muscle,increase their metabolism,lose weight,gain energy,reduce fatigue,and retard the aging process.these claims were unsubstantiated.
the acai total burn scheme used the same deceptive two page ordering process,inconspicuous disclosures,and automatic enrollment in additional trials as the other schemes.acai total burn was available to consumers for only two months,from june,through july.during that time,the program enrolled customers,of whom had already cancelled when the ftc took over the site.
prior proceedings 
in july,the ftc brought suit against many of the participants in the schemes,including vertek,global gold,steven henriksen,and kimoto.the ftc sought,among other relief,a temporary restraining order,which the district court granted the following day,and a preliminary injunction.the ftc amended its complaint to add allegations regarding additional iterations of the scheme,as well as to add kimoto,michael henriksen,tasha jn paul,johnnie smith,and others as defendants.
following discovery,the ftc and various defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court found no genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the line of credit,grant connect,work from home,and acai total burn schemes were deceptively marketed that the upsells were inadequately disclosed that the testimonials were false and that defendants violated the efta by debiting consumers accounts without written authorization.kimoto does not challenge these findings on appeal.
the district court also found that the corporate defendants operated as a common enterprise,because a ll the various offers were run by the same individuals using different company names,the defendants swapped and shared personnel,as well as blurred the lines of corporate separateness in their activities,and engaged in concerted and coordinated action across campaigns,and making their profits interdependent.kimoto,initially proceeding pro se,was the only defendant to appeal from the district court judgment.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over kimoto appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment and entry of a permanent injunction under.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.ftc stefanchik,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and decide whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.id.where the district court chooses to impose an equitable remedy,we review its decision for an abuse of discretion.id.at.
discussion 
kimoto contends that there is insufficient evidence of his personal involvement in many of the schemes to hold him personally liable.kimoto further argues that his liability for vertek actions ended when he left the company to prepare for his criminal trial,and that he can not be individually liable for vertek misdeeds under the efta.
kimoto also contends that the district court injunction,which bars him from engaging in marketing,continuity programs,preauthorized electronic fund transfers,the use of testimonials,and marketing or selling products related to grants,credit,business opportunities,diet supplements,or nutraceuticals,is overly broad.we address these arguments in turn.
personal liability 
individuals may be held liable for injunctive relief based on corporate entity violations of the ftc act if the corporation committed misrepresentations of a kind usually relied on by a reasonably prudent person and resulted in consumer injury,and individuals participated directly in the violations or had authority to control the entities.ftc publ g clearing house,cir.in order to hold an individual liable for restitution as a result of the misconduct of a corporation,the ftc must also show that the individual had knowledge that the corporation or one of its agents engaged in dishonest or fraudulent conduct,that the misrepresentations were the type upon which a reasonable and prudent person would rely,and that consumer injury resulted.id.at quoting ftc am.standard credit.to satisfy the knowledge requirement,the ftc must show that a defendant had actual knowledge of material misrepresentations,was recklessly indifferent to the truth or falsity of a misrepresentation,or had an awareness of a high probability of fraud along with an intentional avoidance of the truth.id.the ftc need not show that a defendant intended to defraud consumers in order for that individual to be personally liable.id.and t he extent of an individual involvement in a fraudulent scheme alone is sufficient to establish the requisite knowledge for personal restitutionary liability.ftc.affordable media,cir.applying this standard,we conclude that the district court properly held kimoto personally liable for both injunctive relief and the requirement to pay restitution with respect to all of the schemes described above,with the exception of the acai total burn scheme.
line of credit scheme 
kimoto does not challenge his individual liability for injunctive relief with respect to the line of credit scheme.further,the government evidence establishes that kimoto possessed the requisite scienter to be personally liable for restitution because he either knew that vertek was engaged in deceptive advertising in connection with the line of credit scheme or was recklessly indifferent as to that fact.publ g clearing house,at.kimoto arranged vertek entire operation.he organized the companies,recruited personnel who had been involved in his prior deceptive marketing schemes,and directed vertek activities.this alone is enough to conclude that he had knowledge sufficient to support personal liability for restitution damages.id.the extent of an individual involvement in a fraudulent scheme alone is sufficient to establish the requisite knowledge for personal restitutionary liability.
additionally,kimoto declared that he thought it was important for him to understand and know the language on the deceptive landing pages,because that was his job to take it out to the affiliate marketer.in light of kimoto prior troubles with the ftc,which also
