in united states mccoy,cir,we entertained an as applied constitutional challenge to a b and held that congress lacks the power under the commerce clause to criminalize the simple intrastate possession of child pornography not intended for distribution or exchange.at.now we must answer the question left undecided in mccoy whether a b,on its face,is an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power.we hold that it is not.
we also hold that the definition of sexually explicit conduct found at a,on its face,is not substantially overbroad under the first amendment.nor is the statute void for vagueness.we affirm the conviction that underlies these challenges.
in october,san diego county sheriffs deputies searched the home of steven adams after receiving a report that adams had been fraternizing with children.at the time,adams was a on state probation and was required to submit to such searches.in the course of the search,deputies seized a billyclub,pornographic pictures of adults,pictures of adams with children,adams computer,and several computer diskettes.
forensic analysis of adams computer and diskettes revealed previously deleted images of naked,prepubescent children engaged in various sexual acts.in june,approximately nineteen months after the search of his home and the seizure of the computer and computer diskettes,a federal grand jury indicted adams for receiving and possessing child pornography in violation of a and a b.the indictment specifically referenced the computer and diskettes seized by the state of california.
the federal charges against adams stemmed from an investigation into the activities of janice and thomas reedy.the reedys operated a pornographic internet website in texas known as landslide.landslide provided subscribing members access to child pornography websites.adams subscribed to landslide and admits that he viewed and possessed prohibited images downloaded from the internet.
the district court denied adams motion in limine to dismiss the indictment.adams then conditionally pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography,in violation of a b,and reserved his right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute see fed.pro.a.as part of a plea agreement,adams admitted the following facts 
on october,a search was conducted at the home of defendant steven adams.at the time of the search,adams was in possession of a computer and a number of computer diskettes.
the computer diskettes and computer contained components that were not manufactured in the state of california.
the computer diskettes and computer contained visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
the production of the visual depictions involved the use of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
the images include depictions of actual children.
adams now appeals.we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court denial of adams motion to dismiss the indictment and its determination of the constitutionality of the statute.united states cortes,cir.
adams first argues that congress is powerless to enact a statute criminalizing intrastate possession of child pornography.to decide whether a b is a valid exercise of congressional power under the commerce clause,we examine the recent supreme court decisions of united states lopez,d,and united states morrison,d,which set forth the relevant analytical framework.
lopez identified three broad categories of activity that congress may regulate under its commerce power the channels of interstate commerce,the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,and those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.at.of course,the possession of child pornography concerns neither the channels nor the instrumentalities of interstate commerce.it follows that the possession of child pornography must substantially affect interstate commerce in order for congress to regulate it under the commerce clause.
in morrison,the court established what is now the controlling test for determining whether a regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce.mccoy,at.these considerations are whether the regulated activity is in nature whether an express jurisdictional element is provided in the statute to limit its reach whether congress made express findings about the effects of the proscribed activity on interstate commerce and whether the link between the prohibited activity and the effect on interstate commerce is attenuated.morrison,at.the most important factors for a court to consider are the first and the fourth.mccoy,at.an activity that is utterly lacking in commercial or economic character would likely have too attenuated a relationship to interstate commerce and would,accordingly,not be subject to regulation under the commerce clause.id.in contrast,activities that do have an economic or commercial character will likely have a nexus to interstate commerce and,accordingly,would be proper objects of congressional regulation under the commerce clause.
in mccoy,we considered whether the federal government may criminalize the intrastate possession of child pornography.id.at.but the mccoy panel declined to address whether the statute criminalizing mere possession is unconstitutional on its issue in this appeal.instead it only held that,as applied to rhonda mccoy,a b was an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power.we recount the facts and reasoning of mccoy in some detail.
jonathan mccoy decided to take a photograph of his intoxicated wife,rhonda,and their daughter.rhonda and her daughter posed for the picture,standing side by side,partially unclothed with their genitals exposed.a photo processor saw the picture and reported the mccoys to the authorities.id.at.
rhonda and jonathan were charged with manufacturing and transporting child pornography.id.at.jonathan elected to stand trial and was acquitted.id.rhonda entered into plea negotiations with the government and conditionally pled guilty to possession of child pornography in violation of a b,preserving for appeal whether the statute,on its face and as applied,constitutes an unconstitutional exercise of congress commerce clause power.id.at.
the panel considered only rhonda mccoy as applied challenge to the statute whether a statute enacted pursuant to the commerce clause may constitutionally reach,individual conduct that is purely intrastate in nature,when there is no reasonable basis for concluding that the conduct had or was intended to have any significant interstate connection or any substantive effect on interstate commerce.id.at.the court then applied the morrison mode of inquiry.id.at.
applying the first morrison the regulated activity is commercial or economic in concluded that simple intrastate possession of child pornography not intended for distribution or exchange is not,in any sense of the phrase,economic activity.id.at quoting morrison,at.the court determined that child pornography intended for personal use did not influence,in any way,the national market for child pornography.
the court expressly noted its disagreement with the third circuit decision in united states rodia,cir.rodia posited that the possession of home grown pornography may well stimulate a further interest in pornography that immediately or eventually animates demand for interstate pornography.id.at.this addiction theory,mccoy reasoned,rested on highly questionable premises for several reasons.mccoy,at.first,rodia common sense understanding of the demand side forces was based on speculation and not explicit congressional findings.id.second,rodia labeling of persons who possess a picture of a child as child pornographers and was highly debatable in that it piled presumption on presumption.id.at.finally,rodia conclusion that pornography is a fungible good was incorrect because pornography often is intended for personal use and not for exchange,as was the case with rhonda mccoy photograph.id.
mccoy explained that the wickard filburn aggregation principle did not apply to render mccoy activity economic in nature.id.at see also wickard filburn.in wickard,the supreme court held that congress did not exceed its commerce clause power in restricting the bushels of wheat a farmer could grow for personal use 
mccoy reasoned that unlike filburn wheat,mccoy photograph 
had no connection with or effect on any national or international commercial child pornography market,substantial or otherwise.the picture of mccoy and her daughter which mccoy possessed for her own personal use did not compete with other depictions exchanged,bought,or sold in the illicit market for child pornography and did not affect their availability or price.nor are pictures of the type mccoy possessed connected in any respect with commercial or economic enterprises.
mccoy,at.in other words,filburn wheat may not have been meant for sale,but its very existence had an economic effect mccoy photo does not have any plausible economic impact on the child pornography industry.id.at.
applying the fourth morrison factor,attenuation,mccoy explained that the link between the possession of child pornography and interstate commerce was too remote to support the exercise of congressional power under the commerce clause.in fact,the court held that there was no relationship whatsoever between mccoy possession of her personal photograph and the interstate market for child pornography.id.at.
mccoy then addressed the second morrison an express jurisdictional element is provided in the statute to limit its reach.here it noted that a b contains an express jurisdictional element that is intended to satisfy commerce clause concerns.id.this jurisdictional hook limits prosecutions under a b to instances where the pornographic matter has been mailed,transported,or shipped in interstate commerce or where the matter was produced using materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported.a b.because all but the most child pornographers will rely on film,cameras,or chemicals that traveled in interstate commerce,mccoy,at quoting rodia,at,mccoy concluded that the jurisdictional hook of a b is useless and that it provides no support for the government assertion of federal jurisdiction.id.at see also united states angle,cir.
finally,applying the third morrison congress made express findings about the effects of the possession of child pornography on interstate held that the findings in the statute and the legislative history do not support the conclusion that purely intrastate possession has a substantial connection to interstate trafficking in commercial child pornography.mccoy,at.the court noted that the legislative history speak s only to the general phenomenon of commercial child pornography it does not speak to the relationship between intrastate conduct like mccoy and the interstate commercial child pornography market.id.at.at most,mccoy held,the legislative history here tells us that congress intended to eliminate the interstate commercial child pornography market,and nothing more.id.
mccoy thus concluded that simple intrastate possession of child pornography did not substantially affect interstate commerce and therefore a b was unconstitutional as applied to mccoy.id.at.expressly left unanswered in mccoy was whether the statute is facially constitutional.id.we answer that question today.
unlike rhonda mccoy,adams does not challenge the constitutionality of a b as applied to his conduct.nor could he.adams was prosecuted for possessing commercial,not,child pornography if constitutional at all,a b must reach the possession of commercial child pornography.
the morrison mode of inquiry must guide our analysis.mccoy,at.there is no effective limit on federal jurisdiction under the express terms of the statute.id.at noting that the jurisdictional hook in a b not only fails to limit the reach of the statute to any category or categories of cases that have a particular effect on interstate commerce,but,to the contrary,it encompasses virtually every case imaginable,so long as any photographic equipment or material has been used.so we focus here on the remaining three morrison factors whether the mere possession of commercial child pornography may be considered in nature whether the link between such possession and the effect on interstate commerce is too attenuated to support the congressional exercise of power and whether congress made express findings about the effects of possession of child pornography on interstate commerce.
we begin with the legislative history of,for the approach taken by congress in regulating child pornography is instructive in discerning how the possession of child pornography has a nexus to economic activity the first incarnation of came with passage of the protection of children against sexual exploitation act in.this legislation criminalized both the sale and distribution for sale of child pornography,a,stat.congress concluded such legislation was necessary because child pornography and child prostitution had become highly organized,multimillion dollar industries that operate d on a nationwide scale.at,reprinted in.
various amendments to followed these amendments responded to a increasingly pornography industry 
the child protection restoration and penalties act of first criminalized the mere possession of child pornography,title iii,stat.senator strom thurmond introduced the legislation.according to senator thurmond,greater federal involvement and more stringent laws,including laws criminalizing the possession of child pornography,were needed to destroy the market for child pornography 
we must continue to strengthen our nation criminal laws in order to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain.since the child pornography market has,in large part,been driven underground,we can not solve the problem by only attacking the production or distribution of child pornography.
this bill meets this challenge by expanding the scope of prohibited activities relating to child pornography.under current law,it is a crime to knowingly transport,distribute,receive or reproduce any child pornography which has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.unfortunately,those who simply possess or view this material are not covered by current law.this bill addresses this insufficiency because those who possess and view child pornography encourage its continual production and distribution.
cong.rec,april,statement of thurmond emphasis added.subsequent legislative history confirms that the views of senator thurmond were shared by congress as a whole.for example,a senate report explains that prohibiting the possession and viewing of child pornography will encourage the possessors of such material to rid themselves of or destroy the material,thereby helping to protect the victims of child pornography and to eliminate the market for the sexual exploitative use of children.at,wl emphasis added see also id.at statement of grassley 
this legislative history leads us to three observations congress determined that child pornography is a dollar industry in which sexually explicit depictions of children are bought,sold,and traded interstate congress decided to stamp out the market for child pornography by criminalizing the production,distribution,receipt,and possession of child pornography and congress thought it could strike a blow to the industry by proscribing possession of child pornography because those who possess and view child pornography encourage its continual production and distribution.cong.rec.at.
congress criminalized possession of child pornography as part of a larger regulation of economic activity.lopez,at.we therefore conclude that the possession of commercial child pornography has at least some nexus to economic activity we explain in more detail below precisely why this is so.for now we note that the first morrison factor,whether the activity regulated is economic or commercial in nature,and the third morrison factor,legislative history,support the exercise of congressional power.
we reject adams proposition that simple possession of photographs or film is as as the simple possession of a firearm in a school zone.in lopez,the supreme court struck down the gun free school zones act in part because the possession of a gun in a school zone has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterpri
