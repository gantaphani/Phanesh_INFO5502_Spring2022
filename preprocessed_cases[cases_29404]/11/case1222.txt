we consider whether hollynn has standing to seek attorney fees in an action brought against the best western encina lodge suites best western encina under title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and california civil rights laws.we conclude that she does.
background 
hollynn is a paraplegic who requires the use of a wheelchair for mobility.on december,traveled from her home in sacramento to santa barbara,california in order to conduct a property inspection for attorney jason singleton early that day,she called the best western encina to reserve a wheelchair accessible room for the night.she was informed that the hotel had an available room that lacked a shower,but was fully accessible in all other respects.she reserved the room.
when arrived at the hotel that evening,she encountered what she describes as multiple and severe barriers to disabled access.steep ramps,lack of handrails,and high counters made it difficult for to maneuver in the front lobby and desk area.after checked in and proceeded to her room,she discovered that the area of the hotel containing the designated disabled access rooms did not have any van accessible parking spaces nearby.once inside her room,found that many of the facilities,including the door hardware,curtain and heating controls,and lamps were either too high or too far from a clear path of travel for her to use.the path to the bathroom was blocked by beds and furniture and the bathroom itself lacked sufficient room to approach and safely use the toilet,which was too low to the ground.the grab bars on either side of the toilet were not properly positioned nor were they of the correct length,resulting in bruises and strains to both of arms and legs while trying to use the facility.the bathtub was similarly inaccessible.
on december,filed suit against the best western encina seeking injunctive relief under title iii of the ada injunctive relief and damages under california civil rights laws,as well as attorney fees,litigation expenses,and costs.after three years of litigation,the parties entered into a consent decree that settled all issues related to injunctive relief and damages.the issue of attorney fees,litigation expenses,and costs was reserved for future resolution.
then filed a motion for attorney fees.in opposing motion,the defendants did not contest her standing to sue the district court nevertheless expressed concern that the issue of standing was never resolved and issued a sua sponte order requiring the parties to address it.in response to the district court order,both parties filed briefs on standing and an evidentiary hearing was held,at which testified the only question with which the district court was concerned at the hearing was whether had a legitimate intent to return to the best western encina at the time that the complaint was filed.after hearing testimony and receiving additional briefing from the parties,the district court found that failed to provide evidence of her intent to return as of december.the court also expressed skepticism that would be able to establish standing even if she had provided such evidence,noting concerns about the credibility of professed desire to return in light of her involvement in multiple prior ada suits.accordingly,the district court concluded that failed to meet her burden of establishing article iii standing,and that the court therefore lacked jurisdiction over her attorney fees motion.subsequently filed motions for a new trial and to renew her pending motion for attorney fees.the district court denied motions and imposed sanctions.this appeal followed.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.whether a party has standing to pursue its claim is a question of law that we review de novo.see skaff meridien north america beverly hills,llc,cir citing hartman summers,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,and afford great deference to district court findings relating to credibility,united states jordan,cir.
ii.discussion 
as an initial matter,we reject argument that the district court lacked the authority to raise the issue of standing sua sponte.s tanding is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.for that reason,both the supreme court and this court have held that whether or not the parties raise the issue,f ederal courts are required sua sponte to examine jurisdictional issues such as standing.bernhardt county of los angeles,cir internal citation omitted emphasis added see also united states hays,d.the district court thus had both the power and the duty to raise the adequacy of standing sua sponte.bernhardt,at.
principal rejoinder is that the question of subject matter jurisdiction was resolved by the parties in the consent decree,and that the district court was therefore powerless to reexamine the issue by challenging standing after the decree became final.this argument lacks merit for two reasons.first,it proceeds from the faulty premise that the parties stipulated to the existence of standing in the consent decree.although the consent decree contains a stipulation to the existence of federal question jurisdiction,the decree is silent on the issue of standing.the parties neither stipulated to standing nor to any facts that would support it.
second,even if the consent decree did contain such a stipulation,it would be of no moment.as the supreme court has explained,t he question of standing is not subject to waiver hays,at.see also united states,cir.moreover,whatever effect the parties agreement and the court acquiescence therein may have had on the entry of the consent decree,our precedent makes clear that the court remains under a continuing obligation to examine its jurisdiction where,as here,the parties consent to the settlement of a case but leave for future resolution the matter of attorney fees.see smith brady,cir i f the district court lacked jurisdiction over the underlying suit,it had no authority to award attorney fees.quoting latch united states,cir footnote omitted.the district court was therefore required to revisit any concerns it had related to standing in considering motion for attorney fees.we can not fault it for doing so.having concluded that the district court had the authority to raise the issue sua sponte,we turn to the merits of its conclusion that failed to meet her burden of establishing standing.
a party invoking federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that it has satisfied the requirement of article iii of the constitution standing is a core component of that requirement.lujan,at.in order to meet its burden of establishing standing,a party must show three things 
first,it must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan,at.citations and quotation marks omitted.each of these elements must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.id.at.the evidence relevant to the standing inquiry consists of the facts as they existed at the time the plaintiff filed the complaint.skaff,at citing lujan,at.in evaluating whether a civil rights litigant has satisfied these requirements,t he supreme court has instructed us to take a broad view of constitutional standing especially where,as under the ada,private enforcement suits are the primary method of obtaining compliance with the act.doran,cir quoting trafficante metro.life ins,d.
in the present case,the only issue is whether met her burden with respect to the second prong of the injury in fact requirement,specifically,whether she demonstrated that her injury was actual or imminent at the time that she filed her complaint.lujan,at.in the context of a suit for injunctive relief,this requirement may only be satisfied where a plaintiff demonstrates a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way that is,he must establish a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.fortyune american,cir quoting city of los angeles lyons,d,and littleton,d.the district court concluded that did not satisfy this requirement because she failed to introduce evidence of her intent to return to the best western encina at the time that she filed her complaint in december.
in recent years,we have clarified the scope of the actual or imminent injury requirement in the context of suits for injunctive relief brought under title iii of the ada.in pickern holiday quality foods,we held that 
a disabled individual who is currently deterred from patronizing a public accommodation due to a defendant failure to comply with the ada has suffered actual injury.similarly,a plaintiff who is threatened with harm in the future because of existing or imminently threatened with the ada suffers imminent injury.
cir.applying this rule in cases where,as here,the public accommodation being sued is far from the plaintiff home,we have found actual or imminent injury sufficient to establish standing where a plaintiff demonstrates an intent to return to the geographic area where the accommodation is located and a desire to visit the accommodation if it were made accessible.see id.holding that plaintiff established an actual or imminent injury where he encountered barriers at a holiday paradise grocery store miles from his home and stated that he prefers to shop at holiday markets and that he would return to shop at the paradise market near his grandmother home if it were accessible doran,at holding plaintiff demonstrated actual or imminent injury where he established intent to return to store miles from his home on future trips,once the barriers to access were removed.we have explicitly not required ada plaintiffs to engage in the futile gesture of visiting or returning to an inaccessible place of public accommodation in order to satisfy the standing requirement.see pickern,at.
in order to show the actual and imminent nature of her injury,then,must demonstrate her intent to return to the santa barbara area and,upon her return,her desire to stay at the best western encina if it is made accessible.on this record,there can be little doubt that she has done so.intent to return to the santa barbara area is evidenced by the regularity with which she visited the city before,during,and after her stay at the best western encina.by her declaration,and her testimony at the evidentiary hearing,demonstrated that she has been visiting the santa barbara area since the early for both business and pleasure from to,she visited approximately times per year in connection with her work for the state department of rehabilitation.in,the year that stayed at the best western encina,she took three trips to santa barbara to visit her friends the marshes,to vacation with her children,and to perform work for attorney singleton.in the three years between her visit to the best western encina and the filing of her declaration in the case,returned to santa barbara four times to conduct business inspections and to visit the marshes.at the evidentiary hearing,testified to three upcoming trips that she was planning to the santa barbara area,including a vacation to visit the marshes,an evidentiary hearing for another trial,and a prospective work trip to carpinteria.
desire to stay at the best western encina on future trips to santa barbara if it were made accessible is also well supported by the evidence that she submitted at each successive stage of the litigation.in her complaint,stated that she would like to return and use the subject best western encina on a spontaneous,but full and equal basis but that she is prevented from doing so by defendants failure and refusal to provide disabled persons with full and equal access to its facilities.in opposing defendants motion for summary judgment,submitted a declaration again reiterating that she definitely plan s on staying at the best western encina when it is made accessible.in that declaration,she explained that her preference for staying at the best western encina during future trips to santa barbara was based on the hotel proximity to downtown,its accessibility from the freeway,and its amenities,including lush gardening and fresh country linen quilts.at the close of her declaration,she summarized her preference for the best western encina as follows it is a nice facility and fits with my needs with regards to taste,style,price and location if made accessible,i would definitely choose it again during my visits to santa barbara.at the evidentiary hearing,consistent with her declaration,testified that she had a desire to stay at the best western encina because it the kind of hotel that i would like to stay at.it simple,and you park close to your room,and it has a place to eat so i do have to get in the car and drive somewhere else to go eat.it meets the configuration of the kind of hotel i like to stay at.it also less expensive than some of the other hotels.
despite declaration and testimony detailing her intent to return to santa barbara and her preference for the best western encina,the district court concluded that she failed to even address the relevant issue because,in the court view,failed to provide any evidence of her intent to return at the time the action was.see skaff,at lujan,at.the district court conclusion is somewhat baffling in light of the record in this case.although was never explicitly asked whether she intended to return as of december,that she so intended is the obvious and most reasonable inference to be drawn from her testimony testimony that she regularly visited santa barbara both before and after she filed the complaint evidences that she was a frequent traveler to santa barbara during the relevant time period.see,pickern,at finding standing where plaintiff traveled to paradise weekly to visit his grandmother doran,at finding standing where plaintiff traveled to anaheim at least once a year on his annual trips to disneyland 
also gave detailed reasons as to why she would prefer to stay at the best western encina during her regular visits to santa barbara if it were made accessible including the hotel style,price,and location.because did not return to the hotel after she filed suit,she did not have an opportunity to develop new impressions of it.nor is there any indication in the record that anything happened between the time that the complaint was filed and the evidentiary hearing that would alter opinion of the hotel or her desire to stay there once it was renovated.thus,stated reasons for preferring the best western encina at the evidentiary hearing were necessarily based on impressions of the hotel that were formed,and that she held,at the time that she stayed there and subsequently filed suit.
in light of this testimony,we can not agree with the district court that failed to provide evidence of her intent to return at the time that she filed suit.to the contrary,her testimony plainly evidences such an intent.accordingly,we hold that established that she suffered an actual or imminent injury sufficient to confer standing.
the district court purported credibility ruling does not disturb our conclusion that sufficiently established her standing to sue.this is so primarily because the district court explicitly declined to decide the credibility issue,relying instead on the ground that did not introduce evidence of her intent to return in december to find that she lacked standing a ground that we reject supra.nevertheless,the district court expressed concerns about credibility throughout its opinion.to the extent that its concerns might be viewed as an adverse credibility finding,we reject the legal reasoning on which such finding is based and,therefore,despite the deference we ordinarily owe its findings,reject its ultimate determination.
the district court concerns about credibility focused particularly on her past ada litigation.in commenting on approximately sixty prior ada suits,the court wrote,it appears plaintiff declares that she intends to ret
