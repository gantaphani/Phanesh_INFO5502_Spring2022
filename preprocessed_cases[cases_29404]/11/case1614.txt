this is a trade case dealing with the scope of an antidumping investigation and the trial court authority to review the final scope determination.ad hoc shrimp trade action committee,versaggi shrimp corporation,and indian ridge shrimp collectively plaintiffs or ahstac appeal a final order and decision of the court of international trade,ad hoc shrimp trade action comm.united states,d.int l trade ahstac,which sua sponte dismissed plaintiffs challenge to the department of commerce commerce determination to exclude dusted shrimp from the scope of its antidumping investigation of various frozen and canned shrimp products.the trial court concluded that dismissal was warranted because it had no power to order the relief requested.commerce,although a defendant in this action,joins plaintiffs in arguing that the trial court erred in dismissing the action and has taken the unusual position of asking this court to grant the relief requested by remand to the trial court to determine on the merits whether commerce erred in excluding dusted shrimp from its final determination.we agree with plaintiffs and commerce.while we affirm the trial court holding that it was without power to order commerce to amend the antidumping order itself,we reverse its holding that it did not have power to review commerce final scope determination.
importers of goods into the united states are subject to antidumping duties if commerce determines that a class or kind of foreign merchandise is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than its fair value and the international trade commission itc determines that a domestic industry will be harmed by reason of imports of that merchandise,or by reason of sales or the likelihood of sales of that merchandise for importation.emphasis added see also viraj group united states.
under the statute,a process involving actions by both commerce and the itc must be completed before an antidumping order can issue.in most cases the process begins when an interested party files a petition with commerce and the itc requesting the imposition of antidumping duties for a certain class of merchandise.commerce will then initiate an antidumping duty investigation.id.within days barring exceptional circumstances of commerce initiation of the investigation,the itc is required to issue a preliminary determination of whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the united states is materially injured or threatened with injury by reason of imports of the subject merchandise.id.a.if the itc makes a negative determination,finds no injury,the investigation is terminated.id.
if the itc makes an affirmative determination,then commerce must issue a preliminary determination of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold,or is likely to be sold,at less than fair value.id.b.as part of this preliminary determination,commerce will also make a preliminary determination of the scope of the investigation.within days after its preliminary determination,commerce must issue a final determination of whether the subject merchandise is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than its fair value.id.a.if commerce determines that goods within the proper scope of the investigation are being or are likely to be sold at less than fair value,commerce forwards its determination and all information upon which such determination was based to the itc.id.c.the itc must then make a final determination of whether united states industry is materially threatened or injured by the importation of the merchandise with respect to which commerce has made an affirmative determination.id.b.if commerce and the itc both issue final affirmative determinations,then commerce shall issue an antidumping order.id.c,a.if either of the final determinations is negative,the investigation is terminated.id.c.
judicial review of the antidumping procedure is available in the court of international trade.in particular,the statute provides that within days of publication in the federal register,an interested party can commence an action in the court of international trade for a review of a final negative determination by commerce or the itc under section or of this act or,including,at the option of the appellant,any part of a final affirmative determination which specifically excludes any company or product.id.a b ii,a a i i emphasis added.
the antidumping proceedings at issue in this case proceeded as required by statute.on december,ahstac,a coalition of members of the domestic shrimp industry,filed an antidumping duty petition concerning frozen and canned warmwater shrimp from brazil,ecuador,india,thailand,china,and vietnam.in response,commerce announced that it was initiating an antidumping investigation.notice of initiation of antidumping duty investigations certain frozen and canned warmwater shrimp from brazil,ecuador,india,thailand,the people republic of china and the socialist republic of vietnam,initiation notice.in the initiation notice,commerce announced that it was preliminarily defining the scope of the investigation to include products which are processed from warmwater shrimp and prawns through either freezing or canning and which are sold in any count size,but was excluding certain categories of shrimp including breaded shrimp and prawns,fresh shrimp,and dried shrimp.id.at.commerce set aside a period of time,however,for parties to raise issues regarding product coverage prior to the issuance of the preliminary determinations.id.
in february the itc issued its preliminary determination that there was a reasonable indication that united states industry was materially injured by reason of imports of certain frozen or canned warmwater shrimp and prawns from the countries named in the petition.certain frozen or canned warmwater shrimp and prawns from brazil,china,ecuador,india,thailand,and vietnam,usitc pub.
meanwhile,in response to commerce initial request for comments regarding product coverage,various foreign producers,including defendant eastern fish company,eastern fish,submitted briefs to commerce arguing that battered shrimp and dusted shrimp should be excluded from the scope of the investigation.according to eastern fish and the other foreign producers,dusted shrimp,shrimp coated with a light layer of flour,is only used as an intermediate to making the already excluded breaded shrimp and,therefore,should similarly be excluded.
after considering the interested parties comments,commerce issued its preliminary determinations finding that certain frozen and canned warmwater shrimp from the countries under investigation were being sold in the united states at less than fair value.notice of preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value,partial affirmative preliminary determination of critical circumstances and postponement of final determination.july,commerce preliminary determination in its preliminary determinations,commerce excluded battered shrimp from the scope of the investigation under the exclusion for breaded shrimp but did not exclude dusted shrimp.dep t of commerce memorandum,antidumping investigation on certain frozen and canned warmwarter shrimp from brazil,ecuador,india,thailand,the people republic of china and the socialist republic of vietnam scope clarification dusted shrimp and battered shrimp july,july scope memorandum.commerce found,however,that there was sufficient evidence for the department to be prepared to exclude dusted shrimp from the scope of the order provided an appropriate description could be developed.commerce preliminary determination.at see also july scope memorandum at.in response,certain importers proposed a definition of dusted shrimp based on various physical requirements,and commerce determined that this definition provided a workable definition that would not lead to circumvention of the antidumping order.dep t of commerce memorandum,antidumping investigation on certain frozen and canned warmwater shrimp from brazil,ecuador,india,thailand,the people republic of china and the socialist republic of vietnam scope clarification dusted shrimp and battered shrimp,november scope memorandum.accordingly,dusted shrimp were excluded from the scope of commerce final determinations which affirmed the finding of sales at less than fair value for those goods within the scope of the investigation.notice of final determination of sales at less than fair value certain frozen and canned warmwater shrimp from the people republic of china,commerce final determination.

on april,ahstac filed a timely complaint in the court of international trade appealing the final determination issued by the united states department of commerce to the extent that it excluded dusted shrimp from the scope of the antidumping investigation.compl.in their prayer for relief plaintiffs requested that the court of international trade d irect commerce to rescind its determination to exclude dusted shrimp from the scope of the investigation,and to amend its order to include dusted shrimp among products subject to the antidumping duty order.id.
plaintiffs filed a rule motion for judgment on the agency record,see ammex united states,bannum united states,arguing that commerce final determinations unlawfully excluded dusted shrimp from the scope of the investigations and thereby requested that the trial court r emand the final determinations to the department of commerce with instructions to correct this error mot.for on the agency.the trial court,sua sponte,dismissed the case over the objections of both plaintiffs and commerce.ahstac,d at.although the trial court recognized that it had subject matter jurisdiction to review commerce final determination,it held that dismissal was proper because the court of international trade did not have the authority to grant the relief requested by plaintiffs.id.at.

the parties dispute how to characterize the trial court holding.plaintiffs and commerce suggest that the court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.eastern fish argues that the court found that it did have jurisdiction,but did not have authority to grant the relief requested.eastern fish more accurately describes the trial court holding.see ahstac,d at holding in a section entitled subject matter jurisdiction that t he court will consider the amended final determinations of commerce to be properly before the court for judicial review before turning to the merits of the rule motion and concluding that the relief plaintiffs requested was unavailable.but plaintiffs and commerce characterization of that ruling as jurisdictional is understandable.our case law is arguably inconsistent about whether a finding that a court does not have authority to grant the relief requested should be considered jurisdictional.compare rhone poulenc united states,holding that whether the court of international trade has power or authority to grant the equitable relief requested was not a question of jurisdiction,and ctr.for sci.united states,we do not,however,mean to suggest any view as to the merits of the case or any other issue going to the jurisdiction of the district court or its authority to grant the requested relief.emphasis added,with data.fed.servs.admin.bd.of contract appeals,a claim seeking relief only beyond that which may be granted will negate jurisdiction,and ledford united states,explaining in a court of federal claims case that,i n order to establish jurisdiction over these claims,the plaintiff must point to some statute specifically conferring power upon the trial court to grant his desired relief.as nothing in the instant appeal turns on whether the trial court dismissal was truly jurisdictional,we need not,and do not,decide whether the trial court determination that the case should be dismissed for lack of authority to grant the relief requested was also implicitly a holding that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.see steel citizens for a better env t,d cautioning against jurisdictional rulings.
the trial court dismissal rested on three independent holdings.first,the trial court held that it did not have authority to order commerce to unilaterally amend the antidumping order because commerce was without statutory power to amend an antidumping order to include merchandise which was not the subject of an affirmative final material injury determination by the itc.second,the trial court found that plaintiffs had not requested as relief that the court remand commerce final fair value determination to the agency,except to the extent that this was part of an order to amend the antidumping order.third,the trial court held that even if plaintiffs had requested a remand of commerce final determination,the court was without power to grant such relief because plaintiffs,although having brought a timely challenge to the amended final less than fair value determinations of commerce,failed to challenge the final affirmative injury determination of the international trade commission on which the antidumping duty orders on frozen shrimp were based ahstac,at.according to the trial court,this failure to appeal the itc final determination would make a court order directing commerce to amend its final determinations to include dusted shrimp futile should the commission refuse to act voluntarily to modify its final injury determination.id.at.we review each determination in turn.
the trial court did not err in concluding that it was without authority to order commerce to directly revise the antidumping order to include dusted shrimp.the court of international trade has no authority to order commerce to act in direct violation of the statute.under the statute,commerce can only issue an antidumping order if it has determine ed that a class or kind of foreign merchandise is being,or is likely to be,sold in the united states at less than its fair value,and the itc determines that an industry in the united states is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of that merchandise or by reasons of sales of that merchandise.emphasis added.accordingly,the court of international trade has no authority to order commerce to issue an antidumping order on merchandise for which the itc has never made a material injury finding.see wheatland tube united states,explaining that allow ing commerce to assess antidumping duties on products intentionally omitted from the itc injury investigation would frustrate the purpose of the antidumping laws.
on appeal,ahstac concedes that the court of international trade could not order commerce to amend the antidumping order in the absence of a final material injury determination by the itc that included dusted shrimp it argues,however,that the itc final determination did,in fact,include dusted sh
