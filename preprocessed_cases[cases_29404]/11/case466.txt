patricia moore king moore king challenges the application of regulations enacted by the county of chesterfield,virginia the county affecting fortune tellers on various grounds.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the county.
the parties do not dispute the relevant facts.the chesterfield county code of ordinances the code defines a fortune teller as 
any person or establishment engaged in the occupation of occult sciences,including a,palmist,astrologist,numerologist,clairvoyant,craniologist,phrenologist,card reader,spiritual reader,tea leaf reader,prophet,psychic or advisor or who in any other manner claims or pretends to tell fortunes or claims or pretends to disclose mental faculties of individuals for any form of compensation.
code.although moore king does not identify herself as a fortune teller,she agrees that her spiritual counseling activities fall within the county fortune teller definition.
the county regulates fortune tellers in four ways,one of which is applicable to all those operating a business in the county,with the others more specific to fortune tellers.first,every person who has a definite place of business in chesterfield county,including those covered by the fortune teller provision,must acquire a business license.code.
second,a person seeking a business license to practice as a fortune teller within the county must apply for and obtain a permit from the chief of police,or his designee.code a the permit application must include biographical information about the applicant,fingerprints and a written authorization to allow the chief of police to conduct a background investigation,and the applicant certification that all information in the application is true.the chief of police is not to issue a permit if his investigation reveals that the applicant has been convicted within the last ten years of a felony or any other crime materially affecting the applicant ability to conduct the permitted activity including a crime involving moral turpitude,or has been denied a permit or has had a permit revoked under any similar statute or ordinance.code d.section also includes procedures for the suspension or revocation of a fortune teller permit.
third,the code imposes a license tax of on fortune tellers and fines any person who acts as an unlicensed fortune teller not less than and not more than for each such offense.code.the code also imposes an annual business license fee for businesses with more than but less than in gross receipts.code.no fee applies if a business receives less than in gross receipts.id.
finally,the county regulates fortune tellers through its zoning ordinances.these ordinances allow occult sciences,which includes fortune telling,as a conditional use within the c general business district.being eligible for c also enables fortune tellers who have acquired a conditional use permit to operate in the agricultural a,general industrial i,and heavy industrial i zoning districts.the conditional use designation is reserved for those uses which,because of their unique characteristics,can not be permitted by right in a particular district or districts,without consideration,in each case,of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use of the particular location.code.between january,and december,the county board of supervisors approved of the applications for conditional use permits.
beginning in late,patricia moore king sought to offer services as a psychic and spiritual counselor in chesterfield county under the name of psychic sophie.she rented office space in an area zoned as a c community business district.other tenants included clinical psychologists and licensed professional counselors.
both on her and in an affidavit submitted to the district court,moore king describes her beliefs and identifies the broad range of her interests.in her own words i am very spiritual in nature,yet i do not follow particular religions or practices,and organized anything sic are not for me.i pretty much go with my inner flow,and that seems to work best.j.moore king draws inspiration from a diverse array of sources 
spirituality,astrology,reiki,natural healing,meditation,study,metaphysics in general,new age philosophy,psychology,human behavior,quantum physics,ancient history,philosophy,writing,jewelry making,reading manly hall,madame blavatsky,alice bailey,and james hillman are of special appeal,music,music,music,and creativity in all forms are passions and interests of mine.
id.she further professes a strong belief in the words and teachings of jesus which she believe s are incorporated into tarot cards and a belief in the new age movement,which moore king describes as a decentralized western spiritual movement that seeks universal truth and the attainment of the highest individual potential.she incorporates these beliefs into the spiritual counseling she provides to her clients.
spiritual counseling involving a psychic reading is apparently moore king primary practice.this counseling appears to consist largely of her use of tarot cards in conjunction with her client name and astrological sign as well as the name and astrological sign of any other person about whom the client wishes to inquire to attempt to perceive whatever she can on behalf of the client.clients often bring moore king specific inquiries about their businesses,relationships,or other personal matters.she encourages clients to take notes during their sessions in order to remember details of what she has said,and to ask her questions about anything that remains unclear.
in august,authorities from the county contacted moore king and informed her she needed a business license to operate.when moore king sought to register with the county commissioner of revenue as a business likely to earn less than in annual revenue,she learned that the county classified her as a fortune teller as defined in the county code.she then received a letter informing her that she owed the county,consisting of the fortune teller license tax under code and a penalty and accrued interest for late payment.
moore king chose not to pay the license tax but instead to challenge the legality of the county regulatory scheme.in december,she filed a complaint against the county alleging seven counts under the constitution and federal statutory law.she asserted violations of her first amendment rights to free speech and the free exercise of religion statutory claims under the religious land use and institutionalized persons act the rluipa,et and allegations that the county regulatory treatment of her violated the equal protection clause.the county filed a motion to dismiss,and,following a period of discovery,both the county and moore king filed motions for summary judgment.
on september,the district court entered a memorandum opinion and order denying the county motion to dismiss,denying moore king summary judgment motion,and granting summary judgment in favor of the county.the district court began its analysis of moore king free speech claim by characterizing the county measures as de minimis regulation of her business common to all businesses in virginia and,most likely,in the entire nation.moore king county of chesterfield,d.it specifically held that moore king business and speech purporting to predict future events constituted quintessential deception,id.at,and was thus not entitled to any first amendment protection.
the district court also offered two alternative rationales for its disposition of moore king free speech claim.first,it concluded that because verbiage is the product that moore king sells,the county justifiably regulated her activities as commercial speech subject to lessened first amendment protection.id.at.second,even if moore king activities were not considered commercial speech,the county regulations passed constitutional muster as valid time,place,and manner restrictions because they properly balance the need to protect the public from unscrupulous charlatans with the opportunity for fortune tellers to practice their profession.id.at.
the district court then addressed moore king remaining arguments.as to moore king free exercise and rluipa claims,the district court found that moore king followed no particular religion in large part because she expressly disavows that her beliefs are rooted in any religion.id.at.it found further support for its conclusion in the panoramic potpourri of her spiritual and secular interests and her fee for service model approach to counseling.id.at see also id.at religious experience is not typically thought of as purchased chunks at a time.having concluded moore king was not engaged in the practice of a religion,the district court granted summary judgment to the county on both moore king constitutional and statutory religion claims.finally,finding no entity or individual similarly situated to but treated differently from moore king,the district court determined that the county regulation of moore king as a fortune teller did not violate the equal protection clause.
moore king now appeals.
moore king presses four arguments on appeal.first,she asserts that the county regulatory scheme violates her first amendment right to free speech.second,she argues that the county has violated her right to the free exercise of her religion,also protected by the first amendment.her third contention is similar that the county has substantially burdened her religious exercise in violation of the rluipa.finally,moore king claims that the county regulatory scheme treats her differently than similarly situated people or entities,and in so doing,violates the constitution equal protection clause.the district court considered and rejected each of these arguments.we review its opinion granting summary judgment to the county de novo,webster dep t of,cir,and only affirm if taking the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to moore king,no material facts are disputed and the county is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,henry purnell,cir en banc quoting ausherman bank of am,cir.we begin with moore king free speech claim.
moore king contends the county regulatory scheme for fortune tellers trenches upon her constitutional right to free expression.the county responds that moore king business involves inherently deceptive speech undeserving of any first amendment protection.we therefore must decide whether moore king spiritual counseling activities merit protection under the first amendment free speech clause,and if so,at what level.
the county argument rests on two premises fortune telling is inherently deceptive and inherently deceptive speech warrants no protection under the first amendment.we examine each in turn.
the county contends that fortune telling constitutes inherently deceptive speech because it involves an attempt to predict the future.indeed,there is some case law to support this view.see,ballard walker,white adams,rodgers southland racing,mitchell city of birmingham,so,so associated with cheats,frauds,imposition upon the credulous and superstition is such profession,fortune telling,that its absolute prohibition is generally declared to be within the police power of the state,and municipalities to which such power is delegated.
as more recent case law appears to recognize,however,fortune telling is not necessarily fraudulent or inherently deceptive simply because it involves predictive speech.see,argello city of lincoln,cir adams city of alexandria,d,nefedro montgomery,spiritual psychic sci.church of truth city of azusa,cal d,cal s ome persons believe they possess the power to predict what has not yet come to pass.when such persons impart their beliefs to others,they are not acting fraudulently they are communicating opinions which,however dubious,are unquestionably protected by the constitution.if,as the county contended at oral argument,all predictive speech were inherently deceptive,most religious prophesy,financial prognostication,and medical diagnosis would fall outside the scope of constitutional protection.nefedro,at noting that lawyers and journalists may also make statements that turn out not to be true.the reality that much professional intercourse depends on predictions about what the future may bring suggests that categorical branding of fortune telling as unworthy of first amendment protection for that same reason is untenable.
at any rate,the record does not support the district court broad conclusion that t he undisputed evidence in this case is that moore king business is deceptive.moore king,d at.moore king contends that she does not deceive her clients,and the record reflects no countervailing evidence to suggest that she does.aspects of her business are clearly identified as for entertainment purposes,and the section of her website places a number of qualifications on the spiritual and clairvoyant information she purports to provide.see sophie does not provide a guarantee,as people,perceptions,and decisions,can fluctuate,and circumstances out of everyone control can happen.a jury might well decide that moore king activities are fraudulent or deceptive.but at a minimum this question raises a genuine issue of material fact,making it unsuitable for decision on a summary judgment basis.
moreover,the supreme court recent decision in united states alvarez,d,calls into question the second premise of the county argument that inherently deceptive speech is without first amendment protection.even when considering some instances of defamation and fraud,moreover,the court has been careful to instruct that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the first amendment.the statement must be a knowing or reckless falsehood.id.at see also id.at alito,dissenting noting that the plurality opinion breaks sharply from a long line of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does not protect false factual statements that inflict real harm and serve no legitimate interest.here,the county has not specifically argued that moore king speech is knowingly or recklessly false.absent such arguments,we can not agree with the county position that inherently deceptive speech necessarily lacks first amendment protection.
the county can not establish either premise of its argument that fortune telling is inherently deceptive speech outside the scope of the first amendment.consequentially,we conclude that the first amendment free speech clause affords some degree of protection to moore king activities.
we now turn to the more challenging question of the appropriate level of first amendment protection accorded mooreking counseling activities.the court below focused primarily on the nature of the protected expression.in its first alternative holding,the district court classified moore king psychic and counseling activities as commercial speech,and concluded that the county had justifiably regulated her activities as such.although the county agrees with this conclusion,on appeal it emphasizes that its regulations can be viewed as reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions subject to and passing muster under intermediate scrutiny.moore king does not challenge application of the time,place,and manner framework,but contends that the county ordinances regulate her activities on the basis of content and viewpoint,and thus trigger strict scrutiny review which the ordinances can not survive.thus,at the outset,we must consider whether commercial speech or the time,place,and manner doctrine supplies the proper analytical framework.
yet neither of these doctrines is a perfect fit.the parameters of commercial speech,typically defined as that which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d citation and internal punctuation omitted,are difficult to identify outside the realm of advertising,see,city of cincinnati discovery network,d,observing the difficulty of drawing bright lines that will clearly cabin commercial speech in a distinct category.certainly some aspects of mooreking speech propose a transaction she is,after all,running a business but it seems equally the case that not all of her psychic activities and spiritual counseling practices are commercial in the same sense.courts considering fortune teller ordinances have reached no consensus on whether to apply a commercial speech analysis or not.see,argello,at noting fortune telling for compensation consists of both commercial and noncommercial speech.
moreover,with one unhelpful exception,we can find no case or set of cases applying the time,place,and manner framework to the regulation of an occupation.the exception involves exotic dancing cases.see,city of erie pap,d barnes glen theatre,d.in those cases,however,the supreme court has failed to provide clear guidance on the operation of the analysis within that framework.see daniel farber,the first amendment ed.in the nude dancing cases the court has been unable to agree on a single standard for defining content neutrality.
at its core this case involves a collision between the power of government to license and regulate those who would pursue a profession or vocation and the rights of freedom of speech guaranteed by the first amendment.lowe,d white,concurring.the supreme court has recognized the regulation of occupational speech under the professional speech doctrine at least since justice jackson concurrence in thomas collins.see generally david halberstam,commercial speech,professional speech,and the constitutional status of social institutions,discussing history and development of professional speech doctrine.considering a texas law requiring a labor organizer to register with the secretary of state before soliciting on behalf of his organization,justice jackson articulated the justification for the professional speech doctrine 
the modern state owes and attempts to perform a duty to protect the public from those who seek for one purpose or another to obtain its money.when one does so through the practice of a calling,the state may have an interest in shielding the public against the untrustworthy,the incompetent,or the irresponsible,or against unauthorized representation of agency.a usual method of performing this function is through a licensing system very many are the interests which the state may protect against the practice of an occupation,very few are those it may assume to protect against the practice of propagandizing by speech or press.
thomas,at jackson,concurring.in describing the relationship between the doctrine of professional speech and protected expression,justice jackson observed that a state may forbid one without its license to practice law as a vocation,but could not stop an unlicensed person from making a speech about the rights of man or the rights of labor,or any other kind of right,including recommending that his hearers organize to support his views.id.at.similarly,in justice jackson view,the state could prohibit the practice of unlicensed medicine,but could not make it a crime publicly or privately to speak urging persons to follow or reject any school of medical thought.id.
thus,the relevant inquiry to determine whether to apply the professional speech doctrine is whether the speaker is providing personalized advice in a private setting to a paying client or instead engages in public discussion and commentary.professional speech analysis applies in the former context where a speaker takes the affairs of a client personally in hand and purports to exercise judgment on behalf of the client in the light of the client individual needs and circumstances,accountant soc y of bowman,cir quoting lowe,at white,concurring but not in the latter.see also robert post,democracy,expertise,and academic freedom within public discourse,the first amendment requires law to respect the autonomy of speakers rather than to protect the targets of speech outside public discourse,the first amendment permits the state to control the autonomy of speakers in order to protect the dignity of the targets of speech.
under the professional speech doctrine,the government can license and regulate those who would provide services to their clients for compensation without running afoul of the first amendment.put differently,t he power of government to regulate the professions is not lost whenever the practice of a profession entails speech.lowe,at white,concurring.and a state regulation of a profession raises no first amendment problem where it amounts to generally applicable licensing provisions affecting those who practice the profession.id.at see also accountant soc y of,at a statute that governs the practice of an occupation is not unconstitutional as an abridgment of the right to free speech,so long as any inhibition of that right is merely the incidental effect of observing an otherwise legitimate regulation.quoting underhill bradshaw,cir.so it is here.
moore king activities fit comfortably within the confines of professional speech analysis.as moore king describes and as we have recounted,her psychic activities and spiritual counseling generally involve a personalized reading for a paying client.and as the record makes clear,moore king takes the affairs of a client personally in hand and purports to exercise judgment on behalf of the client in the light of the client individual needs and circumstances.accountant soc y of,at quotation omitted.
moreover,the county has enacted a generally applicable licensing and regulatory regime for fortune tellers,that is,for anyone who,like moore king,claims or pretends to disclose mental faculties of individuals for any form of compensation.code.unlike a number of government entities that have imposed outright bans on fortune tellers,see argello,at,or bans on those fortune tellers receiving compensation,see,nefedro,at,the county uniformly requires any individual seeking to open a business as a fortune teller to acquire a fortune teller business permit,pay the fortune teller license tax,and secure a conditional use permit in a district zoned c,a,i,or i.indeed,although the steps may differ,the basic paradigm of regulatory requirements before one can publicly practice a profession also applies to law,medicine,counseling,and many other occupations.
as the government complies with the professional speech doctrine by enacting and implementing a generally applicable regulatory regime,the fact that such a scheme may vary from profession to profession recedes in constitutional significance.just as the internal requirements of a profession may differ,so may the government regulatory response based on the nature of the activity and the need to protect the public.see post,supra at the shape and form of constitutional protections extended to professional speech will depend upon the precise constitutional values at stake.with respect to an occupation such as fortune telling where no accrediting institution like a board of law examiners or medical practitioners exists,a legislature may reasonably determine that additional regulatory requirements are necessary.garcetti ceballos,d breyer,dissenting noting that where speech is subject to independent regulation by canons of the profession the government own interest in forbidding that speech is diminished.
to recognize the variability inherent in occupational regulations is not to afford the government carte blanche in crafting or implementing those regulations.we need not delineate the precise boundaries of permissible occupational regulation under the professional speech doctrine in this case because we hold that the county regulation of moore king activities falls squarely within the scope of that doctrine.the county regulations therefore do not abridge moore king first amendment freedom of speech 
moore king also argues that the county regulatory scheme interferes with the free exercise of her religion under the first amendment and the rluipa,which in pertinent part prohibits a government from enacting a land use regulation that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person.a.the county contends moore king set of beliefs does not constitute a religion,and the district court agreed.so do we.
to determine whether moore king set of beliefs deserves constitutional protection as a religion,we consider whether they are sincerely held and religious in nature under moore king scheme of things.united states seeger,d.because the parties agree and the
