the opinion filed on september,and appearing at,is further amended as follows on slip opinion page,line,insert the following text 
plaintiffs also argue that the act potential sanctions of suspension or revocation of an employer business license impliedly conflict with irca because the act sanctions are harsher than irca monetary sanctions.plaintiffs urge that the harsh sanctions,even though expressly saved from express preemption,have the effect of encouraging employers to discriminate,and that such an effect would conflict with irca purposes.their argument is essentially speculative,as no complaint has yet been filed under the act and we have before us no record reflecting the act effect on employers.there is thus no adequate basis in this record for holding that the sanctions provisions create an implied conflict rendering the act facially invalid.see crawford.at.
with these amendments,the panel judges have voted to deny the petition for panel rehearing.judges schroeder and smith have voted to deny the petition for rehearing en banc,and judge walker so recommends.
the full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing en banc and no judge has requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.fed.
the petition for rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc are denied.no further petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc will be accepted.
this case is a facial challenge to an arizona state law,enacted in and aimed at illegal immigration,that reflects rising frustration with the united states congress failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform.the arizona law,called the legal arizona workers act,targets employers who hire illegal aliens,and its principal sanction is the revocation of state licenses to do business in arizona.it has yet to be enforced against any employer.
various business and organizations collectively,plaintiffs brought these actions against the fifteen county attorneys of the state of arizona,the governor of arizona,the arizona attorney general,the arizona registrar of contractors,and the director of the department of revenue of arizona collectively,defendants.plaintiffs allege that the legal arizona workers act the act.to,is expressly and impliedly preempted by the federal immigration reform and control act of irca,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,codified in various sections of and.they also allege that the act violates employers rights to due process by denying them an opportunity to challenge the federal determination of the status of their employees before sanctions are imposed.
the district court held that the law was not preempted.the main argument on appeal is that the law is expressly preempted by the federal immigration law provision preempting state regulation other than through licensing and similar laws.h.the district court correctly determined that the act was a licensing law within the meaning of the federal provision and therefore was not expressly preempted.
there is also a secondary,implied preemption issue that principally relates to the provision requiring employers to use the electronic verification system now being refined by the federal government as a tool to check the status of employees through federal records.it is known as.under current federal immigration law,use of the system is voluntary,and the arizona law makes it mandatory.we hold that such a requirement to use the federal verification tool,for which there is no substitute under development in either the state,federal,or private sectors,is not expressly or impliedly preempted by federal policy.
plaintiffs also contend that the statute does not guarantee employers an opportunity to be heard before their business licenses may be revoked.the statute can and should be reasonably interpreted to allow employers,before any license can be adversely affected,to present evidence to rebut the presumption that an employee is unauthorized.
we uphold the statute in all respects against this facial challenge,but we must observe that it is brought against a blank factual background of enforcement and outside the context of any particular case.if and when the statute is enforced,and the factual background is developed,other challenges to the act as applied in any particular instance or manner will not be controlled by our decision.see crawford marion county election,d describing heavy burden of persuasion to sustain a broad attack on the facial validity of a statute in all its applications.
background 
sanctions for hiring unauthorized aliens were first created at the federal level when congress passed irca in.see,stat.irca prohibits knowingly or intentionally hiring or continuing to employ an unauthorized alien,a,which it defines as an alien either not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or not authorized to be employed by irca or the attorney general,h.
irca also sets out the method of demonstrating an employer compliance with the law through a method of verifying an employee eligibility,known as the system.id.b.it requires employees to attest to their eligibility to work and to present one of the specified identity documents.id.b.irca then requires employers to examine the identity document the employee presents and attest that it appears to be genuine.id.b a.the employer is entitled to a defense to sanctions if the employer shows compliance with the system,unless the employer has engaged in a pattern or practice of violations.id.b.
the attorney general is charged with enforcing violations of irca.id.e.hearings are held before selected administrative law judges aljs,and the aljs decisions are reviewable by the federal courts.id.e.
irca contains an express preemption provision,which states the provisions of this section preempt any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws upon those who employ,or recruit or refer for a fee for employment,unauthorized aliens.id.h.the scope of the savings clause,which permits state licensing and similar laws,is a critical issue in this appeal.
iirira directed the attorney general to establish three pilot programs to ensure efficient and accurate verification of any new employee eligibility for employment,stat,to.one of these programs,the basic pilot program,was to be made available in at least five of the seven states with the highest estimated populations of aliens not lawfully present in the united states.id.c,stat.at.congress amended iirira in by extending the period for the pilot programs to a period,see basic pilot extension act of,stat,and again in by extending the period to an period,see basic pilot program extension and expansion act of expansion act,stat.
the basic pilot program has thus been extended until november.the expansion act also expanded the availability of the basic pilot program to all fifty states.see id.the basic pilot program,now known as,is an system that allows an employer to verify an employee status.it is an alternative to the system.after an employer submits a verification request for an employee,either issues a confirmation or a tentative nonconfirmation of status.if a tentative nonconfirmation is issued,the employer must notify the employee,who has eight days to challenge the finding.the employer can not take any adverse action against the employee during that time.if an employee does challenge the tentative nonconfirmation,the employer will be informed of the employee final status.any employee who either does not challenge a tentative nonconfirmation or is unsuccessful in challenging a tentative nonconfirmation must be terminated,or the employer must notify the department of homeland security dhs that it will continue to employ that person.an employer who fails to notify dhs of the continued employment of a person who received a final nonconfirmation is subject to a civil money penalty.an employer who continues to employ a person after receiving a final nonconfirmation is subject to a rebuttable presumption that it knowingly employed an unauthorized alien.
against this federal backdrop,we turn to the state law at issue here.arizona enacted the legal arizona workers act on july,with an effective date of january.sess.laws ch.the act allows the superior courts of arizona to suspend or revoke the business licenses of employers who knowingly or intentionally hire unauthorized aliens.any person may submit a complaint to the arizona attorney general or a county attorney.id.b.after determining a complaint is not false or frivolous,the appropriate county attorney is charged with bringing an action against the employer in superior court.id.c,d.the act uses irca definition of unauthorized alien.see id.additionally,the act requires that the court use the federal government determination of the employee lawful status.id.h.
the act makes participation in mandatory for all employers,although it provides no penalty for violation of the requirement.see id.a.the act also includes an affirmative defense for compliance,explicitly incorporating irca.see id.j.
the act mandates a graduated series of sanctions for violations.a first violation requires the employer to terminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens,file quarterly reports of all new hires for a probationary period,and file an affidavit stating that it terminated all unauthorized aliens and will not intentionally or knowingly hire any others.id.f f.a second violation during the probationary period results in the permanent revocation of the employer business license.id.f,f.
plaintiffs originally filed an action challenging the act on july,less than one month after the act enactment.the district court dismissed the first action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it did not name as defendants any of arizona county attorneys,who have the responsibility of enforcing the act.
in december,plaintiffs filed a second complaint,this time including the arizona county attorneys as defendants.the principal contentions were that the act was expressly preempted by federal law because the act was not a licensing or similar law within the meaning of the savings clause of irca preemption provision that,even if the act was not expressly preempted,it was impliedly preempted because its sanctions provisions and requirement conflict with federal law and that the act violated employers due process rights because it did not allow them an adequate opportunity to dispute the federal government response that an employee was not authorized to work.
the matter proceeded to hearing,and the district court dismissed the arizona attorney general for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,because he lacks the authority to bring enforcement actions.the court ruled in favor of the remaining defendants on the merits.it held that the act is not expressly preempted by irca because the act is a licensing law within the meaning of the savings clause.it held that neither the act sanctions provisions,nor the provision mandating use of,was inconsistent with federal policy,and thus they were not impliedly preempted.finally,the court held that the act did not,on its face,violate due process because employers due process rights were adequately protected.plaintiffs now appeal.
discussion 
preemption 
federal preemption can be either express or implied.see fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.when a federal statute contains an explicit preemption provision,we are to identify the domain expressly by that language.medtronic,lohr,d quoting cipollone liggett group,d.irca contains an express preemption clause in its provision creating sanctions for hiring unauthorized aliens.it preempts all state sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws.h.plaintiffs contend that the act is expressly preempted.
implied preemption has two subcategories.see lorillard tobacco reilly,d.the first is field preemption,where the depth and breadth of a congressional scheme occupies the legislative field.id.citing fid.fed,at.the second is conflict preemption,which occurs when either compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,fid.fed,at.quoting.lime avocado growers,d,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting hines davidowitz.for conflict preemption to apply,the conflict must be an actual conflict,not merely a hypothetical or potential conflict.see english,d.plaintiffs contend that even if the entire act is not expressly preempted,the mandatory requirement to use is impliedly preempted because it conflicts with the voluntary program in iirira.
a.the act is not expressly preempted because it falls within irca savings clause.
the explicit preemption provision in irca states the provisions of this section preempt any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws upon those who employ,or recruit or refer for a fee for employment,unauthorized aliens.h.the parties agree that the act is expressly preempted by irca unless it falls within the savings clause of irca express preemption provision.plaintiffs argue that the act does not fall within the savings clause because they contend the act is not a licensing law within the ordinary meaning of the phrase,and that the savings clause was not intended to permit a state to create an adjudication and enforcement system independent of federal enforcement of irca violations.
the district court held that the plain language of section h does not facially preempt the act because it does no more than impose conditions on state licenses to do business and thus falls within the savings clause.contractors ass candelaria,d.the court rejected plaintiffs argument that section h permits only licensing sanctions that are preceded by a federal adjudication of employer liability,reasoning that neither the plain language of section h nor the legislative history supports plaintiffs position.id.at.
the district court also rejected plaintiffs argument that the savings clause should be interpreted narrowly,holding that because regulation in the employment field is traditionally an area of state concern,there is a presumption against preemption.id.at.an issue central to our preemption analysis is thus whether the subject matter of the state law is in an area of traditionally state or federal presence.when congress legislates in a field which the states have traditionally occupied we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.united states locke,d internal quotation marks omitted quoting rice santa fe elevator.conversely,we do not assume when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.id.
a leading case involving the employment of illegal aliens is de canas bica,d.the supreme court there upheld a state law prohibiting the employment of unauthorized aliens against a preemption challenge because it concluded that the authority to regulate the employment of unauthorized workers is within the mainstream of the state police powers.id.at.the court reasoned that the fact that aliens are the subject of a state statute does not render it a regulation of immigration,which is essentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted into the country,and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain.id.at.
plaintiffs argue that reliance on de canas is now misplaced because irca,passed after de canas,brought the regulation of unauthorized employees within the scope of federal immigration law.they rely on language in a later case where the court said that irca made the employment of unauthorized workers central to t he policy of immigration law.hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d quoting ins ctr.for immigrants rights,d alteration in original.that case,however,did not involve preemption,or indeed any state regulation
