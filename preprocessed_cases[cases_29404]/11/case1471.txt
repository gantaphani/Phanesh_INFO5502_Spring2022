acting pursuant to a telecommunications act provision designed to promote competition in the payphone service industry,the federal communications commission issued an order requiring the bell operating companies bocs to price the service lines used by payphone service providers at rates.in these consolidated cases,two groups of petitioners challenge the order from opposing points of view.one group,composed of bocs,challenges the commission authority to require a specific methodology for intrastate payphone lines.the other group,composed of payphone service providers that use local exchange carriers payphone lines,challenges the commission decision to limit the methodology requirement to bocs.concluding that the telecommunications act authorizes the commission to regulate boc intrastate payphone line rates,but not those of local exchange carriers,we deny the petitions for review and affirm the commission order in all respects.
until the,because payphones could not be operated separately from local exchange service,only local exchange carriers lecs provided payphone service.see illinois pub.telecomms.ass fcc,per curiam.for that reason,the lecs which,thanks to the consent decree under which divested its local exchange carriers,were primarily bocs,see united states am,aff sub nom.maryland united states,d generally subsidized the cost of payphone equipment and service with revenues from their other services.in the,however,advances in payphone technology enabled independent,payphone service providers psps to enter the payphone market.but because the lecs owned the payphone lines used by all psps,they were able to continue to subsidize and otherwise discriminate in favor of their own payphone service.see generally in the matter of implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,wl notice of proposed rulemaking.
in the telecommunications act of,congress fundamentally restructured the local telephone industry.section of the act,which is specifically aimed at promoting competition in the payphone service industry,prohibits any bell operating company that provides payphone service from subsidizing or discriminating in favor of its own payphone service.a.it also authorizes the commission to prescribe regulations consistent with the goal of promoting competition,requiring that the commission take five specific steps toward that goal.one of these steps is prescrib ing a set of nonstructural safeguards for bell operating company payphone service that shall,at a minimum,include the nonstructural safeguards equal to those governing bocs provision of enhanced services the computer iii safeguards.id.b c.finally,recognizing that the prescribed regulations would trench on state authority,congress provided that section preempts state law t o the extent that any state requirements are inconsistent with the commission regulations.id.c.
the commission implemented section in a series of orders,beginning with the payphone orders.in the matter of implementation of the pay telephone reclassification and compensation provisions of the telecommunications act of,wl report and order first payphone order order on reconsideration,wl payphone reconsideration order.among other things,these orders require that incumbent lecs provide individual central office coin transmission services to psps at rates that satisfy the flexible,new services test that developed as an outgrowth of the computer iii proceeding.first payphone order,at.specifically,in an order following the initial computer iii order,the commission directed that service element rates be set at the direct costs of providing the service element,plus an appropriate level of overhead costs.in the matter of amendments of part of the commission rules relating to the creation of access charge subelements for open network architecture policy and rules concerning rates for dominant carriers,wl report and order and order on further reconsideration and supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking access charge subelements order.in the payphone reconsideration order,the commission clarified that while the states,not the commission,would review the lecs intrastate payphone line tariffs,the states must ensure that the tariffs are consistent with the requirements of section with regard,for example,to the removal of subsidies and nondiscriminatory,and that the states must apply the computer iii guidelines for tariffing such intrastate services.at.
in,a group of independent psps petitioned the wisconsin public service commission to determine whether wisconsin lecs payphone line service tariffs complied with the new services test.the wisconsin commission denied the request,finding its jurisdiction under state law limited to enforcing a prohibition on cross subsidy and prohibitions on discriminatory practices.letter from public service commission of wisconsin to andrew phillips,yakes,bauer,kindt phillips.the fcc common carrier bureau,concluding that t he wisconsin commission stated lack of authority to review these payphone service offerings invokes this commission obligations under section and the commission payphone orders,directed the four largest wisconsin lecs to file with the commission tariffs for intrastate payphone service offerings together with the supporting documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of section and the commission implementing rules.in the matter of wisconsin public service commission,wl order bureau order footnotes omitted see also letter of october,from kathryn brown,chief,common carrier bureau,to joseph mettner,chairman,public service commission of wisconsin,wl.the bureau also notified the lecs that it would examine their tariffs using an appropriate,economic cost methodology consistent with principles the commission set forth in its local competition order,in which the commission implemented the telecommunications act local telephone market deregulation provisions.bureau order,at see also in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,wl report and order local competition order.in that proceeding,the commission prescribed a method for setting rates at which incumbent lecs would provide network elements to their competitors based not on the original,historical cost of the equipment used to provide service,but rather on the current cost of providing service using existing equipment.see verizon communications,fcc,d upholding the cost methodology against the incumbents challenge.
a coalition of lecs applied for review of the bureau order,primarily challenging the bureau decision to use methodologies in applying the new services test.citing section b,which provides that nothing in th e act shall be construed to apply or to give the commission jurisdiction with respect to charges,classifications,practices,services,facilities,or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service,the coalition also contested the commission jurisdiction to regulate intrastate payphone line rates.
in the order under review in this case,the commission determined that sections a and b c establish its jurisdiction to regulate intrastate payphone line rates and thus override section b.it also concluded,however,that its jurisdiction is limited to regulating bocs payphone line rates,since those provisions,by their terms,apply only to bocs,and congress had not expressed with the requisite clarity its intention that the commission exercise jurisdiction over the intrastate payphone prices of lecs.in the matter of wisconsin public service commission,wl order directing filings wisconsin order.finally,the commission upheld the bureau decision to use a methodology in applying the new services test.id.at.
a group of bocs now petitions for review,principally contending that the commission lacks jurisdiction to enter the field of intrastate telephone service.another set of petitioners,psp trade associations new england public communications council,and north carolina payphone association,by contrast,not only endorses the commission decision to impose a cost methodology on states setting intrastate payphone line rates,but also faults the commission for failing to apply the same standard to the lecs from which their members,all independent psps,purchase their payphone line service.
before considering the merits,we must address the commission threshold argument that petitioners lack article iii standing to challenge its wisconsin order.specifically,the commission contends that because it has done no more than establish a standard for the wisconsin public services commission to apply in evaluating the wisconsin bocs tariffs,and because it has made no determination as to the actual payphone line rate to be charged in wisconsin or anywhere else,neither the boc petitioners nor the psp petitioners have suffered an actual or imminent injury that is both fairly traceable to the wisconsin order and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision,as article iii requires,lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.respondents br.at.according to the commission,in order to satisfy article iii,petitioners must show that they have already suffered financial injury that is,the bocs must show that they have to charge less for payphone line service than they otherwise would have,and the psps must show that they will be required to pay more for payphone line service than they would if the commission had asserted jurisdiction over nonboc lecs line rates.respondents br.at.for that reason,the commission argues,petitioners challenge is premature we can not know whether the commission order directing the states to apply a particular methodology will injure the petitioners until the states act.
contrary to the commission argument,neither set of petitioners need wait for the states to review the lecs tariffs before challenging the wisconsin order.verizon,at.at reviewing a challenge to the commission prescription of a methodology to be applied by state commissions.the bocs injury is both clear and immediate the order methodology means that the bocs can not recover certain expenses beyond the current costs of providing,expenses owing to inefficiencies such as poor management or inflated capital and they could recover under a method.see id.at.at.to comply with the wisconsin order,the bocs will almost certainly have to modify their tariffs to lower their existing at the very least,refrain from raising their submitting the tariffs for state review.this injury,moreover,is both directly traceable to the wisconsin order and redressable by a decision in the bocs favor.
the psp petitioners also suffer immediate injury.the wisconsin order,by departing from the payphone orders regime under which the new services test applied to both bocs and lecs,leaves the latter group free to set rates that discriminate against competitor psps.we have repeatedly held that parties suffer constitutional injury in fact when agencies lift regulatory restrictions on their competitors or otherwise allow increased competition.louisiana energy power auth.ferc.while it is true,as the commission points out,that the states may decide on their own to apply the new services test to lecs,the psp petitioners need not wait for the states to set the lecs payphone line rates before bringing their challenge.it suffices for the psp petitioners to show that the wisconsin order has the clear and immediate potential to hurt them competitively.associated gas distribs.ferc.this court ha s not required litigants to wait until increased competition actually occurs.louisiana energy power,at.
mounting a second challenge to the psp petitioners standing,the commission pointed out in its brief that both petitioners are trade groups that failed to allege in their opening brief that they have any members that would be directly affected by the wisconsin proceedings.in response,the psp petitioners moved for leave to file supplemental affidavits indicating that ncpa does have at least one member that operates in wisconsin and whose payphones connect to the network via lecs.though the commission does not oppose the motion,it draws our attention to this court recent statement in sierra club epa,that a petitioner whose standing is not should establish its standing by the submission of its arguments and any affidavits or other evidence appurtenant thereto at the first appropriate point in the review proceeding,and that litigants should not expect this court to depart from that rule a bsent good cause shown.id.at.we have no need to consider the application of sierra club in this case,however,since the psp petitioners standing in no way turns on their members connections to wisconsin.contrary to the commission argument,the order on review is more than just an proceeding pertaining to rates in wisconsin.respondents br.at.instead,it establishes a rule that affects payphone line rates in every state.indeed,the commission itself acknowledged as much,noting that this order will assist states in applying the new services test to bocs intrastate payphone line rates in order to ensure compliance with the payphone orders and congress directives in section.wisconsin order,at see also id.at w e issue this order to assist states in determining whether bocs intrastate payphone line rates comply with section and our payphone orders.
this brings us to the merits of petitioners challenges to the commission authority under section to regulate the bocs intrastate payphone line rates.the communications act of establishes a system of dual state and federal regulation over telephone service,under which the commission has the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication,but is generally forbidden from entering the field of intrastate communication service,which remains the province of the states,id.b.louisiana pub.serv.comm fcc,d see illinois pub.telecomms.ass n,at see also city of brookings mun.fcc,t he fcc enjoys jurisdiction over interstate rates,whereas the several states reign supreme over intrastate rates.
while the apportionment of regulatory power in this dual system is,of course,subject to revision,whether the commission may preempt state regulation of intrastate telephone service depends,as in any analysis,on whether congress intended that federal regulation supersede state law.louisiana pub.serv.comm n,at.at.the best way to answer that question,the supreme court has instructed,is to examine the nature and scope of the authority granted by congress to the agency.id.at.at.in cases involving the communications act,that inquiry is guided by the language of section b,which the supreme court has interpreted as not only a substantive jurisdictional limitation on the fcc power,but also a rule of statutory construction.id.at.at.applying this test in a challenge to the commission authority under section of the act,we have held that should not be read to confer upon the fcc jurisdiction unless is so unambiguous or straightforward so as to override the command of b.illinois pub.telecomms.ass n,at internal quotation marks omitted citing louisiana pub.serv.comm n,at.at.
here we find that section unambiguously and straightforwardly authorizes the commission to regulate the bocs intrastate payphone line rates.section b directs the commission to implement section a and mandates by undertaking five specific measures to promote competition among payphone service providers and the widespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit of the general public.b.recognizing that the commission regulations implementing these commands would tread on ground traditionally occupied by the states,congress included a preemption clause providing that t o the extent that any state requirements are inconsistent with the commission regulations,the commission regulations would preempt state law.id.c see also,at in crafting implementing rules,the commission is not bound to adhere to existing mechanisms or procedures established for general regulatory purposes in other provisions of the communications act of.
two of the five measures prescribed in section b,moreover,expressly apply to intrastate service subsection b a directs the commission to adopt regulations guaranteeing fair compensation for in
