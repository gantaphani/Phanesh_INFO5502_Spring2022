background 
platt filed its complaint in.according to its complaint platt was engaged in the distribution,marketing,and wholesale supply of electrical products intended for consumer purchase and use.ul is a corporation principally engaged in the business of formulating safety standards for new consumer products,testing such products against its standards,determining whether the product so tested conforms to the standards,and,if the product does comply,authorizing the product manufacturer to imprint ul distinctive mark on the complying product.
platt asserted that cadet manufacturing company cadet manufactured space heaters under the names cadet and encore.ul evaluated cadet heaters,and determined that the heaters complied with ul safety standards.ul authorized cadet to include the ul mark on the labels of the heaters.ul process is known as listing,and a product that has qualified to bear the ul mark is said to be a listed product.
platt charged that by permitting these listings,ul impliedly represented to plaintiffs that the heaters were suitable for reasonably safe use as an heater 
platt alleged that the heaters manufactured between and the present,and listed by ul since at least,are inherently defective.according to platt,if the heaters had not been endorsed by ul then neither of the plaintiffs would have engaged in the purchase,sale,advertisement,or distribution of the heaters.moreover,plaintiffs are informed and believe,and based thereon allege,that at no time prior to a cpsc consumer product safety commission recall did they become aware that the heaters were inherently defective.
platt alleged that based on the express approval by ul of the heaters,it distributed in excess of sic cadet heaters.
platt also asserted that since at least,ul became aware that the heaters were exhibiting defects however,ul took no action relative to rescinding its endorsement of the product or notifying the general public,product distributors or retailers of the dangerous defects inherent in the heaters.despite its knowledge,as early as,of the defects inherent in the heaters,ul continued to list cadet heaters.according to platt,plaintiffs did not discover defendants wrongful conduct or its basis for liability until when they became involved in sic consumer class action and were granted through discovery limited access to defendant ul files concerning the heaters.additionally,platt charged that defendants wanton and reckless refusal to disclose such information fraudulently concealed from plaintiffs crucial facts 
i n or around,the cpsc became aware that cadet heaters were defective.accordingly,on or around january,the cpsc filed an administrative order recalling all cadet heaters plaintiffs were required,under controlling federal statute to bear a portion of the costs of conducting the recall.
c ontemporaneous to the cpsc recall,a consumer class action was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the heaters platt was named as a defendant and entered into a settlement agreement with the class,pursuant to which plaintiff platt continues to pay money to the class.according to platt,it has paid in excess of dollars pursuant to the class settlement.
in its negligent misrepresentation claim,platt alleged that at least since ul had knowledge that the heaters failed and could,and in fact had,caused catastrophic injury and death.despite such knowledge,ul continued to represent to the world at large that the heaters were safe products.ul continued to allow its mark to be placed on the heaters knowing that consumers,distributors,and retailers rely on the mark as an assurance of safety.ul continued to make such material representations of material facts without an adequate basis or knowledge for making such representations.according to platt,ul failed to act because such action would constitute a tacit admission that ul testing procedures were flawed and such an admission would undermine ul position as the leader in certifying the safety of consumer goods.
platt also alleged that a t no time prior to the class action or cpsc recall did plaintiffs have any reason to suspect that the heaters were unsafe.plaintiffs relied on the ul mark as an assurance of the heaters safety and suitability for its end use 
in its fraudulent concealment claim,platt alleged that it was not required to conduct an independent investigation of the heaters safety.rather,platt heavily relied on the existence,or,of the ul mark on a good.platt alleged that ul,by allowing their mark to remain on the heaters,intentionally intended to mislead consumers,retailers,and distributors like plaintiff into believing that ul listing procedures accurately reflected that the heaters were suitable and safe for their intended use by consumers and were to be absolutely relied on so that ul could maintain their position as leaders in certifying the safety of consumer goods.platt also asserted that ul assumed a duty to disclose,whether by or public notification,any known incidents that might dissuade consumers,retailers and distributors like platt from trading in the heaters.
the district court determined that platt was on inquiry notice of their claims as early as.specifically,the court held that once platt became aware through the cpsc recall and class action that the cadet heaters they sold were potentially defective,and they began to suffer damages,they were on inquiry notice that ul,on whose mark they relied,may have either negligently tested or negligently endorsed those products the district court,therefore,dismissed platt negligent misrepresentation claim as without leave to amend.however,the district court denied ul motion to dismiss platt fraudulent concealment claim.
the district court subsequently granted ul motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed platt fraudulent concealment claim as,again without leave to amend.
platt dismissed its remaining equitable indemnification claim,and filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to frcp b.watson,at citation omitted.a claim should be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can establish no set of facts under which relief could be granted.id.citation omitted.
we review judgment on the pleadings de novo.stanley trustees of the cal.state,cir citation omitted.judgment on the pleadings is proper when,taking all allegations in the pleading as true,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citation omitted.
the parties contest the applicable standard of review for the district court dismissal of platt claims without leave to amend.platt contends that the standard of review is de novo.ul counters that the standard of review is for an abuse of discretion.
this appeal involves the issue of whether any amendment would be futile due to dismissal pursuant to the applicable statutes of limitations.we review such issues for an abuse of discretion.see naas stolman,cir t he district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend,as the naases potential amended claim would still be barred by the statute of limitations.see also flowers first hawaiian bank,cir a district court,however,does not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend where amendment would be futile.citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
a.the discovery rule and the fraudulent concealment doctrine as applied to platt claims 
pursuant to california code of civil procedure d,there is a statute of limitations for a n action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake.the cause of action in that case is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.for negligent misrepresentation,there is a statute of limitations.ventura county bank macker,th,d.
since a cause of action accrues when the elements of the cause of action,including damage occur,the appreciable and actual harm that results in accrual must be harm of the specific type that is recoverable as damages on that type of cause of action.county of santa clara atl.richfield,th,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in the original.
a cause of action accrues when the claim is complete with all of its elements.slovensky friedman,th,d,as modified citation omitted.although this ordinarily occurs on the date of the plaintiff injury,accrual is postponed until the plaintiff either discovers or has reason to discover the existence of a claim,at least has reason to suspect a factual basis for its elements.id.at,d citations omitted.plaintiffs are required to conduct a reasonable investigation after becoming aware of an injury,and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have been revealed by such an investigation.id.at,d citation and alteration omitted.so long as there is a reasonable ground for suspicion,the plaintiff must go out and find the facts she can not wait for the facts to find her.id.citation omitted.
under the discovery rule,suspicion of one or more of the elements of a cause of action,coupled with knowledge of any remaining elements,will generally trigger the statute of limitations period.in so using the term elements,we do not take a hypertechnical approach to the application of the discovery rule.rather than examining whether the plaintiffs suspect facts supporting each specific legal element of a particular cause of action,we look to whether the plaintiffs have reason to at least suspect that a type of wrongdoing has injured them.
los angeles unified sch,th,d citations,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.a common thread seems to run through all the types of actions where courts have applied the discovery rule.the injury or the act causing the injury,or both,must have been difficult for the plaintiff to detect.prudential home mortgage superior court,th,d,as modified.
a close cousin of the discovery rule is the well accepted principle of fraudulent concealment.bernson indus.of california,cal th,d,in bank citation,alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.the rule of fraudulent concealment is applicable whenever the defendant intentionally prevents the plaintiff from instituting suit id.at,d,citation omitted.in order to establish fraudulent concealment,the complaint must show when the fraud was discovered the circumstances under which it was discovered and that the plaintiff was not at fault for failing to discover it or had no actual or presumptive knowledge of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry.baker beech aircraft,d.citation omitted.in urging lack of means of obtaining knowledge,it must be shown that in the exercise of reasonable diligence the facts could not have been discovered at an earlier date.id.citation omitted.
platt negligent misrepresentation claim 
negligent misrepresentation is narrower than fraud.shamsian atl.richfield,th,d.the elements of a cause of action for fraud and a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation are very similar b oth torts are defined as deceit.however,the state of mind requirements are different.intrieri superior court,th,d footnote reference omitted.negligent misrepresentation lacks the element of intent to deceive.therefore,where the defendant makes false statements,honestly believing that they are true,but without reasonable ground for such belief,he may be liable for negligent misrepresentation,a form of deceit.id.at,d citations,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.
platt was on inquiry notice of its negligent misrepresentation claim in.in,platt became aware of the heaters defects due to the cpsc recall.platt was statutorily required to bear a portion of the recall costs.c ontemporaneous to the cpsc recall,platt was named a defendant in a class action concerning the heaters defects.in,platt should have been suspicious that ul negligently represented that the heaters were safe,given the recall and the class action suit.based on the extensive legal and economic repercussions produced by the recall and class action,platt had reason to at least suspect that a type of wrongdoing ha d injured it,th at,d.platt,therefore,did not have to wait until,during the discovery process for the class action,to suspect that the injury was caused by someone wrongful act.brandon gray,th,d see also jolly eli lilly,cal d,i t is the discovery of facts,not their legal significance,that starts the statute.citation omitted.
similarly,platt claim is not tolled pursuant to the fraudulent concealment doctrine.platt alleged that it was not privy to ul documents concerning ul allegedly fraudulent conduct until.however,platt failed to demonstrate that ul conduct concealed the facts of its alleged negligent misrepresentation,as platt had notice of ul potential wrongdoing as early as.see goldrich natural y surgical specialties,th,d a defendant fraudulent concealment tolls the statute of limitations only when,as a result of that concealment,the plaintiff fails to discover some critical fact.citation omitted see also parsons tickner,th,d under this rule constructive and presumed notice or knowledge are equivalent to knowledge.so,when the plaintiff has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry,or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to its investigation such as public records or corporation books,the statute commences to run.citation omitted.
platt reliance on fox ethicon,cal th,d,is misplaced.in fox,the plaintiff sued a physician for malpractice due to complications from gastric bypass surgery.id.at,d.during the physician deposition,the plaintiff first learned of defects in the medical device utilized.id.at,d.the plaintiff then filed a products liability action against the device manufacturer outside the applicable statute of limitations.id.at,d.the california supreme court held 
it is therefore consistent with our prior applications of the discovery rule to delay accrual of a products liability cause of action even when a related medical malpractice claim has already accrued,unless the plaintiff has reason to suspect that his or her injury resulted from a defective product i f a plaintiff reasonable and diligent investigation discloses only one kind of wrongdoing when the injury was actually caused by tortious conduct of a wholly different sort,the discovery rule postpones accrual of the statute of limitations on the newly discovered claim.
platt claims did not involve ignorance of the heater defects.platt was aware of ul identity and alleged wrongdoing in.based on the recall and subsequent class action,it should have been obvious to platt that its injuries potentially stemmed from ul misrepresentations of the heaters safety,particularly given platt reliance on ul endorsement.the district court,therefore,properly dismissed platt negligent misrepresentation claim,filed in,as barred by the statute of limitations.see jolly,cal d at.
platt fraudulent concealment claim 
with respect to actions based on fraud,the statute of limitations is tolled whenever plaintiff is able to show the defendant fraudulently concealed facts which would have led him to discover his potential cause of action.snow robins,d.citation omitted.otherwise,in such cases,the defendant by concealing his fraud,would effectively block recovery by the plaintiff because of the intervention of the statute of limitations.id.at.citation omitted.
platt fraud claim was not tolled pursuant to california law.in norgart upjohn,cal th,d,the california supreme court articulated 
t he plaintiff disco
