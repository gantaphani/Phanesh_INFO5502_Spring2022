on these appeals we are confronted with an issue of first impression that centers on the interpretation of those portions of the california uniform commercial dealing with the priority of security interests in personal property among competing creditors.specifically,where a secured creditor of a business has actual knowledge that the business is substantially engaged in selling the goods of others,consignment sales,are the rights of the consigner superior to those of the secured creditor we hold that they are.
introduction 
plaintiff behyar fariba is an automobile wholesaler.california auto sales leasing casl,which is not a party to this action,was an independent retail automobile dealer to which fariba provided vehicles on a consignment basis.defendant dealer services corporation dsc is a finance company that financed casl inventory under a written promissory note and had a perfected security interest in,among other things,casl inventory of vehicles.
when casl went out of business and fariba attempted to retrieve his vehicles,he discovered of his vehicles were being repossessed by dsc.when dsc refused to return the vehicles,fariba sued.at trial,the court dismissed fariba fraud and breach of contract causes of action,as well as his claim for punitive damages.the case went to the jury solely on the issue of or priority under the california uniform commercial code as to the vehicles.
the special verdict form asked the jury to answer two questions did dsc have actual knowledge that casl was substantially engaged in the sale of vehicles belonging to others and who had possession of the vehicles at issue in the dispute.the jury answered yes to the first question and brian fariba to the second.the court entered judgment in fariba favor,awarding possession of the vehicles and in damages.
dsc appeals,asserting the court erroneously instructed the jury that fariba interest in his consigned vehicles had priority over that of dsc if dsc had actual knowledge casl was substantially engaged in selling vehicles that belonged to others there is no substantial evidence dsc had actual knowledge casl was substantially engaged in selling vehicles that belonged to others fariba security interest was subordinate to that of dsc because he did not file a financing statement the court erred in instructing the jury on the issue of possession and there is no substantial evidence to support the jury finding fariba had possession of the vehicles.
fariba also appeals,asserting the court erred by granting a directed verdict on his fraud and breach of contract claims,as well as on his claim for punitive damages.
we conclude that the court properly instructed the jury that fariba interest in his consigned vehicles was superior to that of dsc if dsc had actual knowledge casl was substantially engaged in selling vehicles that belonged to others and there is substantial evidence dsc had such knowledge.we also conclude the court properly instructed the jury on the definition of possession,and there is substantial evidence to support the jury finding fariba had possession of the vehicles.we further conclude that,because we are upholding the jury verdict in favor of fariba,we need not address whether the court erred in granting a directed verdict on fariba fraud and breach of contract claims.finally,we conclude the court did not err in granting a directed verdict on fariba claim for punitive damages.
factual and procedural background 
casl was a used car retailer located on the parking lot of the san diego sports arena.a substantial portion of casl inventory consisted of vehicles owned by others who delivered them to casl on a consignment basis.the owners would get paid by casl only when the vehicles were sold.
fariba relationship with casl 
beginning in,fariba entered into a relationship with casl whereby fariba delivered vehicles to casl.they agreed on a price for the vehicle and,when casl sold the vehicle,fariba received an established price for the vehicle.fariba held title to the vehicles and released title to casl only upon receiving payment for the vehicles.
from september forward,fariba supplied approximately percent of casl inventory.fariba,however,did not file a financing statement to perfect his interest in the vehicles.
dsc relationship with casl 
in october casl executed a promissory note in favor of dsc,a used car dealer finance company,in the amount of.dsc secured the loan to casl with a security interest in casl entire inventory,including inventory.dsc filed a financing statement covering its security interest in the inventory.
dsc knowledge of casl consignment sales 
casl was introduced to dsc by marina colli,who worked for automotive finance company afc,casl company.when colli left afc to work for dsc,she convinced casl to close their account with afc and deal with dsc.colli was dsc manager in san diego county and was in charge of the casl account.
fariba testified that colli told him that she always knew that casl was substantially engaged in selling goods that belonged to others.colli told fariba that she acquired the information from rex garwick and carmine malanga,the owners of casl,while she worked with afc,prior to the time casl entered into the loan agreement with dsc.
john denardo,casl car lot manager,testified that prior to dsc loan to casl he saw colli on casl lot inspecting the vehicle inventory.additionally,dsc sent people to casl lot on a monthly basis.denardo also testified that he had conversations with colli about the fact that casl was selling vehicles on consignment.while denardo testified that he was not certain when the conversation occurred,he said that it occurred sometime between or and july.
garwick testified that prior to casl obtaining the loan from dsc,colli knew that casl was substantially engaged in selling vehicles that belonged to others.specifically,he testified that colli was at casl lot numerous times from the beginning of until the middle of and that casl worked with colli for a few years prior to october.he testified that when casl obtained the loan from dsc,colli was well aware of the nature of their business.when colli performed inventory audits at casl,she would ask him to distinguish which were owned by casl and which were on consignment.
casl defaults on note 
in july casl went out of business and defaulted on its note with dsc.at the time,fariba had approximately vehicles on casl lot.on or around july,fariba terminated his relationship with casl and demanded his vehicles back.the owner of casl agreed and told fariba he could retrieve his vehicles at any time.
fariba arranged for drivers and began retrieving his vehicles from casl.after moving approximately of the vehicles,fariba drivers returned to casl lot and found tow trucks working on behalf of dsc repossessing casl inventory.one of fariba drivers called fariba and told him what was happening.fariba talked to colli at dsc.according to fariba,they agreed dsc would be allowed to take fariba remaining vehicles and,when dsc verified that fariba held title to the vehicles,they would be returned to fariba.fariba agreed to give dsc the keys to the vehicles so dsc would not have to make new keys for the cars it was repossessing.according to fariba,later in the day colli and another representative of dsc,floyd smith,again confirmed the arrangement by phone.in total,dsc took of fariba vehicles,each of which fariba held title to.
the next day,however,dsc refused to return the vehicles to fariba.when fariba spoke with colli and smith,fariba alleges they told him they were instructed to tell him the day before that he would get his vehicles back even though dsc had no intention of returning the vehicles.according to fariba,he also spoke with john wick,dsc corporate counsel,who told him dsc conned and tricked fariba in order to get the vehicles from him.
f.the lawsuit 
in july fariba filed suit against dsc and others.he alleged claims against dsc for breach of contract,goods delivered,fraud,wrongful possession,unfair business practices,quiet title,and declaratory relief.the breach of contract and fraud claims,as well as the claim for punitive damages,were based upon fariba conversation with colli and his agreement to give her the keys to the vehicles in exchange for her and dsc alleged agreement to return them if he could prove ownership.
g.the trial 
motion in limine 
prior to trial,dsc filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any evidence dsc knew that casl was substantially engaged in selling vehicles that belonged to others.fariba opposed the motion,arguing the information was relevant to proving who had superior title to the vehicles under the california uniform commercial code.the court denied the motion,noting that while there was no california authority on point,cases from other jurisdictions had held that a creditor actual knowledge of the fact the business dealt in consigned goods made the consignor interest prevail over that of the creditor.therefore,the court found evidence of dsc actual knowledge relevant.
motion for directed verdict 
at the close of presentation of fariba,dsc moved for a directed verdict on fariba breach of contract,fraud and punitive damages claims.the court granted the motion.in doing so,the court found that by the time fariba had his alleged conversation with colli,the cars were already controlled by dsc,in a separate parking lot,and the only thing that changed hands were the keys,to avoid dsc having to rekey the vehicles.the court found that this is fundamentally a commercial dispute between two claimants to the same physical property the court does not find that there evidence of a legally cognizable contract entered into between and by the parties that was supported by consideration.the court further found there were not demonstrable damages as a result of this because the parties would have been in exactly the same place regardless of who had physical possession of the cars.the court noted that t his case is fundamentally and solely about who had priority under the california uniform commercial code with respect to those cars the court ruled that the case would go to the jury solely on the issue of who had priority under the california uniform commercial code.
jury instructions 
fariba sought to impose liability on dsc under a theory it had knowledge casl was substantially engaged in selling vehicles that belonged to others.in this regard,the court instructed the jury in special jury instruction,as follows brian fariba holds a superior interest in the vehicles,if brian fariba proves,by a preponderance of the evidence,that dealer services corporation had actual knowledge in october of that california auto sales and leasing was substantially engaged in selling of the goods of others.in special jury instruction,the court instructed the jury,california auto sales and leasing is considered to be substantially engaged in selling vehicles that belong to others if percent or more of its inventory belonged to others.
as an alternative theory of liability,fariba sought to prove that at the time dsc sought to repossess his vehicles,he legally had possession of them,rendering dsc rights subordinate to his.on the issue of possession of the vehicles,the court instructed the jury,possession as between competing claimants to vehicles in inventory at the premises of a vendor is accomplished when one with the right to possess accomplishes actual custody and control of the vehicle under all of the circumstances demonstrated by the evidence.italics added.
dsc objected to this instruction,arguing the court should have instructed the jury possession is accomplished by physical possession and control,instead of actual possession and control.
special verdict 
in the special verdict form the jury was asked to answer two questions 
question did dealer services corporation have actual knowledge in october that california auto sales and leasing was substantially engaged in the sale of vehicles that belonged to others 
question who obtained possession of the fourteen vehicles from california sales and leasing 
the jury answered yes to question and brian fariba to question.
the court thereafter awarded fariba possession of the vehicles as well as a stipulated amount of for diminution in value of the vehicles.

general knowledge exception to creditors perfected security interest in consigned goods 
case law defines a consignment sale as one in which the merchant takes possession of goods and holds them for sale with the obligation to pay the owner of the goods from the proceeds of a sale by the merchant.if the merchant does not sell the goods the merchant may return the goods to the owner without obligation.citation.in a consignment sale transaction,title to the goods generally remains with the original owner.bank of cal.pacific,th.
to analyze fariba rights,we turn to section,which sets forth guidelines for determining the rights of consignees with respect to creditors of the consignee 
a except as otherwise provided in subdivision b,for purposes of determining the rights of creditors of,and purchasers for value of goods from,a consignee,while the goods are in the possession of the consignee,the consignee is deemed to have rights and title to the goods identical to those the consignor had or had power to transfer.b for purposes of determining the rights of a creditor of a consignee,law other than this division determines the rights and title of a consignee while goods are in the consignee possession if,under this chapter,a perfected security interest held by the consignor would have priority over the rights of the creditor.italics added.
the official comments to section,subdivision a state 
f or purposes of determining the rights of certain third parties,the consignee is deemed to acquire all rights and title that the consignor had,if the consignor security interest is unperfected.the consignee acquires these rights even though,as between the parties,it purchases a limited interest in the goods as would be the case in a true consignment,under which the consignee acquires only the interest of a bailee.as a consequence of this section,creditors of the consignee can acquire judicial liens and security interests in the goods.official comments on,west ann.cal.ed.foll,italics added.
however,section,subdivision a a iii provides a transaction is not deemed a consignment subjecting the consignor goods to the claims of the consignee creditors if the consignee is generally known by its creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others 
consignment means a transaction,regardless of its form,in which a person delivers goods to a merchant for the purpose of sale and all of the following conditions are satisfied.a the merchant satisfies all of the following conditions i he or she deals in goods of that kind under a name other than the name of the person making delivery.ii he or she is not an auctioneer.iii he or she is not generally known by its creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others.italics added.
thus,a consignor may prevent the application of uniform commercial code ucc a a if it qualifies for one of the two exceptions provided under california law.citations.the consignor must either have filed a financing statement as required under ucc article or prove that the deliveree is generally known by his creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others.citations.if either of these notice requirements of ucc article are met,then ucc a a will not apply and the consignee creditors may not reach the consigned goods in the consignee possession.in re valley media,applying california law,fn.omitted.
here,however,fariba did not attempt to prove at trial that it was generally known by casl creditors that it was substantially engaged in selling the goods of others.rather,fariba sought to prove,and the jury found,that dsc had actual knowledge casl was substantially engaged in selling the property of others.thus,we are presented with an issue of first impression in california does actual knowledge by a creditor with a perfected security interest in the inventory of a business that the business was substantially engaged in selling goods of others,selling goods on a consignment basis,defeat the right of that creditor in the consigned goods we hold that it does,and the court therefore did not err in instructing the jury on the question of dsc actual knowledge.
policy underlying ucc consignment law supports actual knowledge exception 
one problem with consignment arrangements is they may create secret liens where a creditor of the consignee does not know the consignee does not own the consigned merchandise.escrow connection haas d,haas.as the court of appeal explained in haas before the introduction of the ucc,even though the interest of a consignor was commonly viewed as a secret lien against creditors,a consignor could nevertheless retrieve the consigned goods in a contest with the consignee creditors.the draftsmen of the ucc effectively did away with the secret lien by providing,where a consignment be intended for security,that the consignor must file a financing statement under article ix of the ucc.the drafters also provided that all goods on or not so placed to secure the subject to the claims of the consignee creditors if the consignor fails to comply with the notice requirements of article ii of the ucc.haas,supra,at,fn.omitted.the notice requirements that exempt all consignors goods from claims of creditors,is now codified in section,subdivision a and requires the consignor to either file a financing statement or prove that the person conducting the business is generally known by his creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others on consignment.haas,at,fn,italics added.
the official comment to former section,subdivision,the predecessor to section,subdivision a,further explains the policy behind the notice exception to creditors priority rights as against consignors 
pursuant to the general polices of this act which require good faith not only between the parties to the sales contract,but as against interested third parties,subsection resolves all reasonable doubts as to the nature of the transaction in favor of the general creditors of the buyer a necessary exception is made where the buyer is known to be engaged primarily in selling goods of others or the seller complies with the filing provisions of article as if his interest were a security interest the purpose of the exception is merely to limit the effect of the present subsection itself to cases in which creditors of the buyer may reasonably be deemed to have been misled by the secret reservation.official comments on,west ann.cal.ed.foll,italics added.
it follows from this authority that since the purpose of the notice exception is to protect creditors from the hidden claim of the consignor,it should follow that a creditor of a consignee who has actual knowledge that the consignee is a consignee can not claim the protection thereof.anderson on the ucc,ed.westlaw interpreting ucc,italics added.
moreover,as will be seen,post,the weight of authority from other jurisdictions also holds that where a creditor has actual knowledge the consignee is substantially engaged in the sale of property belonging to others,the creditor security interest does not have priority over the consignor.we find this authority consistent with the policy underlying the ucc notice exception,the language of the statute,and rules of statutory interpretation.
authority supports actual knowledge exception 
in belmont int l,american int l shoe or,a consignor asserted it had priority over the claims of the consignee creditor,even though it had not filed a financing statement and had not shown it was generally known to creditors that the consignee was substantially engaged in selling goods belonging to others,because the creditor had actual knowledge the relationship was one of consignor and consignee.id.at.the oregon supreme court agreed,holding that a narrow construction of the notice exception would negate the policy behind oregon version of ucc section.belmont int l,supra,at.because the policy of ucc section is to protect the creditors of a consignee from the consignor hidden liens on the consignment goods,t he assumption is that,w here a secured creditor has knowledge of consignments,he will certainly not advance funds to the consignee based on the consignee possession of the consigned property.citation.belmont int l,supra,at.thus,in a dispute between a consignor and a creditor of the consignee as to priority in the consigned goods,proof that the creditor actually knew of the consignment before becoming a creditor is sufficient ibid.
several other cases have reached the same result.see eurpac serv.republic acceptance,eurpac first bank olsen under a minnesota statute similar to,an exemption exists if the secured creditor had actual knowledge of the consignment gbs meat industry,failure to permit an exception when a creditor has actual knowledge would contravene the intent of ucc and sanction intentional conversions of goods or proceeds anderson on ucc,supra,noting that a creditor is estopped from making a claim under ucc when the creditor in fact knew that the consignee was holding the goods in that capacity.
as the colorado court of appeal explained,failure to acknowledge an actual knowledge exception would lead to an absurd result.citation.the effect of the literal language of the exception is to impute knowledge of the consignment arrangement to all creditors if the knowledge is generally known.in other words,a creditor is held to knowledge which he or she could reasonably have obtained because it was generally known by other creditors.it would be absurd to hold a creditor responsible for imputed knowledge but not hold the same creditor responsible for actual knowledge.we find the analysis employed by courts holding that actual knowledge establishes the exception of colorado revised statute b colorado equivalent to ucc,more persuasive.this interpretation gives full effect to the purpose of the statute as explained in the official comments.citation.it does not burden creditors with secret liens while providing limited protection to consignors who never intended to lose title to their property.it also avoids the result of giving greater weight to imputed knowledge than actual knowledge.eurpac,supra,at.
as the court in matter of aviation.ga,stated,if a creditor knows that goods in a debtor place of business are on consignment,the creditor is not misled by the presence of the consigned goods and its lien should not extend to them.
we also conclude that construing the knowledge exception to include constructive knowledge,but not actual knowledge would lead to absurd results and we shall not interpret our commercial code in such a manner.commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,statutory interpretation must avoid absurd results the legislature would not have intended.in construing a statute,courts employ the rule that a statute must be given a reasonable and common sense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intent of the lawmakers,practical rather than technical in nature,which upon application will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.welch oakland unified sch.dist.th.
construing sections and to provide an exception where creditors have actual knowledge of the consignment arrangement is consistent with the purpose of the statute it does not burden creditors with secret liens and avoids the absurd result of giving greater weight to imputed knowledge than actual knowledge.further,section provides that the california uniform commercial code shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.thus,because construing the applicable provisions to contain an actual knowledge exception is consistent with the underlying purpose behind such provisions,and a narrow,literal reading would lead to absurd results,the court did not err in instructing the jury and crafting a special verdict from that provided fariba with priority of dsc claims if fariba could show dsc had actual knowledge casl was substantially engaged in selling the goods of others.
