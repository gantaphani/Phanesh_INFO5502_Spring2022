the department of alcoholic beverage control department seeks an order of this court reinstating its determination that there is cause to suspend the license of norman deleuze and rosa lee deleuze doing business as zd wines,a licensee collectively zd.the department had issued a decision that zd payment for advertising in the exclusive sales catalog of an individual retail licensee violated the proscriptions of the laws.the alcoholic beverage control appeals board board reversed the decision,finding that the department interpretation of the statute was too restrictive.we conclude that the department decision contains a reasoned interpretation and application of the alcoholic beverage control laws and,therefore,must be affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the facts in this matter are not in dispute.the parties submitted the following stipulated facts.norman de leuze and rosa lee de leuze doing business as zd wines zd hold a winegrower license,a california corporation doing business as wally wally,holds an general retail license at westwood boulevard,los angeles,california.george rice sons george rice is a printer and holds no alcoholic beverage licenses.george rice contracted with wally to produce a holiday gift catalog wally catalog in and.zd paid george rice for a wine advertisement placed in the wally catalog and for a wine advertisement placed in the wally catalog.the wally catalogs contained exclusively products carried by wally.the wally catalogs were distributed to over customers in the los angeles area.the wally catalogs contained wally phone number,fax number and address,information about the products and how to order them exclusively from wally.in april,george rice placed in wally postal service account.it was also undisputed that,but for payment by zd and others,wally would have been required to pay george rice and sons for the cost of producing the catalog.
in august the department filed an accusation against zd,alleging two violations of business and professions code section,subdivision a.the first count alleged that o n or about august,zd did furnish,give or lend money or other thing of value,directly or indirectly,to a person engaged in operating,owning or maintaining an licensed premises,to wit a payment to george rice sons,for a wine product advertisement placed in a publication belonging to mel jen,a california corporation,wally who then and there held an general license,in violation of section a of the california business and professions code.the second count mirrored the allegations for a payment made the following year.zd filed a notice of defense pursuant to government code section and the matter was set for a hearing.
following a hearing the administrative law judge alj issued his proposed decision,in which he concluded that section,subdivision a had been violated and that cause for suspension of zd license had been established.the alj found that payments by zd to george rice sons were indirect payments to wally,the sponsor of the catalogs and the only retail outlet mentioned in the two catalogs.the alj proposed that a fine of be paid as an alternative to actual suspension of the license in accord with section.the department adopted the proposed decision.
zd appealed the department decision to the board.the board reversed the decision of the department.conceding that there is something to be said for the department arguments based on the tied house legislation,the board nonetheless was not convinced.relying primarily on california attorney general opinion no.march,hereafter opinion,the board concluded that the interpretation the department placed on the transactions at issue was unreasonably restrictive.
we granted the department petition for a writ of review pursuant to section.
ii.discussion 
the department primary contention is that the board erred in reversing the department decision by substituting its interpretation of the alcoholic beverage control act et act for that of the department,thus exceeding its limited scope of review.we agree.
standard of review 
the administration of the act,within its scope and purposes,is initially vested in the department.cal,art.xx,see also et the department decisions are subject to administrative review by the board.after the board has issued a final order,the department decision is also subject to judicial review in the supreme court or the court of appeal.
the scope of review of both the board and the courts is a narrow one.the review by the board of a decision of the department shall be limited to the questions a whether the department has proceeded without,or in excess of,its jurisdiction.b whether the department has proceeded in the manner required by law.c whether the decision is supported by the findings.d whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.e whether there is relevant evidence,which,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,could not have been produced or which was improperly excluded at the hearing before the department.
section directs the courts to review,not the board decision,but the department decision,addressing the same enumerated questions.the statute goes on to provide nothing in this article shall permit the court to hold a trial de novo,to take evidence,or to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.ibid.thus,in deciding the issues before us our role is limited to determining,based upon a review of the whole record of the department,whether the department decision is subject to reversal on the grounds specified in section.
if the department administrative action declares or applies legal rules,or sets forth conclusions of law which are drawn from adjudicated or undisputed facts,it is subject to review only for insufficiency of the evidence,excess of jurisdiction,errors of law,or abuse of discretion.boreta enterprises,department of alcoholic beverage control cal d.t he discretion exercised by the department is not absolute but must be exercised in accordance with the law,and the provision that it may revoke or deny a license for good cause necessarily implies that its decisions should be based on sufficient evidence and that it should not act arbitrarily in determining what is contrary to public welfare or morals.citations.nevertheless,it is the department,and not the board or the courts,which must determine whether good cause exists for denying a license upon the ground that its issuance would be contrary to public welfare or morals.citations.kirby alcoholic bev.appeals bd.d.see also sepatis alcoholic bev.appeals bd.d.if the department determination is a reasonable one,neither the board nor the courts may substitute a contrary decision even if such decision would be equally or more reasonable.although most cases address the department discretionary powers in the context of the revocation,granting or denial of a license,the same deferential standard of review should and would apply to the department discretionary powers to determine whether there is good cause to suspend a license,since all of the powers derive from the same constitutional source.cal,art.xx.
we evaluate the decision of the department in light of the jurisdiction of the department and the legislative purposes of the act.
jurisdiction of the department 
the department has been granted exclusive jurisdiction to license the manufacture,importation and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state cal,art.xx,par.the department also has the power,in its discretion,to deny,suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverages license if it shall determine for good cause that the granting or continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare or morals,or that a person seeking or holding a license has violated any law prohibiting conduct involving moral turpitude.ibid.the discretion legally vested in an administrative body,such as the department,is broad and inclusive and is not subject to judicial control when exercised within its legal limits.walsh kirby cal d,martin alcoholic bev.appeals bd.cal d.however,deference to the department interpretation of the act is not unlimited.it is subject to review and intervention by the board and the courts in the event that the department acts in an arbitrary and capricious manner,or in a manner which is not in conformity with the spirit of the law.walsh kirby,supra,cal d at.
background of alcoholic beverage control laws 
the legislative background of the alcoholic beverage control laws and of section was aptly summarized by the california supreme court in california beer wholesalers,alcoholic bev.appeals bd.cal d,california beer wholesalers following repeal of the eighteenth amendment,the vast majority of states,including california,enacted alcoholic beverage control laws.these statutes sought to forestall the generation of such evils and excesses as intemperance and disorderly marketing conditions that had plagued the public and the alcoholic beverage industry prior to prohibition.citations.by enacting prohibitions against arrangements,state legislatures aimed to prevent two particular dangers the ability and potentiality of large firms to dominate local markets through vertical and horizontal integration citation and the excessive sales of alcoholic beverages produced by the overly aggressive marketing techniques of larger alcoholic beverage concerns citations,fn.omitted.the principal method utilized by state legislatures to avoid these antisocial developments was the establishment of a distribution and licensing scheme.citations.manufacturing interests were to be separated from wholesale interests wholesale interests were to be segregated from retail interests.in short,business endeavors engaged in the production,handling,and final sale of alcoholic beverages were to be kept distinct and apart.citation.all levels of the alcoholic beverage industry were to remain segregated firms operating at one level of distribution were to remain free from involvement in,or influence over,any other level.it is these legislative objectives that the provisions of california alcoholic beverage control laws seek to effectuate.
department interpretation and application of section,subdivision a 
section,one of the laws,provides a no winegrower,california winegrower agent,or wholesaler shall furnish,give,or lend any money or other thing of value,directly or indirectly,to,or guarantee the repayment of any loan or the fulfillment of any financial obligation of,any person engaged in operating,owning,or maintaining any licensed premises.based upon the stipulated facts presented,the department concluded that all of the elements of section,subdivision a were present zd is a winegrower and a licensed supplier.wally is a licensed retailer.zd furnished money to publisher george rice sons to pay a portion of wally financial obligation to the publisher for the production of wally exclusive catalog.therefore,zd furnished to wally something of value in violation of the statute.
zd challenges that determination.it argued below and argues here that section,subdivision a only prohibits gifts or other unilateral transfers from manufacturers or wholesalers to retailers and,therefore,this transaction is not a violation of the statute but only a straightforward purchase of bilateral contract for which consideration was paid.although this contention finds some support in the attorney general opinion,the department concluded that zd interpretation of the statute would place the department in the impracticable position of having to examine transactions between winegrowers and licensed retailers to determine whether the transactions constituted fair value exchanges to limit the reach of the statute use of furnish to unilateral contracts as urged by zd would invite suppliers to engage in subterfuges regarding the fair value exchanges cited by zd as a activity between suppliers and retailers and would defeat the legislature intent to limit vertical and horizontal integration of the alcoholic beverage industry.we agree with the department.
viewed in the context of the purposes of the laws,zd did not merely purchase an advertisement as it might do,for example,in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation.rather,zd paid money to place wine advertisements in a licensed retailer sales catalog.the catalog promoted wally exclusively,containing only wally telephone number,fax number,and address and only information about the products sold at wally and how to order them from wally.the catalog was then sent to over consumers in the los angeles area,bringing wally and all of its products directly to the consumer doorstep.thus,zd contributed a valuable and tangible benefit to wally by participating in paying for the production of its exclusive sales essence,a virtual retail establishment.
the department decision that this violated the prohibition against a winegrower furnishing anything of value to a retailer is consistent with the legislative purpose of the laws,as articulated in the california beer wholesalers decision.there,the supreme court made clear that all firms operating at one level of distribution were to remain free from involvement in,or influence over,any other level.california beer wholesalers,supra,cal d at.an ongoing relationship between a winegrower and a retailer such as that between zd and wally could easily lead to the kind of influence of a supplier over a retailer the statutes were intended to prevent,for example,by causing the retailer to favor or push the products of the wholesaler who chooses to pay for advertising in the retailer catalog.t he prohibition exists primarily to remove the influence by the manufacturer over the wholesaler and the wholesaler over the retailer,a practice which might result in preference for the manufacturer or wholesaler product.id.at,fn.
zd contends the opinion,interpreting the statutory predecessor to section,and relied upon by the board,is controlling.in that opinion,the attorney general concluded the statute would not be violated if advertising were placed by a supplier in the magazine of a club which held an license,where the magazine was circulated to the members and friends of the club at their homes or offices,even though a few copies of the magazine might also be retained in the reading rooms of the club.opn.the attorney general construed the word giving in the statute to mean donating and,therefore,opined that a bona fide purchase of advertising space would not be prohibited.ibid.the department did not act unreasonably in declining to follow this opinion.
first,while an opinion of the attorney general is entitled to great weight,it is not controlling legal authority.this is particularly true where,as here,there is case authority in existence interpreting the statute at issue thorpe long beach community college dist.th,d.furthermore,the facts upon which the opinion was predicated are substantially different from the stipulated facts presented for review in this case.the opinion involved advertising in a club magazine,not in the sales catalog of a retailer.presumably,the magazine was a club newsletter,not a means for soliciting purchases by club members from the club thus,the benefit of the advertising in the club magazine would inure to the advertiser whose purpose is to generate sales of its product at bars,restaurants and stores.the attorney general was not asked to comment upon a situation where,as here,the benefit of the advertising would inure not only to the advertiser,but also to a single retail licensee.
zd next contends that the department interpretation of section,subdivision a would lead to the absurd result of prohibiting winegrowers or suppliers from purchasing any goods and services from any licensed retailers.it argues that if the purchase of an advertisement placement is prohibited under section,subdivision a,then the purchase of any goods or services from a licensed retailer,whether a loaf of bread,a tube of toothpaste or a pound of onions is also a prohibited purchase.but the purchase of a loaf of bread at a grocery store is not analogous to the placement of a wine advertisement in a retailer catalog the thing of value furnished here related directly to sales of alcoholic beverages.as the department noted,it exercises its discretion to not consider regular commercial transactions unrelated
