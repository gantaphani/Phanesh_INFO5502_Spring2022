this appeal presents the questions of whether a security interest in the accounts receivable of a law an account arising from a contingent fee the firm dissolution and the bankruptcy of one of its partners and,if it does,whether it attaches to a payment of the fee.we hold that it does and reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
from to early,the law firm of schlichtmann,conway,crowley and hugo the firm represented plaintiffs in certain environmental litigation in the middlesex superior court,coble fl aerospace,civil,the groton matter.among the firm accounts receivable was a contingency fee agreement,the fee to be paid to the firm at the conclusion of the litigation.the firm had borrowed funds from the boston trade bank the bank and to secure those loans,the firm and its partners had signed a series of notes,guaranties,security agreements and ucc filings.by virtue of these documents,the bank held a security interest in the groton fee receivable.before any part of this fee became payable,the bank failed and the fdic sold its the firm notes and the security cadle company cadle.
in december,jan schlichtmann wrote to the bank on behalf of the firm,reporting on the status of the outstanding loan accounts and on the progress of the groton settlement.in the letter,schlichtmann stated that this letter serves as an additional security interest of the bank in all groton fees received by this office.
in june,the superior court approved the groton settlement agreement,under which was deposited into an escrow account,with distribution subject to the settlement approval by the massachusetts department of environmental protection.in october,schlichtmann filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code,causing the firm dissolution pursuant to massachusetts general laws ch.causes of dissolution.in january,the bankruptcy court issued a discharge of debtor order,releasing schlichtmann from all his dischargeable debts.
following schlichtmann bankruptcy and the firm dissolution in,schlichtmann continued to work on the groton matter until its final resolution in may.in june,from the groton settlement was deposited into schlichtmann escrow account.of this amount,he distributed to his former partners and to himself of which he shared with thomas kiley,a former who was dismissed from this case.cadle received no part of the groton fee settlement.
cadle then filed this action against schlichtmann,his former partners,and kiley in june.after considerable skirmishing,and cadle filed for summary judgment.on july,the district court denied both motions.the court concluded that because schlichtmann work on the groton matter was not performed on behalf of the dissolved partnership,he was entitled to a portion of the groton fee to compensate for the work he performed in his individual capacity.whether the portion of the groton fee retained by schlichtmann was a proper division between schlichtmann and his former partners was to be resolved at trial.
the case went to trial in november cadle advanced two theories first,that schlichtmann retaining of the groton fee and distributing to his former partners constituted conversion of funds in which cadle had a security interest and,second,that cadle was entitled to the entire groton fee,having forborne enforcing the notes it held in reliance on schlichtmann promise to deliver the fee when received.cadle request for a jury instruction on promissory estoppel was denied.the jury returned a verdict for defendant.
cadle appeals on two grounds first,that because it held a security interest in the entire groton fee,the court should have granted its motion for summary judgment and,second,that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on promissory estoppel.because we conclude that cadle was entitled to the portion of the groton fee retained by schlichtmann,we do not reach the promissory estoppel issue.
the district court had jurisdiction under,and this court has jurisdiction under.
discussion 
in its order denying cadle motion for summary judgment,the court acknowledged that the motion hinges on its contention that the former law partnership had a right to the entire legal fee derived from the second groton escrow account.the cadle schlichtmann,conway,crowley hugo,wl,at.the court then reasoned that t he only way it could potentially lay claim to this amount is if all compensable legal work required to gain access to the second escrow account had been completed at the time of the law firm dissolution in october.id.the court observed that the settlement agreement required additional work by plaintiffs lawyers,schlichtmann performed that work,and he performed it in his individual capacity,rather than on behalf of the firm.he was,therefore,entitled to compensation.see id.the court concluded that cadle security interest only extends to that portion of the groton fee,if any,that belongs to the dissolved partnership.id.
the fundamental error in this analysis is that it ignores the source of schlichtmann entitlement to the groton fee.the fee to which schlichtmann laid claim came out of the distribution from the groton settlement and became payable by only by the fee agreement between the now dissolved firm and the groton plaintiffs.the distribution of settlement proceeds form clearly shows an allocation of attorneys fees plus for litigation consultation.it is unquestioned that this amount became payable by reason of the fee agreement between the firm and the plaintiffs.thus,when schlichtmann began to work for the plaintiffs after the dissolution,he simply took over the firm work and carried out what the firm had agreed to do,for which it was to be compensated.
that the firm no longer existed is immaterial to cadle claim.it had a security interest in the entire groton fee as schlichtmann wrote in december,i want to assure you of the bank security in these anticipated fees in the groton case.and that schlichtmann may have taken over the groton engagement and completed the work can not operate to wipe out cadle acknowledged security interest in the fee from that work without the secured party written consent indeed,the security agreement specifically bars disposal of any collateral without the secured party prior written consent.
schlichtmann concedes that cadle holds a security interest in the firm accounts receivable which encompasses any groton fee received by the firm.however,he contends that after the firm dissolved,the firm terminated its representation of the groton clients,and thus left cadle with a security interest in only the fees related to the work the firm performed on the matter prior to its dissolution.agreeing with the district court,schlichtmann characterizes his efforts on the groton case as work performed in his individual capacity,not on behalf of the firm.
however,that the work on the groton matter was performed by schlichtmann does not alter cadle rights as a secured creditor.partners can not eliminate a security interest in the partnership anticipated fees by transferring without the creditor written consent the client files,whether by dissolution of the partnership or otherwise.in pnc bank,delaware berg,wl,the court held that a bank could assert its security interest under article of the uniform commercial code in contingent fee agreements that had been transferred before having matured.there,tighe,cottrell,and in a firm called berg,tighe,cottrell from the firm and opened a new firm called tighe,cottrell logan tighe.the partners in the new firm took with them many client files,including the active files on which tighe,cottrell,and logan had themselves been working.see id.at.pnc bank claimed a continuing security interest in the contingent fee files.in its defense,tighe argued that the security interest was lost as a result of the agreement between berg and tighe in which berg surrendered any interest in the client files in return for tighe relinquishing its interest in the berg firm.see id.at.the court rejected the argument,holding that unless pnc bank authorized this transfer,it retained the right under uniform commercial code to follow the collateral,the contingent fee files.see id.the cou
