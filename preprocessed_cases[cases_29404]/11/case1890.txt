quartz of southern california,quartz sold certain vehicles to a used car dealer,who sold the vehicles to consumers under conditional sale contracts.the dealer sold the contracts to mullen,mullen,a finance company,which paid the dealer in full.the dealer went out of business and failed to pay quartz for the vehicles,so quartz retained the title certificates.in these between quartz and mullen,the trial court issued a declaration that quartz is the lawful owner of the title certificates but refused to order mullen to pay quartz for the certificates.both quartz and mullen appeal.
we affirm that portion of the judgment declaring quartz to be the lawful owner of the title certificates.however,we reverse the portion awarding no money to quartz we remand to the trial court for a calculation of the amount mullen owes to quartz.
most of the facts in this case are undisputed.quartz,doing business as quartz dealer direct,is a licensed wholesale used auto auction.it acquires vehicles from licensed dealers and sells them to other licensed dealers at an auction sale.quartz practice is to accept vehicles from the selling dealers without a title certificate because the title to the vehicle is mostly unavailable at the time that the selling dealer presents the vehicle for sale.that could be because of a lag in getting the payoff to the previous owner of title,but,in any event,the title is not required for the vehicle itself to go through the auction.
quartz would generally require the buying dealer to pay for a vehicle before taking possession.with some dealers,however,quartz had a previous arrangement with that buying dealer to be able to leave the premise s with the vehicle based on a signature agreement to come back and pay for the title when it is available.in that case,the buying dealer would not be obligated to pay for the vehicle until quartz received the title certificate from the selling dealer and contacted the buying dealer.anthony qualin,doing business as mohawk leasing mohawk,was a licensed used car dealer who had such an arrangement with quartz.
mohawk bought the vehicles which are the subject of this dispute from quartz and took possession without paying.with quartz knowledge,mohawk sold each vehicle to a retail buyer as soon as possible after obtaining possession.each buyer financed the purchase through a conditional sale contract.mohawk then sold the contracts to mullen,doing business as mullen finance plan,which paid mohawk the full amount of the agreed price.
quartz paid its selling dealers for all cars and received title certificates to each one.when it notified mohawk that payment was due,it discovered mohawk had gone out of business,leaving a debt to quartz of.quartz refused to release the title certificates to the retail buyers until mullen paid quartz on mohawk behalf.mullen refused to pay quartz but tried to obtain duplicate title certificates for some of the retail buyers who had paid off their indebtedness.mullen was partially successful the department of motor vehicles dmv issued duplicate title certificates to seven of the vehicles without procuring a release from quartz,showing mullen as legal owner.subsequently,quartz agreed to surrender the title certificate to each consumer who paid off his indebtedness while preserving its right to pursue a remedy against mullen.
at trial,quartz proceeded against mullen and the dmv for declaratory relief and against mullen for fraud on its second amended complaint.mullen proceeded against mohawk for negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract and against quartz and the dmv for quiet title and declaratory relief on its first amended.mohawk appeared and stipulated that it owed money to quartz and it would indemnify mullen if mullen was ordered to pay anything to quartz.quartz stipulated it would not seek any monetary recovery from the dmv in return,the dmv stipulated that it would abide by the determination of this court,respecting transfer of registration or title to the vehicle in question herein so long as all parties having an interest are properly given notice of this action.in addition,the dmv must receive the statutorily required documents and fees due in order to process said transfer 
qualin testified that when mohawk sold a vehicle to a retail buyer on credit,he wanted to sell the conditional sale contract to a lender as soon as possible.some lenders insisted mohawk have the title to a vehicle before they would pay for the contract.these lenders typically paid mohawk the face value of the amount owing on the contract.mullen,on the other hand,did not require title but discounted the value of the contract.a discount is when a conditional sales contract has an unpaid balance,meaning the balance that the customer owes plus interest,and the lender,instead of advancing that unpaid balance and making their profit off the interest,advances a lower figure,thereby increasing their profit.consequently,mullen was willing to buy contracts with less creditworthy customers.so mohawk would go to mullen if it did not have the title certificate and needed payment quickly or when it had a customer that the other lenders would not accept.
the court found,mohawk created the problem by not paying quartz when titles arrived.quartz started the situation leading to this dilemma by giving possession of the motor vehicles to mohawk and not stopping mohawk from selling the cars to third persons consumers before the title arrived.mullen should have waited for title to arrive before funding the loan but did,and thus acquired only what mohawk was able to provide as to title.in this case nothing.mullen is now in the position of being an unsecured creditor there was not fraud or illegal intent or actions on the part of mullen as to quartz.
the trial court framed the remaining issue as follows w hether or not,under the facts presented,mullen achieved the status of buyer in the ordinary course and thus defeated the security interest of quartz within the meaning of section of the commercial code.it found that mullen did not act in a commercially reasonable manner when it funded the loans without at least verifying the right to title by mohawk before paying mohawk for the vehicles the record demonstrates that even the department of motor vehicles can not keep up with the volume and pace of cars moving through the industry.the amount of registration information required to be kept by the agency is staggering.when this is coupled with the number of cars being bought and sold every day and when one considers the number of times a particular car changes hands within days,it would be impossible for everyone in the chain to keep up it would have been simple to require mohawk,before getting paid,to provide information as to where mohawk got the motor vehicle and verify,as far as they needed to,that mohawk was entitled to title when it caught up.mullen is not entitled to buyer in the ordinary course status.
the court issued a declaration that as between quartz and mullen,quartz is the lawful holder of title to the disputed vehicles,but quartz was awarded nothing further on its second amended complaint.the court awarded mullen nothing against quartz on its first amended,but ordered mohawk to indemnify mullen for for any money due to quartz.the judgment specifically recited that it does not act as a declaration of the rights of the individual consumers involving their right to possession of,the registration to,the title to or any other right or interest the individual consumer might have involving a motor vehicle that they purchased from mohawk and financed with mullen that was the subject of this litigation.
quartz appeals from the portion of the judgment stating that it take nothing further from mullen on the complaint it also seeks a declaration that the dmv should not have registered mullen as the legal owner of any of the disputed vehicles.mullen appeals from the portion of the judgment declaring quartz the lawful holder of title to the vehicles.
