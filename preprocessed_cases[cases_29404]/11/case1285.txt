order and amended opinion 
the opinion filed on april,is amended as follows 
on slip opinion page,line,beginning with sales and ending line with from regulated transactions.delete and replace with the following 
sales of pseudoephedrine that are not ordinary,however,may be regulated transactions,because they are not necessarily included in the exemption from regulated transactions.
on slip opinion page,line,after exemption from regulated transactions.insert the following footnote 
the definition of regulated transaction generally allows the attorney general to establish a threshold amount for a specific listed chemical.a.section a iv ii provided at the time of kim offense the threshold for any sale of products containing pseudoephedrine products by retail distributors or by distributors required to submit reports by section b of this title shall be grams of pseudoephedrine in a single transaction.
at the time of the relevant transactions in this case,the attorney general had not established single transaction thresholds for retail sales of pseudoephedrine,but he has done so since then.compare f with f.the details of the quantity or quality of pseudoephedrine that must be recorded and reported are not dispositive in this case and the statute has been amended recently,see infra note,so we do not address the recording and reporting requirements further.
on slip opinion page,line,beginning with alternatively,sales of grams and ending line with grams or more.delete and replace with the following 
additionally,sales of grams or more of pseudoephedrine were automatically subject to the recording requirements of.a iv ii.the upshot is that sales of pseudoephedrine had to be recorded if the items purchased totaled grams or more and were not in blister packs or were in packages of more than three grams per package.
with these amendments,the panel has voted to deny the petition for rehearing.the petition for rehearing is denied.no further petitions for rehearing or for rehearing en banc may be filed.
pseudoephedrine,a listed chemical under a federal drug statute,k,is an ingredient in many cold medications.it can also be used to manufacture methamphetamine,a controlled substance under.both the united states and california have statutes prohibiting sales of drugs containing pseudoephedrine in certain instances.see c cal.health safety code a e.
this case concerns the conviction of the proprietor of a small pharmacy for selling cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine.jae gab kim was convicted of violating c,which prohibits the distribution of listed chemicals,including pseudoephedrine,knowing,or having reasonable cause to believe,that the pseudoephedrine will be used to manufacture a controlled substance.he argues that,because drugs containing pseudoephedrine can be legally sold over the counter and there is no bright line in the law demarcating a legal sale from an illegal sale,the law allowing conviction upon reasonable cause to believe is unconstitutionally vague.we have previously held that c contains a mens rea requirement.with that mens rea standard,the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.we therefore affirm kim conviction.
background 
kim owned and operated the san jacinto pharmacy.after receiving information about the law regarding the sale of pseudoephedrine from an industry newsletter,kim instructed his clerk,virginia garcia,not to sell more than pills per person,per day.kim believed that sales under this quantity were legal.
kim purchased drugs containing pseudoephedrine from bergen brunswig.in may,the drug enforcement administration dea received a report from bergen brunswig that kim purchases of drugs containing pseudoephedrine had sharply increased 
the dea began an investigation of kim,sending undercover agents to purchase cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine from his pharmacy.two transactions are relevant to this appeal on january,three undercover agents entered kim pharmacy.kim was standing in an elevated section at the rear of the pharmacy,filling prescriptions.kim nodded and smiled at the three agents.the agents attempted to purchase all the packages of cold medication on display.after garcia started to tell the agents that one person could not buy all the medication,kim interjected to ask what was going on and who was buying what.kim instructed them to return some of the medication so that his stock would not be depleted.the three agents returned some of the boxes and divided the remainder for purchase.ultimately,the agents were each allowed to purchase two boxes of tablets and one box of tablets,for a total of around grams of pseudoephedrine.additionally,in kim presence and conspicuously,the men inquired about and purchased hydrogen peroxide,iodine,and rubbing alcohol,all of which are used to manufacture methamphetamine.one of the men mumbled,in connection with the purchase of alcohol,that he needed alcohol to break it down.one of the agents provided all the money for the purchases,although the purchases were rung up separately.there were confusing statements as to whether the person who supplied the money was holding the others money for them or,instead,paying for all the purchases himself.
as garcia was completing the transaction,one of the agents asked,can we get some more of this tomorrow garcia answered,well hopefully.kim,however,answered,we not selling every day.he added that the purchase lasts for you,normally.
the next day,january,the same three undercover officers returned to the pharmacy.kim again nodded to them as they entered.although the officers assumed that he recognized them,there is no direct evidence that he did.one officer attempted to purchase multiple bottles of pseudoephedrine.again,garcia would not allow this sale to proceed.she did,however,allow each man to purchase one bottle.as on the previous day,one officer held all the money initially and handed it to the other two so they could pay for their pseudoephedrine.afterwards,the officers also each purchased two boxes of pseudoephedrine,for a total of about grams each.kim was not involved in this transaction,but he was in the store at the time.
kim was indicted for violating c for distributing a listed chemical when the merchant knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the chemical will be used to manufacture illicit drugs at trial,at the close of the government,the district court granted kim motion for judgment of acquittal on three counts.the jury found kim not guilty of another count.the district court later granted a judgment of acquittal as to yet another count.in the end,kim was convicted only on counts six and seven,covering the incidents described above.
both after the government and after the jury returned its verdict,kim challenged the vagueness of the statute under which he was indicted.the district court denied both motions.kim was sentenced to five months incarceration,three years supervised which he was to spend five months in home a fine.we were informed at oral argument that he lost his pharmacist license as a result of the convictions.
ii.state and federal law 
the federal statute under which kim was convicted provides that a ny person who knowingly or intentionally possesses or distributes a listed chemical knowing,or having reasonable cause to believe,that the listed chemical will be used to manufacture a controlled substance except as authorized by this subchapter shall be fined or imprisoned,or both.c.the federal law also contains a requirement that sales of certain packages of pseudoephedrine be recorded the recording statute contains a confusing maze of rules,exceptions to the rules,and exceptions to the exceptions.first,e ach regulated person who engages in a regulated transaction involving a listed chemical shall keep a record of the transaction for two years after the date of the transaction.a.not all sales of listed chemicals,however,are considered regulated transactions.a ny sale of ordinary pseudoephedrine by retail distributors shall not be a regulated transaction.a iv i aa.sales of pseudoephedrine that are not ordinary,however,may be regulated transactions,because they are not necessarily included in the exemption from regulated transactions with respect to pseudoephedrine in particular,
the term ordinary pseudoephedrine product means any product containing pseudoephedrine sold in package sizes of not more than grams of pseudoephedrine base that is packaged in blister packs,each blister containing not more than two dosage units,or where the use of blister packs is technically infeasible,that is packaged in unit dose packets or pouches.
b i additionally,sales of grams or more of pseudoephedrine were automatically subject to the recording requirements of.a iv ii.the upshot is that sales of pseudoephedrine had to be recorded if the items purchased totaled grams or more and were not in blister packs or were in packages of more than three grams per package 
california makes it a felony for people to sell certain substances with knowledge or the intent that the recipient will use the substance to unlawfully manufacture a controlled substance.cal.health safety code a.the prohibited substances,which include pseudoephedrine,are listed in california health and safety code section a,which also requires merchants to report sales of regulated substances the california reporting statute,section,incorporates federal law by exempting from its reporting requirements those transactions involving chemicals lawfully sold,transferred,or furnished over the counter without a prescription pursuant to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act et or regulations adopted thereunder.cal.health safety code e a.the california statute,however,specifically does not exempt from its reporting requirement sales where the individual transaction involves more than three packages or nine grams of pseudoephedrine.id.thus,a pharmacist who sells more than nine grams of pseudoephedrine must report the sale to the california government,whereas a pharmacist who sells less must only report the sale to california if the drugs were sold in violation of the federal category which would include,as we have noted,sales made knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the purchase of drugs would be used to manufacture methamphetamine.
the upshot is that neither state nor federal law specifies any safe harbor amount of pseudoephedrine that may be sold over the counter.instead,the seller actual or imputed knowledge that the chemical will be used to manufacture methamphetamine is determinative of criminal liability,regardless of the amount sold.
a.the interaction between recording and reporting requirements and criminal liability 
kim sold quantities below the per se reporting limits of the california statute,never selling to the undercover dea agents more than three packages or nine grams of pseudoephedrine during a single transaction.kim argues that because the california provision makes a sale of nine grams otherwise authorized,he did not have adequate notice that a sale of less than nine grams could subject him to federal prosecution we reject kim claim.
first,kim points to no support for his assumption that the federal statute exempts from criminal liability transactions permitted under state law.there is no provision in the federal law providing a safe harbor for transactions otherwise authorized the term is entirely of kim own construction.furthermore,unless a federal law states otherwise,state law can not empower a citizen to act contrary to a federal prohibition.see united states moore,cir en banc.
second,kim appears to have confused the reporting requirements under california law with the criminal liability standards.the california provision does not authorize single transactions of less than nine grams.as noted above,the california law requires merchants to report to the california department of justice transactions involving sales of certain chemicals.a merchant need not report a lawful under federal law sale of less than nine grams he or she must report a sale of more than nine grams,whether or not lawful under federal law the standard is thus significant for the purposes of california law only because it delineates those sales that must automatically be reported from those that may not need to be reported.
the california felony provision covering sales of pseudoephedrine,in contrast,contains no dosage safe harbor.section a,the criminal liability provision,makes it a felony conviction to sell certain chemicals with knowledge or the intent that those chemicals will be used to manufacture illicit drugs.a sale of any quantity can violate california law if it is entered into with the requisite mental state the quantity is irrelevant except as circumstantial evidence of intent.although kim allowed the undercover agents to purchase only quantities of pseudoephedrine below the per se reporting requirement of the california statute,he was not necessarily acting within the bounds of state law by consummating the sale for those quantities.
kim argues that there is inadequate notice of where and how the line is drawn to indicate when an sale that is otherwise authorized becomes one that is unlawful.as noted above,however,kim sales were not authorized by the california statute,although they were not explicitly prohibited either the mens rea requirement was determinative.
third,kim arguments based solely on federal law fare no better.he contends that because pseudoephedrine is legally sold for personal use,he must have protection against criminal liability under federal law for those personal use sales that are below the level at which they must be recorded.pointing to provisions of federal law that mention legitimate medical use and personal use,a b,kim contends that other than limiting the dosage level,there is nothing in the law to provide a retail distributor with assurance or guidance as to what is required for his sales to be deemed sales for legitimate medical use.
kim is correct that,under federal law,a retail distributor is one who engages in sales for personal use,which are sales for legitimate medical purposes.he forgets,however,that retail distributors are only exempted from the definition of regulated transaction which triggers the recording requirements of when they sell not more than grams of pseudoephedrine base that is packaged in blister packs,each blister containing not more than two dosage units,or where the use of blister packs is technically infeasible,that is packaged in unit dose packets or pouches.b i.
kim is therefore correct that a rule exists establishing a threshold for sales of pseudoephedrine this rule,however,applies only to the recording requirements and not to the criminal liability provision.the criminal liability provision contains no to the recording requirements,nor does it include the terms legitimate medical use or personal use.whether the sale was for a legitimate medical purpose within the meaning of the recording requirement is therefore technically irrelevant to the criminal liability provision at issue here.in practical terms,however,when a pharmacist knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a quantity of pseudoephedrine will be used for the production of methamphetamine,that is not a legitimate medical use 
in any event,whether or not kim had to report the sales he entered into with the undercover dea agents to the attorney general,he could still be subject to criminal prosecution if those sales violated c.kim criminal liability instead turns on whether he kn e w or ha d reasonable cause to believe that his conduct would lead to manufacture of illicit drugs.c.as is true with other criminal statutes,conduct is prohibited not solely because of its objective contours,but because of the defendant state of mind regarding such an effect.there is no quantity threshold exempting a merchant from criminal liability under c.
vagueness and mens rea 
kim argues that,construed as containing no quantity threshold,the statute is unconstitutionally vague because it does not provide a reasonably intelligent person with sufficient notice concerning whether he is violating it.essentially,he argues that absent designation of a safe harbor amount that he may sell to each individual each day,he can not be expected to conform his behavior to legal requirements and thus av
