introduction 
the insurers and the insured dispute whether the insurers providing advertising injury coverage had a duty to defend the insured in a trademark infringement action and to indemnify the insured in connection with that action.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers based on the prior publication exclusion in the applicable policies.
on appeal,the insured asserts that the insurers had a duty to defend it in the underlying trademark infringement action because of the possibility that the prior publication exclusion did not apply based on the following theories i the prior publication exclusion does not apply to a trademark infringement but rather is limited to libel,slander,and invasion of privacy claims ii the word material used in the policy definition of advertising injury renders the prior publication exclusion inapplicable to the trademark infringement claims in this case and iii the prior publication exclusion does not apply because the trademarked words in question used prior to the policy period were used with different words and a new logo during the term of the policy.we hold that the prior publication exclusion applies to the trademark infringement claims in this case.

discussion 
applicable legal principles and standard of review 
the california supreme court has stated,if any facts stated or fairly inferable in the complaint,or otherwise known or discovered by the insurer,suggest a claim potentially covered by the policy,the insurer duty to defend arises and is not extinguished until the insurer negates all facts suggesting potential coverage.on the other hand,if,as a matter of law,neither the complaint nor the known extrinsic facts indicate any basis for potential coverage,the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance.scottsdale ins.mv transportation cal th,d.
if a policy provision is ambiguous,we resolve the ambiguity in the insured favor,consistent with the insured reasonable expectations.davis farmers ins.group th,d.nevertheless,it is settled that a potential for coverage can not be based on an unresolved legal dispute concerning policy interpretation which is ultimately resolved in favor of the insurer.lebas fashion imports of usa,itt hartford ins.group th,d lebas.
in determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and therefore a duty to defend,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.citations.county of san diego ace property casualty ins.cal th,d.moreover,in considering a summary judgment concerning the duty of an insurer to defend the insured in an action,we conduct a de novo review.cunningham universal underwriters th,d.
policy coverage 
under the policies,advertising injury includes misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business or infringement of copyright,title or slogan.in lebas,supra,th at page,d,the court in interpreting a clause identical to that in the instant case,held that notwithstanding any ambiguity,w hen read in light of the fact that a trademark infringement could reasonably be considered as one example of a misappropriation,and taking into account that a trademark could reasonably be considered to be part of either an advertising idea or a style of doing business,it would appear objectively reasonable that advertising injury coverage could now extend to the infringement of a trademark.see milone and mcguinness,insurance coverage for trademark infringement lawsuit ins.coverage bull.a majority of courts have held that the standard definition of advertising injury contained in standard comprehensive general liability policies covers trademark infringement claims.accordingly,unless an exclusion applies,the policies would cover the injury here.
prior publication exclusion 
the prior publication exclusion in the policies bars coverage for advertising injury that arises out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication of material took place before the beginning of the policy period.
application of exclusion to trademark infringement 
kim seng contends that the exclusion clause only applies to libel,slander and invasion of privacy and not to trademark infringement.in the primary policy,advertising injury applies to four subparts.the first two are a oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels and b oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy.italics added.but the third,c,covers misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business and the fourth,d,covers infringement of copyright,title or slogan.the umbrella policy has similar language.the latter two subparts implicate trademark violations.the exclusion in the policies applies to advertising arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.italics added.kim seng argument is that because the exclusion uses the words oral or written publication,it only refers to injuries arising from an oral or written publication that constitutes defamation or violation of the right of privacy.courts have come to different conclusions on this issue.compare irons home builders,insurance,irons home builders the language of the exclusion mimics the provisions of the policy that relate to advertising injury involving libel,slander,and invasion of privacy and limits the scope of the exclusion to those actions adolfo house distributing travelers property and casualty insurance d followed irons home builders arnette optic illusions,itt hartford group,d,disapproved by united national insurance spectrum worldwide,cir spectrum with spectrum,supra,policy interpretation is a question of california law,and the exclusion language that was identical to that in the instant case clearly and explicitly applies to a trademark infringement action applied bolting technology products,united states fidelity guaranty company,applied bolting the exclusion must be read to apply to the entire definition of advertising injury matagorda ventures,travelers lloyds insurance company d followed applied bolting see also cincinnati insurance pestco,d language at least is ambiguous such that it should be interpreted against the insurer and in favor of coverage.
we believe the exclusion does apply to trademark infringement actions and is not limited to defamation and right of privacy actions.in the policies,the term advertising injury is surrounded by quotation marks,and it appears with quotation marks in the prior publication exclusion.four,not two,actionable elements are expressly set forth in the policy to define advertising injury.the prior publication exclusion bars coverage for advertising injury a rising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.this exclusion means that advertising injury has the same meaning when used in the exclusion that it has every other time it appears in the policy enclosed in quotation marks.the exclusion should be read to give effect to the plain meaning of advertising injury.
that some of the language in the exclusion happens to match some of the words in subparts a and b of the definition of advertising injury but not match some of the language in subparts c and d does not appear to be of any significance.accordingly,the prior publication exclusions apply to all of the actionable conduct listed in the definition of advertising injury,which would include trademark infringements.just because there is a split of authority on this issue does not create an ambiguity or a potential of coverage that requires a duty to defend.see spectrum,supra,at mackinnon truck insurance exchange cal th,d,acl technologies,northbrook property and casualty insurance company th,fn,d lebas,supra,th at,d.
material in the exclusion 
kim seng argues that the word material used in the prior publication exclusion means something tangible such as packaging.according to kim seng,the prior publication exclusion refers to a prior publication of the same advertising material the same packaging or a particular trademark it does not refer to a prior publication of the same right or trademark.thus,kim seng argues that even if the trademark in question was first used on different packaging before the policy period,the packaging or material changed during the policy period.thus,there was no prior publication of the new material.
although the policy does not define material,there is nothing to suggest that material requires a tangible object,such as packaging,and that the exclusion is limited to a trade dress claim.see aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee th,d trade dress involves appearance or image of goods or services as offered for sale in the marketplace and includes the appearance of labels,wrappers,and containers used in packaging a product.as we have discussed,advertising coverage includes trademark infringement actions.it is the infringing trademark that is the material covered by the prior publication exclusion.it would make no sense for the exclusion to apply only to th
