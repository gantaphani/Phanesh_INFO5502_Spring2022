quik payday,which used the internet in making loans,appeals from the district court rejection of its constitutional challenge to the application of kansas statute to those loans.defendants were judi stork,kansas acting bank commissioner,and kevin glendening,deputy commissioner of the state office of the state bank commission osbc,both in their official capacities.
quik payday argues that applying the statute runs afoul of the dormant commerce clause by regulating conduct that occurs wholly outside kansas,unduly burdening interstate commerce relative to the benefit it confers,and imposing kansas requirements when internet commerce demands nationally uniform regulation.we disagree.the kansas statute,as interpreted by the state officials charged with its enforcement,does not regulate extraterritorial conduct this court precedent informs us that the statute burden on interstate commerce does not exceed the benefit that it confers and quik payday argument,which is merely a species of a argument,is not persuasive in the context of the specific regulation of commercial activity at issue in this case.we have jurisdiction under and affirm the district court.
background 
from through early,appellant quik payday was in the business of making modest,personal loans,also called payday loans.it maintained an internet website for its loan business.the prospective borrower typically found this website through an internet search for payday loans or was steered there by lead generators,a term used for the intermediaries that solicit consumers to take out these loans.in some instances quik payday sent solicitations by directly to previous borrowers.
once on quik payday website,the prospective borrower completed an online application form,giving quik payday his or her home address,birthdate,employment information,state driver license number,number,social security number,and references.if quik payday approved the application,it electronically sent the borrower a loan contract,which the borrower signed electronically and sent back to quik payday.in a small number of cases these last few steps took place through facsimile,with approved borrowers physically signing the contracts before faxing them back to quik payday.quik payday then transferred the amount of the loan to the borrower bank account.
quik payday made loans of to,in increments.the loans carried finance charges for each borrowed.the borrower either paid back the loans by the maturity,the borrower next extended them,incurring an additional finance charge of for every borrowed.
quik payday was headquartered in logan,utah.it was licensed by utah department of financial institutions to make payday loans in utah.it had no offices,employees,or other physical presence in kansas.
between may and january,quik payday made payday loans to borrowers who provided kansas addresses in their applications.quik payday loaned these borrowers approximately in principal and charged some in fees it collected in principal and fees.when a kansas borrower defaulted,quik payday engaged in informal collection activities in kansas but never filed suit.
kansas regulates consumer lending,including payday lending,under its version of the uniform consumer credit code.see.stat.ann.through kuccc.the kuccc defines payday loans,or supervised loans,as those on which the annual percentage interest rate exceeds.id.under the kuccc a payday lender other than a supervised financial essence,a bank with a federal or state charter,see id.must obtain a license from the head of the division of the osbc before it can make supervised loans in kansas.see id.obtaining a license requires paying an application fee of and a further to renew each year,posting a surety bond costing approximately per year,and submitting to a and credit check,for which there is no fee.supervised lenders may not charge more than per annum on unpaid loan balances of or less,and may not charge more than per annum on unpaid balances of more than.see id.supervised lenders are required to schedule installment payments in substantially equal amounts and at substantially regular intervals on loans of less than and on which the finance charge exceeds.id.when such loans are for or less,they must be payable within months,while such loans of more than must be payable within months.id.a b.quik payday was never licensed to make supervised loans by the osbc.
in kansas amended the provision of the kuccc that governs the statute territorial application.see id.before that year a transaction was deemed to have been made in th e state,and to come under the kuccc,if either a the creditor received in kansas a signed writing evidencing the consumer obligation or offer,or b the creditor induces the consumer who is a resident of this state to enter into the transaction by solicitation in this state.sess.laws ch.the legislation amended paragraph b to say that the transaction is deemed to have been made in kansas if the creditor induces the consumer who is a resident of this state to enter into the transaction by solicitation in this state by any means,including but not limited to mail,telephone,radio,television or any other electronic means.stat.ann.b emphasis added.no party or amicus questions that the other electronic means includes the internet.
under the kuccc a consumer residence is the address given by the consumer as his or her address in any writing signed by the consumer in connection with a credit transaction.id.the statute does not define solicitation.defendants conceded in district court,however,that merely maintaining a website accessible in kansas that advertises payday loans is not solicitation in kansas under b.see quik payday,stork,d.
in june the osbc received a complaint from a kansas consumer about a loan transaction with quik payday.the agency responded by ordering quik payday,which was not on its list of licensed supervised lenders,to produce documents regarding its loans to kansas residents.quik payday submitted the requested documents,which revealed the payday loans to kansas residents.on march,the osbc issued a summary order that required quik payday to stop all payday lending to kansas residents,halt any collections on outstanding loans,pay a civil penalty of million,and return to the borrowers the interest,service fees,and profits from the loans.the order also barred quik payday from applying in the future to become a licensed payday lender in kansas.quik payday timely requested an administrative hearing to challenge the order.
on may,shortly before the scheduled date of the administrative hearing,quik payday filed this lawsuit under against defendants in the united states district court for the district of kansas.quik payday requested and was granted a stay of the administrative hearing as a result,no final order has been entered in that proceeding.quik payday complaint in district court sought a declaratory judgment that kansas could not regulate quik payday loans and an injunction barring such regulation.it claimed that both.stat.ann.b itself and kansas application of its laws to quik payday under this provision of the statute are unconstitutional under the commerce clause and due process clause.
quik payday moved for summary judgment,offering three arguments under the dormant commerce clause the statute is an impermissible extraterritorial regulation the statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce under the balancing test of pike bruce church,d and the statute subjects internet lending to inconsistent state regulations.on the same day,defendants moved for summary judgment on quik payday constitutional claims,including its contentions under the due process clause that kansas lacked the power to regulate it and that.stat.ann.is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.quik payday did not seek summary judgment on these claims.the parties stipulated to the facts to be considered by the district court in deciding their motions.
the district court denied quik payday motion for summary judgment and granted defendants.it rejected each of quik payday three commerce clause challenges to the kansas statute and its application to quik payday.it rejected the contention that kansas was seeking to regulate conduct entirely outside its borders because the kansas statute is triggered only if there is both solicitation in kansas and a loan to one of its residents.quik payday,d at.with regard to pike balancing,the court cited our decision in aldens,ryan,cir,for the proposition that a state regulation of the cost and terms on which its residents borrow money from an creditor is not outweighed by the burdens on interstate commerce.quik payday,d at.and as to national uniformity,the court determined that quik payday had not shown that internet payday lending specifically represents the type of commerce that should only be subject to standards,id.at its regulated conduct was aimed specifically at kansas and did not necessarily implicate other states or their regulations.the court also entered summary judgment for defendants on quik payday claims.id.at.
quik payday appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants and the denial of summary judgment to itself it does not challenge the district court rulings but only those regarding the commerce clause.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.see jacklovich simmons,cir.we will affirm a grant of summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the prevailing party is entitled to judgment under the law.see id.at.c.likewise,we conduct de novo review of legal issues,including challenges to the constitutionality of statutes.see keenan,cir.
a.the dormant commerce clause 
the supreme court long has recognized that th e affirmative grant of authority to congress to regulate interstate commerce also encompasses an implicit or dormant limitation on the authority of the states to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce.healy beer,d see dennis higgins,d t he commerce clause does more than confer power on the federal government it is also a substantive restriction on permissible state regulation of interstate commerce.internal quotation marks omitted.state statutes may violate the dormant limitation in three ways 
first,a statute that clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce is virtually invalid per se and can survive only if the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.second,if the statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce,it will nevertheless be invalidated under the pike at,d balancing test if it imposes a burden on interstate commerce incommensurate with the local benefits secured.third,a statute will be invalid per se if it has the practical effect of extraterritorial control of commerce occurring entirely outside the boundaries of the state in question.
kt g att y of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
although quik payday treats the need for national uniformity as an additional ground for determining that a state law violates the commerce clause,concerns about national uniformity are simply part of the pike balancing analysis.when assessing the burden of a state law on interstate commerce,the practical effect of the statute must be evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the statute itself,but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other states and what effect would arise if not one,but many or every,state adopted similar legislation.healy,at.for example,in southern pacific arizona ex rel.sullivan,the supreme court declared that states may not regulate those phases of the national commerce which,because of the need of national uniformity,demand that their regulation,if any,be prescribed by a single authority.id.at.but its holding that a state law could not limit train lengths was supported by what amounts to pike,a thorough analysis of the problems that would be created for interstate railroad transportation if each state could regulate train lengths and an assessment that such state regulation would confer little,if any,local benefit.id.at.aclu johnson,cir t he supreme court has long recognized that certain types of commerce are uniquely suited to national,as opposed to state,regulation.
quik payday does not argue that the kansas statute discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of the local variety.rather,it challenges the kansas statute only under the and tests.to the extent that it also argues what it terms the national unity test,we will treat that issue as part of the balancing process.
extraterritoriality 
quik payday argues that the kansas statute regulates interstate commerce that happens entirely outside kansas.it contends that the kansas statute reaches cases in which a kansas resident is solicited while using a work computer in missouri and accepts the loan through the same computer.in support,it points to census data on the number of kansas residents who work in metropolitan kansas city,missouri,and thus likely use computers that lie in missouri.additionally,it asserts that lenders,having no ability to determine the physical location of the consumer at the time of the solicitation,are forced as a practical matter to abide by the k u ccc for all transactions with kansas residents or refuse to lend to such residents altogether.aplt.br.at.
defendants,however,have stipulated that such a transaction would not be governed by the kansas statute.in district court they conceded that a website advertisement does not trigger application of.stat.ann.b,even though the website is accessible in kansas.see quik payday,d at.their brief in this court further clarified that the borrower physical location at the time of the solicitation is controlling it states that t he kuccc regulates the conduct of internet payday lenders who choose to make payday loans with kansas consumers while they are in kansas.aplee.br.at emphasis added.and referring to quik payday hypothetical about a kansas consumer leaving kansas to acquire a payday loan,id.at,it declared that the osbc would not try to apply the kuccc to loans that occur under th ose circumstances,id.at.we adopt this reasonable interpretation of the statute by those charged with its enforcement.see vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d in evaluating a facial challenge to a state law,a federal court must,of course,consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.
quik payday argues,however,that in practice the kuccc will set the rules by which a payday lender deals with a kansas resident,even if the transaction is conducted wholly outside kansas.according to quik payday,this result follows from its inability to tell where the resident is located during internet communications between quik payday and the resident.for example,it says,if a kansas resident communicates with quik payday via his office computer in missouri,quik payday will have to assume that the customer is actually in kansas during the communications and it therefore will have to comply with the kuccc.in our view,however,quik payday has failed to show that this possible extraterritorial effect of the statute is more than speculation.it has provided no evidence of any loan transaction with a kansas resident that was effected totally outside kansas.even if the kansas resident applied for the loan on a computer in missouri,other aspects of the transaction are very likely to be in,the transfer of loan funds to the borrower would naturally be to a bank in kansas.although the kansas statute would not apply to such a loan transaction because the solicitation was not in kansas,the transaction would not be wholly extraterritorial,and thus not problematic under the dormant commerce clause.moreover,quik payday has not explained how it would be burdensome to it simply to inquire of the customer in which state he is located while communicating with quik payday.in this circumstance,we will not hold that the kuccc has a prohibited effect on extraterritorial commerce.
we note,however,that despite the failure of its constitutional challenge to the statute,quik payday may s
