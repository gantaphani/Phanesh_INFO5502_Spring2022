opinion of the court 
this appeal by charles stanziale,the chapter trustee the trustee of debtor tower air,presents a question of first impression for us whether a secured creditor in a chapter bankruptcy may recover the insurance proceeds intended to pay for damage to its collateral,while retaining the fully repaired collateral.we conclude that,under the circumstances of this case,it can.more specifically,we are satisfied that,under the language of section of the arizona uniform commercial code ucc in effect at the relevant times,appellee finova capital corporation,as an undersecured and creditor,is entitled to recover both the collateral an aircraft engine and the proceeds.this conclusion is also supported by the language of the controlling agreements between tower and finova,which grant finova a right of approval over any use of insurance proceeds and by the fact that the insurance documents conferred upon finova the status of a mortgagee payee,and not a mere loss payee.finally,we reject the trustee contention that the equitable exception of b of the bankruptcy code applies to prevent this result.we will therefore affirm the order of the district court,which affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court awarding some in insurance proceeds to finova.
on may,tower,a airline,borrowed million from finova to finance the purchase of a boeing and four aircraft engines.in connection with this transaction,tower entered a series of a security agreement,a promissory note,and a finova a security interest in the financed collateral,including the aircraft engine at issue in this case.the agreements specified that insurance proceeds of the engines were part of finova collateral tower also covenanted to maintain insurance on the aircraft,and to submit any plans for use of insurance proceeds to finova for approval 
finova also financed a number of tower other purchases,and had agreements on all of those borrowings.under these agreements,finova collateral for previous loans would become collateral for the may loan,and the may collateral including the engine would become collateral for the previous loans 
finova perfected its security interest by filing ucc financing statements with the state of new york and with queens county,and by filing the mortgage with the faa both the financing statements and the mortgage explicitly provide for a security interest in any insurance proceeds arising from the aircraft and engines.
on august,the engine at issue in this appeal was severely damaged in an accident.tower fully repaired the engine at a total cost of,of which was directly attributable to the accident.
on february,tower filed a voluntary chapter petition in the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.tower operated as a until december,when it converted to chapter.charles stanziale,who had been the chapter trustee,was appointed chapter trustee.finova claims that,at the time of the bankruptcy,tower owed finova some million under various loan agreements collateralized by,among other assets,the engine at issue here.during the bankruptcy proceedings in,the engine was returned to finova,in partial satisfaction of finova secured claim.some of finova other collateral was apparently destroyed or impaired by tower,but there is no dispute that the engine was returned in fully repaired condition.finova contends that the total value of all returned collateral was some million,leaving it undersecured by some million.
in performing his due diligence,the trustee discovered that tower maintained an accident insurance policy on the engine.he therefore submitted a claim for to the insurers.the insurers agreed to settle the claim for claim amount minus the policy million may.the trustee then filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking approval to enter the settlement.finova timely objected,claiming that it,not the estate,was entitled to the insurance proceeds.the bankruptcy court approved the settlement,but directed the trustee to hold the funds in escrow pending a decision on this issue.

the parties agree that this dispute is governed by arizona law,as provided by paragraph of the security agreement.
iii.the ucc provisions 
this case turns primarily on the provisions of the arizona ucc that govern a creditor rights to the proceeds of his collateral the default rule is that a security interest in property includes an interest in the proceeds of that property.c unless otherwise agreed a security agreement gives the secured party the rights to proceeds provided by.the parties here did not opt out of this default rather,they explicitly granted finova a security interest in proceeds in the mortgage.the trustee argues,however,that this security interest does not give finova a right to the disputed insurance money,because that money is not proceeds properly understood,and because awarding it to finova would constitute a double recovery forbidden by the ucc.we consider each of these contentions in turn.
a.the meaning of proceeds 
our starting point is perforce ucc,which defines the term proceeds and governs a secured creditor rights to the proceeds of his collateral.the relevant parts of this section are set forth in the margin the definition of proceeds is found in subsection a,the first sentence of which defines the term to include whatever is received upon the sale,exchange,collection or other disposition of collateral or proceeds.a.the following sentence reads insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral is proceeds,except to the extent that it is payable to a person other than a party to the security agreement.id.
the plain language of a leaves no doubt that the insurance money at issue here constitutes proceeds of the engine,because it was i nsurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral.finova,by perfecting its security interest in the engine,was entitled to look to those proceeds as collateral under b.under b,prepetition security interests that apply to proceeds of collateral also apply to proceeds of such collateral acquired after the bankruptcy petition.it is undisputed that finova had perfected its security interest in the engine prior to tower bankruptcy.finova interest in those proceeds was therefore also perfected,because tower had not received them prior to entering bankruptcy.see.d.
the trustee argues that the first sentence of a,which requires a sale,exchange,collection or other disposition of property,limits the definition of proceeds to encompass only the results of a transforming event.under this view,a creditor can obtain the proceeds only as a substitute for the original collateral,not as an addition to it.but this interpretation is contradicted by the clear language of the second sentence insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral is proceeds,and we have found no case that supports it 
we are also confident that the arizona courts would reject the trustee view.the arizona court of appeals has read the second sentence of a independently of the first and held that the meaning of the second sentence of a is clear on its face,and that the right to payment under an insurance policy constitutes proceeds subject to article of the ucc.valley bank of cotton growers hail.we note too that airwork markair express,in re markair,cir,a ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel case,assumed,though it did not directly hold,that a secured creditor could be entitled to keep both a repaired aircraft engine and the insurance proceeds thereof.
we therefore are not convinced that a limits the definition of proceeds to encompass only those proceeds that entirely replace collateral.instead,it is quite clear that the insurance money at issue here constitutes proceeds under the ucc definition.
b.the limitation to one recovery 
we acknowledge that there is significant intuitive appeal to the notion that a creditor should not be able to recover both his collateral and the proceeds thereof.such a situation bears a resemblance to a double recovery.the ucc provides that the secured party may claim both proceeds and collateral,but may of course have only one satisfaction.cmt.thus,while we have decided that the insurance money constitutes proceeds,we must conduct a further inquiry before deciding conclusively that finova is entitled to recover it.finova has a claim to any proceeds of its collateral under ucc and b,but that claim may be superseded by the ucc limitation to one satisfaction.we examine that limitation below,both in the general case and as applied to creditors.we also draw an analogy to the case in which the collateral is sold,rather than damaged,and use the courts treatment of sale proceeds to inform our treatment of insurance proceeds.
the meaning of one satisfaction 
it is perfectly evident that the creditor recovery is limited by the amount of its debt a creditor who lends secured by an engine with a fair market value of can not recover both the engine at its full value and any insurance proceeds on it.this is the minimum meaning of comment.it is equally clear that the creditor security interest is limited by the amount of its collateral a creditor who lends secured only by an engine with a value of is secured only for the remaining of its debt will be only an unsecured claim in bankruptcy.see a.
the difficult case is where the value of the original collateral plus proceeds exceeds the value of the original collateral,but is less than the amount of the debt.in that case,may the creditor recover the collateral and proceeds limited only by the amount of its debt,or is it limited to the value of its original collateral this is a vexing question,and one that does not seem to have been directly decided on the one hand,the debtor might argue that the creditor security interest is limited to the value of the collateral,not of the claim.giving the insurance payment to the creditor would arguably create a larger security interest than the creditor bargained for,and thus lead to a windfall.on the other hand,the plain language of the ucc gives the creditor a security interest in proceeds of the collateral.the creditor windfall is no different from a situation in which the collateral market value increases the creditor simply gets the benefit of all increases in value of the those increases come by appreciation or by insurance to the total value of the claim.
because finova,and other facts specific to the case at bar,are enough for finova to recover,we need not decide this question in the general case 
finova loans to tower were that is,under the may,agreements between tower and finova,numerous tower assets became collateral for numerous loans by finova.in finova submission,tower owed finova some million when it filed for bankruptcy,and returned collateral worth million,leaving some million still due.much of finova collateral was apparently damaged or impaired due to tower negligence.
the result of this is that the original value of finova collateral was not merely the original value of the aircraft engine at issue in this case.instead,finova had numerous pieces of collateral collectively worth millions of dollars.much of this collateral was impaired or damaged at some point between the time tower entered the financing agreements and the time the disputed insurance proceeds were paid.this fact is important because it eliminates any concern we might have about giving finova a windfall by allowing it to recover those proceeds.as we note above,there may be some reason to think that the ucc limitation to one satisfaction limits secured creditors to the original value of their collateral,although we will ultimately conclude,based on an analogy to sale proceeds,that the better view is to allow creditors to recover up to the value of their debt,see infra part.but even if we were to limit finova to the original value of its collateral,the fact of means that it will certainly recover less than the original value of all of its collateral.
the effect of the clauses was to make some large quantity of tower assets collateral for all million of its debt to finova if the only impairment to finova collateral were the damage to the engine,and if that damage were fully repaired,then the insurance proceeds would increase the value of the collateral,and create a difficult case,see supra part.but in fact collateral worth millions of dollars was destroyed.thus it is misleading to state that tower returned the collateral at issue here in fully repaired condition.the specific aircraft engine was returned fully repaired,but much other collateral was destroyed,damaged,or subject to liens,and all of this collateral secured the same loans.we therefore should not view the insurance proceeds on one particular engine as increasing the value of that specific piece of collateral,and thus creating a windfall rather,we should view it as only partially compensating for the destruction of several other pieces of collateral.on that view,awarding those proceeds to finova does not create more than one satisfaction,as the overall value of the collateral is still significantly impaired.
the clauses,and the fact that finova other collateral was impaired,leave us satisfied that awarding the insurance proceeds to finova would not create a windfall or a double satisfaction.even if it recovers both the engine and the insurance proceeds,finova will still recover less than its entire debt,and also less than the original value of its collateral.in such circumstances,a double recovery is impossible.
the analogy to sale of collateral 
while few cases directly address the issue of whether a creditor can recover both repaired collateral and the insurance proceeds for damage to that collateral,several courts have examined the situation in which creditors claim both collateral and the sale proceeds of that collateral.because sale and insurance proceeds are governed by the same ucc provisions,see.a,these cases provide a helpful analogy to the present case,and inform our understanding of the meaning of one satisfaction under.
to clarify our discussion,we use a hypothetical case.a creditor lends a debtor,secured by an engine initially worth.the engine value then depreciates to,and the debtor secretly sells it to a third party for.the hypothetical relies on the assumption that the buyer is not a bona fide purchaser or buyer in ordinary course,and has no right to retain the engine.we also assume that the sale price is proceeds,and that the creditor security interest in it is perfected under c d.if the debtor then enters chapter bankruptcy and can not pay its unsecured debts,may the creditor then claim the proceeds from the debtor and proceed against the third party on its perfected security interest in the engine 
the language of b seems clear enough the creditor security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale unless the disposition was authorized by the secured party and also continues in any identifiable proceeds including collections received by the debtor.b.the creditor can thus look to both the sale proceeds and the engine itself in the third party hands.
here again,the creditor may claim both proceeds and collateral,but may of course have only one satisfaction.cmt.the crucial question,in this hypothetical as in the case at bar,is what constitutes a satisfaction.does this comment mean that the creditor may claim both proceeds and collateral,but only receive one of them or does it mean that the creditor may receive both proceeds and collateral,so long as its total recovery is less than the value of its debt 
in our view,it is clear that the creditor may receive both proceeds and collateral,and is limited only to the amount of its debt,not the value of the underlying property.see,taylor rental case,cir interpreting identical florida ucc provision and stating that a creditor may pursue several remedies until the debt is satisfied standard dyeing finishing arma textile printers,civ,wl,when an unauthorized disposition of collateral has occurred,a secured party has numerous cumulative remedies at its disposal it is not forced to elect a single remedy a creditor may pursue several remedies until the debt is satisfied.citation and emphasis omitted fleet capital yamaha motor,wl,frantz first nat.bank trust of wyoming,although a creditor is entitled to only one satisfaction for the underlying debt,he may seek it in different ways.emphasis added.
these cases demonstrate that our hypothetical creditor could recover both collateral and proceeds up to the amount of his debt,and present a clear analogy to the case at bar.in our hypothetical case,the creditor is undersecured because of depreciation in the value of the engine here,the creditor is undersecured because of loss of other collateral specifically covered by clauses.as discussed above,see supra part,the clauses allow finova to treat all of its collateral,and the proceeds thereof,as collateral for all of its debts.thus,by virtue of the loss of its other collateral,finova is in essentially the same situation as our hypothetical creditor whose single piece of collateral has depreciated,and can recover from both the collateral and the proceeds 
the trustee disagrees with this result,citing a bankruptcy court case that holds that a secured claim is limited to the sale price of the collateral where it was sold pursuant to a chapter plan.see in re broomall printing,united fruit produce absolute exterminating in re united fruit produce.we do not think that broomall is applicable here.tower is not in chapter,and far from getting court or creditor approval for the disposition of the collateral,tower repaired it without getting finova contractually required permission.we note that b grants a creditor a continuing interest in both collateral and proceeds unless the creditor authorized the transfer.b the fact of authorization in broomall distinguishes it from the present case.
we thus conclude that,under the arizona ucc as it was in effect at the time relevant to this case,finova was entitled to recover both its collateral and the insurance proceeds from that collateral.
iv.the contractual provisions 
our ucc holding is also supported by several provisions in the agreements between tower and finova,which strengthen finova claim to the insurance proceeds.the first of these is a contract clause that granted finova a right of approval over any use of insurance proceeds the second is the insurance agreement,which gave finova the extensive rights of a mortgagee payee.
finova right of approval 
paragraph a of the security agreement gives finova the right to approve any use of any insurance proceeds by tower,and allows finova the right to,in its sole discretion,apply such proceeds to the satisfaction of the obligations.
it is undisputed that tower repaired the engine without either filing an insurance claim or asking for finova approval.but the contract unequivocally grants finova,not tower,the right to decide how to use any insurance proceeds.finova had the sole discretion to decide to apply the insurance proceeds to the satisfaction of tower debt,rather than to repairing the engine.tower decision to repair the engine,rather than file an insurance claim and get finova approval on the use of the proceeds,deprived finova of the benefit of a.
the bankruptcy court cited pima county acres trust,for the proposition that arizona courts would enforce contract clauses similar to a.the pima county court upheld clauses in a mortgage agreement that allowed the mortgagee to apply any fire insurance proceeds or condemnation awards to the amount of the debt,hold the proceeds as additional security,or release them to the mortgagors,at the mortgagee discretion.at.the mortgagors in that case argued that an award for partial condemnation of the property should have been split between themselves and the mortgagee,because giving the full award to the mortgagee left it oversecured.id.the arizona court rejected this argument and gave the entire award to the mortgagee,requiring it to use the award either as additional security or to reduce the amount of the mortgagors indebtedness.pima county strongly suggests that arizona courts will give secured parties the benefit of their bargain with regard to clauses,even if it leaves them with what might appear to be a recovery greater than their security interest but less than or equal to the amount of the underlying debt.the bankruptcy court correctly took this as an indication that arizona courts would uphold a and let finova decide how to use the insurance proceeds.
finova thus had an interest in the insurance proceeds,payable to it independent of any action including repairs taken by tower.it had the right to approve tower use of the proceeds,and to apply them to its own debt rather than to repairing the engine.the trustee states in his brief that finova made a bad deal with the debtor resulting in finova holding a secured and unsecured claims against the debtor.but in fact it is difficult to see how finova could have made its deal any more bulletproof than this.it bargained for,and received,an absolute right to the insurance proceeds,and the trustee attempts to restrict that right are unavailing 
b.the standard mortgage policy language 
it is well settled,in mainly real property contexts,that certain mortgagees can claim insurance proceeds on their collateral,even when they suffer no loss.see,savarese ohio farmers ins.the cases that so hold depend on the nature of the insurance clause involved.
the bankruptcy court cited one representative example,grange mut.cas.central trust,in which a mortgagee bank sued an insurer who refused to pay out on a fire insurance policy because the mortgagor had,at his own expense,repaired the mortgaged property.the kentucky court stated 
the right of the mortgagee under a standard mortgage insurance clause is not dependent upon his sustaining loss.that is,the mortgagee under such a clause acquires a right to the insurance proceeds even though he suffers no actual loss,as when the building was restored to its former condition by the mortgagor.
id.this language applies to mortgagee payees,but not to loss payees.
the difference between mortgagee and loss payees has been spelled out by an arizona court.a loss payee is a mere appointee to receive the proceeds to the extent of his interest.granite state ins.employers mut.ins,quoting appleman,insurance law and practice.in cases the policy is subject to any act or omission of the insured which might void,terminate,or adversely affect the coverage and if the policy is not collectible by the insured,the appointee,likewise,can not recover thereunder.id.quoting appleman,supra.on the other hand,i n contradistinction with a basic loss payee whose rights are totally derivative,a mortgagee payee has an independent agreement with the insurer.id.the mortgagee payee is treated just as if he or she had applied for the insurance entirely independently of the mortgagor.id.at quoting appleman,supra.
the choice of which category the payee falls under depends on the language of the insurance clause a standard or union clause creates a mortgagee payee,while a simple clause creates a loss payee.see lee russ et,couch on insurance,ed hereinafter couch.the main differ
