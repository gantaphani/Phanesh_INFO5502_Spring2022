before us are petitions for review of orders of the federal energy regulatory commission requiring certain crude oil carriers to pay shippers reparations for excessive rates.the contend that ferc went too far,in holding that a joint rate exceeds the just and reasonable rate simply on the basis of a finding about the costs for providing service on one of four segments,where the commission has denied the carrier any opportunity to show that the overall rate did not exceed costs.the contend that ferc did go far enough,in awarding reparations only for complaining shippers in privity with the carrier.we grant the carriers petition,deny the shippers,and remand the case.
i.the carriers petition 
background 
we first explain the regulatory framework for oil pipelines,as well as some shipping terms.
congress passed the interstate commerce act ica in to regulate railroads,also creating the interstate commerce commission to administer the statute.ch,stat.in,it declared the ica applicable to oil pipelines and correspondingly expanded the icc jurisdiction.hepburn act,stat.in,it transferred the icc authority over oil pipelines to the newly created ferc,department of energy reorganization act,b,stat,codified in substance at,and the next year provided that oil pipelines were to be regulated under the version of the ica that prevailed on october,act of,c,stat.accordingly,all references to the ica in this opinion are to the version,which can be found in et,reprinted in app.et.the parties agree that decisions of the icc applying the ica prior to the legislation are treated as if they were ferc decisions,if ferc deviates from such a decision,it must at least justify the deviation as it would a deviation from a decision of its own under greater boston television fcc.
ica,app,requires all rates to be just and reasonable and declares all unjust and unreasonable rates to be unlawful.the statute allows a shipper to challenge as unreasonable any rate,whether already filed and applicable,ica,app,or newly filed,ica,app.from the dawn of federal oil pipeline regulation in up to the,the relevant agencies decided the reasonableness of a rate mainly on the basis of the pipeline individual costs.see association of oil pipe lines ferc,aopl farmers union central exchange ferc,farmers union central exchange ferc.
in congress adopted the energy policy act epact,instructing ferc to issue,within one year of the statute enactment,a final rule which establishes a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines in accordance with section,a,stat,codified at note.ferc carried out this mandate by issuing order,revision to oil pipeline regulations pursuant to the energy policy act of,ferc stats.regs,order on reh g,order,ferc stats.regs,aff,aopl.
order adopts a rate cap system,under which ceiling levels for pipeline rates are adjusted annually on the basis of a formula predicting annual percentage changes in pipeline costs.this system dispenses with intricate calculations of specific pipeline costs.order,ferc stats.regs,at.at.further,whereas fixing rate maximums on the basis of individual pipelines costs tended to deter pipelines from adopting innovations as the regulators would ultimately catch up with any cost reduction and lower the ceiling,the new system counters this tendency a single pipeline cost reduction is unlikely to much affect the index.see flying j,ferc.
under the order,a carrier calculates a ceiling level at the start of each index year which runs from july to june by taking the ceiling level for the previous index year and adjusting it according to the formula.c,d.the original ceiling level from which this process begins is determined either by reference to the rate in effect on december,which became the ceiling for the first six months of,d order,ferc stats.regs,at.at,or,for service going into effect thereafter,the initial rate for such service,d.for such an initial rate,the carrier can choose any figure it wants,so long as it gets the consent of at least one nonaffiliated shipper and no other shipper protests failing that,the pipeline must justify the initial rate on the basis of its individual costs.order,ferc stats.regs,at.at.
a pipeline may raise a rate above the resulting ceiling level,but only if it shows a lack of market power or a substantial divergence between the ceiling level and its individual costs or all customers consent.order,ferc stats.regs,at.at order,ferc stats.regs,at.at.when a rate is changed by one of these methods,the new rate becomes the ceiling level for the index year in which the change occurs.d.
a rate increase that does exceed the ceiling level takes effect with no additional showing from the carrier.a.further,shippers challenges to rates that comply with the challenges under ica to rate changes and under ica to existing subject to special limits requiring the shipper to allege reasonable grounds for asserting a substantial deviation between the challenged rate increase and the pipeline cost increase or between the whole rate and the pipeline costs.c order,ferc stats.regs,at.at 
this discussion of the epact is far from comprehensive.the statute contains at least one other major provision,known as the grandfather clause,that confers special protections on rates that had been in effect one year prior to the statute enactment,in effect on october,and had been the subject of protest,investigation,or complaint during the intervening year.epact,note order,ferc stats.regs,at.at.this grandfathering operates independently of the provisions of order.see,c order,ferc stats.regs,at.at see also order,ferc stats.regs,at.at.if a filed rate protected by the grandfather clause exceeds its ceiling level,the statutory grandfathering trumps.e.here,the grandfather clause is inapplicable,since the parties agree that none of the rates at issue enjoys its protection.big west oil frontier pipeline,ferc,at,wl second order big west oil frontier pipeline,ferc,at,wl first order.
we must also review some shipping terminology.as this court explained in a case on railroads,whose terminology is the same as for oil pipelines 
a through route is an arrangement,express or implied,that provides for the continuous movement of freight over the lines of two or more railroads.there are a variety of methods by which the railroads along a through route may price their services.if they establish a joint rate,shippers pay a specified rate for the shipment over the route and the revenue is divided among the railroads according to an agreed formula,by a contract among the carriers.in the absence of a joint rate,shippers pay a combination rate,which is simply the sum of the individual rates charged by those railroads on the through route.the individual rates which,when aggregated,produce the combination rate may be either local rates,applicable to any shipment between the relevant points served by the particular carrier,or proportional rates,applicable only to that carrier portion of a through movement.
a carrier on a through route that is priced by combination rate is free at any time to modify the local or proportional rate it charges for its portion of the through route,subject to whatever independent legal constraints restrict its choice of rates.by contrast,once a joint rate is established,no carrier may modify it without unanimous agreement from the other participating carriers 
pittsburgh lake erie railroad icc,emphasis added see also seaboard coast line railroad united states,cir commonwealth of pennsylvania icc,metropolitan edison conrail,wl.the local or proportional rates covering the individual movements that constitute a through route are known as intermediate rates of that route.see seaboard coast line railroad,at.
a note about the above taxonomy the phraseology in the discussion of local and proportional rates is potentially misleading,since local describes both a rate that applies only to local traffic,and a rate that applies both to local and through traffic.for rates of the second type to which all the intermediate rates in this case belong,the phrase local and proportional,which occurs often in this proceeding record,is technically inaccurate under the case law but the phrase has the virtue of suggesting that the rates apply to both forms of traffic.trusting that our explanation will prevent a misreading,we join ferc in following the typology of the case law,referring to those rates simply by the name local.
facts of the case 
each of the shippers,big west oil,llc,and chevron products company,owns a refinery in salt lake city,utah.both ship crude oil from the canadian border to their respective refineries over a sequence of four separately owned order of usage express pipeline,llc,frontier pipeline company,anschutz ranch east pipeline,and chevron pipeline company.
during the period in question,each of the four carriers published its own individual referred to as local,proportional,local proportional,or local and proportional that offered the same rate for a movement from the origin of the carrier individual segment to its terminus,regardless of whether the shipment itself started and ended at those points or went all the way from the border to salt lake city.in other words,each carrier was offering a single rate for its segment and was exercising its option to charge through shippers a different rate from local shippers.oral arg.tr.stating,without contradiction in the record excerpts presented to us or in statements of counsel,that each carrier had the right to publish a proportional rate different from the local rate,which right none of them exercised see also second order,ferc at first order,ferc at.thus,it was possible for a shipper to transport oil over the four successive segments by contracting separately with each of the four pipelines and paying each its rate.oral arg.tr,see also express pipeline llc,ferc,at pp,wl cancellation order affidavit of van hoecke at.
in the four pipelines contracted among themselves to give through shippers a discount.under the contract,express published joint tariffs known as the express joint tariffs under which a shipment going all the way from the border to salt lake city would be charged a single joint rate,lower than the sum of the four local rates.cancellation order,ferc at pp.technically,the tariffs offered multiple joint rates,which varied according to shipment characteristics that do concern us,including grade of petroleum and term commitment,express pipeline partnership joint and proportional term rate tariff,supp.unlike the other three pipelines,chevron pipeline did not participate directly in the joint tariff agreement,though it apparently did so indirectly,through a side agreement with frontier and anschutz.cancellation order,ferc at p.
the express joint tariff proposals of complied with texaco pipeline,ferc,wl,a ferc ruling on how it would evaluate joint rate proposals under the ceiling level regime,an issue not explicitly addressed in order.oral arg.tr.in texaco,ferc held that the ceiling level for such a rate is the sum of the ceiling levels associated with individual tariff rates currently on file for the individual movements making up the journey covered by the joint rate.ferc at.the joint rate proposal compliance with texaco is no surprise,since the joint rate as a matter of business could not be greater than the sum of the local rates,and each local rate as a matter of law was required to be no greater than its corresponding ceiling level.as already mentioned,of course,a rate at or below its ceiling may still be found unjust and unreasonable if a shipper can meet the standard specified in order.
c.the ferc proceedings 
the present controversy began in january,when big west brought challenges to frontier and anschutz local tariffs,principally under ica,alleging that both were substantially out of proportion to the individual costs of the respective carriers and thus unreasonable under.first order,ferc at.further,big west challenged the express joint tariff as unreasonable under,first order,ferc at,and included express as a respondent,solely on the ground that express whose local rate the complaint did question was,as a participant in the joint rate,jointly and severally liable for reparations arising from it,id.at big west oil frontier pipeline,ferc,at,wl rehearing order.
on receiving the complaints,ferc reached the conclusion that big west evidence,although confined to the local rates of two of the pipelines providing the through service,could without more show the joint rate covering all four pipelines to be unreasonable.in rejecting the carriers motions to dismiss,ferc acknowledged that big west failed to contest,to offer evidence against the joint tariff rates in their entirety.first order,ferc at.ferc insisted,however,that this was not an obstacle to big west challenge to the joint tariffs,since the shipper was disputing the local rates because they are used to determine the amount of joint rates.id.we return later to the question what the phrase used to determine may have meant.if the alj found the local rate to be reasonable,ferc ruled,it can be assumed that the subject express joint rates meet the standard set forth in texaco,but if the alj found the local rate to be unreasonable,then,the express joint rates must be recalculated in accordance with texaco,first order,ferc at.
a month after big west complaints,chevron products brought essentially identical challenges to the same rates and included the same carriers as respondents.second order,ferc at.chevron products affiliate,chevron pipeline,was not a direct participant in the joint rate and was not included as a respondent in either complaint.
ferc consolidated big west and chevron products complaints for the purpose of settlement procedures and ordered that,should those procedures fail,there would be two alj hearings one for all challenges to frontier local tariff and one for all challenges to anschutz local tariff.rehearing order,ferc at second order,ferc at.as to the dispute over the joint rates,ferc adopted,for the purpose of all complaints,the same theory that it had originally adopted for big west complaints,the only difference being that two local rates rather than one would be at issue.second order,ferc at.
because settlement procedures did not lead to an agreement,alj proceedings began but soon afterward the shippers and anschutz settled all pending issues,including the unreasonableness of the joint tariff insofar as it concerned anschutz.the shippers and frontier also reached a settlement during the alj hearing,covering reparations for past movements under the local frontier tariff and a future reduction in the local and joint tariffs.but as to reparations for shipments under the joint tariffs,frontier and the complainants agreed only that for the purpose of calculating the reparations,if any,the just and reasonable rate for frontier local tariff for the relevant past period was for light petroleum,the only type of petroleum involved in the disputed shipments.joint stipulation of july,at emphasis added.the was much less than the actual local rate charged in the period,which had been about.
in august,frontier submitted to ferc a compliance filing,arguing that it owed no reparations on the joint tariff.ferc rejected the filing in february,concluding that the express joint rate was unreasonable to the extent it exceeded the sum of the applicable local rates,including the stipulated per barrel for frontier.big west oil frontier pipeline,ferc,at p,wl reparations order.in other words,it calculated reparations as the difference between the joint rate filed and actually charged and the sum of a the stipulated rate for the frontier segment and b the local rates on file for the reparations period for the remaining three segments.frontier and express requested rehearing,which ferc denied.big west oil frontier pipeline,ferc,at pp,wl rehearing order.
discussion 
the crux of the carriers petition is that ferc erred by rejecting their argument that although one of the intermediates of the route covered by the joint rate was unreasonable,one or more of the other intermediates might well have been below their respective maximum reasonable levels perhaps because of greater competition on those segments,such that the depression of some of the intermediate rates might partly or completely offset the excessiveness of the others,meaning the joint rate could be condemned as unreasonable,at least not without considering the joint rate as a whole.the carriers say that ferc failed to explain why,under the ica and epact,such an argument is valid.
we agree with the carriers that the commission has failed to reconcile its finding that the joint rate was unreasonable under ica with the supreme court construction of that section.the first pertinent decision is louisville nashville railroad steel iron.the commission had found certain joint rates unreasonable,id.at,and,for shipments over a certain period,held one of the carriers the only one for which the statute of to that t run liable for the entire overcharge,id.at.the court rejected that carrier claim that it should be liable only for a portion of the excess commensurate with its share of the icc mandated prospective rate reduction.id.at.although this holding is not relevant here,the court also specifically targeted the carrier argument that the joint through rates should be treated as if they were merely a combination of the full individual rates of the several carriers,because the rates in question were in fact constructed by combining as factors the existing published proportional rates of the several carriers.id.at.the court found this irrelevant,explaining 
the fact that the joint rate had been constructed out of existing proportional rates is not of legal significance.the rates complained of were not merely the aggregate of individual local or proportional rates customarily charged by the respective lines for the transportation included in the through routes.the rates in question were strictly joint through rates.each through rate was complained of as a unit a single charge was made for the transportation from point of origin to point of destination.
id.at.this passage may do no more than rule that carriers offering a joint rate can not demand that it be treated as a combination rate for joint and several liability purposes just because it happens to equal the sum of the intermediates.but the court went on 
the division of the joint rate among the participating carriers is a matter which in no way concerns the shipper.the shipper only interest is that the joint rate be reasonable as a whole.it may be unreasonable although each of the factors of which it is constructed was reasonable.it may be reasonable although some of the factors,or of the divisions of the participants,were unreasonable.
id.at,emphasis added.
to be sure,the local rates against which ferc here purports to judge the express joint rate are factors,there no evidence they have any functional relationship to the joint rate or divisions,there no evidence that they correspond to the portions of proceeds received by the various participants.but apparent the reasonableness of a joint rate is to be assessed as a whole rather than simply by reference to one of its segments or,more generally,to fewer than all of its segments seems entirely applicable.certainly ferc orders made no effort to explain how local rates are any more suitable than factors or divisions as bases for judging the reasonableness of a joint rate.
the second case,great northern railway sullivan,involved genuine combination rates,each being the sum of two proportional rates.id.at.the icc found the proportional rates applicable to one of the two segments to be unreasonable under and ordered the carrier on that segment to pay reparations for the excess.id.at.the commission made no finding as to the reasonableness of the overall combination rates nor of the proportionals applicable to the other of the two segments indeed,the shippers never denied that the aggregate charges were reasonable and could have been collected without liability if the carriers had imposed the charges by means of joint instead of the combination through rates that they did establish.id.at.reversing the icc,the court concluded 
a s to the shipments here involved the petitioner proportional rate can not be applied save as it is a part of the through rate.there was a single charge which,though based on the combination rate,was precisely the same in amount as if the rate had been jointly made.as shown by our decision in,the division among connecting carriers of charges based on joint involved in that case were constructed out of existing no concern of the shipper.the proportionals here involved are but parts of a through rate and can not be distinguished from divisions of a joint rate.the shipper only interest is that the charge shall be reasonable as a whole.
id.at.citations omitted emphasis added.
addressing great northern,ferc said only 
great northern is distinguishable from the instant case in that it addressed combination rates based on the sum of proportional rates,not on the sum of local rates.the supreme court explained the difference between the types of rates by stating,a proportional differs from a local rate in that it covers only terminal service at place of receipt or at place of delivery but can not,as does the local rate,cover both.at.the court in great northern specifically recognized that there was no applicable joint rate at issue.id.at.
rehearing order,ferc at p,footnotes omitted.
the commission closing sentence seems to have things exactly backwards.the court rejected liability because,for purposes of the principle that a through rate could only be judged as an aggregate,it saw no material difference between a joint rate clearly to be judged only as an aggregate and a combination rate by extension,also to be judged only as an aggregate.
further,the commission implicit description of the joint rate here as based on the sum of local rates is hard to make sense of.earlier,in rejecting the carriers motions to dismiss,ferc used a similar formulation,explaining its indifference to the costs on the unchallenged segments by asserting that big west was disputing the local rates because they are used to determine the amount of joint rates.first order,ferc at emphasis added.but nothing in the orders,statements of counsel,or the record excerpts presented to us suggests that the joint rate was based on the sum of the local rates or that the local rates were used to determine the joint in the very general sense that the business rationale for the joint rate was to provide a discount from the locals.and even if the joint rate were somehow calculated based on the sum of the locals,reliance on one local rate to condemn the joint rate would seem to violate instruction not to use less than all the factors constituting a rate to judge the whole.
perhaps ferc means to read great northern as saying only that a through rate should not be judged against the sum of proportionals,a reading that might leave the commission free to judge a joint rate against the sum of locals.but it hard to see why locals would be just as problematic as proportionals when employed as yardsticks to measure the reasonableness of a through rate.if the carrier offers local rates but not proportional rates,its rates do vary based on local versus through service,as each carrier did here,then from the perspective of the through shipper,the local rates are functionally identical to the proportional rates in great northern.alternatively,if the carrier charges different rates to local shippers and through shippers,the result is merely to render the local rates irrelevant from the perspective of the through shipper.it also unclear why great northern admonition against judging a combination rate on the basis of one unreasonable intermediate would apply with equal force to judging a joint rate in the same way particularly in light of.the basic variations in competition may produce reasonable rates on particular segments,so that in defending a through rate a carrier must be free to show that its average costs were higher for that segment than the rate it charged the segment seem applicable.ferc orders say nothing about this.
on the distinction,ferc counsel attempted an answer at oral argument the shippers during the period in question had the option to ship under the local rates,and if frontier local rate had been unreasonably high,the sum of the locals would have been lower than the joint rate,and the shippers therefore would have exercised their option.thus,counsel urged,ferc should now award reparations as if things had unfolded that way.oral arg.tr.at.the factual existence of the shippers option appears undisputed.but the orders presently under review never even mention the option,much less rely on it to distinguish great northern.under sec chenery,accordingly,we can not entertain the argument.
besides failing to distinguish and great northern,ferc order departs from the icc principle that under a through rate exceeding the sum of the intermediate rates is only rebuttably not conclusively presumed unreasonable.patterson louisville nashville railroad.citing numerous icc cases moore chicago,burlington,quincy railroad,michigan buggy grand rapids indiana railway.the icc approach received the supreme court endorsement in patterson,a case about the interplay between and another section of the ica,app.ica originally consisted solely of the clause forbidding a carrier to charge any greater compensation in the aggregate for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line,in the same direction,the shorter being included within the longer distance plus a provision authorizing the commission to grant relief from the clause upon application by a carrier.ch,stat.later,in,after the commission had already established the presumption that a through rate exceeding the sum of the intermediate rates presumptively violated the reasonableness requirement of,michigan buggy,at,congress amended by adding the clause,making it unlawful for a carrier to charge any greater compensation as a through rate than the aggregate of the intermediate rates.act of june,stat.in,congress divided certain sections of the ica into subsections the reasonableness requirement of ended up in,and all the provisions discussed above ended up in.transportation act of,stat,stat.at.in patterson the shippers argued that the relief clause must not apply to the clause,in part because such an application they said would effectively roll back shippers rights,the icc,whenever it granted relief from the clause,would no longer apply any presumption of unreasonableness.at.the court said this fear was unfounded the icc would should hold a through rate exceeding the sum of intermediates to be presumptively unreasonable under regardless of the clause or any exemptions to it 
the icc is correct in holding that if a through rate higher than the aggregate of the intermediates is attacked under ica,the prima facie presumption that such higher through rate is unreasonable,and hence unlawful,obtains now as it did before the amendment,the addition of the clause to.but no such question could arise in a proceeding limited to.in a proceeding for violation of either clause of including the clause,there is no occasion to consider either the presumption of unreasonableness or the existence of a justification for making the through rate higher.neither is relevant.for if there has been an adequate and timely application within the six months which application remains an application filed later and can be no violation of that section.if there was no such application filed,the section is violated by the higher through rate,even if conditions are shown which would have justified the rate as against a charge of unreasonableness under.
id.at.the court ultimately held that relief clause embraced the rule as well as the provision.id.its reasoning in support of that holding treated one principle of application to a through rate as a given in making a case of unreasonableness,shippers could shift the burden of proof to the carrier by showing that the through rate exceeded the sum of the filed intermediate rates,at which point the carrier could prevail by showing a justification of the excess.
the line of icc cases endorsed in patterson,creating the rule that a through rate exceeding the sum of intermediate rates is rebuttably presumed unreasonable,apparently refers only to the contemporaneously filed rates.all thirteen icc cases cited on the point in patterson,at,follow this pattern,and no party cites a case to the contrary.here,of course,the express joint rate exceeded the sum of the intermediates only when a rate was substituted for one of the contemporaneously filed rates.thus,ferc approach is doubly removed from the rule,in that the agency found the presumption triggered by a mixed batch of rates some contemporaneously filed,another stipulated as reasonable after the fact,and made the presumption irrebuttable.
the parties dispute not only the interpretations of but also the question whether ferc methodology follows logically from texaco pipeline,ferc,wl,in which ferc approved a proposed joint rate prospectively,saying that the ceiling for a joint rate was the sum of the ceiling levels associated with the individual tariff rates currently on file,ferc at.ferc method here of adding up segment rates to determine a benchmark for reparations does not follow from texaco.for three of the four segments,ferc used filed rates,on which texaco never relied.the filed rates in texaco happened to be the same as the ceiling levels,but that was mere coincidence.and for the remaining segment,ferc used a rate stipulated to be reasonable pursuant to a settlement of proceedings,violating the historic principle that a through rate can not be judged on the basis of a traditional cost inquiry into some segments unless the agency allows the carrier to be heard on costs for other segments.texaco did not remotely question that principle on the contrary,it implicitly honored it by adding apples to apples ceilings to ceilings,summing figures that approximated cost by a single method of computation.
ferc also makes a waiver argument that rests on its misreading of texaco.it claims that its first order in gave the carriers fair warning that ferc planned to award reparations for the difference between the joint rate and the sum of the locals three as filed,one as later stipulated if the carriers did like the approach,they should have objected back then.here is what the first order said 
our policy has been that a joint rate is just and reasonable if it is less than or equal to the sum of the local interstate rates currently on file with the commission.citation to texaco.if a pipeline participant in a joint rate does not have a corresponding local interstate rate on file with the commission,the joint rate can be found to be just and reasonable so long as it is less than or equal to the sum of the local interstate rates of the remaining joint participants that are on file with the commission 
if it is established that frontier and anschutz local rates are just and reasonable,it can be assumed that the subject express joint rates meet the standard set forth in texaco.however,if it is shown that the local rates of frontier and anschutz are not just and reasonable,then the express joint rates must be recalculated in accordance with texaco.
first order,ferc at footnotes omitted.
contrary to ferc counsel argument,these passages can not be said to anticipate the approach ultimately adopted.the order says that a joint rate can be reasonable if or so long as it does exceed the sum of the locals on file.the language is literally consistent with texaco correctly read,if one assumes the filed rates are no greater than the ceiling levels,as the regulations require,but does not necessarily imply the converse,that the joint rate is reasonable only if it does exceed the sum of filed rates.the rule that any filed through rate exceeding the sum of the filed local rates is unjust and transforms texaco,even though the order never suggests that it is modifying texaco at all.a reasonable participant in the process could not be expected to infer that the commission would spin texaco so offhandedly into a repudiation of decades of application of.worse,even if the converse rule were implied,it does not match what ferc ultimately did add up three filed rates and one reasonable rate.
more broadly,it is clear what a reasonable reader anticipating an extension of texaco to the reparations domain should have expected.a literal extension of texaco the ceiling for a joint rate is the sum of the ceilings of the suggest that reparations should equal the difference between the joint rate and the sum of the contemporaneously existing ceiling levels there being no express provision in the regulations fitting a recomputation of ceiling levels into the ica provision for reparations.but the first order could have meant this,for even if the shippers alleged that the challenged rates exceeded contemporaneous ceiling levels and it seems,from the one complaint presented to us,joint appendix at,that they made no such allegation,ferc stated that the rates would need to be recalculated under texaco upon a finding that the local rates are not just and finding that,given the very same order mandate of individual hearings,ferc clearly believed might be premised on something other than a violation of contemporaneous ceiling levels.
given the ill fit between the language of the first order and the reparations process,and the fact that these passages never refer to reparations,a reasonable observer would likely suppose that they referred only to prospective relief,a matter then still entirely up in the air.indeed,the final quoted if the challenged local rates are found unreasonable,the joint rates must be recalculated in accordance with texaco makes perfect sense if confined to prospective relief if one or more challenged local rates were found unreasonable and therefore reduced,the reductions would automatically reduce the segments respective ceiling levels,d,which under texaco would automatically reduce the joint rate ceiling level,which would require that the joint rate be recalculated and under some circumstances,if all filed segment rates had been at their prior ceiling levels,reduced,see e.in any event,ferc can not prevail on waiver.
in addition,the commission seeks to justify its override of historic practice and case law under by invoking the epact general mandate to simplify ratemaking.it notes that the carriers proposed a carrier to show that because other intermediate rates on the through route were below their respective reasonable maximums the overall through rate was require individual inquiries into pipeline costs,exactly the sort of onerous and complex proceeding that the epact and order sought to sidestep.thus ferc purports to see that act as a policy watershed that justifies minimizing the importance of act precedent.see rehearing order,ferc at pp,see also id.at p.
administrative simplicity is a value,and agencies may take it into or not.see,consolidated edison of new york ferc,approving ferc invocation of administrative convenience in a proceeding under the natural gas act illinois public telecommunications association fcc,evaluating on the merits an agency claim of administrative convenience in a proceeding under the telecommunications act but finding the burdens avoided by the agency approach too small to justify the cost.but we know of no case,and ca imagine one from an american court,where simplification value has been taken to justify the exclusion of all data supporting one side when equivalent data supporting the other has been admitted.true,by virtue of a stipulation here the cost issue for frontier leg of the journey was resolved without a cost inquiry.but that was a fluke.essentially,ferc approach is to review a joint rate on the basis of individual inquiries into the local rates,but only the rates picked by shippers.
we have up to this point discussed the case under ica and sections applicable to a case.the orders on review,however,also lean heavily on ica clause.rehearing order,ferc at pp,reparations order,ferc at p.yet the agency brief before this court downplays the clause.brief for respondent at but see id.at.counsel at oral argument,when asked,with reference to and,under what section was the commission acting,responded,the commission decided this case under.oral arg.tr.at.we take commission counsel at her word.
because of possible confusion on remand,however,we think it important to remind ferc that patterson drew clear distinctions between and,particularly in the passage from that case quoted in our discussion of,above.
we note but do not rule on the carriers two key objections to the orders as attempted applications of.first they argue that in the icc decisions the term intermediate rates in the clause refers to the contemporaneously effective rates,filed rates.see omaha chamber of commerce traffic bureau atlanta,birmingham atlantic railway.ferc adduces no icc decision to the contrary,and all that we have seen,such as those cited in patterson,at,appear consistent with the principle.second,the carriers say that any monetary recovery under the clause requires a showing of actual damage,typically perhaps exclusively injury to a shipper disadvantaged by the challenged rate in competition with firms enjoying the lower rates used for comparison,as was true under the provision of,davis portland seed,and under the ica express ban on discriminatory rates ica,app,pennsylvania railroad int l coal mining.
finally,we must address ferc attempted reliance on ica,app.it establishes the familiar filed rate doctrine,the rule that a carrier may charge no more than the filed rate even if that rate is lower than the maximum just and reasonable rate 
no carrier shall engage or participate in the transportation of property unless the rates,fares,and charges upon which the same are transported by said carrier have been filed and published in accordance with the provisions of this chapter nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation of property between the points named in such tariffs than the rates,fares,and charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time.
ferc contends that this provision supports its approach to reparations.rehearing order,ferc at pp.the commission idea seems to be that allowing the carriers to show,in defense,that the local rates for some segments were below the just and reasonable level,would somehow implicate this provision.the argument flies in the face of decades of icc practice as we just saw,this allowed carriers that have charged a through rate higher than the sum of the intermediate filed rates to rebut the inference that the through rate was unreasonable under.it also violates ordinary language.section merely prohibits a carrier from charging more than the rate in effect at the time of the shipment.nobody says that the carriers here did such a thing.ferc argument is wholly without merit.
on remand,ferc must consider whether the prior judicial constructions of ica in,great northern,and patterson preclude its condemnation of the joint rate here without considering the reasonableness of the rate as an aggregate.see national cable telecommunications association brand x internet services,d chevron,natural resources defense council,d.if they do not,of course,the commission must explain why its approach is a reasonable construction.further,to persist in the outcome here it would have to explain its deviation from the icc applications of.
we need not reach the carriers claims that ferc erred in its damage calculations by using discounted rates and excluding the local rate of platte pipe line company.
ii.the shippers petition 
the award that prompted the carriers petition concerned a set of shipments made by the big west and chevron products as owners of the oil from the moment it left the border if not earlier,contracting directly with the carriers.but there was a second set of shipments made by,who had contracted to sell the oil to big west and chevron products under price terms that specifically included whatever the carriers had charged for transportation,plus an additional amount dependent on various factors that do concern us.the characterize their contracts with the third parties as contracts,in that the price consisted of the cost of transportation from the border to salt lake city,plus additional charges that did vary with that cost.we assume in the favor that their ver
