we address related appeals from rulings of the international trade commission the commission.
first,we consider the propriety of the commission limited exclusion order barring importation of optical scanning devices and a related cease and desist order.we vacate the cease and desist order,vacate the limited exclusion order in part,and remand so that the order can be revised to bar only a subset of the scanners at issue.resolution of this appeal turns in part on our conclusion that an exclusion order based on a violation of a b i may not be predicated on a theory of induced infringement under b where direct infringement does not occur until after importation of the articles the exclusion order would bar.the commission authority under a b i reaches articles that infringe a valid and enforceable united states patent at the time of importation.because there can be no induced infringement unless there has been an act of direct infringement,however,there are no articles that infringe at the time of importation when direct infringement has yet to occur.the commission exclusion order must be revised,accordingly,to bar only those articles that infringe a claim or claims of an asserted patent at the time of importation.
next,we consider a commission order refusing to find a violation of with respect to some of the same optical scanners.the proceeding giving rise to that appeal was premised on alleged infringement of patent the patent,a different patent than the two patents at issue in the first appeal we address today.the commission concluded that the scanners at issue did not infringe the asserted claims of the patent when properly construed.because we agree with the commission claim construction and finding,we affirm the commission ruling in this related appeal.
the commission rulings before us arise from proceedings in which cross match technologies,cross match asserts that suprema,and mentalix,violated a b i by importing articles that infringe or are used to infringe patent the patent,the patent,and the patent.the commission found that mentalix directly infringed method claim of the patent by using its own software with imported suprema scanners and found that suprema induced that infringement.the commission also found that certain of suprema imported optical scanners directly infringe claims,and of the patent.but the commission found no infringement of the patent.the commission then held that suprema and mentalix failed to prove that the patent was invalid as obvious over two prior art patents patent the patent and patent the patent.based on these findings,on october,the commission issued a limited exclusion order directed to certain scanning devices imported by or on behalf of suprema or mentalix and issued a cease and desist order directed to mentalix only.
suprema and mentalix premised their appeal of the exclusion and cease and desist orders on their belief that the commission erred because a a b i violation may not be predicated on a theory of induced infringement under the facts of this case suprema was not willfully blind to the existence of the patent and,thus,did not induce infringement of that patent mentalix did not directly infringe the patent suprema scanners do not infringe the patent under the correct claim construction and the asserted claims of the patent were invalid as obvious.cross match,in turn,appeals the commission ruling with respect to the patent,challenging the claim construction upon which that ruling was based.
we vacate the infringement finding on the patent because we hold that an exclusion order based on a violation of a b i may not be predicated on a theory of induced infringement where no direct infringement occurs until.given this conclusion,we do not reach the merits of the commission willful blindness or direct infringement findings on the patent.regarding the patent,we affirm the commission finding of infringement and conclusion that suprema failed to prove that the asserted claims were invalid as obvious.finally,we affirm the commission ruling regarding the patent.
the technology at issue pertains to biometrics,the science of analyzing biological characteristics and the scanning of biometric objects.this case specifically involves fingerprint scanners.fingerprint capture and recognition,probably the most common form of biometrics,is important technology because many industries and law enforcement increasingly rely on fingerprints as biometrics to store,recognize,or verify identity.
as explained above,these appeals concern three patents.two are method patents,the patent and the patent.the patent is at issue in the appeal by suprema and mentalix the patent is at issue in cross match appeal.they relate to particular implementations of fingerprint image capture and processing.the third patent,the patent,contains apparatus claims over an optical system and is at issue in suprema appeal.
the patent contains claims drawn to methods used by an optical scanning system to detect fingerprint images based on shape and area,and to determine quality based on the detected shape and area.patent ll.claim the only claim of the patent found infringed recites such a process 
a method for capturing and processing a image,the method comprising 
a scanning one or more fingers 
b capturing data representing a corresponding fingerprint area 
c filtering the fingerprint image 
d binarizing the filtered fingerprint image 
e detecting a fingerprint area based on a concentration of black pixels in the binarized fingerprint image 
f detecting a fingerprint shape based on an arrangement of the concentrated black pixels in an shape in the binarized fingerprint image and 
g determining whether the detected fingerprint area and shape are of acceptable quality.
the patent claims an optical system for forming a real image of a biometric object that corrects for field curvature using a system.claims,and were found infringed.claims and depend from claim.the three claims read 
an optical system having an optical axis,said system forming an image of an object and comprising 
a a prism having a first surface for contacting the object and a second surface,said first surface being oriented with respect to the optical axis at an angle greater than the angle of total internal reflection of the surface 
b an aperture stop 
c a first lens unit having a positive power between the aperture stop and the prism for forming a telecentric entrance pupil 
d a second lens unit having a positive power for forming a real image of the object,said second lens unit being on the image side of the first lens unit and 
e a third lens unit for correcting the field curvature of the image contributed by the first and second lens units.
the optical system of claim wherein the first lens units consist of a single lens element.
the optical system of claim wherein the third lens unit has a negative power.
patent ll.the debate over the patent centers on whether the optical system described in claim can include within it elements,such as the mirrors that are included in the lens units of the suprema scanners.while suprema says claim and those claims that depend therefrom exclude the use of such mirrors,the alj and the commission found they did not.
the patent claims methods aimed at reliably capturing print images.the parties dispute regarding the patent centers on an issue of claim construction in particular,the determination by the alj and commission that capture,within the meaning of the asserted claims,can not occur until after the print quality and number of prints have been determined and detected.
cross match,the complainant and intervenor,is a global provider of fingerprint acquisition technology.it is a domestic company headquartered in florida,and it develops and manufactures a variety of biometric identification products for verifying a person identity,such as fingerprint and palm print scanners.it supplies products to the government and private industry.cross match is the sole assignee of the three.
the respondents below are suprema,a korean company that manufactures and imports hardware and software for scanning fingerprints,and mentalix,a domestic importer of suprema scanners.specifically at issue are suprema scanners marketed under the realscan and software development kits sdks packaged along with those scanners.mentalix imports suprema scanners and integrates them with its own software in the united states.the specific mentalix software involved in this case is called fedsubmit.mentalix accused software can be used with fingerprint scanners sold by other companies,including cross match.in the commission investigation,cross match contended that its system claims are infringed by suprema optical systems and that the method claims at issue are infringed when suprema scanners are used in combination with both respondents software,suprema sdks and fedsubmit.
suprema appeals the commission finding that it violated a b i by infringement of the and patents,and asks that the related exclusion orders be vacated.the alj found that a number of suprema scanners realscan,realscan d,realscan,and realscan df,when used with mentalix fedsubmit software,directly infringe claim of the patent and recommended an exclusion order relating to those scanners on that ground.the commission agreed that the patent was infringed,but clarified the controlling infringement theories it concluded that mentalix directly infringes method claim of the patent when it combines suprema products with its own software and that suprema induces that infringement.
while the alj had not considered inducement and made no factual finding on its elements,the commission nevertheless concluded that the record evidence supported a finding that suprema was willfully blind to the patent,studied and emulated cross match products before willfully blinding itself to the infringing nature of mentalix activities,and actively encouraged those activities.therefore,it found that suprema had induced infringement of the patented method under b,and that this inducement formed the basis for a a b i violation.
regarding the underlying direct infringement,the commission found that mentalix fedsubmit software,when integrated with the imported suprema scanners,and upon execution of the software,practiced method claim of the patent under the alj claim constructions the commission adopted those constructions and the subsequent infringement findings.
with respect to the patent,the commission fully adopted the alj infringement analysis.specifically,the commission found that the claimed optical systems need not exclude elements such as distortion correcting prisms or holographic optical elements or optics.the commission then concluded that all the recited elements of claims,and were met by the accused scanners.
the commission also found that the asserted prior art,the and patents,did not render the asserted claims of the patent obvious.based on the evidentiary record,the alj determined that the respondents failed to offer clear and convincing evidence that the combination of the and patents renders asserted independent claim,as well as asserted dependent claims,and,obvious under a.the alj concluded that the patent did not disclose element c a first lens unit having a positive power between the aperture stop and the prism for forming a telecentric entrance pupil,element d a second lens unit having a positive power for forming a real image of the object,or element e a third lens unit for correcting field curvature.the alj also noted that,although the patent disclosed a triplet lens that was well suited for use with photographic cameras,the patent did not pertain to fingerprint scanners and did not disclose a telecentric condition.the alj also found no motivation to combine the two references.the commission adopted each of these findings.
in its separate appeal,cross match challenges the commission determination that claims,and of the patent are not infringed by either suprema scanners or use of those scanners in conjunction with the fedsubmit software.the alj adopted cross match proposed construction of capture as it appears in step f of the asserted independent claims,namely,that capture means acquiring,by the scanner,for processing or storage.the commission adopted that construction and,based on it,also adopted the alj finding that the accused products do not infringe the asserted claims.
specifically,the commission found that the capture limitation was not met because the record evidence showed that the accused scanners do not perform the steps of claim in the required order.the commission found that claim requires that the scanned fingerprint image be captured after both a determination of the expected number of prints under step e and a determination of the quality of the prints under step d have been made.but the accused products capture the fingerprint image before software determines the number of prints as required by step e and before assessing their quality as required by step d.the commission also found the accused products do not perform step f of claim,since that step is substantially the same as step f of claim.
we turn first to suprema appeal regarding the patent and the threshold issue it raises specifically,whether a a b i violation may be predicated on a claim of induced infringement where the attendant direct infringement of the claimed method does not occur until.we conclude that a b i,by tying the commission authority to the importation,sale for importation,or sale within the after importation of articles that infringe a valid and enforceable patent,leaves the commission powerless to remedy acts of induced infringement in these circumstances.accordingly,we vacate the commission rulings regarding the patent 
on appeal,suprema contends it does not import articles that infringe,as required under a b i.the accused devices are imported scanners which cross match concedes do not directly infringe the method of claim of the patent at the time of importation.the alleged infringement only takes place when the scanners are combined with domestically developed software after the scanners are imported.cross match does not dispute that the scanners have substantial uses,and suprema contends its other customers have put them to such uses.on these facts,suprema contends that no infringing articles were ever imported.accordingly,suprema asserts that the commission decision with respect to the patent must be vacated.
suprema argues that allegations of induced infringement do not adequately connect the fact of importation to the ultimate infringement.suprema concedes that,if an article is capable of no uses,its importation may constitute contributory infringement and thereby violate.but,suprema asserts that the imported scanners at issue here are capable of multiple uses.it is only when they are combined with mentalix specific software program that they purportedly infringe the method described in claim.suprema believes that a b i does not reach the conduct in which cross match alleges it engaged.
cross match defends the commission ruling that,by inducing mentalix to commit direct infringement,suprema violated a b i.cross match argues that in the matter of certain electronic devices,inv.ta,wl,at itc,a recent commission ruling,makes clear that a violation can be predicated on the theory of induced infringement the commission employed here.cross match also relies on our rulings in kyocera wireless international trade commission,and alloc,international trade commission.
the commission disputes suprema argument regarding the scope of its authority under a b i.according to the commission,articles that infringe can involve any type of infringement,be it direct,contributory,or induced.the commission asserts that suprema began encouraging and aiding and abetting mentalix infringement well before importation,indicating that suprema already was indirectly infringing at the time of importation.the commission also cites certain electronic devices,which,in its view,did not change the law and simply reiterated that all forms of indirect infringement can lead to a violation of a b i.
the commission authority to issue exclusion orders in this case must find a basis in statute.see kyocera,at the itc is a creature of statute,and must find authority for its actions in its enabling statute.the question presented is,thus,one of statutory construction.when interpreting a statute which an agency administers,we conduct our statutory analysis under the framework established in chevron natural resources defense council,d.under that framework,a reviewing court must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting chevron,at.if congress has done so,the inquiry is at an end the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.quoting chevron,at.if,however,the statute in question is ambiguous and the agency interpretation is reasonable,a court must defer to an agency construction of a statute governing agency conduct.cathedral candle int l trade comm n.
all matters of statutory construction,of course,begin with the language of the statute in question.see hughes aircraft jacobson,d as in any case of statutory construction,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.internal quotation marks omitted.section states 
subject to paragraph,the following are unlawful,and when found by the commission to exist shall be dealt with,in addition to any other provision of law,as provided in this section 
b the importation into the united states,the sale for importation,or the sale within the united states after importation by the owner,importer,or consignee,of articles that 
i infringe a valid and enforceable united states patent or a valid and enforceable united states copyright registered under title or 
a emphases added.the commission mandate to deal with matters of patent infringement under a b i is thus premised on the importation,sale for importation,or sale within the united states after importation of articles that infringe.id.thus,the commission authority extends to articles that infringe a valid and enforceable united states patent.the focus is on the infringing nature of the articles at the time of importation,not on the intent of the parties with respect to the imported goods.
the same focus is evident also from the main remedy it can grant,exclusion orders on the imported articles 
d exclusion of articles from entry 
if the commission determines,as a result of an investigation under this section,that there is a violation of this section,it shall direct that the articles concerned,imported by any person violating the provision of this section,be excluded from entry into the united states,unless,after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare,competitive conditions in the united states economy,the production of like or directly competitive articles in the united states,and united states consumers,it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry.the commission shall notify the secretary of the treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry,and upon receipt of such notice,the secretary shall,through the proper officers,refuse such entry.
emphasis added.in the context of this dispute,the articles concerned would be,of course,the aforementioned articles that infringe a valid and enforceable united states patent,a b i.exclusion orders based on violations of a b i thus pertain only to the imported goods and are necessarily based on the infringing nature of those goods when imported 
the commission has recognized this limitation on its jurisdiction by refusing to investigate complaints premised on allegations of direct infringement of method claims under a because patented methods are not infringed until use in the united states occurs.see in the matter of certain electronic devices,inv,wl,at itc.
to determine if imported goods are articles that infringe,we turn to the patent laws,specifically,of title of the.that provision defines unlawful patent infringement,the basis for the unfair trade practice regulated in a b.section states 
a except as otherwise provided in this title,whoever without authority makes,uses,offers to sell,or sells any patented invention,within the united states or imports into the united states any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor,infringes the patent.
a whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.
c whoever offers to sell or sells within the united states or imports into the united states a component of a patented machine,manufacture,combination or composition,or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process,constituting a material part of the invention,knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent,and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use,shall be liable as a contributory infringer.
section a defines direct patent infringement and makes unlawful conduct tied to an article,namely,the making,using,offering for sale,and selling of a patented invention.section c defines contributory patent infringement,which again prohibits conduct tied to an article,but here,a component of a patented machine,manufacture,combination or composition,or a material or apparatuses for use in practicing a patented process,constituting a material part of the invention.section b defines induced patent infringement,and this provision,unlike the other two,declares unlawful conduct which is untied to an article actively induc ing infringement of a patent.
precedent from our court makes evident the nature of b and its focus on the conduct of the inducer.see,dsu med.jms,en banc i nducement requires evidence of culpable conduct,directed to encouraging another infringement,not merely that the inducer had knowledge of the direct infringer activities.emphasis added.we have stated,additionally,that t o succeed on a theory of induced infringement,a plaintiff must prove that the defendants actions induced infringing acts and that they knew or should have known their actions would induce actual infringement.warner lambert apotex,emphasis added internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.for this reason,a large part of the inducement analysis and our case law dealing with the theory focuses on the intent of the inducer in performing the proscribed act.see dsu,at.our most recent en banc decision dealing with induced infringement likewise makes clear the nature of the offense s ection b extends liability to a party who advises,encourages,or otherwise induces others to engage in infringing conduct akamai,limelight networks,en banc.
but the focus of the inducement analysis is not on the conduct of the alleged inducer alone.to prevail on inducement,the patentee must show,first that there has been direct infringement kyocera,at quoting.mining chemque.under that longstanding law,while the inducing act must of course precede the infringement it induces,it is not a completed inducement under b until there has been a direct infringement.
given the nature of the conduct proscribed in b and the nature of the authority granted to the commission in,we hold that the statutory grant of authority in can not extend to the conduct proscribed in b where the acts of underlying direct infringement occur.section a b i grants the commission authority to deal with the importation,sale for importation,or sale within the united states after importation of articles that infringe a valid and enforceable patent.the patent laws essentially define articles that infringe in a and c,and those provisions standards for infringement aside from the united states requirements,of course must be met at or before importation in order for the articles to be infringing when imported.section b makes unlawful certain conduct inducing infringement that becomes tied to an article only through the underlying direct infringement.prior to the commission of any direct infringement,for purposes of inducement of infringement,there are no articles that infringe a prerequisite to the commission exercise of authority based on a b i.consequently,we hold that the commission lacked the authority to enter an exclusion order directed to suprema scanners premised on suprema purported induced infringement of the method claimed in the patent 
cross match points to a number of cases from our court and the commission to argue that the commission has the authority to entertain induced infringement claims.but the cases on which cross match relies do not squarely address the issue or are distinguishable.in kyocera wireless international trade commission,we reversed a finding of induced infringement by the commission because it failed to apply the specific intent requirement which,subsequent to the commission determination,we clarified in dsu and remanded for reassessment under the correct legal standard.at.we assumed without deciding that the commission had the authority to predicate a exclusion order on its finding of induced infringement by qualcomm.there was no challenge to the commission authority to predicate a violation on the theories urged.our holding was limited to the following 
because the commission based its finding on an approach overruled by dsu,this court vacates and remands the itc determination of induced infringement.on remand,the itc will have the opportunity to examine whether qualcomm conduct satisfies the specific intent requirement set forth in dsu.
id.at.it is understandable,moreover,that the parties and court in kyocera did not focus on the commission authority to address inducement in the circumstances presented here,where no direct infringement occurs until after the articles are imported.the facts in kyocera were very different.
in kyocera,the commission prohibited the importation of wireless communication devices which when programmed to enable certain features infringe the patent,but the commission only did so with respect to manufacturers who purchase d and incorporate d qualcomm chips into their mobile wireless devices outside the united states,and then imported them into the united states for sale.id.at.thus,while the infringement theory the commission relied upon in kyocera was one of induced infringement,the commission exclusion order was directed to articles which,when imported,directly infringed the patents at issue.thus,this case differs significantly from kyocera.
alloc,international trade commission,also does not compel us to reach a different conclusion here.in alloc,in a brief discussion we affirmed a commission finding of no induced infringement.but there was no challenge in that case to the commission authority over inducement claims,and we premised our holding on the fact that there simply was no evidence of either direct infringement by anyone or of an intent to induce by the importers 
here,the administrative judge found no evidence that the intervenors intended to induce others to infringe the asserted patents.more importantly,the administrative judge found no evidence of direct infringement,which is a prerequisite to indirect infringement.moba,diamond automation,because this court upholds the verdict that claim of the patent is not directly infringed,the trial court correctly determined that fps does not indirectly infringe that claim.met coil.korners unlimited,t here can be no inducement of infringement without direct infringement by some party.this court finds no reason to disturb the administrative judge conclusion on inducement.
alloc,at.thus,alloc is uninformative with respect to the question presented here.
simply put,the issue we address today has never been presented to or decided by us.we are unpersuaded by either cross match or the commission efforts to read more into kyocera and alloc than is there.see united states tucker truck lines.t his court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio.beacon oil,stare decisis applies only to legal issues that were actually decided in a prior action.
the parties also focus on a recent commission ruling,in the matter of certain electronic devices,inv.ta wl,at itc.there,the pertinent issue was raised.the commission analyzed the statutory provisions we discussed above and concluded it has the authority generally to entertain indirect infringement claims 
the plain language of a b first identifies three specific acts that may form the basis of a violation of section importation,selling for importation,and selling after importation.the statute then specifies,in list form,categories of articles that must be involved in the proscribed acts.first on the list are articles that infringe a patent.id.a b i.because the statute specifies that the articles in question must infringe,an importation analysis that ignores the question of infringement would be incomplete.
the word infringe in section derives its legal meaning from,the section of the patent act that defines patent infringement.section defines infringement to include direct infringement a and the two varieties of indirect infringement,active inducement of infringement and contributory infringement b,c.thus,section a b i covers imported articles that directly or indirectly infringe when it refers to articles that infringe.we also interpret the phrase articles that infringe to reference the status of the articles at the time of importation.thus,infringement,direct or indirect,must be based on the articles as imported to satisfy the requirements of section.
certain electronic devices,wl,at.despite this general discussion,on the merits,the commission ultimately found no infringement 
thus,might have proved a violation of section if it had proved indirect infringement of method claim.failed to do so,however,and we adopt the alj findings to that effect.because has not shown importation,sale for importation,or sale after importation of articles that infringe method claim,directly or indirectly,has not shown a violation of section based on infringement of method claim.
id.at see also id.at because has failed to prove indirect infringement of any asserted method claim,we reiterate that has not shown a violation of section with respect to claim of the patent.we are not persuaded that the decision in certain electronic devices counsels against the conclusion we reach today.
first,while the commission spoke in terms of its authority to ban articles that infringe either directly or indirectly,it emphasized that the articles must infringe at the time of importation.id.at.for inducement,the only pertinent articles are those which directly infringe at the time of importation.hence,while the commission may ban articles imported by an inducer where the article itself directly infringes when imported as it attempted to do in kyocera,it may not invoke inducement to ban importation of articles which may or may not later give rise to direct infringement of cross match patented method based solely on the alleged intent of the importer.second,the commission discussion of its authority to predicate a finding on an inducement claim in certain electronic devices was dicta ultimately,it did not resort to its purported authority over such claims to fashion a remedy.and,the commission ruling,even if not dicta,would not be binding on us.instead,we are bound by congressional intent,which is evident from the statutory language 
because we find the commission had no authority to premise an exclusion order addressed to suprema scanners on the infringement theory it employed,we do not address the commission other findings on the patent.whether mentalix directly infringes claim of the patent and whether suprema induces that infringement are issues to be addressed by the only tribunal with authority to do so the applicable federal court forum.
we turn next to suprema challenge to the commission finding that certain products suprema imports realscan and realscan infringe claims,and of the patent.the commission adopted the alj initial determination on these claims as its own.on appeal,suprema challenges the alj claim construction of a term appearing in the asserted claims,the infringement finding based on that claim interpretation,and the holding that suprema failed to prove that the patent would have been obvious.
the claim construction dispute involves the phrase said second lens unit being on the image side of the first lens unit,as it appears in step d of claim of the patent,and the two other asserted claims,which both depend from claim.specifically,suprema argues that the claimed lens excludes elements and optics because those were disavowed in the written description of the patent.so there can be no elements between the lens units,suprema believes,and the alj erred by not limiting the claims in this manner.
the alj did not separately analyze the language of step d but did construe the term optical system,which appears in the preamble of claim and the dependent claims.in its analysis of optical system,the alj first found the preamble of claim to be a limitation,in the matter of certain biometric scanning devices,components thereof,associated software,and products containing the same,final initial and recommended determinations,inv.ta,usitc pub,at june,hereinafter initial determination,and then held that optical system could include elements,distortion correction prisms,holographic optical elements and optics,id.at.the alj looked to the written description for a disavowal related to the presence of elements in the optical system,ultimately finding none.id.at.then,he stated the following 
based on said construction of optical system supra,the administrative law judge rejects respondents arguments regarding the disavowal of nonlens elements and optics with respect to the other elements of claim of the patent.rbr at.thus,he finds that the claim terms first lens unit having a positive power,between the aperture stop and the prism,said second lens unit being on the image side of the first lens unit,and third lens unit are not precluded from containing elements,distortion correcting prisms,holographic optical,or optics.
id.at.the alj again rejected suprema arguments for disclaimer,first distinguishing case law which suprema cited and then rejecting its arguments based on the written description.id.at.the alj relied on,among other things,suprema concession that the optical system could include the purportedly excluded items and only the lens system could not suprema stands by that concession here.ultimately,suprema seeks a limitation excluding elements within the lens system because its products contain mirrors,elements along with the lenses,so such a construction would lead to a finding of.
thus,suprema concedes that elements can be included in the optical system,as long as they are not located within the lens system.suprema also seems to concede that the claim language does not exclude elements from being present in the lens system,between the first and second lens units.instead,suprema relies on two passages in the written description to argue that elements can not be present at that location.first,suprema points to the patent statements regarding the objects of the invention 
in view of the foregoing,it is an object of the invention to provide improved lens systems for use in fingerprint detection.in particular,it is an object of the invention to provide lens systems which employ only lens elements and do not employ distortion correcting prisms,holographic optical elements,or optics.
a further object of the invention is to provide inexpensive lens systems for use in fingerprint detection systems.in particular,it is an object of the invention to provide lens systems for use in fingerprint detection which comprise molded lens elements which can be produced in large quantities at low cost.
patent ll.the foregoing language referred to is the background of the invention section,on which suprema also relies.that passage states 
a description of some of the problems involved in fingerprint detection using frustrated total internal refection can be found in stoltzmann et,versatile anamorphic electronic fingerprinting design and manufacturing considerations,spie,vol,pages,august.these authors conclude that the optical system used to form the image of the fingerprint ridges should include prisms for correcting optical distortion.in practice,an optical system employing prisms is expensive to manufacture compared to an optical system employing only lens elements,both because prisms themselves are expensive and because collimating optics are required to avoid introducing aberrations.
significantly with regard to the present invention,stoltzmann et specifically teach away from the use of an optical system employing only lens elements to produce an image of fingerprint ridges.in particular,they state that a system employing cylindrical lenses can not successfully correct for high levels of compression.
as an alternative to distortion correcting prisms,bahuguna et,prism fingerprint sensor that uses a holographic optical element,applied optics,vol,pages,september,describes using a holographic optical element to achieve total internal reflection without tilting the object fingerprint ridges,thus allowing a rectilinear image of the object to be produced using only lens elements.the use of a holographic optical element,of course,increases the cost and complexity of the optical system.
hebert,robert,optical elements in integrated,assemblies,spie,vol,pages,december,describes another approach to the fingerprint detection problem,namely,the use of optics to avoid tilting the object.this approach requires the use of complex optical surfaces which are difficult to manufacture economically.
reading both passages together,it becomes evident that the concern which the patented invention addresses,and which is described in the first quoted passage above,is the use of costly means for correcting optical distortion.the prior art,according to the patent,achieves this correction with three alternatives,all of which are costly prisms,holographic optical elements,and optics.the stated purpose of the invention,which forms the strongest basis for suprema arguments,says it is an object of the invention to provide lens systems which employ only lens elements and do not employ distortion correcting prisms,holographic optical elements,or optics.id.ll.if anything is disclaimed by this statement,it is prisms,holographic optical elements,and optics,when either is used as the means to correct distortion.
we need not decide if this statement amounts to a clear disavowal of claim scope with respect to distortion correcting optics,however,a result that would require holding suprema to a high burden.see bell atl.network,covad commc ns,we have previously held that,in redefining the meaning of particular claim terms away from the ordinary meaning,the intrinsic evidence must clearly set forth or clearly redefine a claim term so as to put one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the patentee intended to so redefine the claim term.we have also stated that the specification must exhibit an express intent to impart a novel meaning to claim terms.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.suprema only argument based on the disputed claim term is its assertion that mirrors between the lens elements in its products preclude a finding of infringement.but suprema never contends that the mirrors correct distortion and it is unlikely that they serve this purpose the mirrors seem instead to fold the optical axis to make the systems fit within their cases.
accordingly,we conclude that the alj infringement finding was supported by substantial evidence,as was the commission adoption thereof.even assuming certain costly devices were disclaimed and can not be present in between lens units,mirrors that do not correct distortion were not clearly disclaimed.
suprema also challenges the alj holding on its obviousness defense to the asserted claims of the pa tent.suprema argues that,in light of prior art patent the patent combined with prior art patent the patent,the asserted claims of the patent would have been obvious to a person of skill in the art.the alj rejected this argument,first finding the patent failed to disclose a unit as required by claim of the patent or a telecentric condition in a lens located between the prism and the aperture stop as required by element c of claim of the patent.initial determination at.the alj also rejected suprema argument that it would have been obvious to combine the triplet lens disclosed in the patent into the device disclosed in the patent,in order to render the asserted claims obvious,because the patent,in the alj view,also failed to disclose the required telecentric condition and suprema adduced insufficient evidence regarding motivation to combine.id.at.accordingly,the alj found,among other things,that suprema failed to prove,by clear and convincing evidence,that one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the asserted references.id.at.that finding,we hold,was supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we affirm the alj legal conclusion that suprema failed to establish,by clear and convincing evidence,that claim of the patent is obvious in view of the patent in combination with the patent.id.
the patent,entitled identification device,issued on november.it generally discloses identification devices and more particularly a device which employs optical apparatus for comparing an object to be identified with a preselected image.patent ll.one disclosed embodiment of the identification device is a finger print scanner comprising a light source,a prism,two lenses,a diaphragm,and a focal plane.id.this device is depicted in figure of the patent 
the device is described as follows 
the object to be identified,which may be a human finger on the hand of a person to be identified is positioned on the second face,as at.the light beams pass into the prism perpendicularly to the face,and an image is formed of the fingerprint because the light is reflected between points of contact between the finger and the second face.the reflected light comes out through face of the prism and is focused with an achromatic lens through a diaphragm onto an inclined focal plane.
acromatic lens is the focus of the parties argument,and the passage is the only description of that lens contained in the patent.that is,no details regarding the achromatic lens are given,such as its structure or makeup.this failure to provide constructional data for the achromatic lens,suprema argues,provides motivation to combine the patent with the lens system disclosed in the patent.
turning to that second reference,the patent is entitled bright triplet and was issued on july.it discloses a novel triplet,a triplet lens unit the present invention relates to a bright triplet and,more particularly,to a type triple that has a wide field angle and is bright,so that it is well suited for use on photographic cameras.patent ll.the structure of the disclosed triplet is described in detail.see,id.according to one aspect of the invention,there is provided a bright triplet which comprises,in order from the object side,a first lens consisting of a positive single lens of glass in a meniscus form convex on the object side,a second lens located with an air separation between it and said first lens and consisting of a negative single lens of glass,a third lens located with an air separation between it and said second lens and consisting of a positive single lens of glass in a form,and an aperture stop located on the image side of said third lens,and in which at least two of said first to third lenses are provided with aspherical surfaces.
we agree with the alj that the absence of constructional data regarding the achromatic lens disclosed in the patent provides insufficient motivation for a person of skill in the art to seek out that data from the patent,and that suprema has shown insufficient evidence to substitute the triplet lens disclosed in the patent for the achromatic lens of the patent.as the alj noted,the only pertinent expert testimony provided by suprema was that of its expert,jose manuel sasian alvarado,in which he stated 
q.why would they be motivated to do so combine the patent with the patent 
because of the need to,to create a finger print system.the patent does disclose the constructional data for the achromatic lens.so a person of ordinary skill would have the need to find what the achromatic lens that could be the triple of the patent.
can you explain for me why the lens would need to be replaced in the patent 
because,again,the patent does not disclose the construction of that,so a person needs to put a lens and then that person could very well use the triplet of the patent,because they are lenses.
that a person of skill in the art could very well use the triplet of the patent is insufficient reason for the skilled artisan to specifically seek out the unique lens disclosed in that reference.moreover,the alj found that the patent discloses a lens system that is well suited for photographic cameras,not fingerprint scanners.that finding,we hold,was supported by substantial evidence.the patent itself indicates that the lens it discloses is well suited for use on photographic cameras.patent.ll.thus,suprema adduced insufficient evidence of motivation to substitute the photographic camera triplet lens of the patent for the fingerprint scanner achromatic lens of the patent.moreover,since it gives no description of the achromatic lens structure,there is no indication that the achromatic lens of the patent is a triplet lens or that a triplet lens would be suitable in its place.
accordingly,we affirm the commission holding that suprema failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims of the patent would have been obvious to a person of skill in the art.
for the reasons explained,we vacate the commission judgment regarding infringement of the patent and vacate the limited exclusion order to the extent it was predicated on that finding.we affirm the commission holding that suprema directly infringes the patent,however,and leave intact the exclusion order regarding the realscan and realscan optical systems.
the scope of the exclusion order must thus be adjusted accordingly it appears that only two of the previously identified products may be subject to the order accordingly,we vacate the limited exclusion order and remand for proceedings in accordance with this decision.
we turn now to cross match appeal regarding the patent.the commission fully adopted the alj initial determination regarding this patent the alj found that cross match failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that any suprema accused product infringed the asserted claims of that patent.on appeal,cross match challenges the alj interpretation of the term capture as it appears in the asserted claims of this patent and claims that the alj improper construction of that term led to an incorrect finding.
claim is representative of the asserted claims and states 
a method for reliably capturing print images,comprising 
a initiating camera operation with a scanner 
b scanning a biometric object to obtain a scanned image 
c processing the scanned image 
d determining print quality of individual print images in the scanned image 
e detecting prints in the scanned image and 
f determining whether the scanned image is ready for capture based on an expected number of print images detected in step e and the quality of the print images determined in step d.
cross match proposed to the alj that capture as used in the preamble to and step f of claim means acquiring,by the scanner,for processing or storage.initial determination at.the alj adopted this construction.id.at.and,based on this construction,the alj concluded that suprema products do not infringe the asserted claims because they do not perform steps d and e before the image is acquired for processing or storage,before it is deemed ready for capture and,ultimately,captured.
cross match now suggests that the alj construction of capture was wrong it claims that acquiring,by the scanner,for processing or storage does not require that the scanner perform all steps of the claimed capturing process.instead,cross match argues that the scanner only need be involved in that process.cross match also contends that the scanner need only keep or save the image and that any processing thereof can be done by a computer.based on these interpretations of what it means to capture an image,cross match contends the alj and commission were wrong to conclude that all steps of claim must be performed by a scanner for infringement to occur,and were wrong to conclude that step f of claim the determining whether the scanned image is ready for capture must occur after steps e and d have been performed.
in making these arguments,cross match puts itself in the difficult position of challenging a claim construction it proposed.see tessera int l trade comm n,key pharma.hercon labs,we find highly questionable hercon assertion on appeal that the trial court erred when it adopted the very construction hercon urged upon the court through the testimony of guy.in essence,hercon asserts that the trial court erred by adopting the position it advocated at trial.although the function of an appellate court is to correct errors committed at trial,we look with extreme disfavor on hercon assertion that the trial court committed error in its claim construction.ordinarily,doctrines of estoppel,waiver,invited error,or the like would prohibit a party from asserting as error a position that it had advocated at the trial.and,cross match is in the peculiar situation of asking for a construction of capture in the patent which differs from that which it advocates for the same term in the patent,even though the patent incorporates by reference the patent.indeed,suprema and the commission ask that we resolve cross match appeal on these grounds,finding that it either waived any right to seek a different construction of the term capture before this court,or at least is estopped from doing so.
cross match contends it did not waive its right to make the arguments it develops here because it is not really asking for a new construction it is simply debating how that construction should itself be construed.while cross match position is a stretch it really seems to be unhappy with the construction it proposed and to be asking for something directly at odds with that original construction we need not rely on waiver to affirm the commission finding on the patent because we conclude that the commission finding on the merits was correct.
specifically,we conclude that the alj construction of the term capture is correct and that the alj was correct to conclude that the capture itself,and the preceding determination of whether the image is ready for capture,in the claims of the patent must occur before the scanned image is transferred to a computer.we also hold that the alj infringement finding is supported by substantial evidence.the computer of the accused products performs the checks,steps e and d,with software at some point after the computer receives the image from the scanner.so,in the accused products,those checks necessarily occur sometime after the scanner determines whether the image is ready for capture.
there is no real dispute regarding the construction of capture since the alj adopted cross match proposed construction.we adopt that construction as well capture means acquiring,by the scanner,for processing or storage.we also conclude that the alj was correct to conclude that,under this construction,step f necessarily requires a determination of whether the scanned image is ready for acquiring,by the scanner,based on the number and quality checks of steps e and d.given that claim language,as a matter of logic,those quality checks must precede the determination made under step f,since that step is based on the results from the checks,and,since the scanner ultimately performs the capture,the preceding checks must be performed by the scanner or one of its components.see altiris,symantec,we look to the claim language to determine if,as a matter of logic or grammar,the steps of a method claim must be performed in the order written.
the claim language here plainly requires this construction.see,patent ll.determining whether the scanned image is ready for capture based on the number of prints detected in step e and the quality of the print image determined in step d.emphasis added id.ll.claim adding to claim steps of g capturing the scanned image to obtain a captured image and i forwarding the captured image to a computer.the written description of the patent also supports the view that capture is performed by the scanner and not by a separate computer.id.ll.the method includes capturing the scanned image,processing the captured image,and forwarding the captured image to a computer.a component of the scanner,such as software residing on a computer coupled to the scanner which computer is part of the scanner can perform the scanner functionality,including the step f determination step.see id.ll.in an embodiment of the present invention,scanner includes a controller which includes print capture manager control functionality of print capture manager can be carried out by a computer coupled to the scanner.
because it is undisputed that,in the accused products,the scanner has already transmitted the image to a computer when the purported number and quality checks are performed,the accused products can not perform the method as claimed.accordingly,we hold that the alj finding as to the patent was premised on its correct construction of the term capture and understanding of the scope of claim.we affirm the commission ruling finding no violation of on grounds that no imported articles infringe the asserted claims of the patent.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded in part 
the majority concludes that the international trade commission lacks authority to find a violation of section that is premised on induced infringement where the acts of underlying direct infringement occur.op.at.while i agree with the majority disposition of this case in all other respects,i can not join my colleagues decision to negate the commission statutory authority to stop induced infringement at the border.accordingly,i respectfully and.
this appeal arises out of an investigation into alleged violations of section by suprema a korean company and mentalix located in plano,texas.suprema manufactures fingerprint scanners that it imports and sells for into the united states.to function,suprema scanners must be connected to a separate computer running special software.suprema does not make or sell this software,but provides software development kits sdks that allow its customers to create their own software to operate the scanners.the sdks include utilities that operate various functionalities of the scanners,and also include manuals instructing customers on how to use the sdks.mentalix,one of suprema customers in the united states,imports suprema scanners and sells the scanners after importation,along with software to operate the scanners.mentalix software uses some of the functions included in suprema sdks.
as relevant here,the commission found that suprema scanners,when used with mentalix software,practice a patented method for capturing and processing fingerprints.the commission found mentalix liable for direct infringement for integrating its software with suprema scanners and using the integrated scanners in the united states.the commission also found that suprema actively aided and abetted mentalix infringement by collaborating with mentalix to import the scanners and helping mentalix adapt its software to work with the imported scanners to practice the patented method.finding that suprema willfully blinded itself to the existence of the patent and the infringing nature of the activities it encouraged,the commission held suprema liable for induced infringement under b.accordingly,the commission issued a limited exclusion order banning from entry into the united states articles imported by suprema or mentalix that infringe the patented method.see certain biometric scanning devices,components thereof,associated software,and products containing same,usitc inv.ta,pub,limited exclusion order.
instead of addressing the merits of the commission determination of induced infringement,the majority takes the unnecessary step of addressing the legality of the commission authority to conduct a section investigation that is based on allegations of induced infringement.the majority concludes that the commission did not have authority to issue an exclusion order in this case because the statutory grant of authority in can not extend to the conduct proscribed in b where the acts of underlying direct infringement occ
