background 
burnlounge operated from to and sold music,merchandise,and packages of merchandise.customers could participate in burnlounge in three ways they could buy music and merchandise they could buy a package to become an independent retailer with the ability to earn credits redeemable for music and merchandise or they could buy a package and pay an additional fee to become a mogul with the ability to earn credits redeemable for cash.in,the ftc commenced this action and the parties stipulated to a preliminary injunction that prohibited burnlounge from continuing to operate its mogul program.after a bench trial,the district court concluded that burnlounge and the individual defendants had violated ftca a,issued a permanent injunction,and imposed monetary awards against the defendants.
burnlounge business 
the basics of burnlounge 
the evidence at trial showed that burnlounge business had two primary aspects its retailer program and its mogul program.individuals could become independent retailers of online music by purchasing one of burnlounge three packages basic per year exclusive per year plus per month or vip per year plus per month.each package provided the retailers with access to a ready made and customizable web page,called a burnpage.a burnpage was the vehicle through which retailers sold music,merchandise,or packages of merchandise to customers in return for burnrewards.more expensive packages included more merchandise for personal use by the retailer individuals who participated as retailers could redeem burnrewards for music or merchandise.
retailers could pay an additional monthly fee of to become moguls.once qualified,moguls could redeem burnrewards for cash rather than music or merchandise the mogul program was the only aspect of burnlounge that the district court found to be a pyramid accordingly,this opinion focuses on the mogul program.
burnlounge bonuses 
burnlounge offered moguls the opportunity to earn three types of burnrewards bonuses that could be redeemed for cash.each type of bonus had a separate set of requirements that had to be met before moguls were eligible to receive the bonus.
concentric retail bonuses 
moguls received concentric retail bonuses for music,merchandise,and package sales made through their own burnpage and through the burnpages of their downline recruits.downline recruits included participants recruited by moguls and those recruited by earlier recruits.this sequence created a hierarchy,with those whom a mogul directly recruited in the first ring of the hierarchy,those whom the recruits recruited in the second ring of the hierarchy,and so on,for up to six rings.to qualify for a concentric retail bonus for sales made by recruits in each ring of the hierarchy,a mogul had to sell at least the number of packages corresponding to that ring number.for example,to qualify for concentric retail bonuses for sales made by recruits in the fourth ring,a mougl had to sell at least four packages.the mogul also had to have made a certain number of music album sales in the previous month,and the mogul hierarchy must have made a certain number of album sales in the previous month.
product package bonuses 
moguls received product package bonuses for selling product packages.moguls received these bonuses in increasing amounts for the sale of basic,exclusive,and vip packages,and respectively.to qualify for this bonus,moguls must have sold at least two music albums to in the previous month and have a positive burnrewards account 
mogul team bonuses 
moguls earned mogul team bonuses by accruing mogul team points.mogul team points were accrued by selling premium packages exclusive or vip.once a mogul accrued enough mogul team points,the points were automatically converted into a mogul team bonus paid in burnrewards,which could be converted to cash.the amount of cash earned for each mogul team bonus depended on the type of package the moguls originally purchased and the amount of music the moguls sold.a vip mogul,who paid the yearly fee,could earn a bonus with no additional music sales.an executive mogul,who paid the yearly fee,could earn a bonus,or a bonus if that mogul also sold worth of music.a basic mogul,who paid the yearly fee,was not eligible for a mogul team bonus unless that mogul sold worth of music for a bonus or worth of music for a bonus 
district court proceedings 
after a bench trial,the district court issued a statement of decision.it provides a comprehensive review of burnlounge merchandise,bonus system,and advertising materials.the district court described burnlounge bonus system as a labyrinth of obfuscation.it found there was a failure rate for all moguls,meaning of moguls never recouped their investment.the district court also found that burnlounge marketing focus was on recruiting new participants through the sale of packages.the district court ruled that burnlounge expert,david nolte,provided estimated values of the merchandise in the burnlounge packages that were not credible or supported by the evidence.it found that burnlounge products had some value,but concluded that the evidence did not support a finding that the products were worth what was charged for them.
the district court found that because purchasing a package was required for participation as a retailer or mogul,and because moguls earned cash for selling packages,moguls by default received compensation for recruiting others into the program.the district court concluded that a majority of the burnlounge business consisting of the mogul program and related elements was a pyramid scheme.

iii.discussion 
in webster omnitrition international,our court approved the ftc test for determining whether a multilevel marketing mlm business is a pyramid scheme a pyramid scheme is characterized by the payment by participants of money to the company in return for which they receive the right to sell a product and the right to receive in return for recruiting other participants into the program rewards which are unrelated to sale of the product to ultimate users,cir quoting koscot,at.not all mlm businesses are illegal pyramid schemes.to determine whether a mlm business is a pyramid,a court must look at how the mlm business operates in practice.see id.at see also united states gold unlimited,cir in re amway.
prong participants in the burnlounge business paid money in return for the right to sell a product.
moguls were required to purchase a package basic,exclusive,or vip in order to access a burnpage.burnpages provided moguls with the ability to sell music,merchandise,and packages.the sale of packages thus conveyed the right to sell a product,which satisfies the first prong of omnitrition.at citation omitted.
prong burnlounge participants paid money in return for the right to receive rewards for recruiting other participants into the program,which were unrelated to the sale of the product to ultimate users.
satisfaction of the second prong of the omnitrition test is the sine qua non of a pyramid scheme and is characterized by recruitment with rewards unrelated to product sales.id.at.in omnitrition,this court found that a mlm business was a pyramid scheme because t he mere structure of the scheme suggests that omnitrition focus was in promoting the program rather than selling the products.id.at emphases in original.the ftc has explained that in a pyramid,participants purchase the right to earn profits by recruiting other participants,who themselves are interested in recruitment fees rather than the sale of products.amway,at.
here,the ftc presented ample evidence to support the district court finding that burnlounge was an illegal pyramid scheme.it did so by showing that moguls were required to recruit new members in order to become eligible for all three types of cash bonuses and moguls were motivated by the opportunity to earn cash rewards,as shown by data illustrating the sharp difference in package purchasing patterns of moguls and,and by the fact that burnlounge sales plummeted after the mogul program was enjoined.
we agree with the district court that the ftc provided sufficient evidence to prove that burnlounge focus was recruitment and that the rewards it paid,in the form of cash bonuses,were primarily for recruitment rather than for sales of merchandise.recruiting was built into the compensation structure in that recruiting led to eligibility for cash rewards,and more recruiting led to higher rewards.for example,moguls could not convert their rewards to cash until they became qualified moguls,and moguls had to sell two premium packages to become qualified.selling packages was a way of recruiting new moguls in fact,it was the only form of recruitment because purchasing a package was necessary to become a mogul and earn cash rewards.also,of the participants who bought packages became moguls,which is strong evidence that package purchases were motivated by the opportunity to earn cash.
moguls were required to sell packages to receive concentric retail bonuses at each level of their downline hierarchy.product package bonuses were cash rewards received for selling packages to new members.moguls received more lucrative bonuses if they sold premium packages.moguls were also eligible to receive mogul team points,with the goal of receiving mogul team bonuses,by selling packages to new participants.the district court found that mogul team bonuses were t he most lucrative.this finding is supported by the record in,burnlounge paid a total of in concentric retail bonuses and four times that amount,nearly,in mogul team bonuses.concentric retail bonuses were paid for the sale of music and packages though the bonus was based on only a percentage of the first of each package.in contrast,mogul team points accrued only for the sale of packages,so they primarily rewarded recruiting new participants.the fact that burnlounge paid approximately four times more in mogul team bonuses than concentric retail bonuses supports the district court finding that moguls had a strong incentive to recruit new participants.this incentive was the danger our court warned of in omnitrition,where we stated,the promise of lucrative rewards for recruiting others tends to induce participants to focus on the recruitment side of the business at the expense of their retail marketing efforts,making it unlikely that meaningful opportunities for retail sales will occur.omnitrition,at citing koscot,at.
that burnlounge motivated moguls through cash rewards earned by recruiting other participants is exemplified by the sharp difference between moguls and package purchase patterns.burnlounge own data showed that of moguls bought vip packages,bought exclusive packages,and just bought basic packages.in contrast,of bought vip packages,bought exclusive packages,and bought basic packages.if package purchases were driven by the value of the merchandise included in the packages rather than by the opportunity to earn cash rewards,one would expect to see comparable numbers of moguls and buying the same packages.further,of people did not purchase any of the packages at any time they just bought music and other merchandise.
the district court finding that burnlounge paid rewards for recruitment unrelated to product sales is also supported by the effect the preliminary injunction had on burnlounge revenues.after the parties entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction in july that stopped burnlounge from offering the ability to earn cash rewards,burnlounge revenues plummeted.burnlounge still offered packages,but its revenues decreased from in june to in august.the dramatic decline in revenue after the ability to earn cash rewards was eliminated provides further evidence that the sale of burnlounge packages was primarily directed at participants who were interested in the mogul program,where it was possible to earn cash rewards.
recruiting and rewards for recruitment were integral to burnlounge business structure,and there was ample evidence that moguls were meant to be,and were,primarily motivated by the opportunity to earn cash rewards for recruitment.as in omnitrition,the evidence in this case shows that burnlounge focus was in promoting the program rather than selling the products.omnitrition,at emphases in original.the district court did not err by holding that burnlounge was an illegal pyramid scheme.
the omnitrition test does not require that the rewards be completely unrelated to the sale of products.
burnlounge argues that the second prong of the omnitrition test requires that the rewards be completely unrelated to sales of bona fide products.the second prong of the pyramid test requires the ftc to show that the scheme provides the right to receive in return for recruiting other participants into the program rewards which are unrelated to sale of the product to ultimate users.id.at citation omitted.this test does not require that rewards be completely unrelated to product sales,and burnlounge provides no support for its argument that the test should be interpreted this way.
first,reading completely into the test would be inconsistent with the outcome in omnitrition.see id.at holding omnitrition was likely a pyramid scheme because of its recruitment focus,notwithstanding the fact that omnitrition made some retail sales.
second,courts applying the test have consistently found mlm businesses to be illegal pyramids where their focus was on recruitment and where rewards were paid in exchange for recruiting others,rather than simply selling products.see gold unlimited,at,affirming conviction based on finding that participants bought gold and received cash payments for recruiting others to both buy gold and recruit others to do so,because rewards were paid for recruitment rather than product sales stull ytb int l,gpm,wl,at,denying motion to dismiss where plaintiffs adequately alleged that pyramid existed by showing focus on recruitment and payment of rewards in return for product sales,because buying the product was synonymous with being recruited into the scheme ftc equinox int l,vc s rlh,wl,at,ordering preliminary injunction after finding equinox was likely a pyra
