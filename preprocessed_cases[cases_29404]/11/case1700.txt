the department of alcoholic beverage control department has exclusive licensing authority over entities that sell alcoholic beverages.its procedures for adjudicating whether licensees have violated the terms of their licenses include an evidentiary hearing at which a department prosecutor makes the department case to an administrative law judge alj,and a second level of decisionmaking in which the department director or a delegee decides whether to adopt the alj proposed decision.in the three consolidated cases here,consistent with standard department procedure,the prosecutor prepared a summary of the evidentiary hearing and recommended resolution,which he then provided ex parte to the ultimate decision maker or decision maker advisor.
while the state administrative agencies have considerable leeway in how they structure their adjudicatory functions,they may not disregard certain basic precepts.one fairness principle directs that in adjudicative matters,one adversary should not be permitted to bend the ear of the ultimate decision maker or the decision maker advisors in private.another directs that the functions of prosecution and adjudication be kept separate,carried out by distinct individuals.california administrative procedure act apa,et as overhauled in,adopts these precepts by regulating and strictly limiting contacts between an agency prosecutor and the officers the agency selects to preside over hearings and ultimately decide adjudicative matters.we conclude the department procedure violates the apa bar against ex parte communications.
factual and procedural background 
the department is a unitary agency with the exclusive authority to license the sale of alcoholic beverages in california and to suspend or revoke licenses.cal,art.xx.as a unitary agency,it carries out multiple functions it is in the nature of administrative regulatory agencies that they function both as accuser and adjudicator on matters within their particular jurisdiction.administrative agencies are created to interpret and enforce the legislative enactments applicable to the field in which they operate.that role necessarily involves the administrative agency in both determining whether a licensee is in violation of the law,and taking action to correct such violations.department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals board alq d.
like many state administrative agencies the department exercises its adjudicatory power through a process.in the first trial stage,a department staff attorney,acting as prosecutor,and the licensee present their respective cases to an alj at an evidentiary hearing.the alj then makes factual findings,prepares a proposed decision,and submits it to the department.see,subd.c.in the second decision stage,the department director or a delegee considers the proposed decision and elects to adopt it,modify it,reject it and remand for a new hearing,or reject it and decide the case on the record,subd.c.
the department followed this procedure in each case here.between may and august,the department filed accusations against real parties in interest daniel becerril quintanar,kv mart,and richard leun kim hereafter collectively the licensees.the department alleged quintanar bartender sold beer to an obviously intoxicated customer and alleged clerks who worked for kv mart and kim both sold alcoholic beverages to a decoy.in each case,at the trial stage,the alj considered the department and licensee evidence and argument and issued a proposed decision dismissing the accusation,which was then referred to the department for final action.
after the close of each administrative hearing but before the department rendered its decision,the department prosecutor prepared a report of hearing,a form document,and apparently sent it to the department chief counsel,but not to any of the licensees.as we will discuss,the reports of hearing prepared in these three cases are not part of the records,but copies of the generic form are.the generic form provides space for the prosecutor to summarize the issues and the evidence presented at the hearing and to recommend,with supporting reasons,a particular disposition of the case.
in each case,the department rejected the alj proposed decision to dismiss the accusation and substituted its own decision,suspending the licenses of kim,quintanar,and kv mart for periods of,and days,respectively.
the licensees appealed these adverse decisions to the alcoholic beverage control appeals board board,a separate entity with limited appellate jurisdiction over the department decisions.see cal,art.xx,bus.they contended the department had violated their due process rights because the decision maker,the department chief counsel,was the prosecutor supervisor and a biased advocate rather than a neutral decision maker.
in connection with their appeals,the licensees each filed a motion to augment the record,seeking all documents available to the chief counsel at the time the department rendered its decision,including the reports of hearing.in opposition,the department argued the documents sought were protected by the privilege and work product doctrine and,in any event,the board lacked authority to augment the record.the board granted the motion in each case and ordered the department to file its reports of hearing under seal within days.the department refused.instead,after the time for production had expired,the department reasserted its privilege claim and told the board it would not acquiesce in the board order without further proof of legal authority supporting it.thus,the reports of hearing do not appear in the record.
the board heard argument in these three matters and reversed the department decisions.the board concluded the department failure to screen its decision maker and the decision maker advisors from communications with its prosecutors deprived the licensees of the right to a fair trial by a fair tribunal and constituted a due process violation.the board also found the report of hearing was an ex parte communication between an agency decision maker or decision maker advisor the department chief counsel and a party the department prosecutor prohibited under the apa,and the department had violated the apa by failing to make the report part of the administrative record,notify the parties of its inclusion,and allow the licensees an opportunity to respond.
the department sought writ relief see bus,but the court of appeal affirmed.it concluded the manner in which the department had conducted its administrative hearings created an unacceptable risk of bias and unfairness.the court of appeal held the department practice of having the agency prosecutor prepare a report of hearing,including a recommended outcome,and forward it to the department chief counsel while a final department decision was still pending,violated the licensees due process rights.it ordered the department to institute screening procedures preventing the agency prosecutor from communicating with the ultimate decision maker and any advisors while a proceeding was still pending and to henceforth exclude the report of hearing from the materials reviewed by the department decision maker.
we granted review to address how the apa and due process clause apply to a unitary administrative agency that combines prosecutorial and adjudicative functions in resolving administrative matters.like the court of appeal,we confine our review to the question whether the department has proceeded in the manner required by law.cal,art.xx,bus,subd.b see walsh kirby cal d.
discussion 
i.the california administrative procedure act 
does the apa permit ex parte contacts between an agency prosecutor and its ultimate decision maker or his or her advisors about the substance of the case,prior to the ultimate decision maker rendering a final decision we conclude it does not.
a.the apa historical background 
california original apa stats,ch,was pioneering but limited.california new apa,supra,tulsa at,see generally hohreiter garrison d.it applied principally to licensing cases and covered only certain aspects of administrative practice.in particular,it said nothing about either ex parte communications or agency separation of functions recommendation administrative adjudication by state agencies cal.law revision com,hereafter recommendation california new apa,supra,tulsa at.a amendment added restrictions on ex parte contacts with alj during the trial stage for some agencies,but continued to leave unregulated such contacts with agency heads during the decision stage.see former,added by stats,ch,recommendation,cal.law revision com,supra,at california new apa,supra,tulsa at.in the absence of regulation,agency heads were free to discuss adjudicatory matters with whomever they pleased,both inside and outside the agency,subject only to whatever indefinite limits due process might impose 
in,the legislature directed the california law revision commission commission to study administrative adjudication and propose reforms to the apa.conc.res,stats.reg.sess.res.ch,par,see recommendation,cal.law revision com,supra,at california new apa,supra,tulsa at,fn.after seven years,the commission came back with extensive recommendations.it declared fundamental fairness in decisionmaking demands both that factual inputs and arguments to the decisionmaker on law and policy be made openly and be subject to argument by all parties.recommendation,cal.law revision com,supra,at.consistent with this view,the commission proposed an administrative adjudication bill of rights,which inter alia would require state agencies to limit reliance on ex parte contacts in their decisionmaking and adopt some internal separation of functions.senate bill reg.sess.adopted the commission proposed administrative adjudication bill of rights virtually unchanged,including its limits on ex parte contacts article and its internal separation of function provisions articles and.
b.the apa ex parte and separation of function provisions 
article,modeled on provisions of the federal administrative procedure act and the model state administrative procedure act see california new apa,supra,tulsa at,broadly prohibits ex parte contacts between parties,including agency parties,and decision makers during administrative adjudicative proceedings.while the proceeding is pending there shall be no communication,direct or indirect,regarding any issue in the proceeding,to the presiding officer from an employee or representative of an agency that is a party without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate in the communication,subd.a,italics added.a presiding officer is defined as an officer who presides over an evidentiary hearing,but other provisions of article expressly extend this prohibition to all decision makers,including agency heads and their delegees,whether or not they preside over an evidentiary hearing subject to subdivision b governing ratemaking proceedings,the provisions of this article governing ex parte communications to the presiding officer also govern ex parte communications in an adjudicative proceeding to the agency head or other person or body to which the power to hear or decide in the proceeding is delegated,subd.a.the commission comments to section reiterate that section expands section scope this provision section also applies to the agency head,or other person or body to which the power to hear or decide is delegated.see section application of provisions to agency head or other person.cal.law revision com,west ann.foll.
other provisions slightly narrow section blanket prohibition.two are pertinent here.first,communications are permitted regarding uncontroversial procedural matters,subd.b.second,an agency decision maker may receive advice from nonadversarial agency personnel an otherwise prohibited ex parte communication will be allowed if it is for the purpose of assistance and advice to the presiding officer from a person who has not served as investigator,prosecutor,or advocate in the proceeding or its preadjudicative stage.an assistant or advisor may evaluate the evidence in the record but shall not furnish,augment,diminish,or modify the evidence in the record,subd.a.none of the exceptions permit prosecutors and other adversarial agency employees to have contact about substantive issues with the agency head,or anyone to whom the agency head delegates decisionmaking authority,during the pendency of an adjudicative proceeding.thus,the apa sets out a clear rule an agency prosecutor can not secretly communicate with the agency decision maker or the decision maker advisor about the substance of the case prior to issuance of a final decision 
this rule enforces two important procedural precepts.first,it promotes neutral decisionmaking by requiring a limited internal separation of functions.procedural fairness does not mandate the dissolution of unitary agencies,but it does require some internal separation between advocates and decision makers to preserve neutrality.see howitt superior court th,d a different issue is presented,however,where advocacy and decisionmaking roles are combined.by definition,an advocate is a partisan for a particular client or point of view.the role is inconsistent with true objectivity,a constitutionally necessary characteristic of an adjudicator see also nightlife partners,city of beverly hills th,d toward a new california apa,supra,ucla.at,reprinted at cal.law revision com,supra,at.second,the rule preserves record exclusivity.the decision of the agency head should be based on the record and not on discussions from which the parties are excluded.cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll,see also english city of long beach cal d,t he right of a hearing before an administrative tribunal would be meaningless if the tribunal were permitted to base its determination upon information received without the knowledge of the parties.
the department takes issue with this rule.it argues that even under the revised apa,limits on ex parte communications extend only to communications during the trial stage,not to those during the decision stage.the department reasons that section limits contacts with agency heads and other decision makers only during adjudicative proceeding s,subd.a,an adjudicative proceeding is defined as an evidentiary hearing for determination of facts pursuant to which an agency formulates and issues a decision,and thus agency heads and their delegees are limited in their contacts only when they preside over evidentiary hearings.after the close of the evidentiary hearing,according to the department,the agency prosecutor may secretly advise the agency head without violating any apa proscription.
we are not persuaded.we do not construe statutory language in isolation,but rather as a thread in the fabric of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.carrisales department of corrections cal th,d.section expressly qualifies the applicability of the apa definitions unless the provision or context requires otherwise,the definitions in this article govern the construction of this chapter.italics added.here,as we shall explain,the context of the rest of article and the legislative history behind it make clear section,subdivision a was not intended to incorporate the narrow section definition of adjudicative proceeding,but was intended to apply more broadly to limit ex parte contacts in all nonratemaking proceedings that employ an evidentiary hearing in the course of adjudicating the rights of a single party.
as originally introduced,section provided in total the provisions of this article governing ex parte communications to the presiding officer also govern ex parte communications to the agency head or other person or body to which the power to decide in the proceeding is delegated.bill reg.sess,as introduced.this version clearly extended the limit on ex parte communications from the administrative hearing trial stage to the final decision stage.
as drafted,however,the provision would have prohibited ex parte contacts in individual ratemaking proceedings.see cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll,r ate making and licensing determinations of specific application,addressed to named or particular parties such as a certain power company or a certain licensee,are decisions subject to this chapter.the section was subsequently amended,not to confine its application to the trial stage,but to clarify that it did not extend to individual ratemaking proceedings.the original version of section was redesignated as subdivision a,language limiting it to an adjudicative proceeding was inserted,and a new subdivision b was added,providing an ex parte communication to the agency head or other person or body to which the power to decide is delegated is permissible in an individualized ratemaking proceeding if the content of the communication is disclosed on the record and all parties are given an opportunity to address it in the manner provided in section.bill reg.sess,as amended,italics added.the author,senator kopp,explained this technical amendment responds to so uthern cal ifornia edison concern that the ex parte communication prohibition should not apply in rulemaking sic ratemaking proceeding s gov t code amended to allow ex parte communication in individualized ratemaking proceeding if disclosed on the record and parties have an opportunity to comment.this is the approach used by puc.kopp,appropriations,amendments to bill reg.sess,see also recommendation,cal.law revision com,supra,at california new apa,supra,tulsa at fn.thus,the adjudicative proceeding limit in section,subdivision a was added as a way to distinguish individual ratemaking proceedings not covered from individual nonratemaking proceedings covered,apparently without heed to the of adjudicative proceeding in section.
the commission comments to section,which further defines the extent of permissible contacts,likewise reflect the understanding that the limits on contacts with agency heads and other decision makers apply at both the trial stage and the decision stage the comments note this provision is not limited to agency personnel,but includes participants in the proceeding not employed by the agency.a deputy attorney general who prosecuted the case at the administrative trial level,for example,would be precluded from advising the agency head or other decision maker delegated the power to hear or decide at the final decision level,except with regard to settlement matters.cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll,italics added.
the more general legislative history behind senate bill reg.sess.also demonstrates that the concerns of the commission and legislature extended beyond ex parte contacts with alj issuing proposed decisions to ex parte contacts with the true,ultimate decision makers,the agency heads and their delegees.the commission proposed proscribing ex parte communications with all agency decision makers,not just hearing officers.recommendation,cal.law revision com,supra,at.more specifically,as professor asimow explained in the study that was submitted to the legislature with the commission proposed reforms,an advocacy role could distort the advice one gave and thus it was critical to limit advice given by adversaries to the ultimate decision maker while a final decision was being made.toward a new california apa,supra,ucla.at,reprinted at cal.law revision com,supra,at.principles of fairness dictated that these final decisions should flow exclusively from the record,not from submissions by either side.toward a new california apa,supra,ucla.at,reprinted at cal.law revision com,supra,at.
the legislature adopted article without significant change,and the committee reports describing the understanding of that article reflect equal concern with ex parte contacts at the trial and decision stages.senate bill was intended to prohibit contacts with agency decision makers at all stages.assem.appropriations,on bill reg.sess.as amended july,bill p rohibits communications with the decision maker in all state agency proceedings of finance,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,the proposed law would prohibit ex parte communications with the decision maker in all state agency proceedings.current law prohibits ex parte contact with an alj employed by the office of administrative hearings,but is silent as to ex parte communications to agency heads.
the department construction would render superfluous section,subdivision a extension of the limits on ex parte contacts to contacts with agency heads.presiding officers,including agency heads who serve as presiding officers,are already constrained from engaging in ex parte communications elsewhere in article,subd.a no ex parte contacts with presiding officer presiding officer includes agency head who presides over an adjudicative proceeding.if an agency head is constrained only when he or she serves as a presiding officer,section,subdivision a has no function.as is well settled,we will avoid constructions such as this that render statutory language surplusage.elsner uveges cal th,d.
the department points to section and the commission related comments,which it asserts give it wide latitude to structure its adjudicative proceedings as it sees fit,in support of its argument that its prosecutors may advise its decision makers section is beside the point.the department may structure its decisionmaking however it sees fit,so long as it complies with the apa and related statutory and constitutional minimums.nothing in either the superseded or current version of section purports to authorize procedures that run afoul of proscriptions spelled out elsewhere in the government code.
finally,the department relies on department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals board alq,supra,d,as approving its use of a confidential report of hearing procedure.in alq,a licensee sought discovery of any reports of hearing or other communications between hearing staff and the department decision makers.the board held due process required disclosure of these communications,but the court of appeal reversed.it concluded due process did not authorize an inquiry by the board into the agency decision makers reasoning,the material the licensee sought was irrelevant to the proceedings,and the board lacked jurisdiction to require the department to disclose any communications.id.at.
alq was decided years before the overhaul of the apa.where previously the apa was silent on the subject of communications with agency decision makers,now it regulates them.the board is authorized to determine whether the d epartment has proceeded in the manner required by law cal,art.xx,bus,subd.b as such,it has jurisdiction to determine whether the department has complied with statutes such as the apa.alq was decided on due process grounds,but insofar as it may be read more broadly to authorize contacts between an agency prosecutor and its ultimate decision maker,or preclude board or court inquiry into the occurrence of such contacts,it has been superseded by statute.
application of the apa to reports of hearing 
the administrative adjudication bill of rights provisions of the apa apply to department license suspension hearings.see,provisions apply whenever evidentiary hearing is required by statute or constitutional right bus,providing for license suspension hearing irvine state bd.of equalization d,liquor license can not be suspended or revoked without hearing.
did the department prosecutor and the department final decision maker or advisor have an impermissible ex parte contact the board and the court of appeal inferred as much.the department refusal to comply with the board order and produce its reports of hearing from these three cases leaves us somewhat in the dark however,the department concedes a report of hearing was prepared in each case.at oral argument,it further conceded that the final decision in each case was made by either the department director or its chief counsel,and that both had access to the reports of hearing.in light of these concessions,we consider it established that the reports of hearing were provided to the agency decision maker.
the department argues the record contains no proof the reports of hearing were actually considered by the ultimate decision maker or his advisors,but neither does it deny this occurred.whether the decision maker considered the reports of hearing is in any event beside the point.on the one hand,proof as to how a particular ex parte contact
