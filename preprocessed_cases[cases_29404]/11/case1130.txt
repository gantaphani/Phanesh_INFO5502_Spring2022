background 
the facts of this case are relatively and not in dispute.the manasters desired to move their household goods,consisting mainly of fine arts and antiques,from chicago to phoenix.they requested a quote from pickens.pickens,in turn,requested a quote from nonparty tci a freight broker.tci then requested a quote from atlas.atlas provided tci with a quote based on the minimum tariff of per pound.tci then submitted the quote to pickens with the notation that the quote did not include insurance.pickens submitted a quote to the manasters.the manasters requested million in insurance coverage and the rate was adjusted accordingly.pickens contracted with tci,who contracted with atlas for the shipment at the per pound rate,but pickens never informed tci or atlas of the million valuation.
on november,atlas picked up the manasters household goods from the pickens warehouse.the atlas bill of lading was signed by pickens representative as shipper and by atlas driver as carrier,and it listed the manasters as the consignee.the bill of lading had a valuation section on its first page as follows 
valuation the released rates for shipments moving under this bill of lading vary with the services provided under the tariff and carrier tariff is incorporated into this bill of lading for determination of which released rate applies.shipper has released the entire shipment to a value not exceeding 
to be completed by the shipper signing below 
the maximum released rate set forth in the tariff for shipments on which specified services are being provided,which may be either per pound per article or per pound.this is not insurance but a limit on carrier liability.
the declared value for the property of.if this amount exceeds the maximum released rate in the tariff,carrier shall obtain insurance in the amount on shipper behalf for the charges set forth in the tariff.
if no declaration is made,the shipment shall be deemed released to the value set forth in the tariff.
pickens representative signed the bill of lading but did not choose either option and did not indicate a declared value for the property.
pickens also had a bill of lading for warehouse labor.in the signature block of the bill of lading,pickens representative signed as the carrier and atlas driver signed as the shipper.the valuation section of the bill of lading read 
shipper must complete this valuation designation 
unless the shipper expressly releases the shipment to a value of per pound per article,the mover maximum liability for loss of or damage to the shipment shall be an amount equal to for each pound of weight in the shipment or the lump sum value declared by the shipper on this form,whichever is greater,subject to the valuation charges in the applicable tariff on file with the illinois commerce commission.
if the shipper wishes to avoid these additional charges,the shipper must agree that if any articles are lost or damaged,the mover liability will not exceed cents per pound for the actual weight for any lost or damaged article or articles in the shipment.
the shipment shall move subject to the rules and conditions of the mover tariff.shipper hereby releases the entire shipment to a value not exceeding.
again,the valuation section of the bill of lading was left blank.
the manasters property was destroyed by fire during transport while in the custody of atlas.pacific paid the manasters claim in full for million and was subrogated to their interests.pacific then filed suit in the district court of arizona for carrier liability under the carmack amendment against both pickens and atlas.pickens and atlas against each other also for carrier liability pacific moved for summary judgment against pickens and atlas.pickens moved for summary judgment against atlas.atlas moved for partial summary judgment against pacific and pickens to limit its liability.
the district court held that atlas was liable to both pacific and pickens for or per pound,and that pickens was liable to pacific for million.pickens moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied.pickens also moved for reasonable expenses from atlas.the district court granted that motion,holding that pickens,as the prevailing party,was entitled to recover the entirety of its expenses from atlas.pickens appealed from the judgment,specifically the apportionment of damages.atlas separately appealed the judgment,specifically the award of costs to pickens.the appeals were consolidated and are now before the court.
the carmack amendment is a part of the interstate commerce act,which provides the exclusive cause of action for interstate shipping contract claims.white mayflower transit,cir.two sections of the carmack amendment are at issue in this case.the first is f,entitled limiting liability of household goods carriers to declared value.the section reads 
in general.a carrier or group of carriers subject to jurisdiction under subchapter i or iii of chapter may petition the board to modify,eliminate,or establish rates for the transportation of household goods under which the liability of the carrier for that property is limited to a value established by written declaration of the shipper or by a written agreement.
full value protection obligation.unless the carrier receives a waiver in writing under paragraph,a carrier maximum liability for household goods that are lost,damaged,destroyed,or otherwise not delivered to the final destination is an amount equal to the replacement value of such goods,subject to a maximum amount equal to the declared value of the shipment and to rules issued by the surface transportation board and applicable tariffs.
application of rates.the released rates established by the board under paragraph commonly known as released rates shall not apply to the transportation of household goods by a carrier unless the liability of the carrier for the full value of such household goods under paragraph is waived,in writing,by the shipper.
f.in,congress added subsections and,which form the basis of pickens argument.the interpretation of these subsections is a matter of first impression 
the second provision of the carmack amendment at issue here is the cost apportionment provision which reads 
the carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading under subsection a of this section or delivering the property for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property,as evidenced by a receipt,judgment,or transcript,and the amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.
b.we have not addressed the possible apportionment of costs among carriers.it is also a matter of first impression.
replacement value of household goods 
on summary judgment,the district court held that atlas was liable to both pacific and pickens for or per pound,and that pickens was liable to pacific for million.pickens does not appeal the assessment of liability itself,rather it argues that the apportionment
