we review the granting of a summary judgment in favor of and respondent bank of america,bofa on the of appellant amerus life insurance company amerus alleging a conversion cause of action.the underlying lawsuit arose out of a fraud perpetrated by defendant richard shear against an elderly widow named maxine levy,trustee of the levy family trust.in the period from late through the summer of,shear,an independent life insurance agent,persuaded levy to buy in annuity life insurance policies from amerus.however,instead of remitting her three checks to amerus,shear deposited the checks made payable to amerus into his own corporate bofa accounts.as part of his fraud,shear provided levy with forged or fake annuity policies.after levy died in,the successor trustee and beneficiary,norma berneman plaintiff,filed a claim on the policies with amerus.amerus denied the claims because it had no knowledge of any such policies.in july,plaintiff sued shear,amerus,bofa,and others on a variety of claims to recover the losses arising out of the wrongfully paid checks.shear,however,could not be located.
on december,amerus filed its against bofa for conversion of the checks,alleging that by paying them into shear accounts over his fraudulent endorsements,bofa exercised wrongful dominion over amerus property interest as payee of the checks.bofa moved for summary judgment on the ground that the conversion claim was barred by the statute of limitations under code of civil procedure,section,subdivision c,and california uniform commercial code ucc,section,subdivision g.the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of bofa on an alternative ground,and amerus filed a timely appeal from that ruling.as the uncontroverted facts show that amerus conversion claim was,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
as is relevant to this appeal,plaintiff sought to recover against the various defendants for wrongful payment of the three checks,each made payable to amerus and deposited into shear bofa,dated december,paid january,check,dated december,paid february,and check,dated july,paid july.shear and his wife had opened two accounts at an arizona branch of bofa in the name of their corporation,life insurance marketing.these were not trust accounts.according to amerus,life insurance marketing,was a nonexistent corporation.in,bofa designated that the corporate owner of those accounts was doing business as the new england,american mutual life.at that time,amerus operated as american mutual life.
according to the operative pleadings in late and early,the levy was engaged in estate planning efforts with her attorney,isaac berneman,who introduced her to shear for the purpose of obtaining an annuity investment for levy trust.shear convinced levy to purchase a flexible premium deferred annuity insurance policy from amerus.the policy did not provide annual payments.rather,it guaranteed a percent return,with accumulated interest to be automatically reinvested.the policy would become payable in full upon levy birthday or her death,whichever came first.levy delivered to shear two checks payable to amerus for that purpose.levy subsequently received by mail a document dated march,purporting to be a annuity policy.
according to amerus evidence,the policy was a forgery.on approximately march,amerus received an application for a annuity policy on behalf of the levy trust with isaac berneman as trustee.that application was accompanied by a cashier check from bofa for the premium payment,issued on behalf of the levy trust.amerus issued a annuity policy to the levy trust,which it delivered to isaac berneman as trustee.because amerus never received an application for the supposed annuity policy or any premium payment in that amount,it did not issue any such policy.
the documentary evidence submitted by amerus shows that levy issued a check,dated december,which was made out to american mutual.shear originally endorsed it on january,with a stamp life insurance marketing,and deposited the check into one of his bofa accounts.the check was initially rejected by plaintiff bank with the notation endorsement not as drawn.shear,however,it on january,by writing american mutual over the stamped endorsement and the check into one of his bofa accounts.levy issued another check,payable to amerus,dated december.shear endorsed it on february,with the same stamp and by writing american mutual over it and deposited the check into one of his bofa accounts.
on july,levy issued check,payable to american mutual.shear endorsed it on july,in the same manner and deposited it into one of his bofa accounts.as before,levy received by mail a document purporting to be an annuity policy from amerus,this time in the amount of and dated july.according to amerus evidence,the policy was a forgery.as amerus never received an application or premium payment for such a policy,it never issued one.
according to amerus evidence,it never gave shear authority to endorse,negotiate,or deposit checks payable to amerus.it has never given its independent agents or brokers such authority.the only contractual arrangement between shear and amerus was a general agents contract,which classified shear as an independent contractor,granted him the authority to collect the first premium only and required him to promptly remit the premium to amerus.further,amerus had no knowledge of,or interest in,shear bofa accounts amerus had no accounts of its own at bofa.finally,amerus never authorized bofa to permit shear to use amerus name on any bofa account.
levy died in july.on march,plaintiff filed a death claim with amerus under the supposed two annuity policies.amerus denied the request on the ground that it had never received applications or payments for either policy,and the only policy it ever issued to the levy trust was the annuity policy.amerus informed plaintiff that the other two policies were forgeries.plaintiff accepted payment on the policy.
plaintiff complaint was filed on july.in its second amended against bofa,amerus alleged that in specified paragraphs of the underlying complaint,plaintiff had claimed that amerus alone or in concert with bofa was liable for damages arising out of shear disposal of the three levy checks.amerus denied liability to plaintiff,but alleged that if it were found liable to plaintiff on the underlying complaint,then bofa would be liable to amerus under ucc section for the conversion of the levy checks made payable to amerus.amerus specifically alleged that shear fraudulently endorsed the levy checks,which were payable to amerus predecessor in interest,american mutual life insurance company.invoking ucc section,amerus alleged that if shear were found to be amerus agent for purposes of receiving delivery of the levy checks,then bofa would be liable to amerus for converting the checks.bofa asserted a variety of affirmative defenses,including that the conversion claim was pursuant to the limitations periods in code of civil procedure sections,subdivision,and,and ucc sections,subdivision g,and.bofa also against amerus for indemnity and damages under a third party tort theory.
bofa moved for summary judgment against plaintiff and amerus,while amerus moved simultaneously for summary judgment against plaintiff and bofa.the trial court granted bofa motions against both parties.it also denied amerus motion against bofa,but granted amerus summary adjudication motion on various claims as to plaintiff.although bofa primary argument in favor of summary judgment against amerus was that the conversion claim was,the trial court granted relief on a different theory.invoking the federal appellate authority of in re produce,cir,the trial court found that bofa could not have converted the levy checks because amerus authorized shear as its agent to negotiate the checks.consistent with the applicable standard of review,we do not assess the propriety of the trial court reasoning because bofa affirmative defense,based on the statute of limitations,was fully addressed below and is dispositive of this appeal 
after the summary judgment rulings,but before entry of judgment against amerus,bofa settled its remaining claims with plaintiff in exchange for waivers of costs and dismissals with prejudice.over amerus objection,the trial court granted bofa motion for a good faith settlement determination.sometime after the summary judgment ruling,amerus and plaintiff settled their claims against each other.plaintiff request for dismissal with prejudice as to amerus was filed on august,about one month after amerus filed its notice of appeal.
discussion 
amerus conversion claim is barred by the statute of limitations 
bofa,relying on the general rule that an instrument is converted when it is paid to an unauthorized person,argues that the statute of limitations began to run in,when bofa paid the checks into shear accounts.accordingly,the limitations period expired more than three years before amerus filed its in december.amerus counters that its conversion claim could not have accrued until it suffered damages,which it asserts could not occur until it incurred monetary liability to plaintiff on the checks.that is,amerus argues that because it never issued any policies in exchange for the checks,it had no interest in the checks at the time bofa paid never suffered any damages until,when amerus entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiff after the trial court ruled on the summary judgment motions.
as we explain below,while that argument is carefully constructed,it is ultimately untenable and.to prevail on a conversion claim against bofa,amerus needed to establish that it had a possessory interest in the checks from the time levy delivered the checks to shear to the time bofa deposited them into shear account.unfortunately for amerus,if shear was amerus agent at the time of conversion and if amerus was the rightful must be the case for bofa to be potentially liable under ucc section the conversion claim accrued at the time of negotiation in and there is no basis for equitable tolling of the statute.therefore,the conversion claim is as a matter of law.
the standard of review is well settled.as our supreme court instructs,the party moving for summary judgment always bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.a triable issue of material fact exists if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.ibid.as,bofa bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.citation.ibid.
in other words,i f a party moving for summary judgment in any action would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination,then he should prevail on summary judgment.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.in determining the propriety of a summary judgment,the trial court is limited to facts shown by the evidentiary materials submitted,as well as those admitted and uncontested in the pleadings.citations.the court must consider all evidence set forth in the parties papers,and summary judgment is to be granted if all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue of material fact in the action,thereby entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.citation.citation.s ummary judgment shall not be granted based on inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,if contradicted by other inferences or evidence,which raise a triable issue as to any material fact.citations.elcome chin th,d.
on appeal,our review is de novo,and we independently review the record before the trial court.citation.the trial court stated reasons for granting summary judgment are not binding on us because we review its ruling,not its rationale.elcome chin,supra,th at,d,quoting kids universe th,d.
amerus conversion claim under ucc section is governed by a limitations period.ucc section,subdivision g provides that actions for conversion of an instrument shall be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues.as the ucc commentary makes clear,however,section does not define when a cause of action accrues.accrual of a cause of action is stated in other sections of article such as those that state the various obligations of parties to an instrument,pt.west.ed.foll.we therefore look to the california uniform commercial code provision defining instrument determine when a conversion claim accrues.that section provides the law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments,and an instrument is also converted if a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.ucc,subd.a.
under code of civil procedure,section,subdivision c,which applies to the conversion of personal property,there is a limitations period for action s for taking,detaining,or injuring any goods or chattels.under california law,the general rule is well established t he statute of limitations for conversion is triggered by the act of wrongfully taking property.bono clark th,d strasberg odyssey group,th,d strasberg it is the act of wrongfully taking the property which triggers the statute of limitations,citing coy hutton d,and first national bk.thompson d,see also rose d.
to the extent our courts have recognized a discovery rule exception to toll the statute,it has only been when the defendant in a conversion action fraudulently conceals the relevant facts or where the defendant fails to disclose such facts in violation of his or her fiduciary duty to the plaintiff.in those instances,the statute of limitations does not commence to run until the aggrieved party discovers or ought to have discovered the existence of the cause of action for conversion.strasberg,supra,th at,d see bennett hibernia bank cal d,sears rule cal d,hobart hobart estate cal d.amerus can not take advantage of this limited discovery rule exception because there is no evidence that bofa or any of its agents was guilty of fraudulent concealment,much less that bofa owed a fiduciary duty of disclosure to amerus.
of course,there is evidence that shear fraudulently concealed the relevant facts from amerus.however,in order to state a claim for conversion under ucc section,amerus must prove that shear was its own agent for purposes of amerus could not establish the element of possession that is necessary to prevail on that cause of action.under ucc section,for a payee like amerus to recover for conversion of an instrument,the payee must have actual or constructive possession of the stolen instrument bearing the payee name.white summers,uniform commercial code ed,at white summers.an action under ucc section may not be brought by a payee who does not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a copayee.ucc,subd.a.there can be no conversion action until the check is delivered to the payee because until delivery,the payee is not a holder and has no property interest in the check.software design application,hoefer arnett,th,d.the official comment to ucc section makes it clear that delivery of a check to an agent for the payee is delivery to the payee and thus gives the payee a caused of action if the check is stolen.white summers,supra,at.
