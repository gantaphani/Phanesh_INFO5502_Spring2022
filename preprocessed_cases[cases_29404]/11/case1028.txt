gas aggregation services,gsi appeals from an order of the district court vacating portions of an arbitration panel award.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
gsi is a minnesota corporation that operates as a natural gas marketing company,specializing in providing natural gas needs of utilities in minnesota and elsewhere.gsi contracts for the purchase and sale of gas and for transfer and storage from the producers or owners of the gas to purchasers.howard avista energy llc,and howard energy marketing,howard are delaware corporations with their principal place of business in michigan.howard is a full service gas trading company which buys and sells large quantities of natural gas as a commodity and also provides gas supply services to utilities,marketers,and industrial customers in michigan and elsewhere.
in,gsi and howard entered into a series of four joint venture transactions,combining gsi expertise in natural gas storage and transportation with howard ability to provide credit and act as guarantor for these transactions.natural gas volumes to service the joint ventures were to come from gsi or from howard as circumstances required and availability dictated.gsi and howard frequently transferred natural gas between themselves from one to the other to service the joint ventures.in addition,gsi and howard also engaged in several isolated sales of natural gas between each other that were unrelated to the joint ventures.
in the course of carrying out these joint ventures,disputes arose between gsi and howard concerning responsibilities of each of the parties,and concerning the sales price of natural gas transfers between the parties.
in april,gsi filed suit against howard in district court claiming breach of contract,fraud,violation of the minnesota consumer fraud act,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and contractual relations,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion of partnership business opportunities,conversion,demand for accounting,and unjust enrichment.gsi and howard subsequently entered into an agreement to submit the dispute to binding arbitration.the agreement provided all claims in this action and among the parties shall be arbitrated by a panel.pursuant to this agreement,each party chose a selected representative arbitrator,and by agreement selected a third neutral member who was an expert in natural gas sales and transportation.
the parties presented evidence and arguments to the arbitration panel through briefs and five days of hearings.the panel issued an award and dissent on july.a supplemental award and dissent for attorneys fees,costs,and interest was issued on september,finding in favor of gsi on all issues.the panel awarded gsi as its share of profits for the parties joint ventures as the proper balance on its trading account as consequential damages for the loss of gsi business as interest on an nsp receivable in reasonable attorneys fees in costs of arbitration for miscellaneous costs and prejudgment interest of.
gsi moved the district court to confirm the arbitration award.howard filed a motion to vacate four specific portions of the arbitration award relating to the general trading account the loss of business damages attorneys fees,costs,and interest,and an nsp receivable.howard argued that the award failed to draw its essence from the subject contracts,exhibited a manifest disregard of the law,failed to make a final and complete resolution of the dispute,and wholly lacked support in the record.
the district court vacated the portions of the award dealing with the general trading account,the loss of business damages,and the attorneys fees,costs and interest,on the grounds that the award failed to draw its essence from the contract,manifested a disregard of the applicable law,and did not make a final determination of the issues with respect to attorneys fees,costs,and interest.
gsi timely appealed the district court order.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review a district court decision to vacate an arbitration award de novo.executive life ins.of new york alexander ins,cir.
ii.discussion 
the district court vacated significant portions of the arbitration panel award,finding that the panel ignored unambiguous terms of the underlying contract.the central issue before this court is the determination of what contract,if any,governs the parties dispute.in its findings,the district court cites one of howard general provisions documents as containing the controlling contractual language as to the issues concerning the general trading account and loss of business damages.gsi argues that the issues regarding the parties general trading account balance and the loss of business damages flowed from howard behavior within the parties joint venture activities,and were not connected to a single gas transaction,for which the transaction confirmations were generated.accordingly,gsi disagrees that these documents controlled any of the issues that flowed from their joint venture relationship,and,in addition,contends these documents were inaccurate.
gsi argues that the arbitration panel did not address this issue in their award because it was not raised during the arbitration it is significant that the panel did not identify this as an issue for arbitration.that omission supports gsi assertion that this was not identified as an issue or argued before the arbitration panel.
further,the general provisions document which howard cites as being controlling,contains an arbitration clause this clause provides for binding arbitration of any dispute concerning the interpretation of the general provisions document by a sole arbitrator,and requires an arbitrator to hear the case and render a decision within days of appointment.significantly,this clause was not invoked.instead,after gsi filed suit in district court,the parties voluntarily stipulated to arbitration of all issues by a panel of three,which took greater than days to hear the case and render its decision.this further supports gsi assertion that prior to their motion to vacate the award,howard did not argue that the general provisions contract was controlling as to the general trade account or the issue of limitation of damages for loss of business.
standard of review of arbitrators awards 
a court review of an arbitration award is very limited.lee chica,cir.where parties agree to arbitrate,a court can not substitute a judicial determination for the arbitrator decision.united paperworkers int l union,misco,d.courts may not review the merits of an arbitration award even though the parties may allege that the award rests on errors of fact or on misinterpretation of the contract.bureau of engraving,graphic communication int l union,local,cir quoting misco,at.even if the court is convinced that the arbitrator committed serious error,so long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,arbitration awards must be confirmed.bureau of engraving,at quoting misco,at.
although limited,arbitration awards are not entirely free from judicial review.the federal arbitration act faa provides limited grounds on which an arbitration award may be vacated.the faa requires that an arbitration award be upheld unless it is obtained by corruption,fraud,or undue means where there is evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators where there was misconduct by the arbitrators or where the arbitrators exceeded their powers.a.
this court has held that beyond the grounds provided in the faa,an arbitration award will be vacated only where it is completely irrational or evidences a manifest disregard for the law.hoffman cargill,cir citing constr.of rosebud sioux tribe,cir.
an arbitrator is not free to ignore or abandon the plain language of the parties agreement.boise cascade paper,chemical and energy workers pace,local,cir.an arbitration award has been held to be irrational where it fails to draw its essence from the agreement.hoffman,at.an arbitrator award draws its essence from the parties agreement as long as it is derived from the agreement,viewed in light of its language,its context,and any other indicia of the parties intention.boise,at quoting johnson controls,servs.div.united ass of journeymen,cir.
but where there is no clear and unambiguous agreement,the arbitrator must utilize other sources to determine the parties intent.as this court has previously held,d etermining the intent of the parties is the essential inquiry if the written agreement is silent,the arbitrator may consider past practices and bargaining history to fill gaps.boise,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.on the other hand,where the plain language of the parties agreement is silent or ambiguous with respect to a disputed issue,an arbitrator is obliged to consider other relevant sources of the parties intent.id.
arbitration 
based on arguments and evidence,the arbitration panel organized the issues for arbitration into the following categories the nature of the parties business relationship accounting for profit and loss from the parties joint venture activities accounting for gsi general trading account with howard gsi claim for loss of business gsi claim for attorneys fees prejudgment interest arbitration costs and fees disposition of the nsp receivable assigned by gsi to howard and other claims and issues.
significantly,the arbitration panel did not identify the issue of what contract controls the issues of the general trading account or loss of business damages as an issue to be determined.
general trading account award 
the district court granted howard motion to vacate three of the four specifically identified awards first,the district court vacated the portion of the award related to parties general trading account,finding that the panel majority ignored the unambiguous terms of the underlying contracts.
gsi contends that the issues regarding the general trading account flow from the parties joint venture relationship,for which there is no written contract.gsi and howard engaged in multiple varied business transactions.the panel award indicated that the written documentation for the joint ventures consisted of letters of agreement dated april,june,and june,and transaction confirmation documents.
the panel majority described the dispute concerning the general trading account as focusing on four accounting issues 
the correct beginning balance of the account whether any price adjustments should be made for prices accounted for by howard on the agreed volumes of gas bought and sold,whether gsi is responsible for hedge activity accounted for by howard for its account after november,and the appropriate accounting reconciliation for payments and receipts of the parties in,and net profit from,their joint venture activities with general trading account.
arbitrator award and dissent at.
first,gsi contended that the october,beginning balance of the account did not include profit from three hedge transactions,and the trading account beginning balance should have reflected a credit of to gsi.howard contended that the profits from the hedge transactions were credited to gsi in determining the final balance.the panel determined that gsi beginning balance should be adjusted to reflect the profit of the three hedge transactions.
second,howard argued that sales prices of physical gas sales should not be adjusted because the prices were documented by its business records.the accuracy of howard business records was disputed by gsi,with gsi contending that these transaction confirmations were at least inaccurate and possibly fraudulent.gsi argued that the prices documented on howard business records should be adjusted to market prices or seasonal averages.the panel concluded that the price adjustments sought by gsi for its gas purchases should be made,but not those proposed for its sales to howard.the panel majority found that the amount of the price adjustment reduction for the cost of physical gas should be to gsi,based upon its conclusion that howard imposed prices higher than market on gsi for farwell gas purchases,when the above market cost of the farwell gas was a joint venture responsibility.
third,gsi contended that it did not authorize hedge transactions with howard after november,and therefore the associated losses are not collectible from it.the panel agreed and credited gsi.
fourth,the panel concluded that the final balance of gsi trading account with howard should be a credit of.
the court did not address each component of this trading account award individually,but held generally that the transaction confirmation documents,generated by howard for each natural gas transaction,exclusively determined the rights and obligations of the parties concerning gsi trading account.the district court stated 
according to defendants,contracts evidenced by the transaction confirmations generated and maintained by defendants for each transaction exclusively determined the rights and obligations of the parties concerning gsi trading account.because the court finds that the arbitration panel ignored those contractual terms,the court vacates that portion of the arbitration award.
dist.order at internal citation omitted.
the district court held that by determining that a monthly average market price should be substituted for the price term listed on the trade confirmation,the panel ignored an unambiguous contract term,and exceeded their authority.
the district court erred.there was no unambiguous contract term to which the panel could look to determine the parties intent.as the panel majority indicated,the trading account dispute involved transactions between gsi and howard that went beyond transfers of gas between the parties,and touched on hedge transactions as well as joint venture net profit.the clear language of the transaction confirmation general provisions document provides that the contractual terms set forth in the document are controlling only as to that gas transaction,and applies only in the absence of another agreement.the general provisions contract was limited to the transaction for which it was generated,and then only if there was no other agreement in existence between the parties.it is clear that any award based on a breach of the parties joint venture relationship could not be controlled by a general provisions document with application limited to a sale of gas between the parties.
in addition,the plain language of the transaction confirmation indicates that it is not binding on the other party if challenged within ten days this confirmation shall be final and binding,whether or not signed or confirmed by counterpart,unless counterpart advises howard energy of any inaccuracy within ten days.there was evidence presented to the panel by gsi that once received,they immediately disputed the terms and challenged at least one of these documents as being fraudulent.
in addition,gsi contends that it did not receive transaction confirmations on all of its gas transfers with howard in a timely manner despite repeated requests.gsi argued that it requested an accounting from howard multiple times,but that no accounting was forthcoming from howard until just prior to the arbitration.consequently,the contractual language in these general provisions documents may not have been controlling even as to the individual transactions for which they were generated.
in the absence of clear and unambiguous contractual language,an arbitration panel must look to other sources to determine the parties intent.here,the arbitration panel accepted briefs and conducted five days of hearings.
due to the conflicting evidence regarding these transactions,the determination of the existence of any agreement between the parties was ultimately a credibility determination,on which there is no judicial review of the arbitration panel finding.the panel award stated that all of the evidence was considered and carefully weighed.
in determining the issues regarding the parties joint venture and hedge activities,the arbitration panel looked to other relevant sources of the parties intent,past practice and bargaining history,as well as industry practice to fill the gaps.this is precisely what our opinion in boise required in the absence of clear and unambiguous contractual language.boise,at.here,ther
