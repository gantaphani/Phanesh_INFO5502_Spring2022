in this case we clarify what expenses related to electronically stored information esi are taxable under the federal statute as f ees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case.the district court entered an order taxing only the costs of converting electronic files to formats,and transferring files onto cds.country vintner of,llc gallo winery,cv br,wl,at.asserting the district court erred or otherwise abused its discretion,appellant gallo winery,the prevailing party in this case,noted its timely appeal from the district court order.for the following reasons,we affirm.
in january,the winery bodegas esmeralda selected appellee the country vintner of north carolina,llc country vintner,as the exclusive north carolina wholesaler of alamos,an argentinian wine.in january,gallo winery gallo began supplying the wine to a network of wholesalers in the state,excluding country vintner.country vintner sued gallo,alleging violations of the north carolina wine distribution agreements act the wine act and the north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act.
almost immediately,the parties clashed over the discovery of esi.among other things,country vintner sought emails and other writings that refer red to or relate d to the establishment of the business relationship between gallo and bodegas esmeralda,gallo relationship with wine distributors,and gallo appointment to import alamos.during a phone conference to draft a discovery plan,gallo complained that retrieval of all potentially relevant electronically stored information was not reasonably accessible because of the undue burden and expense it would impose.id.at.gallo asserted that it would have to interview each of more than forty employees,search at least seven or eight servers in various locations,and review every single document wherein it communicated with anyone concerning the alamos brand.id.at.country vintner agreed to consider any proposal to narrow the field of potential employees and develop key words,search terms,date restrictions in order to search specific repositories of electronically stored information,but otherwise refused to limit its discovery requests.id.at.
gallo moved for a protective order,arguing that country vintner discovery requests were overbroad,vague,ambiguous,and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.gallo asserted that it would cost to process the email data of employees,and up to to review the data to guard against privilege waiver.id.at.gallo further asserted that country vintner ha d refused to offer any meaningful assistance in narrowing the field of potential employees or assisting gallo to develop key words,search terms,date restrictions.id.at.
country vintner opposed the motion and moved to compel gallo to provide more complete responses to its interrogatories and requests for documents and admission.country vintner accused gallo of a strategic decision to avoid responding to discovery,and asserted that country vintner ha d suffered prejudice because it continue d to lack information to adequately prosecute its case id.at.
the district court denied gallo motion for a protective order and adopted country vintner proposal for handling esi the court ordered gallo to run searches on archived email and documents created in a period by an initial set of eight identified custodians,using search terms proposed by country vintner and any other terms suggested by gallo that might produce relevant documents.the court further ordered that,after gallo determine d the volume of materials produced by these searches,the parties meet and confer to agree upon a sequence for disclosure of the electronically stored information on a rolling production.id.at.the court also granted country vintner motion to compel,to the extent that gallo ha d additional relevant and responsive information that it ha d not yet provided to country vintner.id.at.
in response to the court order,gallo collected more than gb of data and forwarded it to its lawyers firm for processing and review.the firm process ed the data into a searchable format,remove d system files and exact duplicates,and then ran three variations of the phrases and search terms set forth in the district court order.id.country vintner proposed applying search terms to the gb of data,and noted a preference for receiving the esi in a format compatible with summation.id.at gallo had used different litigation support software,ipro ecapture and kcura relativity,to process the data.id.at.
less than two months after gallo began producing documents,the district court granted gallo motion to dismiss country vintner claim under the north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act.the parties then filed for summary judgment on the remaining wine act claims,and the court granted summary judgment in favor of gallo.upon country vinter appeal of the order granting summary judgment in favor of gallo,we affirmed.country vintner of,llc e j gallo winery,app x,cir.
gallo thereafter filed in the district court a bill of costs,seeking to recover from country vintner for charges related to esi.gallo sought costs in the following six categories 
first,for flattening and indexing esi.this initial processing of data involved decompressing container,zip files or microsoft pst files making the data searchable by extracting text and creating optical character for text that could not be extracted indexing the data removing system files that were known not to contain any content and removing duplicate files.id.
second,for extraction.this process involved extracting from the documents unitiz ing electronic documents by locat ing logical document breaks for purposes of reviewing,searching,and production creating an index of metadata for every electronic document and exporting and loading the electronic documents and metadata onto a platform.id.at.
third,for tiff production and pdf production.this process involved converting original or native documents to a.or.pdf to render them.id.at.
fourth,for electronic bates numbering.in this version of bates stamping,the tiff or pdf documents were endorsed with a unique number that allow ed all parties to track the document s.id.at.
fifth,for copying images onto a cd or dvd.
sixth,for management of the processing of the electronic data,quality assurance procedures,analyzing corrupt documents and other errors,and preparing the production of documents to opposing counsel.
the parties having vigorously contested the propriety of the bill of costs filed with the clerk,and having filed numerous legal memoranda,the clerk of the district court deferred the matter of costs to the presiding district judge.
the district court granted in part and denied in part the bill of costs.adopting the reasoning of the third circuit,the court concluded that,under,a prevailing party may recover costs associated with copying or duplicating its files,but it may not receive reimbursement for any other expenses.country vintner of,llc,wl,at citing race tires,hoosier racing tire,cir.the court found that,in this case,the only tasks that involve d copying we re the conversion of native files to tiff and pdf formats and the transfer of files onto cds.id.at.the court concluded that gallo was entitled to recover in costs

on appeal,gallo argues that allows recovery of its esi processing charges and the district court erred in excluding them from the award of costs.country vintner counters that the district court properly denied these charges as outside the scope of.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court order.

judicial administration and technical amendments act of,stat,codified at emphasis added.
these amendments originated with the judicial conference of the united states the judicial conference and its committee on court administration and case management the committee.judicial conference,report of the proceedings of the judicial conference of the united states march,hereinafter judicial conference report.sometime before december,a former magistrate judge had asked the committee to consider proposing amendments to that would allow expenses associated with new courtroom technologies to be included in the taxing of litigation costs.committee on court administration and case management,report of the judicial conference,committee on court administration march hereinafter committee report.
in december,the committee considered whether technological advances that ha d occurred over the past years ma d e it appropriate to reevaluate the cost provisions in,so that recovery for costs associated with many litigation tools commonly used in,including videotaped depositions or electronically presented evidence,might be permitted.
committee report.while the committee agreed that did not address many of the technology expenses that we re often expended in federal litigation,it was concerned that the charges for these new expenses could dramatically expand the intention of the statute,which was to allow the taxing of costs in a very limited way.id.at.
therefore,the committee decided to recommend that the judicial conference endorse two limited statutory amendments to.the first would amend subsection to recognize the availability of transcripts in electronic form.the second would expand the concept of papers in subsection in order to reflect the decreasing use of paper and the increasing use of technology in creating,filing,and exchanging court documents.the committee rejected the concept of an amendment to permit the taxing of costs associated with the use of technology to create,assist,enhance or present materials during a trial.

on appeal,gallo seeks the in charges it initially sought,less the district court awarded,in charges for bates numbering,and in charges for any billable time related to bates numbering,searching,or activities.opening br.gallo argues that the remaining in esi processing charges is taxable under as both costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case,and f ees for exemplification of any materials.id.at.we are not persuaded by gallo arguments,but neither do we embrace wholesale country vintner crabbed interpretation of the amended costs statute.
as a preliminary matter,we reject country vintner contention that applies only to the costs related to materials attached to dispositive motions or produced at trial.to the extent that country vintner has not waived this challenge the argument fails on the merits.although the original costs statute limited taxation to lawful fees for exemplifications and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use on trial,stat,emphasis added,the current statute more broadly permits taxation of f ees for exemplification and the costs of making copies necessarily obtained for use in the case,emphasis added.moreover,several circuits have found that encompasses costs thus,the plain language and weight of authority establish that the costs of exemplifications and copies in discovery are taxable under.
turning to the merits of gallo appeal,we must first determine whether gallo esi processing charges constitute costs of making copies necessarily obtained for use in the case.we think not.
as with any issue of statutory interpretation,we focus on the plain language of the statute,seeking first and foremost to implement congressional intent.wec carolina energy solutions llc miller,cir internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.to determine a statute plain meaning,we not only look to the language itself,but also the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.in re total realty,llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the relevant statutory language is making copies.u.because the term is not defined in the statute,we must apply its ordinary meaning.taniguchi.at.
copies has appeared in the taxation statute since its enactment in,when copy meant a transcript,a writing like another writing,or an imitation.today,copy still refers to an imitation,transcript,or reproduction of an original work.to make means to cause to happen,to bring into being by forming,shaping,or altering material,to produce a material thing or to construct or assemble.thus,making copies means producing imitations or reproductions of original works.
although the ordinary meaning of the phrase is expansive,its application is limited by the broader context of as a whole.in re total realty,llc,at.the supreme court has observed that taxable costs under the statute are modest in scope and limited to relatively minor,incidental expenses.taniguchi.at 
section lists such items as clerk fees,court reporter fees,expenses for printing and witnesses,expenses for exemplification and copies,docket fees,and compensation of experts.indeed,the assessment of costs most often is merely a clerical matter that can be done by the court clerk.taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys,experts,consultants,and investigators.it comes as little surprise,therefore,that costs almost always amount to less than the successful litigant total expenses in connection with a lawsuit.

gallo argues that its charges are taxable as fees for making copies under because esi has unique features esi is more easily and thoroughly changeable than paper documents,it contains metadata,and it often has searchable text.opening br.gallo contends that converting native files to pdf and tiff formats produce d static,images that,by themselves,we re incomplete copies of dynamic,esi other processing was necessary to copy all integral features of the esi.id.at emphasis in original.gallo argues that it had to remove esi from container files,extract and index text to make it searchable,copy metadata,and load the data onto a review platform to allow the native files and their associated metadata to be viewed and their text to be searched as if the native files were being opened in the software applications that created them.id.at.gallo concedes that this process was far more involved than that necessary to copy paper documents but argues that 
just as copying a table or dress requires a different approach than copying a paper document,copying esi also requires a different approach.
country vintner counters that gallo distorts the plain meaning of the statute and misconstrue s the act of processing,which was not required in order to produce copies to country vintner,only to assist gallo with its review.resp.br,emphasis in original.country vintner disputes that gallo had no choice but to process the esi in order to comply with its discovery obligations,because country vintner never demanded that gallo produce processed esi replete with metadata and searchable text.id.at.country vintner thus asks us to affirm the district court adoption of the third circuit approach in race tires america,hoosier racing tire.
in race tires america,the third circuit held that,of the numerous services that electronic discovery vendors had performed in that case,only the scanning of hard copy documents,the conversion of native files to tiff,and the transfer of vhs tapes to dvd involved copying within the meaning of.race tires am,at.the court reasoned that 
s ection does not state that all steps that lead up to the production of copies of materials are taxable.it does not authorize taxation merely because today technology requires technical expertise not ordinarily possessed by the typical legal professional.it does not say that activities that encourage cost savings may be taxed.section authorizes awarding only the cost of making copies.
id.at footnote omitted.the court recognized that extensive processing may be essential to make a comprehensive and intelligible production of esi.id.
hard drives may need to be imaged,the imaged drives may need to be searched to identify relevant files,relevant files may need to be screened for privileged or otherwise protected information,file formats may need to be converted,and ultimately files may need to be transferred to different media for production.
id.nonetheless,the court reasoned,that does not mean that the services leading up to the actual production constitute making copies.id.
the process employed in the era to produce documents in complex litigation similarly involved a number of steps essential to the ultimate act of production.first,the paper files had to be located.the files then had to be collected,or a document reviewer had to travel to where the files were located.the documents,or duplicates of the documents,were then reviewed to determine those that may have been relevant.the files designated as potentially relevant had to be screened for privileged or otherwise protected material.ultimately,a large volume of documents would have been processed to produce a smaller set of relevant documents.none of the steps that preceded the actual act of making copies in the era would have been considered taxable.and that is because congress did not authorize taxation of charges necessarily incurred to discharge discovery obligations.it allowed only for the taxation of the costs of making copies.
id.the third circuit further reasoned that the supreme court has accorded a narrow reading to the cost statute in other contexts,and n either the degree of expertise necessary to perform the work nor the identity of the party performing the work of making copies is a factor that can be gleaned from.id.at.nor may the courts invoke equitable concerns to justify an award of costs for services that congress has not made taxable.id.at.
we find the third circuit reasoning persuasive.the court properly took into account the statute history,its plain language,and the supreme court narrow contemporary interpretation of the costs taxable under.all of these considerations support the conclusion that,in this case,subsection limits taxable costs to those identified by the district court converting electronic files to formats,and burning the files onto discs 
that gallo will recover only a fraction of its litigation costs under our approach does not establish that our reading of the statute is too grudging in an age of unforeseen innovations in technology the supreme court has emphasized that costs almost always amount to less than the successful litigant total expenses,and is limited to relatively minor,incidental expenses.taniguchi.at.moreover,the presumption is that the responding party must bear the expense of complying with discovery requests.oppenheimer fund,sanders,d.to the extent that such costs are excessive,a party may invoke the district court discretion under.to grant orders protecting it from undue burden or expense,including orders conditioning discovery on the requesting party payment of the costs of discovery.id.internal quotation marks omitted.when,as here,a district court d
