in the deposition of a law firm representing an unidentified nonparty witness noticed in this securities fraud class action and taken in the district of massachusetts pursuant to a subpoena that issued there,the nonparty witness asserted a right to anonymity under the first amendment.the massachusetts district court,having authority over the subpoena,denied the law firm motion to quash the subpoena and ordered the law firm to reveal the nonparty witness identity.but the court also entered a protective order prohibiting the lawyers for the parties from disclosing the identity of the nonparty witness to anyone else,including the parties.finally,the court stated that its protective order was subject to modification by the maryland district court,where the action is pending.
by order dated september,the maryland district court modified the protective order to allow disclosure of the nonparty witness identity to the attorneys clients but to no one else.
from the maryland district court order,the nonparty witness filed this interlocutory appeal,contending that the maryland district court had no authority to modify the massachusetts district court protective order and that the maryland district court modification nonetheless violates the nonparty witness first amendment right to remain anonymous.for the reasons that follow,we reject both arguments and affirm.
in the pending securities fraud litigation,the plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and a purported class of persons who purchased stock of bank clothiers,during the period from december,to june,claim that bank and insiders issued a series of false and misleading statements about the company earnings,profits,and inventory and thereby allowed the insiders to profit from inflated stock prices.the plaintiffs allege that when the true facts were disclosed in june,the price of bank stock fell,causing the plaintiffs tens of millions of dollars of investor losses.
during the period defining the class,bank received a letter dated march,from the law firm of foley lardner llp in boston,massachusetts,who represented a client whom it did not identify referred to herein as the doe client.the letter,addressed to bank audit committee,stated 
foley lardner llp represents a shareholder of bank clothiers,the company who has held several hundred thousand shares of the company for some time.our client is concerned about the company public communications and financial reporting with respect to its inventory.
the letter proceeded to detail multiple allegations regarding the handling,accounting,and reporting of inventory.some allegations suggested specific,nonpublic knowledge.but other allegations were generalized,such as claims that the public assertions by management that bank inventory levels were necessary,appropriate or advantageous were not credible and defy common business sense.the letter concluded 
this communication is a formal report on behalf of our client to the company audit committee regarding the integrity of the company financial statements and the company compliance with ethics policies and legal and regulatory requirements.our client requests that this letter be shared with the company auditors,deloitte touche llp.please advise us promptly as to what steps the company board,audit committee auditors are taking in response to this letter.
the audit committee received the letter roughly two weeks before bank was scheduled to release its earnings report and hold its earnings call.to investigate the letter claims,the audit committee hired the law firm of wilmer,cutler,pickering,hale dorr llp and the accounting firm of ernst young llp.this investigation,which was substantially completed by friday,march,at a cost of approximately,concluded that the allegations were without substance.the investigation,however,caused bank to delay its earnings report and call by days,to april.on the next trading day after bank announced the delay in reporting its earnings,the price of its stock dropped.
several months later,the plaintiffs commenced this action in the district of maryland,filing it on july.
in this litigation,bank served a notice to depose the foley lardner law firm in massachusetts to obtain the identity of and information about the doe client,suspecting that the doe client could provide information relevant to the pending action,particularly relating to the causation of losses claimed by the plaintiffs and the bases for defining the class.to compel foley lardner to attend the deposition and reveal the identity of and other information about the doe client,bank caused a subpoena to be issued from the district court in the district of massachusetts pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.
foley lardner filed a motion in the massachusetts district court to quash the subpoena,arguing that it is punitive,seeks irrelevant information,and violates foley client right of anonymity as protected by the first a mendment and federal common law.the district court,however,allowing for the possibility that the doe client might be complicit with the plaintiffs and that its letter was part of a cabal to affect the stock price of bank and then to sue,denied the motion to quash and allowed a deposition to be taken directly under its supervision.the court also ordered that the deposition be sealed and directed counsel not to disclose the identity of the doe client to anyone absent an order of the judge presiding in the lawsuit.in response to the district court sealing order,foley lardner on behalf of the doe client then took the following position with respect to the doe client first amendment rights,which the court rejected 
counsel for doe client your honor,i appreciate the effort to narrow this,but it does obviate the threshold issue from their standpoint which is that they are looking for complete anonymity here.
the court well,they may be,but they have no legal right to complete anonymity.
counsel for doe client under the first amendment cases that we understand your honor 
the court i not creating,i not creating some new privilege here.i sorry.that intriguing.this was,this was very interesting.but we not going there.
emphasis added.
the deposition took place in camera,and foley lardner,instead of designating a representative of the firm as required by the notice of deposition and federal rule of civil procedure b,produced the doe client itself.at the conclusion of the deposition,the court summarized its order 
the deposition as i earlier ordered will be entirely sealed without prejudice to application being made to the presiding judge in maryland for whatever treatment,and that also means application made to the presiding judge to call for additional depositions or expand the scope of this deposition i express no opinion on that.
i have a small piece of this dispute,and i tried to balance the interests of the entity that wished to remain anonymous against the justified interests under rule of bank of obtaining discovery.
my ruling is based upon what seems to me the appropriate limits of discovery,not any privilege as i said when we were in open court.but i am willing that the presiding judge who has the lawsuit under his care make the final call as to all of these matters and foley may find itself before that presiding judge,defending or seeking to modify the limits that i put on it.
when counsel for bank requested that he be allowed to disclose the identity of the doe client to his client,the massachusetts district court instructed that counsel had to keep the doe client identity to himself and his partners.it directed counsel,however,to go to the presiding judge in maryland and say,this was far too limited,open it up and that judge,i sure,will give notice to foley,and foley can be heard this is a sealed proceeding sealed,unless the presiding judge should otherwise order.but the court allowed that bank counsel could go out and investigate the doe client,but could not reveal its identity to counsel or anyone else,except with permission of the maryland district court.
bank outside counsel accordingly sought out all publicly available information on the doe client and uncovered several facts suggesting to counsel that the doe client took deliberate and successful actions,sending the letter to the audit committee to drive down the market price of bank stock during the proposed class period.most importantly,bank outside counsel learned that the doe client was a known short seller and that it,in addition to holding several hundred thousand shares of bank stock,also held several times that quantity of puts on bank stock,giving the doe client the option of selling bank stock at an price and thus potentially allowing the doe client to profit from the stock price fall.
with this information in hand,bank outside counsel filed a motion in the maryland district court to unseal the deposition of the doe client and permit further discovery from the doe client.bank asserted that the discovery from the doe client would be relevant to its various defenses,including discovering whether the doe client manipulated the price of the stock,a fact that goes to both substantive liability and damages,and which may have spawned inefficiencies in the market for the company fact that strongly militates against certification of the proposed class.bank also expressed a wish to file any appropriate lawsuits against the doe client.
despite the doe client opposition to bank motion,the maryland district court modified the protective order by making the doe client identity accessible to parties to this litigation.the order allowed bank outside counsel to reveal the doe client identity to counsel and to pursue further discovery against the doe client.but the district court continued the massachusetts district court protective order insofar as it prohibited disclosure to the public.
from the district court order,dated september,the doe client filed this interlocutory appeal,invoking the collateral order doctrine.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.united states moussaoui,cir.and pending our decision on appeal,the district court stayed its order.
the doe client contends first that the maryland district court lacked statutory authority to unseal,even partially,the deposition that the massachusetts court had ordered sealed,even though the massachusetts court expressly contemplated that the maryland court could determine to unseal the deposition.the doe client argues 
by reversing a final order of the massachusetts district which bank and the insider defendants never appealed to the first maryland district court usurped the prerogatives of the massachusetts district court and the first circuit alike.to the extent that the maryland district court had any authority to review the ruling of the massachusetts district court,its review was subject to the law of the case doctrine.
the doe client arguments are far too rigid for the legal scheme created by the federal rules of civil procedure for obtaining discovery in federal cases,and they are especially strained in light of the fact that the two courts involved appropriately divided authority with respect to the deposition and neither overstepped that division of authority.the massachusetts court acted within the authority granted it by the federal rules of civil procedure,and it did not enter any order intending to control the authority of the maryland district court to manage discovery and the litigation.likewise,the maryland district court acted within the authority granted it by the rules,and it did not overrule any order entered by the massachusetts court.
stated generally,the deposition noticed in the maryland case was taken in massachusetts and supervised by the massachusetts district court for use in the maryland case,and the two courts recognized their roles in the process.indeed,the massachusetts court was especially sensitive to not interfere with the maryland court role in managing discovery and the litigation.
more particularly,the massachusetts court ruled that the doe client could not maintain complete anonymity under the first amendment but that disclosure of its identity would be limited to enable the maryland district court to make the final call.and the court repeated this message the deposition as i earlier ordered will be entirely sealed without prejudice to application being made to the presiding judge in maryland for whatever treatment,and i am willing that the presiding judge who has the lawsuit under his care make the final call as to all of these matters and the doe client may find itself before that presiding judge,defending or seeking to modify the limits that i put on it.when counsel for bank expressed his desire to disclose the identity of the doe client to his client,the massachusetts district judge stated that counsel should go to the presiding judge in maryland and say,this was far too limited,open it up and that judge,i sure,will give notice to the doe client and the doe client can be heard.in giving these instructions,the massachusetts court defined its role i have a small piece of this dispute,and i tried to balance the interests of the doe client that wished to remain anonymous against the justified interests under rule of bank of obtaining discovery.and the court indicated that it was deferring to the presiding judge to make the final call.
it is apparent that both the massachusetts court and the maryland court recognized the division of authority anticipated by the federal rules of civil procedure.
under the rules,the deposition of a nonparty witness is noticed in the pending action,with notice served on all parties.see.b.as rule a provides,a party may,by oral questions,depose any person,including a party,without leave of court except as provided in rule a.the deponent attendance may be compelled by subpoena under rule.a.because the deponent in this case was a nonparty witness,bank caused the issuance of a subpoena,as authorized by rule a and pursuant to rule,to compel the attendance of the witness.and because the deponent was located in massachusetts,bank caused the subpoena to be issued from the district court there.accordingly,the massachusetts district court had authority to enforce,modify,or quash the subpoena in accordance with rule c.
but under this scheme,the deponent could also have sought protection from the maryland district court under the authority given by rule c.that rule provides 
a party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court where the action is as an alternative on matters relating to a deposition,in the court for the district where the deposition will be taken.
c emphasis added.the maryland district court is also given authority to regulate depositions under rules d and.of course,use of the deposition in the litigation is controlled by the maryland court,where the action is pending.see.a.
thus,a nonparty witness whose deposition is noticed for a location other than in the district where the case is pending has a range of options in seeking protection.
even though rule c authorized the doe client to seek protection from either the maryland court,where the case is pending,or the massachusetts court,where the deposition was being taken,it could also invoke rule c to obtain protection specifically from the massachusetts court where the subpoena issued.these multiple accommodations to the deponent,however,do not create an antagonistic jurisdictional division of authority.to the contrary,they afford flexibility so that the nonparty witness can facilely obtain protection and not be unduly burdened.
in this case,when the doe client filed its motion to quash the deposition subpoena and demanded complete anonymity under the first amendment,the massachusetts district court denied the motion,stating that the deponent has no legal right to complete anonymity.the district court explained,i not creating some new privilege here.i sorry.that intriguing.this was,this was very interesting.but we not going there.the court nonetheless entered a protective order prohibiting disclosure of the doe client identity except to the lawyers for the parties and subject to review and modification by the maryland district court.the protective order,therefore,not only prohibited the attorneys from disclosing the identity of the deponent to anyone,but also,by its terms,allo
