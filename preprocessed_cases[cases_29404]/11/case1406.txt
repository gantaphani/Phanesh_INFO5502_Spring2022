iii.discussion 
a.the alabama supreme court interpretation of the franchise act 
pursuant to rule of the alabama rules of appellate procedure,the court certified the following question to the alabama supreme court 
w hether the franchise act permits an automobile dealer to bring a claim under the act,despite the fact that both parties had already executed a mutual release agreement in which the dealer relinquished all existing legal claims against the manufacturer in exchange for valid consideration.
edwards kia motors of america,wl,at.may,edwards iii see.after reviewing the certified question and the parties respective arguments,the alabama supreme court determined that the dispositive issue was whether the legislature intended to apply so broadly as to preclude parties subject to the franchise act from reaching any form of binding agreement by which then existing,ripe claims could be mutually settled without resort to a judicial determination of the claim.edwards iii,wl,at footnote omitted.section provides as follows 
notwithstanding the terms,provisions,or conditions of any dealer agreement or franchise or the terms or provisions of any waiver,and notwithstanding any other legal remedies available,any person who is injured in his business or property by a violation of this chapter by the commission of any unfair and deceptive trade practices,or because he refuses to accede to a proposal for an agreement which,if consummated,would be in violation of this chapter,may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction in this state to enjoin further violations,to recover the damages sustained by him together with the costs of the suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.

in so concluding,the alabama supreme court looked to the plain language of the statute.noting that the relevant terms waiver and release are not defined by the franchise act the alabama supreme court relied on the legislative intent of the act,which is to protect the state citizens from abuses by motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers,and,to that end,to regulate manufactures and dealers and the dealings between manufacturers and their dealers.id.at citation quotations omitted.that court further acknowledged that the purpose of the franchise act is to give balance to the inequality of bargaining power between individual dealers and their manufacturers.id.citation quotations omitted.however,notwithstanding the purpose of the act,the alabama supreme court stated that there is no indication of a legislative intent to prohibit the parties to an franchise agreement from reaching a settlement of existing claims after those claims arise and entering into a binding settlement agreement.id.that is,a retrospective mutual release agreement is enforceable and not prohibited by the franchise act so long as it is made in good faith by the parties thereto,and concerns claims then existing at the time of the agreement inception.see id.
moreover,reading the franchise act as a whole,the alabama supreme court stated that there is no indication that does or was intended to prohibit the settlement of known claims as an alternative to taking them to trial and ultimately to judgment.if the legislature had wished to include the settlement and release of known claims in the language of,it knew how to do so.id.the alabama supreme court also noted that while the legislature listed prospective releases and waivers in describing particular unfair trade practices under the franchise act,it did not similarly state that a retrospective release is an unfair trade practice or include such a release in its list of ineffective provisions in.id.at.in other words,that the franchise act proscribes prospective releases and waivers does not mean that retrospective releases and waivers are similarly prohibited by that act.thus,the alabama supreme court concluded that h ad the legislature meant to require the litigation of every disagreement between a manufacturer and a dealer,it could have said so.id.
b.the effect of the alabama supreme court interpretation of the franchise act in edwards iii on the court holdings in edwards ii
