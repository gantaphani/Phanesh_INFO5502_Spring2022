viking supply viking sued national cart company national cart in a contract dispute.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of national cart and viking appealed.we affirm.
background 
national cart is a manufacturer of,among other things,shopping cart corrals corrals which are used by various stores for the placement,handling,and storage of shopping carts.viking was a distributor for national cart corrals for several years.jerry ogren ogren,viking president,acted for a period of time as a sales representative for various national cart products,including corrals.it is not particularly clear whether ogren was acting independently of viking all of this,however,is immaterial.this opinion will treat the sales representative or distributor as viking for purposes of simplicity.one of viking customers and thus,indirectly,national cart customer was target,then a subsidiary of the dayton corporation.in,national cart told viking that it wanted viking to enter into a distributorship agreement if viking wanted to continue to sell national cart corrals to target.national cart sent viking a proposed agreement which had a duration of one year and a strict termination clause,precluding termination at will.viking refused to enter into a distributorship agreement with national cart.during that same time period,or thereafter,national cart asked ogren to enter into a sales representative agreement and sent ogren a form agreement ogren refused to sign a sales representative agreement,stating that he did not like a written contract.on december,national cart terminated ogren sales representative status.viking was given the option of remaining as national cart distributor for corrals to target and shopko.on january,viking wrote to national cart 
the next topic is target and shopko.you mentioned in your letter that you would like us to remain a distributor for national cart company.this can certainly be accomplished but we both need to have some rules.if we can receive assurances from you that as long as we are selling your cart corrals to target and shopko,your company will never attempt to sell them on a direct basis sic.if you can agree to this,we will agree to selling only national cart corrals to both target and shopko.
in response,national cart wrote to viking on january,
i am writing this letter in response to your letter dated january,i would like you to continue to sell cart corrals as a distributor to target and shopko.as long as we have an agreement that you will not pursue another cart corral line we will protect these two accounts y ou are very welcome to buy from us at a discount on any and all products.you will receive special pricing liturgical discount on the target and shopko cart corrals.
on september,national cart faxed a letter to viking and ogren 
let this letter serve sic written notice that viking supply or jerry ogren will no longer represent or distribute any of national cart.sic products.
we will honor are sic existing orders and will no longer take any new orders as of september.
national cart asserts that it terminated the distributorship relationship because,in july and august of,target told national cart that it had become dissatisfied with viking service and pricing.national cart contends that,on september,target buyer called robert unnerstall,president of national cart,and told him that target would not be purchasing national cart products through viking in the next millennium the fall bidding cycle was for products target needed in.that decision was based in part on dissatisfaction with service and price and because target had instituted a policy of dealing only directly with manufacturers,whenever possible.viking put forth no evidence to the contrary.
ogren contends that he met with target buyer on september,and that he was informed at that time that national cart had put in a direct bid to supply corrals to target.ogren contends that,coincidentally,as he was leaving,rob unnerstall name tag from a september,visit to target stuck to ogren shoe.national cart denies that unnerstall met with target on september,and contends that it did not put in a bid for the corrals until some time in october.
national cart continued to honor viking orders until october.viking failed to pay national cart for corrals supplied to viking from july,through october.
in november of,viking instituted an action in minnesota state court,claiming national cart breached the alleged distributorship contract,breached the terms of the termination letter by submitting a bid directly to target for corrals prior to september,and claiming national cart was unjustly enriched.viking sought damages in the amount of per year,apparently indefinitely,and compensatory damages of on each count.national cart removed the action to the united states district court for the district of minnesota,and counterclaimed,seeking for unpaid goods shipped to viking.national cart also counterclaimed for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment,claiming that viking had fraudulently induced national cart to reduce the price it charged to viking for the corrals,to its detriment in excess of.viking defended the counterclaim for unpaid invoices,claiming that it was entitled to recoupment of its investment in obtaining and maintaining the target account and also claiming that it was entitled to at least that much in damages on its claim that national cart breached the agreement not to contact target before september,which agreement was set forth in the termination letter from national cart to viking.
national cart filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the alleged distributorship contract is barred by the minnesota statute of frauds because it could not be completed in one year,that the writings between the parties did not amount to a written contract,that any such contract was terminable at will,that national cart gave reasonable notice,and that national cart did not breach the contract because performance was rendered impossible.national cart further contended that it did not breach the terms of the termination letter because such letter did not amount to a contract and because the letter terminated the distributorship relationship as of september,rather than september.national cart sought dismissal of viking unjust enrichment claim on the basis that there was no evidence national cart had anything to do with the termination of viking relationship with target.national cart also sought summary judgment on that portion of its counterclaim seeking payment for goods sold and shipped to viking.
the district court rejected the claim that the contract violated the statute of frauds but granted summary judgment on the breach of the distributorship contract claim.the ruling was based on the doctrine of frustration of purpose.the district court found that viking and ogren failed to dispute that the primary purpose of the contract which the district court found was to have viking act as the distributor of national cart corrals to target and shopko was frustrated by target refusal to buy national cart corrals from viking,thus excusing national cart performance.as to the breach of the termination agreement,the district court found that the letter terminated the distributorship agreement as of september,and any contacts national cart had with target after that date were not in violation of the agreement.the district court further held that viking had failed to present evidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact as to whether national cart did indeed bid on target account prior to october.the district court rejected viking claim for unjust enrichment because viking had not shown that it suffered losses other than lost profits and at a markup,any investment in obtaining and keeping the target business was surely recouped.as to national cart counterclaim,the district court found that viking did not dispute that it owed national cart for corrals supplied to viking from july,through october.since the district court rejected viking unjust enrichment and recoupment claims,it granted summary judgment to national cart on its counterclaim for unpaid invoic
