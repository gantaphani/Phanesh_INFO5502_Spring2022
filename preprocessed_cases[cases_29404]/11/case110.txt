vascular solutions,vsi and marine polymer technologies,mpt sell differently designed medical patches that are designed to stop bleeding after specific medical procedures,including catheterizations.each accused the other of spreading false statements about its particular product.awarding nothing to mpt,the jury found vsi was entitled to damages of million in lost profits on its product disparagement claim,and it is from that judgment that mpt now appeals.
the background facts can be briefly summarized,recounted in light of the jury verdict.municipality of guaynabo,cir.both mpt syvekpatch and vsi dry are commonly used after cardiac catheterization procedures,which are performed to examine blood vessels in the heart.applied to the skin surface like a bandage,the patches stem blood flow at the site of a physician puncture of a patient major artery in the upper thigh,which is made to start the catheterization.the patches are intended to operate more quickly and less invasively than older methods for halting bleeding.
vsi dry patch uses bovine compound derived from cow its active ingredient.the ingredient creates the risk,which increases with multiple exposures of the patient to the ingredient,of triggering antibodies and therefore possible complications which may include excessive bleeding or blood clots.an warning appears in dry written instructions for use.however,the ingredient seals wounds rapidly and,by the time of trial,vsi had sold more than one million dry patches,without reports of severe bleeding or blood clots resulting from proper use of the device.
vsi began selling dry in september it sold devices during the remainder of and in.in early,howard root,vsi chief executive officer ceo,and vsi chief financial officer developed a sales forecast,projecting that sales of vsi patch would grow from an estimated in of the market to in of the market.vsi sales leveled off,however,and the company achieved about a percent market share by.
several years earlier,mpt had won fda approval for its own clotting bandage,now named the syvekpatch,which uses a thin fiber produced by the diatom,a marine organism.mpt sales of the patch grew rapidly through,but growth declined in subsequent years.mpt concluded that its sales had been affected by false information about its patch disseminated by vsi starting in,and it by providing to its own sales agents negative information about vsi product.
after gentler critiques of dry failed to stop the decline in mpt sales,mpt marketing director,peter stevens,prepared an informational bulletin dated march,the marketing bulletin,drawing on material in a scientific paper published in the ortel article.the bulletin,in an introductory message,asserted,you ca use and do no harm a reference to the hippocratic contained five statements later successfully challenged by vsi as product disparagement the first two being the two sentences contained in the substantive paragraph that follows 
the message to communicate to all health care providers is 
after one application of bovine thrombin there is a patient risk of developing antibodies to it,and a risk of developing antibodies to human factor v.after just two exposures to topical thrombin there is a risk of developing abnormal coagulation results leading to events such as excessive bleeding,gastrointestinal bleeding,and hemorrhagic stroke.
the other statements challenged by vsi were the first three of five numbered points that appeared farther down on the first page of the bulletin 
bovine thrombin is extremely immunogenic after just one exposure to bovine thrombin of patients raise antibodies to it.
bovine thrombin carries a very high risk of causing serious permanent bleeding disorders in of patients.excessive bleeding,gastrointestinal bleeding,and hemorrhagic stroke only exposures to bovine thrombin.
after a second exposure to thrombin,of patients develop antibodies to human factor v and have abnormal coagulation effect is irreversible for life.
the bulletin was sent electronically and presented in training sessions to mpt sales force for its message to be communicated to customers without giving them the bulletin itself.a vsi sales agent discovered the document while visiting a customer,and root then wrote to mpt president asking for correction of false and misleading statements.root asserted,for example,that the ortel article rested on a study using an extremely impure and form of bovine thrombin rather than the purer dry version,and said that certain of the data concerned patients who had undergone surgeries rather than minimally invasive catheterization procedures.
mpt did not respond and vsi filed the present action in federal district court in minnesota in may the case was later transferred to the district of massachusetts.the only one of vsi claims to survive the trial was its product disparagement claim we need not discuss the others or mpt counterclaims which also failed.following a trial,the jury awarded vsi million,a little more than half of the million in damages vsi had sought.the jury made specific findings that these five statements were false and,in light of the jury instructions,had to find that mpt made them with actual malice.the district court enjoined mpt further use of the false statements.
on appeal,mpt challenges the jury verdict for vsi.mpt contends that vsi failed to prove malice by clear and convincing evidence and,alternatively,that vsi was not entitled to the judgment because the evidence did not show specific lost sales attributable to mpt conduct and so was insufficient evidence of special damages as a matter of law.the parties assume in their briefs that massachusetts law governs vsi product disparagement claim we therefore do likewise.see nagle reg l sch,cir.
starting with malice,we note that neither the supreme court nor this one has decided whether the first amendment requires in product disparagement actions the actual malice standard of new york times sullivan,d at least one circuit has rejected that proposition for a similar cause of action,see procter gamble amway,cir lanham act commercial disparagement,cert.denied,d.whether massachusetts courts might independently read such a requirement into its common law cause of action is also unclear 
the parties tried the case before us on the premise that actual malice is required,and we accept that view solely for the purposes of this case.bose consumers union of the,cir accepting that the actual malice standard applied in a product disparagement case where the parties did not dispute it,aff,d suzuki motor consumers union of,cir.same,cert.denied,d.such a requirement might seem far afield from the concerns animating the new york times an innovation not known to the common this is an issue for another case.
to prove actual malice,vsi had to provide clear and convincing evidence that mpt marketing director made the challenged statements with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not.new york times,at.bose,at.thus stevens must have had a high degree of awareness of their probable falsity to meet the actual malice standard,garrison louisiana,d for recklessness the evidence must permit the conclusion that he in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication,amant thompson,d.
subjecting the jury malice determination to our own independent review,as we must,see bose,at,we find that the evidence supports the jury finding that the statements were false and provides ample proof of malice for at least the principal challenged statements and,for reasons that will appear,this is an ample basis for satisfying the malice requirement,assuming it exists.
the most inflammatory of the five statements,and the most glaringly unsupported,are the two that associated dry with specific and serious outcomes in percentages that would be remarkable for a relatively straightforward medical stop bleeding at a incision.if believed,they would certainly deter use of a product for a result that could be achieved by other,means or by newer products like that of mpt.both statements associate vsi product after just or only two exposures with excessive bleeding,gastrointestinal bleeding,and hemorrhagic stroke.
phrasing the statistics differently,the two statements read 
after just two exposures to topical thrombin there is a risk of developing abnormal coagulation results leading to events such as excessive bleeding,gastrointestinal bleeding,and hemorrhagic stroke.
bovine thrombin carries a very high risk of causing serious permanent bleeding disorders in of patients.excessive bleeding,gastrointestinal bleeding,and hemorrhagic stroke only exposures to bovine thrombin.
the ortel article does refer to the increased risk of an adverse event upon second exposure to bovine thrombin,and it contains language and a table listing some of the possible adverse events,including postoperative bleeding,gastrointestinal bleeding,and hemorrhagic complications.the article,however,does not directly link a second exposure to bovine thrombin to the complications cited by mpt and certainly does not quantify any such risk in the percentages stated by mpt.if anything,the ortel article disclaims proof of such an association 
language in the article that comes closest to the quoted statements was specific to exposure to bovine thrombin during surgery where much larger dosages are employed.nor could mpt prediction of permanent bleeding disorders be supported by the article as stevens himself suggested,the time period of the study was too short to make that fact,the study followed the patients for only four to eight weeks.stevens admitted that the ortel article does support even one person losing the ability to clot their blood permanently or even one patient having a serious and permanent bleeding disorder.
in considering malice,the jury was also entitled to weigh mpt motive.commc ns,connaughton,d bose,at.mpt own sales began to fall after dry was introduced,and chronology shows that mpt developed the bulletin after mpt early and more temperate criticisms of dry seemingly went unheeded by customers.the scare phrasing of the document and the indication that it was to be used to persuade customers,but not to be left with them,could also be considered by the latter as reflecting a concern that the bulletin could otherwise be discovered by vsi and challenged as false.
the other three statements are a closer call as to malice.two of them charge that bovine thrombin causes percent of patients to raise antibodies to it after one exposure two that it causes percent of patients to raise antibodies to human factor v after at least one exposure and one that a second exposure to bovine thrombin causes percent of patients to have abnormal coagulation results the effect is irreversible for life.the ortel article uses these exact percentages with respect to the claimed risks of antibodies and abnormal coagulation results in speaking generically about bovine thrombin and while at trial vsi offered expert medical data suggesting much lower antibody production in response to exposure to its form of bovine thrombin,stevens could have been unaware of that other data and could have made these three challenged statements without actual malice.
but this possibility makes no difference to the damages verdict.the most inflammatory statements were recklessly so the jury permissibly it is a fair inference that the damages verdict rested primarily on them their assertion of high percentage risks of lurid complications would have alarmed any doctor considering dry.as for injunctive relief directed at future repetition of the statements,mpt request for relief from the injunction rests on the premise that no violation was proved as to any of them and does not seriously attempt to show that any of the statements is true but only that they were all made without position the jury permissibly rejected.
the hard questions on this appeal concern damages.mpt main claim is that vsi failed to provide a particular form of proof of special damages namely,lost sales to specific named customers as opposed to expert evidence and general data from which aggregate loss of sales might be inferred.in most fields of tort law,a plaintiff having established wrongdoing may prove damages in any reasonable way,graves packer,stating that the damages evidence need only afford a basis for a reasonable judgment quoting linkage trs.of boston,but for peculiar reasons,probably more historical than prudential,a number of jurisdictions following the restatement second of torts require in product disparagement cases proof of specific lost sales to identifiable customers unless it is infeasible to provide such proof 
massachusetts has no authoritative case cited to us that is directly on point,but it has followed the restatement on other aspects of product disparagement,dulgarian,at citing a different restatement section on liability for injurious falsehood,which includes product disparagement,and we will assume arguendo that it would likely do so here.this is merely an assumption 
under the impact of more detailed statistical and expert proof,courts have shown increasing willingness in recent years to award a loss of profit in other kinds of cases,and it may be expected that this will carry over into the injurious falsehood which includes product disparagement cases where the loss is shown with reasonable certainty.
prosser and keeton on torts,at ed footnote omitted.
furthermore,the restatement proof requirement applies only where it is feasible to identify specific lost sales.but our case is not one of falsehoods about a product sold to a limited list of named regular purchasers.mpt had a number of representatives who dealt with hundreds of cath labs at hospitals.so one could postulate that it would hardly be easy to determine in most cases to whom mpt sales agents spoke who or what group or committee made purchasing decisions,and the precise connection if any between the dissemination of falsehood and the absence of a set of purchases of vsi product.
had mpt asserted this special proof rule in the district court,we would presumably have some developed information on the relevant facts and a ruling from the district judge as to whether the facts added up to the wide dissemination exception,under which even the restatement does not require proof of individual lost sales.restatement,supra,cmt.h see also sack on defamation ed stating that generalized evidence of lost profits is probably enough to prove special damages,particularly where it is impractical to establish specific lost sales.but mpt made no such objection in the district court prior to or during trial,so the need for an instruction on proof of special damages was never established.
vsi has failed to point out that the special damages proof rule was not properly invoked in the district court.but because the parties tried the case below on the assumption that ordinary rules of damages proof applied,mpt objection is forfeit,subject to plain error,davila corporacion de puerto rico para la difusion publica,cir the judicial system has an ample interest in not wasting resources with unnecessary retrials.see harden united states,cir.unit b.plain error is rarely found in civil cases in this circuit,ass of chain drug stores new england carpenters health benefits fund,cir and here,given the difficulty of proving specific lost sales,it is far from plain that any error occurred.
mpt spends much less time arguing that damages were not established even under ordinary standards,but this argument does require attention.for reasons already noted it might be impossible to identify most,let alone all,of the various individuals exposed to the false statements,or to identify many of those involved in purchasing the products,let alone to connect specific statements to specific failures to buy but this does not mean that no such instances could be that the falsehoods had effect.while vsi initially indicated to the district court that it would seek to present at least some specific lost sales,in the end it identified no such instance.no legal rule requires such exemplars but they could well have strengthened vsi case.
instead,vsi central evidence was its projection estimating expected growth of sales for its new and initially successful product.admittedly,this was made before mpt false statements were disseminated and before litigation in this case commenced and root testified that the projections were on market research including reports,public company reports,and available information on competitive developments,pricing,and vsi own sales experience.he also said that he knew of no reason that could explain the unrealized sales growth other than the false statements disseminated by mpt.
vsi also provided an expert damages witness,donald nicholson,a certified public accountant,who analyzed vsi estimate and concluded that based upon the projected sales figures,it had fallen short by million in sales million in profits.it was this loss in profits that vsi attributed to mpt defamatory statements.nicholson said that his calculations accounted for new entrants during the relevant period but not for other true information in the market place about bovine thrombin risks.mpt introduced no evidence of its or refute vsi damages showing.
yet even as nicholson stated that root projection was reasonable,he reiterated that they were really root estimate s and confessed that they would be too high if one were to accept a report estimates of the market size.vsi also provided lower estimates of sales growth to its investors,although there are reasons why a company executives might provide more conservative estimates to shareholders.it is not surprising that the jury did not entirely accept the projection,awarding vsi only about half of what it sought for conduct that the jury itself deemed malicious.
massachusetts cases have relied upon expert testimony by outside experts or company executives to uphold a jury determination that a defendant conduct caused a loss of profits this is perhaps an easier inference where existing sales fall after the defendant wrongdoing vsi damages require the further step of giving credence to root projected growth in sales over and above the inference that the defendant conduct caused harm.massachusetts courts have not foreclosed the use of growth estimates but are prepared to reject individual calculations as unsupported.see augat,aegis,rejecting a specific high growth rate,admittedly calculated after the litigation,as implausib le,but not rejecting the method.
in this case,the evidence surely permitted the jury to infer that mpt malicious false and widely a negative causal effect on vsi otherwise climbing sales and profits.as to the amount of damages,lost profits inherently involve estimation and courts are often inclined to think that the wrongdoer created the problem and must accept the jury judgment within a range of uncertainty.herbert sullivan,at lowrie castle,ricky smith pontiac,at.the question is whether the amount in this case went beyond reasonable limits.
on this,the panel is divided even as between the two judges who believe liability has been established and vote to uphold an award of damages in favor of vsi.one member of the panel,recognizing that causation must be inferred and that any amount of damages is an estimate,thinks that the jury verdict is still within reasonable bounds the other,that it is the lack of proof of any specific lost sales and that its support is almost entirely a projection by the plaintiff as to what it hoped to that a sua sponte remittitur is essential.
the verdict most favorable to the judgment that two judges will support is an affirmance subject to a remittitur limiting vsi recovery to million apart from interest,costs and other incidentals.see alvira woolworth,wl.lexis,at cir,catullo metzner,cir kolb goldring,cir.on remand,which we now order,vsi can accept this figure or insist upon a new trial as to damages.in all remaining respects the judgment is affirmed.each side will bear its own costs.
it is so ordered.
i agree with the majority that the evidence permitted the jury to find that mpt made the two most inflammatory statements about the dangers of the dry with actual malice.i disagree,however,that the jury damages verdict is sustainable,even with the proposed reduction,on the record before us.the majority treads lightly over vsi failure to show the loss of even one specific customer as a result of mpt statements.in my view,the adequacy of vsi proof of damages depends on whether it is entitled to the widespread dissemination exception to the special damages rule for product disparagement claims.if not,its failure to show any specific lost sales would be fatal to the product disparagement cause of action,and damages would be unavailable as a matter of law.i would therefore remand the case to the district court for consideration of the exception and,hence,respectfully dissent from the damages portion of the majority decision.
product disparagement is a species of business tort that is often grouped with similar claims,such as trade libel or slander of title,as a form of injurious falsehood.rodney smolla,law of defamation ed.it is well established that special damages are an essential part of a cause of action for injurious falsehood,page keeton et,prosser keeton on torts,at ed,and must always be proved,restatement second of torts cmt.dooling budget pub,restatement second of torts cmt.b arlen langvardt,section a,commercial falsehood,and the first amendment a proposed framework.
to prove special damages in a product disparagement case,a plaintiff usually must show a loss of particular sales to specific customers.prosser keeton on torts,at stating that the plaintiff ordinarily must identify the particular purchasers who have refrained from dealing with him,and specify the transactions of which he claims to have been deprived robert sack,sack on defamation libel,slander,and related problems,at ed restatement second of torts cmt.c see also amerinet,xerox,cir dismissing disparagement claims on motion for summary judgment where t he record contains no evidence of specific lost sales or of losses directly attributable to particular false statements by the defendant.the strict requirement to prove lost sales ensures that the actual pecuniary harm the tort is designed to remedy did,in fact,occur.see arlen langvardt,free speech versus economic harm accommodating defamation,commercial speech,and unfair competition considerations in the law of injurious falsehood,temp,observing that the strict special damages requirement appears to be based on a sensible notion the economic interests with which injurious falsehood law is concerned necessarily carry a pecuniary value.
there is an exception to this specific requirement where the false statement has been widely disseminated and it would be impossible to establish that the challenged statements caused specific lost sales.the restatement explains the exception as follows 
widely disseminated injurious falsehood may cause serious and genuine pecuniary loss by affecting the conduct of a number of persons whom the plaintiff is unable to identify and so depriving him of a market that he would otherwise have found.when this can be shown with reasonable certainty,the rule requiring the identification of specific purchasers is relaxed and recovery is permitted for the loss of the market.
restatement second of torts cmt.see also prosser keeton on torts,at amerinet,at noting that,where a plaintiff is unable to show loss of specific sales,the modern view allows plaintiff to prove a general decline of business,so long as this is shown to be the result of defendant disparaging statements and other possible causes are eliminated quoting advanced training,caswell equip,fashion boutique fendi usa,d,aff,cir charles atlas,books.
the exception is most plainly applicable when disparaging remarks appear in a publication that is distributed to a general audience,leaving the plaintiff unable to identify specific customers who were lost or specific individuals who might have become customers,but did not,because of the negative information communicated by the defendant.the bose case,which ultimately reached the supreme court on another issue,is illustrative.see bose consumers union of,rev on other grounds,cir,aff,d.the bose corporation had alleged that its loudspeaker system was disparaged in an article published in consumer reports magazine,which was distributed to millions of readers.id.at.it was impossible for bose to identify the customers it had lost,and the district court permitted it to prove damages with evidence showing a decline in the rate of sales following publication of the article.id.at see also charles atlas.at involving a product disparagement claim against the publisher of a book that was sold only through mail order.the more flexible approach to damages also has been applied where the challenged statements were disseminated by means of sales literature.see porous media pall,cir.
given massachusetts consistent reliance on the restatement in injurious falsehood cases,see,dulgarian stone,powell stevens,wl,at.may,and the broad acceptance of the product disparagement cause of action as discussed in the treatises,a federal court applying massachusetts law must assume that the state courts would follow the restatement approach to the special damages rule and the widespread dissemination exception.thus,a plaintiff asserting product disparagement in massachusetts must show that the challenged statements caused it to lose the sales of specific customers unless wide dissemination of the statements makes it unreasonably difficult for the plaintiff to prove its damages by identifying particular losses.
vsi claim to the widespread dissemination exception 
vsi asserts entitlement to the widespread dissemination exception because the challenged statements were communicated through mpt sales agents and key executives to many potential customers who would be impossible to identify.in response,mpt emphasizes that this case does not involve a publication,and it argues that the limited universe of customers potentially affected by its statements renders the widespread dissemination exception inapplicable 
mpt is correct that the circumstances here differ in a significant way from those typically associated with the widespread dissemination exception.mpt sales agents presumably know which customers they visited during the relevant time period.in addition,vsi claims that mpt aggressive marketing wrested away some of its existing customers in addition to discouraging new purchases,and it would therefore seem feasible for vsi to have contacted the customers it lost during that period to inquire whether mpt statements were a substantial factor in their decision.see restatement second of torts stating that publication of an injurious falsehood causes pecuniary loss if it is a substantial factor in bringing about the loss.
vsi asserts that it is more complicated than it may at first seem to retrieve information from specific customers.it states that,as a general matter,information about the loss of specific sales to catheterization labs is not reasonably obtainable because there are myriad individuals at each lab to whom an mpt representative might speak and t he purchasing decisions are sometimes made by committees.there appears to be no reason,however,why multiple individuals in the same lab could not be asked about their interactions with mpt sales agents.indeed,vsi ceo,howard root,testified that vsi representatives speak to doctors every day.anyone who is in the lab using products,we ask them what are they using and why.we talk to them about what information they have on that product,what they believe about that product,what they like or do like about the product.the ability to question specific customers is suggested as well in the testimony of mpt expert eugene ericksen,who contacted more than thirty syvekpatch customers who had switched,at least partially,to the dry.
at the same time,it is apparent that,even if the statements impact on a number of specific customers should have been ascertainable,many potential lost sales would have been extremely difficult,if not impossible,to confirm.for example,it would be impractical to expect vsi to contact every one of mpt longstanding customers in search of those who had considered switching to vsi,but did not do so because of the statements.it would be similarly challenging to determine whether potential customers who ultimately purchased from a competitor other than mpt had excluded vsi from contention based on what they heard from mpt sales agents.
the circumstances here thus appear to involve a cause of action that embraces both a traditional claim that particular sales were lost and the exceptional claim that many other customers were likely affected by the defendant disparaging statements.if in vsi no evidence of specific lost sales is accessible,the widespread dissemination exception would seem fully applicable and generalized proof of lost profits could be legally sufficient.if evidence of a number of specific losses should exist and is reasonably obtainable,however,the plaintiff should be required to produce proof of such losses in conjunction with the generalized proof of lost profits.this is so because the proof of specific losses under such circumstances is strong evidence of the causal link between the defendant statements and the plaintiff harm,and such specific proof justifies reliance on the generalized proof of lost profits to establish the dollar value of the loss of market.moreover,requiring the plaintiff to offer that evidence,where it is reasonably available,is consistent with both the traditional strict standard of proof for product disparagement claims and the policy of flexibility underlying the widespread dissemination exception.
the widespread dissemination exception is rooted in principles of fairness,meant to accommodate plaintiffs who lack contact with their own customers and are therefore unable to identify individual recipients of the defendant message.in such instances,evidence of sales based on past performance and market other possible causes for the decline are eliminated,advanced training,at realistically the only way the plaintiff can prove that the challenged statements caused it to lose customers.where the record shows that a plaintiff has the means to prove a link between the allegedly defamatory communication and some identifiable set of lost customers,however,the rationale for allowing a plaintiff to rely solely on the general,more speculative evidence of lost sales is considerably weakened.
if the plaintiff shows between the defendant statements and the loss of identifiable customers,the jury reasonably can draw the inference that such harm happened more widely.when such exemplar evidence should be available but is not,put another way,if the plaintiff can not show that its identifiable customers were influenced by the defendant inference of causation becomes unduly speculative.the plaintiff should not be able to satisfy its burden of proof by omitting what is logically the best evidence of the harm it alleges.in effect,that omission renders the plaintiff proof of causation insufficient as a matter of law.verizon directories yellow book usa,d,verizon makes no representation that it is in the nature of its business not to have direct contact with its customers it would be striking if such a large organization would be unable to identify even one customer it had allegedly lost as a result of the defendant commercials.fashion boutique,d at rejecting applicability of the widespread dissemination exception where the plaintiff store could have interviewed customers from its list of more than names to determine why they stopped shopping at the store.
moreover,in an age of increasingly widespread communication of information,many companies could plausibly claim that disparaging statements about their products were widely disseminated,with the harm extending far beyond the particular customers they can reasonably identify.if every plaintiff that could show some widespread dissemination were able to avoid the requirement to prove particular losses,the exception would swallow the traditional special damage rule.on the other hand,the exception would be severely diminished if it were unavailable to a plaintiff whose losses extended far beyond the specific lost customers it could identify.
applying the widespread dissemination exception to plaintiffs who can identify some,but not a
