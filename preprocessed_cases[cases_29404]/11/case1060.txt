california resale royalty act requires the seller of fine art to pay the artist a five percent royalty if the seller resides in california or the sale takes place in california.cal.a.plaintiffs in these consolidated appeals are artists and the estates of artists.sitting en banc,we address plaintiffs allegation that defendants two auction houses and an online retailer violated the act by failing to pay mandatory royalties on sales of fine art.reviewing de novo the district court order dismissing this action,zadrozny bank of mellon,cir,we hold that the act clause regulating sales outside the state of california facially violates the dormant commerce clause but that the offending provision is severable from the remainder of the act.we return the case to the panel for its consideration of the additional issues raised by the parties on appeal.
background 
the act requires that,w henever a work of fine art is sold and the seller resides in california or the sale takes place in california,the seller or the seller agent shall pay to the artist of such work of fine art or to such artist agent percent of the amount of such sale.cal.a.the artist right to the royalty may not be waived or reduced by contract.id.the act defines fine art as an original painting,sculpture,or drawing,or an original work of art in glass.id.c.the act exempts some sales,including those for less than and those involving an artist who died before.id.b.
when art is sold by an agent,the agent shall withhold percent of the amount of the sale,locate the artist and pay the artist.id.a.if the seller or the seller agent can not locate the artist within days,the seller or agent must transfer the royalty to the california arts council.id.a.in that event,the arts council must attempt to locate the artist and deliver the royalty.id.a.if the artist still has not been located after seven years,the arts council may use the funds for acquiring fine art.id.if the seller or the seller agent fails to comply with the act,the artist or the artist heirs may sue the seller or the seller agent for the royalty plus reasonable attorney fees.id.a.
invoking the royalty provision,plaintiffs brought three separate class actions against defendants sotheby,christie,and ebay,alleging that defendants,acting as agents of sellers of fine art,failed to comply with the act requirements.plaintiffs allege that some sales took place in california and that other sales took place outside california but on behalf of a seller who is a resident of california.defendants moved to dismiss the cases arguing,among other things,that the act violates the dormant commerce clause.
the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss.the court held that the act regulation of sales outside california is an impermissible regulation of wholly conduct,in violation of the dormant commerce clause.the court next held that the entire act must be stricken as unconstitutional,because the invalid portion of the act could not be severed.the court declined to reach the parties alternative arguments,such as defendants argument that the act is preempted by federal copyright laws and defendant ebay argument that it is neither a seller nor a seller agent.
plaintiffs timely appealed,and we consolidated the separate appeals.a panel heard oral argument last year.but,after argument,the panel directed the parties to file simultaneous briefs setting forth their positions on whether this case should be heard en banc.thereafter,a majority of nonrecused active judges voted to hear the case en banc.
dormant commerce clause 
the commerce clause of the united states constitution assigns to congress the authority t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states.const.art.i,cl.implicit in this affirmative grant of regulatory power to congress is a negative aspect,referred to as the dormant commerce clause.conservation force,manning,cir.the dormant commerce clause is a limitation upon the power of the states,great atl.pac.tea cottrell,d internal quotation marks omitted,which prohibits discrimination against interstate commerce and bars state regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce,quill north dakota,d citation omitted.this principle ensures that state autonomy over local needs does not inhibit the overriding requirement of freedom for the national commerce.great atl.pac.tea,at internal quotation marks omitted.
california resale royalty act requires the payment of royalties to the artist after a sale of fine art whenever the seller resides in california or the sale takes place in california.cal.a emphasis added.defendants challenge the first clause because it regulates sales that take place outside california.those sales have no necessary connection with the state other than the residency of the seller.for example,if a california resident has a apartment in new york,buys a sculpture in new york from a north dakota artist to furnish her apartment,and later sells the sculpture to a friend in new york,the act requires the payment of a royalty to the north dakota artist even if the sculpture,the artist,and the buyer never traveled to,or had any connection with,california.we easily conclude that the royalty requirement,as applied to sales by california residents,violates the dormant commerce clause.
the supreme court has held that our cases concerning the extraterritorial effects of state economic regulation stand at a minimum for the following proposition the commerce clause precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the state borders,whether or not the commerce has effects within the state.healy beer instit,d ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted see also id.holding that a statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a state exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting state authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature.here,the state statute facially regulates a commercial transaction that takes place wholly outside of the state borders.id.accordingly,it violates the dormant commerce clause.see also valley bank of plus,cir direct regulation occurs when a state law directly affects transactions that take place entirely outside of the state borders.such a statute is invalid per se citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
cases such as rocky mountain farmers union corey,cir,and association des eleveurs de canards et du quebec harris,cir,do not apply here.unlike this case which involves regulation of wholly conduct corey and harris concerned state laws that regulated conduct with allegedly significant practical effects.see corey,at california imposition of a fuel standard,which applied to fuels consumed in california emphasis added harris,at california ban on the sale of certain types of foods,including foie gras made by the plaintiffs.
nor do cases that concerned the validity of taxes,such as quill,d,and complete auto transit,brady,d,control here.the rules applied in those cases do not govern because the act does not impose a tax it regulates conduct among private parties.the act requires the seller or the seller agent to pay a royalty to the artist,a private party,not to the government.cal.a.the act even spells out additional procedural requirements for agents of sellers the agent shall withhold percent of the amount of the sale,locate the artist and pay the artist.id.a.the agent must withhold the royalty,undertake affirmative efforts to locate the artist and,once found,pay the artist.nothing of the sort is required by an ordinary tax law,such as those at issue in quill and complete auto 
it matters not that,in some circumstances,the royalty amount eventually may wind up,through a form of escheat,in a special fund of the state coffers.if the seller or the agent withholds the royalty,attempts unsuccessfully to locate the artist,remits the royalty to the arts council after days,and if the arts council attempts unsuccessfully to locate the artist for seven years,only then does the right of the artist terminate,and an amount equal to the royalty may be used by the arts council to purchase fine art.id.a.that contingent consequence years after the sale does not change the fact that the act directly regulates the conduct of the seller or the seller agent for a transaction that occurs wholly outside the state.accordingly,healy governs.under healy,the act clause regulating art sales where the seller resides in california,cal.a,and no other connection to california need exist,violates the dormant commerce clause as an impermissible regulation of wholly conduct.
the partial concurrence urges us to impose an artificial limitation one never urged by any party on that straightforward holding by limiting it to agents and not deciding the issue with respect to sellers.we decline for the simple reason that the constitutional doctrine that we apply operates without regard to that distinction.under healy,the commerce clause precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the state borders.at ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted.as we explain above,the act regulation of sales runs afoul of that constitutional rule accordingly,we must strike that portion of the act as an impermissible regulation of wholly commerce.
the scope of our holding is neither improper nor inconsistent with the supreme court guidance.it is always possible to narrow a holding.for example,we could limit our holding today to agents from new york and reserve the question with respect to agents from,say,pennsylvania.or we could limit our holding to corporate agents and reserve the question with respect to natural persons.but,where the constitutional rule applies without regard to those facts,issuing an artificially constrained opinion serves no purpose indeed,it would confuse the issue and lead to judicial inefficiency.contrary to the partial concurrence assertion,we neither anticipate a question of constitutional law nor formulate a rule of constitutional law.united states raines,d partial concurrence at.we merely apply the simple,well established constitutional rule summarized in healy.
severability 
we next consider whether we may sever the invalid clause the seller resides in california or from the remainder of the act.severability is a matter of state law.leavitt jane,d per curiam.in california,courts look first to any severability clause.cal.redev.ass matosantos,cal th,d,cal.here,the california legislature enacted the following provision 
if any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid for any reason,such invalidity shall not affect any other provisions or applications of this section which can be effected,without the invalid provision or application,and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.
cal.e.that broadly worded clause covers the situation here.accordingly,there is a presumption in favor of severance.cal.redev.ass n,d,at see also santa barbara sch.dist.superior court,cal d,cal holding that a severability clause normally calls for sustaining the valid part of the enactment internal quotation marks omitted.
we must also look to three additional criteria the invalid provision must be grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable.cal.redev.ass n,d,at internal quotation marks omitted.the first two criteria are met easily.after severance,the revised provision reads whenever a work of fine art is sold and the sale takes place in california,the seller or the seller agent shall pay to the artist of such work of fine art or to such artist agent percent of the amount of such sale.cal.a severed clause replaced with ellipsis.grammatical separability exists because the invalid part can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording or coherence of what remains the revised provision above is perfectly coherent cal.redev.ass n,d,at internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,there is functional separability because the remainder of the statute is complete in itself.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the revised provision has a reduced scope,of course,because it applies only to sales but it is complete,has coherent functionality,and does not conflict with any of the act other provisions.
the volitional separability test,although not facially obvious,also is met.we conclude that the remainder of the statute would have been adopted by the legislative body had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.id.internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,we think that the legislature actually foresaw the partial invalidation of the statute.in detailed letters to the bill legislative sponsor and to the governor,while deliberations were underway and before the act passage,legislative counsel explained that the law application to sales which occur outside of the state of california would violate the commerce clause.but,counsel opined,the law would be valid as to sales which occur in california.despite those warnings,the enacted version of the law included regulation of both sales and sales in easily separable clauses.perhaps most tellingly,the enacted version also added the severability clause,which expressly states the legislature intent that the provisions of this section are severable if any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid for any reason.cal.e.we find no reason to deviate from the presumption in favor of severance.cal.redev.ass n,d,at.
conclusion 
california civil code section regulates and sales of fine art.we hold that the provision regulating sales violates the dormant commerce clause but that the provision is severable from the remainder of the act.because the district court held that the act fell in its entirety,the court did not reach defendants alternative arguments.we return this case to the panel for its consideration of the remaining issues.we leave to the panel discretion the decision whether to address those issues on the merits or to remand them for the district court determination in the first instance.
remanded to the panel.
in,california passed the california resale royalty act the act a law that,for the last years,has secured invaluable benefits for talented artists.the act requires that when a fine art sale takes place in california or the seller of the art sometimes referred to in this opinion as the owner resides in california,the seller or the seller agent must pay a royalty to the artist.cal.a under the act,when a wealthy collector of modern art purchases for several million dollars a work of art that the prior owner bought for a minimal amount from a young artist,the artist will for the first time receive a measure of reasonable compensation for the art that he created 
in the case before us,the defendants who challenge the statute are not the seller,the buyer,or even the artist,but two new york auction houses who under the act are the sellers agents the act imposes certain duties on them with respect to the disbursement of the royalty payments.the auction houses argue that because the act imposes those duties in connection with art sales that take place outside of california,it violates the dormant commerce clause i agree that,for better or worse,the majority is compelled to conclude that,under the supreme court dormant commerce clause jurisprudence,the regulation of entities is unconstitutional and that,as a result,the defendants can not be subjected to the obligations required of them in connection with sales that take place outside of california.that,however,has little to do with the fundamental purpose and operation of the act,or with the majority unwarranted extension of the dormant commerce clause to declare a substantial portion of the act unconstitutional specifically,the portion that obligates californians to pay to the creators of the work of art a small part of the proceeds from the fine art that they sell at a profit regardless of where the actual sale takes place.
it is unfortunate that the majority goes far beyond deciding the constitutionality of the act as applied to the defendants.it decides a question entirely unnecessary to the resolution of this case when it holds the act unconstitutional as applied to california art owners who ultimately receive proceeds from sales and are then responsible for the payments to the artists.the majority does so despite the fact that no california art owners are a party to the case,and despite the fact that we could and should affirm the district court grant of the defendants motion to dismiss on far narrower constitutional grounds.
to make matters worse,the majority not only decides an unnecessary,highly disputable question regarding california art owners,but it decides it incorrectly.indeed,i strongly disagree with the majority that californians who sell their art by means of transactions may not be required by california law to remit a portion of the proceeds they ultimately receive to the artists who created the works of art.if i found it necessary or even permissible to reach this issue,i would hold that the act as applied to california art owners is not an extraterritorial regulation.in fact,the california statute represents only a minor regulation of the proceeds received from art sales by a small number of wealthy californians it in no way regulates the actual sales.indeed,it in no way affects such sales,but only imposes on californians who dispose of their art for profit an obligation to remit a small part of the proceeds to a third party after the transaction has been completed moreover,unlike in the court extraterritorial regulation cases under the dormant commerce clause,the act does not regulate the price or terms of sales in other states,nor require californians whose art is sold,or the buyers of such art,to seek regulatory approval in california before the institution or completion of such sales.for the above reasons,i dissent from the majority opinion to the extent that it holds the act unconstitutional as applied to the actions of a california owner whose work of art is sold.
as to the only question it is necessary for the court to answer the application of the act to agents of california art sellers whose business is to sell art whether its owners are or residents this case presents an entirely different legal question.that question is whether under the dormant commerce clause a california law may impose duties on business entities that engage in transactions.the defendant auction houses that sell the art work of californians and the residents of numerous other states are new york entities engaged in the business of selling art primarily in new york.that the defendants are called agents of the owners of the art work is,for purposes of the dormant commerce clause,of no legal significance.the supreme court current case law requires us to hold unconstitutional the requirement by state laws that entities take or refrain from taking actions outside of the regulating state.the california statute does just that.therefore,although i have serious doubts that this aspect of the supreme court dormant commerce clause jurisprudence is wise,i reluctantly concur in the majority judgment that the act is not constitutional as applied to the imposition of obligations on agents,professional sellers of art,including the auction houses of california art owners with respect to sales that are conducted outside of california.
california art owners 
a.the majority unnecessary and improper decision 
the supreme court has made clear that we are bound by two rules one,never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it the other,never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.united states raines,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted by deciding a constitutional question entirely unnecessary to the resolution of this case,the majority flagrantly violates both of these rules.
we have before us two lawsuits in which the defendants are auction houses that acted as agents in new york for california art owners.they have moved to dismiss lawsuits filed against them as a result of their alleged noncompliance with the act.we may affirm the district court grant of the defendants motions to dismiss by simply holding that the act is unconstitutional as applied to the agents.we need do no more,and under raines,we therefore must do no more.by striking down not only the act applications to the two agents,but also its applications to the actions of california art owners who receive money from sales,the majority opinion goes far beyond what is necessary to decide the case.indeed,it decides a constitutional question regarding the application of the dormant commerce clause to california residents that is both highly disputable and wholly unprecedented.in doing so,the majority formulates a constitutional rule far broader than is necessary to decide this case,in direct contravention of raines.
the justification the majority puts forth for not narrowing its constitutional decision is plainly insufficient.the majority decline s to narrow its decision for the simple reason that the constitutional doctrine that we apply operates without regard to the distinction between agents and sellers.majority op.at.here,the majority simply assumes the answer to the fundamental question in this case whether the imposition of obligations on agents conducting business outside of the regulating state is constitutionally indistinguishable from that state regulation of monetary proceeds received by its own residents.however one may ultimately resolve that question,it is at least clear that it is a highly controversial one on which we lack clear precedent.when such a question exists,but it is not necessary to decide it in the case before us,raines is clear we must not decide it 
there is no other justification for the majority decision to disregard supreme court precedent and decide an unnecessary constitutional issue.that the defendants have asked us to decide a broader question that does not affect them is no excuse for such an unnecessary constitutional holding.nor is the majority approach justified by the fact that the district court relied on broader reasoning than is necessary to grant the motions to dismiss.we may affirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the record,whether or not the decision of the district court relied on the same grounds or reasoning we adopt.atel financial quaker coal,cir.the majority has simply decided an unnecessary constitutional question without any need or cause to do so,in blatant disregard of the supreme court instructions to the contrary 
b.the act is not extraterritorial as applied to californians 
although the majority should not have reached the issue whether the act is constitutional as applied to the conduct of california art owners,it compounded its error by deciding it incorrectly.the supreme court has explained that the commerce clause precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the state borders,whether or not the commerce has effects within the state.healy beer,d citation omitted.from this principle,the majority concludes that the act must fall as to californians who arrange for the sale of their art in new york or other states outside of california.its rationale is that requiring californians to give the artists a portion of the proceeds they receive from sales of the art they created facially regulates a commercial transaction that takes place wholly outside of the state borders.majority op.at quoting healy,at.contrary to the majority,were we permitted to resolve this question i would hold that the act requirement that california art owners remit to the original artist a portion of the proceeds they receive from art sales is not in any respect a regulat ion of a commercial transaction.in my view,what the act regulates is the use of the money that californians ultimately receive from the transaction not the transaction itself,and certainly not any transaction.
nowhere in its opinion does the majority explain how requiring californians to remit a small percentage of the proceeds they ultimately receive from an sale of art constitutes regulat ing a commercial transaction,let alone a commercial transaction that takes pla
