this case raises the question of whether a corporate signatory to a written partnership agreement that requires international arbitration of their commercial disputes may escape arbitration of such disputes by naming as defendants two,on the basis that there was no written agreement to arbitrate with those defendants.we hold the answer is no,and reverse the contrary decision of the district court.we remand with instructions to enter an order compelling arbitration and to dismiss the case.
plaintiff sourcing unlimited,jumpsource,is a massachusetts corporation based in danvers that provides mechanical parts for the commercial and industrial equipment industry.jumpsource operates five manufacturing facilities in the united states and china it also maintains two offices in china and contracts with other chinese manufacturers to produce parts.
in late,jumpsource sought a larger manufacturing company to help it cope with filling contracts.jumpsource ceo,michael porter,began negotiating a business partnership with john perkowski,chairman and ceo of asimco technologies,atl,a delaware corporation headquartered in china.those negotiations resulted in a written partnership agreement the agreement in october.
in addition to acting as chairman and ceo of atl,perkowski was also chairman of asimco international,asimco.asimco is a subsidiary of atl and is based in southfield,michigan.it was not listed as a party to the agreement 
under the agreement,jumpsource agreed to abandon certain of its manufacturing operations in china and turn them over to atl.this freed jumpsource to focus its efforts on sales and marketing in the united states.the agreement listed existing and impending contracts held by jumpsource and indicated how the companies would split profits on those contracts.the companies agreed that atl would invoice the partnership customers in the united states for orders received and remit payment to jumpsource on a monthly basis.atl agreed,for its part,not to circumvent jumpsource in relationships with its existing customers.the companies further agreed to be exclusive partner s in the golf and turf,industrial vehicle and light construction markets.
the agreement concluded with a arbitration clause and a complementary clause 
this agreement shall be governed by,and construed in accordance with,the laws of the china,without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.any action to enforce,arising out of,or relating in any way to,any of the provisions of this agreement shall be brought in front of a china arbitration body.
the agreement was signed by porter and by wilson ni,president of atl.the agreement is not signed by any corporate subsidiary of atl,nor is there the usual boilerplate language binding all corporate subsidiaries,affiliates,assigns.one clause of the agreement,however,requires jumpsource to keep confidential any information provided to jumpsource by asimco about asimco or any asimco company and its business methods.
the business relationship soured.jumpsource filed suit in massachusetts superior court in june,asserting a number of tort,contract,and statutory claims notably,the complaint named only asimco and defendants.
the complaint alleged that in addition to the written partnership agreement between jumpsource and atl,jumpsource had entered into an oral contract with perkowski.the complaint alleged that jumpsource and perkowski agreed that asimco would deliver parts produced by the partnership to their customers in the united states.asimco would invoice the customers,retain partnership profits in the united states,and split those profits with jumpsource according to the terms of the written agreement.jumpsource alleged that the agreement with asimco adopted the written agreement terms forbidding asimco to compete with jumpsource in certain markets.the complaint does not mention any oral agreement between jumpsource and asimco to arbitrate their disputes,and jumpsource says a court must then infer that there was no such arbitration agreement 
the complaint described asimco alleged breach of the oral contract that asimco inflated expenses,concealed invoices,and attempted to generate additional business from existing jumpsource customers without informing jumpsource.asimco allegedly rebuffed repeated requests by jumpsource for an accounting.when asimco finally did provide sales figures to jumpsource,asimco allegedly those numbers by million and blocked jumpsource efforts to audit atl operations in china.asimco,allegedly,had paid jumpsource a mere in spite of invoicing the partnership customers close to million.
defendants asimco and perkowski removed the case to the district court in massachusetts on diversity grounds.defendants then filed motions to dismiss.asimco motion,in addition to arguing that the complaint failed to state valid claims,cited chapter of the federal arbitration act faa,as a basis for dismissal in favor of arbitration.asimco int l,mot.to dismiss at,sourcing unlimited,asimco int l.
that citation was significant.chapter of the faa implements the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,reprinted at,at west hereinafter new york convention.chapter governs how courts treat agreements to arbitrate international commercial disputes.asimco motion argued that the arbitration clause in the contract was subject to chapter and the new york convention because there was a written arbitration agreement the agreement provided for arbitration in the territory of a signatory to the convention the agreement arose in a commercial relationship and the commercial relationship is related with a foreign state.dimercurio sphere drake,plc,cir outlining appropriate inquiry for applicability of chapter.jumpsource has not disputed that the arbitration clause in the agreement is subject to the new york convention and chapter of the faa.
asimco motion to dismiss characterized the oral agreement between jumpsource and perkowski as a modification of the agreement,not a contract 
asimco argued that jumpsource should not be permitted to evade its obligation to arbitrate under the contract by suing a subsidiary and a corporate officer of atl for matters that all clearly arise from the agreement.asimco framed its argument in terms of equitable estoppel,noting that the issues jumpsource sought to litigate are intertwined with the agreement that jumpsource has signed.as such,asimco requested that jumpsource complaint be dismissed in favor of arbitration in china.
jumpsource responded that its claims derive not from the agreement,but from the separate oral contract between jumpsource and asimco.that oral contract,unlike the contract,did not contain any agreement to arbitrate.jumpsource denied that estoppel provided grounds for asimco,as a,to invoke a right to arbitrate under the partnership agreement.
on november,the district court issued a summary order that,in relevant part,stated the following 
the motion to dismiss on the ground that arbitration must take place in china is denied.jumpsource is not a party to any such contract with asimco.
order,sourcing unlimited.the district court gave no reasons to support its ruling other than that jumpsource had not signed an arbitration agreement with asimco.the net effect of the district court order is to deny arbitration and allow the merits of the dispute to proceed in the district court.
appellate jurisdiction 
jumpsource has moved to dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.jumpsource primary contention is that appellate jurisdiction is lacking because asimco is not a signatory to a written arbitration agreement.we reject the argument and hold that we have jurisdiction.
