we must decide whether recyclers challenging a local ordinance that bans a particular method of waste disposal have prudential standing to raise its constitutionality under the dormant commerce clause.
the fact that the subject matter of the case before us involves sewage sludge will be of no surprise to those familiar with the negative implications of the commerce clause.for our purposes,sludge is the solid,or liquid residue generated during the treatment of domestic sewage.w.here,we deal with the land application of biosolids essentially,a particular recycling method which involves the use of treated sludge as fertilizer see h land application is the spraying or spreading of sewage sludge onto the land surface the injection of sewage sludge below the land surface or the incorporation of sewage sludge into the soil so that the sewage sludge can either condition the soil or fertilize crops or vegetation grown in the soil.
in,voters in kern county,california kern,adopted a local ordinance measure e or the ordinance by ballot initiative that makes it unlawful for any person to land apply biosolids to property within the unincorporated area of the county.violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than or by imprisonment of not more than six months.by its terms,the ordinance applies to both and waste generators.in practical effect,however,because kern does not currently apply its biosolids to land within the county,measure e does not directly impact kern own waste disposal programs.
prior to the ordinance,waste generators frequently disposed of their biosolids by land application at various farms throughout the unincorporated area of kern county for example,the city of los angeles,orange county sanitation district,and county sanitation district of los angeles county ship large amounts of waste generated by their residents to green acres,honey bucket farms,and tule ranch.if these generators were precluded from land applying their biosolids in kern county,they would be required to find alternative locations to dispose of their sludge.they have submitted declarations pointing to arizona as a probable destination,and asserting that this site change would result in increased transportation costs.
these generators,along with waste transporters and farmers collectively,the recyclers,filed suit in the united states district court for the central district of california.they alleged that measure e violated the dormant commerce clause and the equal protection clause and was preempted by the federal clean water act,the california integrated waste management act ciwma,and the california water code.they also asserted that it constituted an invalid exercise of kern police power.the district court initially dismissed the clean water act and the california water code claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,while granting the recyclers request for a preliminary injunction halting enforcement of measure e.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.
the district court granted kern motion for summary judgment on the recyclers equal protection claim,and denied summary judgment on the police power claim,citing the existence of disputed facts.as for the dormant commence clause,the district court concluded that measure e discriminated against interstate commerce in effect.accordingly,the court applied strict scrutiny,determined the ordinance could not survive,and granted summary judgment in favor of the recyclers.the district court also exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the recyclers ciwma claim under and held that measure e was preempted by state law.
kern timely filed this appeal,challenging only the district court rulings on the dormant commerce clause and preemption claims.
we first assess whether the recyclers have standing to bring suit under the dormant commerce clause.that inquiry involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.warth seldin,d.constitutional or article iii standing concerns whether the plaintiff personal stake in the lawsuit is sufficient to make out a concrete case or controversy to which the federal judicial power may extend under article iii.pershing park villas homeowners ass united pac.ins,cir see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d.these limits are jurisdictional they can not be waived by any party,and there is no question that a court can,and indeed must,resolve any doubts about this constitutional issue sua sponte.see,indep.living ctr.of,shewry,cir.here,no party contends the recyclers lack article iii standing,and we are independently satisfied that they have met the requirements of lujan.
over and above the limits of article iii,however,there exists a body of judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,allen wright,d,founded in concern about the properly of the courts in a democratic society,warth,at.citing their nonconstitutional nature,we have previously held that these requirements,commonly referred to as prudential standing,can be deemed waived if not raised in the district court.bd.of natural res.brown,cir 
because kern admittedly failed to raise prudential standing before the district court we must satisfy ourselves that we should address the matter in the first instance.at times,we have exercised our prerogative to deem this issue waived in such circumstances.see,laub dep t of interior,cir pershing park,at.past practice,however,does not preclude our consideration of the subject in the case at hand.rather,the permissive language in our caselaw can be deemed indicates that the choice to reach the question lies within our discretion.we are also mindful of the supreme court description of constitutional and prudential standing as threshold determinants of the propriety of judicial intervention.warth,at.
the seventh circuit opinion in mainstreet organization of realtors calumet city,cir,is instructive.in that case,the court reached the issue of prudential standing,despite the wrinkle that the city did not argue prudential standing until the panel raised the issue at oral argument.id.at.n onconstitutional lack of standing,according to the seventh circuit,belongs to an intermediate class of cases in which a court can notice an error and reverse on the basis of it even though no party has noticed it and the error is not jurisdictional,at least in the conventional sense.see also id.at citing failure to exhaust state remedies in habeas cases and abstention as examples tenet doe,d a pplication of the totten rule of dismissal,like the abstention doctrine or the prudential standing doctrine,represents the sort of threshold question we have recognized may be resolved before addressing jurisdiction.emphasis added citation omitted.
thus,we may cite a party failure to invoke prudential standing as a ground for refusing to invoke it on our own initiative such failure,however,does not bar our examination of the matter.mainstreet,at.in other words,we may raise an unpreserved question on our own,but unlike questions of constitutional standing,we are not obliged to do so.rawoof texor petroleum,cir.
we recognize that at times,the prudential objectives thought to be enhanced by standing restrictions can not be furthered by consideration of an unpreserved argument.see craig boren,d.here,we have provided the parties with an opportunity fully to brief the issue,and further development of the record would not aid our decisionmaking process.those briefs indicate that at least one of the parties kern resist s an authoritative determination by this court.id.at.our disposition of the prudential standing question might also affect the district court decision under to exercise jurisdiction over the claims.
perhaps most importantly,a ruling on prudential standing could obviate the need to rule on the merits of the dormant commerce clause challenge.in such circumstances,we are guided by the traditional principle that a federal court should not decide federal constitutional questions where a dispositive nonconstitutional ground is available.this rule against unnecessary constitutional adjudication applies even when neither the trial court no
