plaintiffs troy peterson and michael jackson appeal from the judgment dismissing their case with prejudice after the court sustained the demurrers of defendant cellco partnership,doing business as verizon wireless,to plaintiffs unfair competition cause of action under business and professions code section et ucl in their second amended complaint,and unjust enrichment cause of action in their third amended complaint for the reasons explained below,we conclude the court properly sustained,without leave to amend,defendant demurrer to plaintiffs ucl claim because plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to support their standing to bring the claim,and plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim because it was based on alleged insurance code violations for which no private right of action exists and because plaintiffs received the benefit of the bargain.
in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs brought a class action against defendant alleging five causes of actions,including claims for unfair business practices under the ucl and unjust enrichment.plaintiffs alleged that defendant is a communication equipment vendor pursuant to insurance code section defendant offered and sold communication equipment such as cell phones and related insurance policies plaintiffs purchased cell phones and insurance from defendant and a percentage of each insurance premium paid by defendant customers was retained or received by defendant as a fee or monetary benefit to defendant from the insurance provider.plaintiffs further alleged defendant lacked a license required under insurance code section to offer or sell such insurance.
in their ucl cause of action,plaintiffs alleged defendant violated the ucl by,inter alia,offering and selling insurance while unlicensed to do so.plaintiffs alleged they had standing to bring the claim because they suffered injury in fact because defendant unlawfully retained or received a percentage of the insurance premiums paid by plaintiffs as a fee,monetary benefit or recurring revenue stream,all of which plaintiffs have a legally protected ownership interest in that is concrete,particularized and actual they lost money because defendant retained a percentage of the premium and the money was no longer in plaintiffs possession and they suffered injury in fact and lost money to defendant as a direct result of defendant unlawful activities because if defendant had not offered and sold insurance when it was not licensed to do so,plaintiffs would not have purchased the insurance from defendant.
in their unjust enrichment cause of action,plaintiffs alleged defendant was unjustly enriched by its receipt or retention of the fee,monetary benefit or recurring revenue stream because defendant did not maintain the required license to offer or sell the insurance and was not lawfully entitled to receive or retain any percentage of the insurance premium 
plaintiffs prayed,inter alia,for restitution of all funds acquired by defendant in violation of the ucl and of all gains that have unjustly enriched defendant at the expense of plaintiffs.
defendant demurred to the second amended complaint,arguing,inter alia,plaintiffs ucl claim failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because under proposition,only a private plaintiff who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition may bring a ucl claim,plaintiffs allegation that defendant received a percentage of the insurance premium as a commission in no way shows that plaintiffs incurred monetary loss,and therefore does not satisfy the standing requirements of proposition,and plaintiffs lacked standing because the allegations of the complaint show that plaintiffs received the benefit of the bargain and have not lost money.defendant asked the court to take judicial notice of the official voter information guide to proposition.as to plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim,defendant demurrer alleged plaintiffs failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because plaintiffs received the benefit of the bargain and could not seek a windfall under the guise of restitution.
the court granted defendant request for judicial notice and sustained,without leave to amend,the demurrer to plaintiffs ucl cause of action because plaintiff had been repeatedly unable to state facts supporting the legal requirement of actual injury and pecuniary loss as required by proposition.the court overruled defendant demurrer to plaintiffs unjust enrichment cause of action 
defendant subsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim in the second amended single remaining theory arguing,inter alia,the cause of action was subject to proposition requirement that a private plaintiff have lost money and have suffered injury,and was based on alleged violations of insurance licensing statutes for which there is no private right of action.the court granted the motion with leave to amend,relying on cases holding that no private cause of action exists for such violations of the insurance code.
plaintiffs then filed a third amended complaint alleging solely an unjust enrichment cause of action,once again relying on insurance code section prohibition against a communications equipment vendor offering or selling insurance without a license,and claiming defendant was unjustly enriched by the payment of the fee,commission,profit or other form of monetary benefit because defendant was not authorized to receive or accept such payments as a result of the offer,sale or transaction of communication equipment insurance and failed to maintain the proper license 
defendant demurred to the third amended complaint,arguing the claim was still fundamentally grounded in alleged violations of the insurance code.defendant contended the legislature delegated enforcement of the insurance code statutes governing communication equipment vendors to the insurance commissioner and chose not to create a cause of action for private plaintiffs.defendant further argued plaintiffs could not evade the legislature decision not to allow a private cause of action simply by omitting some references to some statutory citations,while still invoking the substance of those statutes.
the court sustained,without leave to amend,defendant demurrer to plaintiffs third amended complaint,stating the claim for unjust enrichment is based upon violations of the insurance code for which no private cause of action exists.the court dismissed plaintiffs action with prejudice.
discussion 
standard of review 
in evaluating a trial court order sustaining a demurrer,we review the complaint de novo to determine whether it contains sufficient facts to state a cause of action.blank kirwan cal d.in doing so,we accept as true all properly pleaded material facts,as well as facts that may be implied from the properly pleaded facts montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d,and we also consider matters that may be judicially noticed evans city of berkeley cal th,d.we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.ibid.the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court erroneously sustained the demurrer as a matter of law and must show the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of the cause of action.rakestraw california physicians service th,d.because standing goes to the existence of a cause of action,lack of standing may be raised by demurrer buckland threshold enterprises,th,d.
the court properly sustained defendant demurrer to plaintiffs ucl claim 
plaintiffs contend their second amended complaint alleged facts sufficient to establish standing to bring their ucl claims,arguing their alleged payment of an unlawful commission represents a distinct and palpable injury in fact sufficient to provide standing for their ucl claims they alleged facts showing they lost money as a result of defendant illegal business practice and they alleged facts demonstrating the causal connection between defendant unlawful business practice and the lost money.alternatively,they argue that a violation of the insurance code creates a cause of action for unfair business practices.
the ucl prohibits,inter alia,any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.in order to give substance to this prohibition,a ucl action borrows violations of other laws and treats these violations,when committed pursuant to business activity,as unlawful practices farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d.here,plaintiffs ucl claim was predicated on allegations defendant violated the insurance code by selling cell phone insurance without a license.
the court sustained defendant demurrer to plaintiffs ucl cause of action for lack of standing.section of the ucl governs a plaintiff standing to assert a ucl claim.prior to the enactment of proposition in november,the ucl did not predicate standing on a showing of injury or damage and was thus subject to abuse by attorneys who used it as the basis for legal shakedown schemes and frivolous lawsuits.buckland threshold enterprises,th,d buckland californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d.to address this problem,proposition amended section to accord standing only to certain specified public officials and to any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.buckland,at,d.thus,in the aftermath of proposition,only plaintiffs who have suffered actual damage may pursue a private ucl action.a private plaintiff must make a twofold showing he or she must demonstrate injury in fact and a loss of money or property caused by unfair competition.buckland,at,d.
plaintiffs contend they asserted sufficient facts to meet both requirements for standing under section.the first requirement injury in fact is defined in buckland as a distinct and palpable injury suffered as a result of the defendant actions.alternatively,buckland articulates another definition of injury in fact as an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,citations and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,citations.buckland,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs assert they met both definitions,having suffered distinct and palpable injury and the concrete and actual invasion of a legally protected interest,because they paid the alleged unlawful commission that was illegally retained or received by defendant as a percentage of plaintiffs insurance payments.
to support their assertion they suffered injury in fact,plaintiffs rely on aron of california th,d aron,where plaintiff aron rented a truck from.at the time,supplied each customer with a partially fueled truck and required the customer in order to avoid refueling charges to return the truck with the amount of fuel,measured solely by the fuel gauge.id.at,d.aron alleged he returned the truck to with more fuel than he was provided and asked for credit or reimbursement for the excess fuel but was refused.id.at,d.he alleged injury in fact an economic loss because,in the absence of a precise gauge,the only way to avoid the imposition of charge was to overfill the fuel tank.id.at,d.he further alleged the use of the fuel gauge as the instrument of measurement did not comply with california law on weights and measurements.id.at,d.the appellate court held aron had standing to file a ucl complaint because his allegations set forth a basis for a claim of actual economic injury as a result of an unfair and illegal business practice.ibid.
plaintiffs contend there is essentially no difference between aron being required to pay for excess fuel standing granted and plaintiffs here being required to pay an unlawful commission.not so.there is a difference and it is a decisive one.aron suffered actual economic injury due to imprecise measuring system,he paid more to refuel the truck than required under the rental agreement.aron,supra,th at,d.in other words,aron could have paid less to rent the truck had employed an accurate measuring system.in contrast,plaintiffs here do not allege they paid more for the insurance due to defendant collecting a commission.they do not allege they could have bought the same insurance for a lower price either directly from the insurer or from a licensed agent.absent such an allegation,plaintiffs have not shown they suffered actual economic injury.rather,they received the benefit of their bargain,having obtained the bargained for insurance at the bargained for price.medina products,th,d insurance policy sold by unlicensed insurer is nevertheless enforceable by the insured.
instructive here is hall time th,d hall,where the plaintiff hall based his ucl claim on allegations a book seller deceptively sent buyers invoices to pay for a book during a free trial period.id.at,d.hall received the book,kept it,and did not make payment until after the free trial period expired.id.at,d.a different panel of this court held hall lacked standing to pursue his ucl claim.id.at,d.hall did not allege he did not want the book,the book was unsatisfactory,or the book was worth less than what he paid for it.id.at,d.so too,in the instant case,plaintiffs do not allege they were dissatisfied with the insurance or were uninformed of its price.indeed,in their fraud claim in the second amended complaint,plaintiffs acknowledged defendant disclosed to them the price and extent of the insurance coverage.
because plaintiffs failed to allege facts showing injury in fact,we need not address their assertion they met the second requirement for,they lost money as a result of the alleged unfair to briefly discuss the meaning of the phrase lost money in section.in plaintiffs view,a person has lost money when the money is no longer in their possession.but this proposed definition encompasses every purchase or transaction where a person pays with money.in hall,we defined a loss,for purposes of section,as a n undesirable outcome of a risk the disappearance or diminution of value,usu.in an unexpected or relatively unpredictable way.hall,supra,th at,d.thus,in hall,the plaintiff expended money by paying the seller he received a book in exchange therefore he did not lose money or suffer injury in fact.id.at,d.
alternatively,plaintiffs argue that,even if they lack the standing prescribed in section,they may bring a ucl action because a violation of the insurance code give s rise to a cause of action for violation of the ucl.for this proposition they rely on wayne staples,th,d wayne and stevens superior court th,d stevens.we note that the existence of a cause of action does not answer the question of who has standing to bring the claim.and in any case,both stevens and wayne are inapposite.the stevens decision was final prior to the adoption of proposition.wayne did not address the issue of the plaintiff standing to bring a ucl claim.rather,wayne considered whether the defendant was exempt from the insurance code licensing requirements under a statutory exception.wayne,at,d.in wayne,the defendant charged the plaintiff an insurance premium that was twice as high as the amount the defendant paid the shipper who contracted with the insurer.id.at,d.the issue in wayne was whether that percent markup constituted a commission within the meaning of insurance code section which allows certain persons to sell insurance without a license so long as no commission is paid.wayne,at,d.thus,neither stevens nor wayne supports plaintiffs implied assertion that section does not apply to ucl claims predicated on insurance code violations.
the court properly sustained defendant demurrer to plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim 
plaintiffs contend they properly pled facts to support their cause of action for enrichment in their third amended complaint,relying on the following pleadings plaintiffs conferred a benefit upon defendant defendant knowingly accepted and retained the benefits defendant has been unjustly enriched by the benefit conferred by plaintiffs and it would be unjust and unconscionable to permit defendant to be enriched at plaintiffs expense.
the elements of an unjust enrichment claim are the receipt of a benefit and the unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.lectrodryer seoulbank th,d.here,plaintiffs received the benefit of the bargain t he mere fact that a
