the investing public is concerned with two factors when confronted with a business opportunity risk and reward.this point was underscored in a recent case in this court.see commodity futures trading comm fitzgerald,cir.there,we held that the defendant made misleading statements when it spoke of unlimited profit potential and ways to limit risk while,in fact,of the firm customers lost money on its proposed investments.the representations created a picture of the ratio that,when compared to reality,was heavily distorted.
the focus in that case was on the risk variable.in this case,we turn to the other variable reward.the federal trade commission ftc contends that the defendants misrepresented the potential profit that customers could expect to earn from their telephone card dispensing machines,thereby violating section of the federal trade commission act ftca,in addition to the ftc franchise rules,et.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.we reverse and render judgment in favor of the ftc.
stephen tashman was in the business of selling business opportunities to hopeful entrepreneurs.tashman sold machines that dispensed phone and the phone cards that go in them through the corporation that he controlled,telecard dispensing tdc the record points to an intricate web of sales pitches by the defendants that ultimately consisted of untruthful,baseless assertions.first,tdc attempted to lure customers through radio advertisements which asked listeners the following question do you really want to make more additional to thousand dollars a year or more,possibly a lot more,and only work three to five hours per week the advertisement went on to proclaim that w ith a very small investment you can make to a week or a lot as little as five hours a week.the advertisement concluded stop the excuses.you can do it.you can change your life.
spurred by the specter of a lot more than per hour and the admonishment to stop excuses,who could resist the temptation to call tdc upon making the phone call,prospective customers spoke to a telemarketer,known as a fronter,who would read a script in which mathematical figures were thrown around in an effort to get down to the nuts and bolts and talk about the money being made in this industry.this conversation included claims that tdc locators would put machines in public places experiencing a traffic flow of at least persons per day of passersby,according to tdc experience,are likely to purchase phone cards from the machines and entrepreneurs could be expected to pay off their in about six months.prospective customers were then sent disclosure statements which reinforced the rosy picture painted by the defendants.the disclosures stated,for example,that tdc received positive letters and only twenty negative ones.tdc also encouraged prospective customers to speak to references who would give testimony of the profit potential in the phone card dispensing business.
unfortunately for tdc customers,tdc had no basis for many of its claims.the claim that customers could expect to pay off their machines in six months,for example,was in turn based upon two untrue claims that people per day would pass by the machines and of passersby would purchase cards.in fact,neither claim is true.tdc locators were paid to put machines in any location,and many locations did not have foot traffic at a rate of per day.moreover,the figure was completely made up.the record shows that the defendants once ran an experiment which,to the defendants chagrin,showed that the machine made no sales whatsoever.the defendants then decided to borrow the usage rate from an unrelated machines in which people can attempt to catch stuffed animals with a mechanical crane.compounding this misrepresentation,the radio advertisement,in conjunction with the disclosure statements and the telemarketers emphasis on the nuts and bolts of the money being made in the industry,created an impression that most customers were reaping nice profits and,on the whole,very satisfied.the record points to a quite different conclusion few of the customers who bought machines made significant returns and most did not even recoup their original investment.the ftc put forward fourteen witnesses who claimed to have lost substantial sums in reliance on tdc representations tdc,on the other hand,used four one of which was a customer who claimed to have made a profit,and his testimony on this point is somewhat suspect moreover,some of the references never owned phone card vending machines,and all of them were paid to serve as references.finally,the disclosure statements failed to report that tdc received twenty to thirty calls per day complaining about sluggish phone card the portrait of customer satisfaction and profitability painted by tdc.
to establish liability under section of the ftca,the ftc must establish that there was a representation the representation was likely to mislead customers acting reasonably under the circumstances,and the representation was material.ftc world travel vacation brokers,cir ftc atlantex,trade cas.cch at,wl,aff,cir.the defendants concede that the first and third elements have been established they dispute only the second element.the undisputed evidence shows,however,that tdc had no basis for the representations it made.how,for example,could it claim that of passersby would purchase phone cards when the only data tdc utilized was based upon an entirely different product one searches in vain for the district court analysis on whether particular assertions were likely to mislead.in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,for example,the court jumped from a correct recitation of the legal standard to a discussion of irrelevant points such as the fact that the business was new and the fact that migrant workers might buy the cards leading the court to conclude that i t was therefore up to the potential customers to weigh the risks and profit potential,and to follow up their investment with the hard work and business savvy necessary to make the venture successful and profitable.with regard to the second point,no one doubts the utility of phone cards or claims that the product is a scam all that is at issue are the statements made by the defendants.as for the first point,there is no new business immunity from the federal trade commission act.see,ftc wolf,trade cas.cch,wl,aff,cir holding that defendants had violated section by making false representations regarding earnings that consumers could expect from hot pizza vending machine business opportunities.indeed,it is precisely in the context of a new venture that investors are unlikely to have their own data.in the new business setting,investors are the most vulnerable to the representations and purported expertise of those in the business of selling novel business opportunities.finally,caveat emptor is simply not the law,and the district court conclusion to the contrary is incorrect.
the district court even seemed to concede that misrepresentations were made.in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,it held that reasonable potential customers would not have believed that they could make tens of thousands of dollars while working only three to four hours per week.the ftca does not have an extravagant claim defense moreover,this was only one of many misrepresentations made by tdc.
in short,the record contains overwhelming evidence that misrepresentations were made and that reasonable consumers were likely to and,in fact,did rely on those statements.rather than analyzing those statements,the court focused on a few satisfied customers,the utility of the product being sold,and why the government ought not protect consumers from what it perceived as a lack of hard work and walking around common sense.the district court legal conclusions are incorrect,and its findings of fact are clearly erroneous.
count five of the ftc complaint alleges that the defendants violated the ftc franchise rule section b of the rule,b,states that if a franchisor makes any representation to a prospective franchisee regarding a specific level of potential sales,income,gross or net profit for that prospective franchisee,or which states other facts which suggest such a specific level,then the franchisor must have a reasonable basis for the representation which must be disclosed.in this case,there is no question that the defendants many representations such as the claim lacked any reasonable basis in fact.the disclosure statements did not provide a reasonable basis for the claims.rather,they merely added to the deceit by supplying testimonials of satisfied customers without saying that twenty to thirty calls per day were made by disgruntled customers.the district court ignored this count entirely when,in fact,it should have entered judgment in favor of the ftc.
for the forgoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for the entry of judgment in favor of the ftc.on remand,the district court should fashion appropriate monetary and injunctive relief 
i agree with the majority that the district court erred,but i believe that the majority paints with too broad a brush instead,i would reverse only the district court failure to address the appellees compliance with the franchise rule disclosure requirements,and i would affirm the judgment of the district court both on the ftc section claim and the district court refusal to entertain the ftc reasonable basis franchise rule claim.
section of the ftc act simply prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a.congress must have realized this vague and amorphous standard would require more concrete definition.for that reason,congress gave the ftc broad authority to define by rule specific acts or practices which are unfair or deceptive.a b.the ftc is also given authority to bring a civil action in district court for violations of its rules.alternatively,the ftc can also bring a direct action for injunctive relief to prevent continued violations of section.b.the ftc determination that a particular practice is unfair or deceptive is entitled to deference from the courts because 
this statutory scheme necessarily gives the commission an influential role in interpreting and in applying it to the facts of particular cases arising out of unprecedented situations.moreover,as an administrative agency which deals continually with cases in the area,the commission is often in a better position than are courts to determine when a practice is deceptive within the meaning of the act the commission judgment is to be given great weight by reviewing courts.ftc,d.
the ftc has determined that,as a general matter,making earnings claims in conjunction with the offering of business opportunities constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice unless specific procedures are followed.as congress intended,those procedures are promulgated in the franchise rule.
in this case,count i of the complaint charges that the appellees violated section by making false and misleading representations regarding the expected earnings for tdc business opportunities.the ftc requirements for such potential earnings representations are set out in subsections b c and e of the franchise rule each of these subsections contain the identical operative language that 
at the time such representation is made,a reasonable basis exists for such representation 
that specific violation is also separately alleged as a part of the ftc franchise rule claim in count v of the complaint to give appropriate regard to the ftc expertise in regulating the business opportunity industry,where the central issue in the case is the basis for earnings claims,i think the correct analysis is to first determine whether the specifics of the franchise rule regarding earnings claims have been violated with respect to the alleged section violation claimed in count i,this approach allows a focus on the franchise rule requirement whether the appellees had a reasonable basis for their earnings claims by focusing on the franchise rule,the inquiry must shift to hard evidence the appellees preliminary research on the profit potential of calling card vending machines and the basis of the actual representations made.instead,the trial of this case,conducted under the ambiguous standards of section,amounted to weighing the sometimes suspect and often conflicting testimony of a small percentage of disgruntled customers about their perceptions of the appellees representations.i agree that the district court may have misapplied the law to the facts of this case.however,upon careful review of the record,i am compelled to agree with the district court that the ftc failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to the lack of a reasonable basis for the potential earnings representations.
under the franchise rule,any oral or written representation of potential or existing earnings must have a reasonable basis and the franchisor must possess material substantiating the earnings claim which must be provided to the franchisee on request.b,c,e.the franchisor must notify the franchisee of the existence of the substantiating materials when making the earnings claim.the franchise rule also requires that franchisors provide franchisees with a disclosure document containing numerous required boilerplate provisions b,c,d.oral or written representations of potential or existing earnings must contain the number and percentage of customers which the franchisor knows have earned at least the same amounts as those claimed and the time period over which the franchisees have made the claimed earnings.b i,c i.if the franchisor has no prior franchising experience in the field,this fact must be disclosed.b ii,c.
to violate the franchise rule,the appellees must have either lacked a reasonable basis for their earnings claims when made,or failed to appropriately disclose the required information.in count v of its complaint,the ftc alleges the appellees did both it did not prove the former,and the record is incomplete as to the latter.the ftc bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellees lacked a reasonable basis for their earnings claims or did not properly disclose the required information.see ftc pantron i,cir.the district court held that the ftc failed to meet its burden under section because tdc customers did not rely on the representations as to potential profits in this new and risky industry both the parties agree that customer reliance is not the controlling inquiry.the district court also overlooked the key inquiry for the kind of alleged violation at issue here whether the appellees had a reasonable basis for their earnings claims.the majority flatly concludes that the appellees had no basis for their earnings claims.my review of the evidence indicates that,while that may be true,the ftc did not prove it at trial.
determining the reasonableness of the basis for earnings claims is a highly factual inquiry which i would not reverse unless it appears that the district court was clearly erroneous.see beneficial ftc,cir whether misrepresentation has a tendency to mislead is a highly factual inquiry d private franchise contracts the question of what constitutes a reasonable basis is essentially a factual issue.a critical determination is what level of substantiation is required in order to constitute a reasonable basis see ftc pantron i,cir.determining the quantum of evidence necessary to carry the burden of proof is quintessentially a question for the finder of fact.in this case,the district court made no factual findings with respect to the basis for the appellees earnings claims,and with good reason the ftc presented no credible evidence that the appellees lacked a reasonable basis for their claims.
the record is not nearly as clear as the majority sets it out.the only evidence in the record on which the ftc bases its lack of reasonable basis argument is the testimony of defendant mishkin.mishkin,an associate of tashman,was questioned regarding the fronters telemarketing script,used when callers responded to tdc advertisements.in relevant part,the script stated
