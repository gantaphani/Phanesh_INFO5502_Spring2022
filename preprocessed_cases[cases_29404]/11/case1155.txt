the dispute in this telecommunications case stems from appellant north county communication north county contention that it has a private right of action to enforce various compensation arrangements pursuant to the federal communications act.in its complaint,north county,a competitive local exchange carrier clec,alleged that appellees,as commercial mobile radio service cmrs providers,failed to properly compensate north county for terminating their calls on north county network.
north county challenges the district court dismissal of its declaratory judgment claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.specifically,the district court held that north county had no private right of action to enforce the compensation arrangements in federal court.on appeal,north county asserts that b,b,and,and the implementing federal communications commission commission or fcc regulation,provide the requisite private right of action.we disagree,and affirm the district court judgment.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
prior to enactment of the telecommunications act,the commission established rules governing connections between local exchange carriers lecs and cmrs providers.these rules required mutual compensation for the exchange of traffic between lecs and cmrs providers.in the matter of developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime decision,footnote reference omitted.in particular,the rules required the originating carrier,whether lec or cmrs provider,to pay reasonable compensation to the terminating carrier in connection with traffic that terminates on the latter network facilities.id.at,footnote reference omitted.
the commission eventually determined that b obligates lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the exchange of intramta major trading area traffic between lecs and cmrs providers.id.at,footnote reference omitted.for traffic originating and terminating within the same mta,reciprocal compensation obligations under b,rather than interstate or intrastate access charges,applied.see id.at,footnote references omitted.
although section b and the commission reciprocal compensation rules reference an arrangement between lecs and other telecommunications carriers,including cmrs providers,they do not explicitly address the type of arrangement necessary to trigger the payment of reciprocal compensation or the applicable compensation regime,if any,when carriers exchange traffic without making prior arrangements with each other.id.at,footnote reference and internal quotation marks omitted.this lack of guidance generated a legion of disputes among the carriers,see id.at,and prompted clarification from the commission.
as the existing rules did not expressly preclude the filing of tariffs to set compensation,the commission clarified that the reciprocal compensation rules did not,at that time,prohibit incumbent lecs from filing state termination tariffs,which cmrs providers were obligated to accept.see id.at.because the existing compensation rules were silent as to the type of arrangement necessary to trigger payment obligations,the commission found that it would not have been unlawful for incumbent lecs to assess transport and termination charges based upon a state tariff.id.at,footnote reference omitted.however,the commission also amend ed its rules to make clear its preference for contractual arrangements by prohibiting lecs from imposing compensation obligations for cmrs traffic pursuant to tariff.id.at footnote reference omitted 
upon the effective date of the commission amendments,any existing wireless termination tariffs would no longer apply.id.at.
b.the district court dismissal of north county third amended complaint 
according to its third amended complaint,north county is a clec that provides switched and local exchange,exchange access,and other telecommunication services to end users in california.north county alleged that the are cmrs and clec providers that offer calling plans allowing calls to areas serviced by north county.
north county asserts that it incurs costs in terminating calls sent to its end users by the defendants end users.north county alleged that knowingly send traffic to north county in the absence of an interconnection agreement or a reciprocal compensation agreement for north county to terminate to its end users customers.as a common carrier,north county is obligated to terminate calls received from other carriers to north county end users.
north county alleged that it began sending monthly bills to the defendants for traffic termination in january,and that it billed the defendants per minute and per call,before increasing its rate to the prevailing market rate of per minute.according to north county,the defendants refused to pay the bills or enter into a compensation arrangement.
relying on the decision,north county contended that it is proper for a lec,like north county,to be compensated for traffic sent to its that originates with cmrs providers pursuant to its tariff on file.north county acknowledged that the commission limited the scope of this finding to time periods preceding april,the effective date of the amendments to section promulgated by the decision.according to north county,cmrs providers still remained obligated to comply with the principles of mutual compensation and to pay reasonable compensation to the lec for the termination of traffic that originates with the cmrs provider.
in its first cause of action,north county sought declaratory judgment,alleging that it is entitled to be compensated for the termination of traffic which the defendants sent and continue to send to north county end users north county recognized that while determining the precise rate of compensation for termination of traffic,including call and minutes of use,under these circumstances may be a matter beyond the expertise of this court and within the expertise of the appropriate regulatory body,the fcc has also indicated that collection actions do not state a cause of action under its rules.north county requested that the district court determine 
the number of calls and the number of minutes originating on the defendants networks and terminated on north county network from april,up through the time of trial,that north county is entitled to receive mutual compensation for the termination of calls to north county which originate on the defendants networks,and that the defendants are required to commit to compensate north county at a rate to be determined by the appropriate regulatory body,or else refrain from sending any traffic to north county and refrain from taxing north county limited resources,that the defendants conduct amounts to an unjust and unreasonable practice in violation of section and of the federal communications act,which has damaged north county.
north county second cause of action is premised on quantum meruit.north county alleged that defendants knowingly accepted,used,enjoyed and benefitted from the services provided by north county.according to north county,i t would be unjust to allow the defendants to have the benefit of north county services without paying reasonable compensation for these benefits and the defendants should be so ordered to pay.north county sought damages covering the period beginning april,and continuing up through the time of trial.
in its third cause of action,north county asserted damages pursuant to the applicable tariff covering the period beginning years before the filing of this complaint and continuing up to and including april.
the district court granted motion to dismiss,holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction,because north county failed to properly allege a federal claim.the district court also concluded that declaratory judgment would not achieve the objectives of granting such relief.north county filed a timely notice of appeal.

iii.discussion 
north county declaratory judgment act claims 
north county claims are hampered by the very relief it declaratory judgment.t he declaratory judgment act does not by itself confer federal jurisdiction.nationwide mut.ins.liberatore,cir.as required by article iii,courts may adjudicate only actual cases or controversies.rhoades,at citation omitted.the disagreement underlying the declaratory relief action must not be nebulous or contingent but must have taken on a fixed and final shape so that a court can see what legal issues it is deciding,what effect its decision will have on the adversaries,and some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them.id.quoting pub.serv.comm wycott,alteration omitted.
north county contends that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act because the federal communications act creates a private right of action for violations of its compensation requirements.where a federal statute does not explicitly create a private right of action,a plaintiff can maintain a suit only if congress intended to provide the plaintiff with an implied private right of action.in re digimarc.derivative,cir quoting first pac.bancorp,helfer,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the judicial task is to interpret the statute congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.id.at quoting alexander sandoval,alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,it is not enough for north county to broadly proclaim that it is entitled to compensation under the federal communications act.instead,north county must demonstrate that a federal statute vests north county with such a right.rouse united states dep t of state,cir,as amended citation omitted emphasis in the original.language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that congress through statutory text created,but it may not create a right that congress has not.id.quoting alexander,at parentheses and footnote reference omitted.
a broad assertion of a private right of action is not easily maintained under the federal communications act,as our statutory analysis is intertwined with the requisite deference to the commission interpretation of the federal communications act.this is so because the fcc is the agency that is primarily responsible for the interpretation and implementation of the telecommunications act and of its own regulations.greene sprint commc ns,cir citation omitted see also howard aol,cir congress created the fcc to enforce the communications act.the supreme court opinions have repeatedly emphasized that the fcc judgment regarding how the public interest is best served is entitled to substantial judicial deference.quoting fcc wncn listeners guild,alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.absent a supporting commission determination,and with no showing of congressional intent to create a private right of action,north county can not assert a viable claim for relief.see greene,at.
in support of its contention that it has a private right of action to seek compensation from the cmrs providers in federal court,north county relies on b b b and.we examine each of these cited sources to determine if the referenced statutory or regulatory language provides for a private right of action or for a private remedy.we simultaneously consider any relevant determinations from the commission.applying this analysis and deferring to the commission primary jurisdiction,we conclude that b and b can not support north county claims for declaratory relief.the primary jurisdiction doctrine is a doctrine specifically applicable to claims properly cognizable in court that contain some issue within the special competence of an administrative agency.radio servs.qwest,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.t he primary jurisdiction doctrine is designed to protect agencies possessing powers and that are actively involved in the administration of regulatory statutes.clark time warner cable,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.charged with the administration of the telecommunications and federal communications acts,the fcc is such an agency.id.citation omitted.under the primary jurisdiction doctrine,courts may decline to decide issues that are within the special competence of an administrative agency.id.at.specifically,the commission determinations that b is inapplicable to cmrs providers,and that the commission is the appropriate forum for pursuing compensation under b are fatal to north county contention.we also conclude that north county declaratory judgment claims premised on b are fatally flawed because the commission has not determined that the cmrs providers lack of compensation to clecs violates b.finally,we hold that,because north county can not establish an independent right to compensation,and are not viable vehicles for it to seek relief.
b provides 
local exchange carriers and commercial mobile radio service providers shall comply with principles of mutual compensation.a local exchange carrier shall pay reasonable compensation to a commercial mobile radio service provider in connection with terminating traffic that originates on facilities of the local exchange carrier.a commercial mobile radio service provider shall pay reasonable compensation to a local exchange carrier in connection with terminating traffic that originates on the facilities of the commercial mobile radio service provider.
pursuant to b,e ach local exchange carrier has the following duties the duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.
according to north county,a violation of b compensation requirements is the equivalent of a violation of.b for which it has a federal remedy.however,nothing in the plain language of b provides for a right to compensation.rather,b provides for the duties of local exchange carriers,not even mentioning cmrs providers.see u.b.
our reading of b plain language is bolstered by the commission determination that b is inapplicable to cmrs providers.in north county commc ns metropcs california,llc,north county alleged that metropcs,a cmrs provider,failed to compensate north county for traffic terminated on north county network.see id.at.rejecting north county claims made pursuant to,the commission held 
section b imposes a duty to establish reciprocal compensation only upon lecs.moreover,the commission has stated unequivocally that cmrs providers will not be classified as lecs and are not subject to the obligations of section b.therefore,as a cmrs provider,metropcs is not subject to the obligations arising directly from section b itself 
metropcs,at,footnote references and internal quotation marks omitted.
the commission also delineated the procedures that a private party must undertake in pursuit of reasonable compensation under b.the commission decline d to determine,in the first instance,what constitutes reasonable compensation under b.id.at,footnote reference and internal quotation marks omitted.the commission expounded that the more appropriate venue for determining what constitutes reasonable compensation for north county termination of intrastate traffic originated by metropcs is not this commission,but rather the california puc,via whatever procedural mechanism it deems appropriate under state law,complaint proceeding,declaratory ruling proceeding,generic cost or rulemaking proceeding.id.internal quotation marks omitted the commission explained that it would consider north county claims once a determination of the rate of reasonable compensation was made by the appropriate state commission.id.the commission ruling demonstrates that it is the proper forum for north county claims premised on b,once north county has met the predicate procedural requirements 
we readily defer to the commission resolution of north county claims asserted pursuant to,and its determination of the procedures applicable to claims made under b.see,cir w e are interpreting the fcc regulations,and courts should give substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations.citation and internal quotation marks omitted 
section b provides in relevant part 
all charges,practices,classifications,and regulations for and in connection with such communication service,shall be just and reasonable,and any such charge,practice,classification,or regulation that is unjust or unreasonable is declared to be unlawful.
it is arguable that the plain language of b contains an implication that private parties may pursue remedies for violations of the statute.however,given the broad language of the statute,a more reasonable interpretation is that it is within the commission purview to determine whether a particular practice constitutes a violation for which there is a private right to compensation.see in re long distance telecomm,cir,as amended this charge of unreasonable practices is a determination that congress has placed squarely in the hands of the fcc.quoting consol.rail ass of recycling,alteration and internal quotation marks omitted see also greene,at.however,the commission has not determined that the cmrs providers lack of payment to clecs like north county violates b north county essentially requests that the federal courts fill in the analytical gap stemming from the absence of a commission determination regarding b.this we decline to do.the district court properly dismissed north county declaratory judgment claim premised on b,because entry of a declaratory judgment would put interpretation of a regulatory scheme squarely in the hands of private parties and some federal district judges,instead of in the hands of the commission.greene,at quoting conboy v.at t,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted see also in re long distance telecommunications,at 
our conclusion,that an fcc determination is integral to claims involving b,is bolstered by the supreme court recent decision in global crossing,metrophones.in global crossing,the supreme court considered whether of the telecommunications act authorized a payphone operator to bring a federal claim against carriers who refused to pay compensation ordered by the fcc.at.the fcc determined that a carrier refusal to pay the compensation ordered amounts to an unreasonable practice within the terms of b.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.that determination,it believed,would permit a payphone operator to bring a lawsuit under,to collect the compensation owed.id.citation omitted.the supreme court opined that language makes clear that the lawsuit is proper if the commission could properly hold that a carrier failure to pay compensation is an unreasonable practice deemed unlawful under b.id.at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in the original.
in reviewing,the supreme court noted the linkage between the statute purpose and the fcc regulations.t he purpose of is to allow persons injured by b violations to bring damages actions.id.at citations omitted.history also makes clear that the fcc has long implemented b through the issuance of rules and regulations.this is obviously so when the rules take the form of fcc approval or prescription for the future of rates that exclusively are reasonable.id.citations omitted.it is also so when the fcc has set forth rules that,for example,require certain accounting methods or insist upon certain carrier practices,while as here prohibiting others as unjust or unreasonable under b.id.citations omitted.insofar as the statute language is concerned,to violate a regulation that lawfully implements b requirements is to violate the statute.id.at citation omitted emphasis in the original.
given these statutory and regulatory considerations,the supreme court framed the issue as whether the particular fcc regulation lawfully implements b unreasonable practice prohibition.id.at.the supreme court opined that t he carrier refusal to divide the revenues it receives from the caller with its collaborator,the payphone operator,despite the fcc regulation requiring it to do so,can reasonably be called a practice in connection with the provision of that service that is unreasonable.id.citation omitted.
however,the supreme court limited its holding,as it did not suggest that the fcc is required to find carriers failures to divide revenues to be b violations in every instance.id.at citation omitted.nor did it suggest that every violation of fcc regulations is an unjust and unreasonable practice.here there is an explicit statutory scheme,and compensation of payphone operators is necessary to the proper implementation of that scheme.under these circumstances,the fcc finding that the failure to follow the order is an unreasonable practice is well within its authority.id.t he fcc properly implements b when it reasonably finds that the failure to follow a commission,rate or determination made under a different statutory provision is unjust or unreasonable under b.id.at citations and emphasis omitted.moreover,in resting its conclusion upon the analogy with rate setting and rate divisions,the traditional,historical subject matter of b,the supreme court avoid ed authorizing the fcc to turn b and into a remedy for violation of fcc regulations.id 
in contrast to the facts in global crossing,the commission has not made any findings that cmrs providers failure to compensate clecs constitutes an unreasonable practice in violation of b.because north county can not demonstrate a violation of b in the absence of an fcc determination,the district court properly dismissed north county claims.see greene,at.
unable to demonstrate any statutory or regulatory violations for which there is a private right to compensation,north county fares no better in seeking declaratory judgment under and.
provides in pertinent part 
in case any common carrier shall do,or cause or permit to be done,any act,matter,or thing in this chapter prohibited or declared to be unlawful,or shall omit to do any act,matter,or thing in this chapter required to be done,such common carrier shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this chapter 
any person claiming to be damaged by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter may either make complaint to the commission as hereinafter provided for,or may bring suit for the recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable under the provisions of this chapter,in any district court of the united states of competent jurisdiction but such person shall not have the right to pursue both such remedies.
the plain language of and establish procedures for private parties to pursue claims in federal court,but does not establish an independent private right of action for compensation.in greene,we clarified that there must be an independent right to compensation for a private right of action to lie under and.greene,at because the private right of action created by and extends only to violations of this chapter,and does not require ixcs to compensate psps,there is no violation of for which a private action explicitly lies for payphone compensation.internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,because north county has failed to establish a right to specific compensation pursuant to any statute or regulation,and can not form the basis for its compensation claims.see id.
we have also held that claims pursuant to,like those premised on b,are particularly amenable to resolution by the fcc.in radio servs,we considered whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over claims that an ilec failed to negotiate an interconnection agreement in good faith.at.we observed that issues regarding the applicability of are complex and should n
