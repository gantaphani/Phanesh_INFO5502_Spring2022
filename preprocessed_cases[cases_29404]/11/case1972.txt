defendants north california boulevard,a limited partnership the partnership,sunset ridge,sunset and sanford diller diller the partnership,sunset and diller are referred to collectively as borrowers appeal from the order denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict after a jury found them liable to plaintiff the nippon credit bank,los angeles agency bank for bad faith waste.bank appeals from the order granting a new trial,and borrowers appeal from a subsequent order involving the order for new trial.
the principal issues are whether a lender can recover for waste when the lender security is substantially impaired by the borrower bad faith failure to pay real property taxes,and whether that failure in this case supports an award of punitive damages.we answer both of those questions in the affirmative in the published portion of this opinion.
background 
sunset and diller were the general and managing partners,respectively,of the partnership,which developed,owned and operated a office complex in walnut creek the project.diller owned sunset and,through sunset and the dns trust dns,a family trust,he owned over percent of the partnership.diller was the last word on all important financial decisions for the partnership.
the partnership borrowed million from bank in to refinance an initial construction loan of approximately million from another lender and complete construction of the project.bank loan officer,greg gillam,testified that a large chunk of the difference between the amounts of the original construction loan and bank loan was earmarked to repay diller for his investment in the project.diller acknowledged that the partnership received million of the proceeds of bank loan.cal prom,a construction company wholly owned by diller,received million of the loan proceeds.
bank loan was structured as a nonrecourse obligation.the partnership paid interest on the loan at a variable rate tied to the london offer rate libor,and could elect to lock in specified rates for one to periods.the partnership was required under the deed of trust securing the loan to timely pay all property taxes for the project,and bank had the right under the loan documents to pay the taxes if the partnership did not.the partnership was authorized under the deed of trust to collect and retain rents from the project until written revocation of that right from bank after an event of default.
the partnership made all loan and property tax payments until december,when diller directed that the property tax installment due on the of that month not be paid.before that decision was made,the partnership had asked bank for a concession on the rate of interest payable on the loan,and the request had been denied.
vicki mullins,who was the chief financial officer of the project property manager,another entity called maxim property management,and another partnership representative met with gillam and another bank representative on november.mullins presented projections showing that,because of rising interest rates and other factors,the project would have a cash flow shortfall of over million in.a number of leases were coming due the next year,rental rates were decreasing,and tenants were demanding shorter leases with more tenant improvements.mullins and diller testified that there was a severe real estate recession at the time.t he state of the economy was an absolute disaster,diller said,and d evelopers were dropping like flies.appraisals submitted by the partnership to bank showed that the project value had dropped from million in september of to million in of.
in his memo of the november meeting,gillam said he thought that the partnership could pay more interest than mullins projected if it paid all tenant improvement costs,and requested that diller use his own cash to cover deficits of the p roject because he has already earned a large amount of money through the p roject.on december,mullins faxed gillam a letter stating that the project would have a negative cash flow prior to any increase in the libor rate if it paid bank loan,the property tax installment,the operating expenses,and the tenant improvements due that month.the letter requested a lock at the current libor rate.diller conceded at trial that this request was for a below market interest concession bank was not legally obligated to make.gillam called mullins about five minutes after receiving the fax and rejected the request.
diller testified that he would have paid the december tax installment if bank had worked with us,but he was convinced that they were not dealing fairly he said that his decision not to pay the taxes was very difficult and taken with a lot of thought.diller admitted that the project had sufficient cash flow that month to make the payment.there was no dispute that the partnership had the means to pay the taxes.on the date the tax payment was due,the partnership paid diller entity dns over.diller said that this payment was made to reduce dns investment in the partnership.
diller acknowledged at trial that the unpaid taxes would be a charge against the project,and that bank would eventually have to pay the taxes or accept a reduced sale price for the project.he also agreed that the missed payment was a substantial sum of money.however,he thought that the amount of the unpaid taxes was insignificant compared to the value of the project and that the missed payment did not substantially impair bank security.he denied using nonpayment of the taxes to try to gain leverage to force bank to make concessions.however,diller did say that he wanted bank to share the pain.
in addition to directing that the december taxes not be paid,diller caused the partnership to default on the january and february loan payments to bank.he explained the reason it was decided not to make the january loan payment was that it was determined at that time bank in negotiations and restructuring this loan was acting in bad faith,bank was not dealing fairly,bank had no intention of restructuring the loan.what bank intended to do was to bleed the p artnership dry,to have the p artnership come up with outside funds and to convert this loan from a nonrecourse loan to a recourse loan,and then as soon as bank has bled the p artnership dry and got all the money it could out of it through outside sources so that the loan would be kept current,then it would go ahead on its course of action and take the property away from the p artnership.and that why we felt it was hopeless to allow this bank to extract all of this money from us and also throw us off the property.they were not negotiating in good faith,although negotiations did continue to try and save the ship after that 
the partnership sent bank a series of proposals in january and february of.on january,mullins faxed gillam a proposal to purchase the project at fair market value.on january,mullins faxed gillam a letter stating rather than a deed in lieu,we would like to propose a cash flow mortgage.on february,mullins faxed gillam a term sheet for restructuring bank loan.on february,mullins faxed gillam a letter asking for your thoughts on an outright sale for cash.on february,mullins faxed gillam a letter proposing a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
no agreement was ever reached,other than a agreement which stated that no agreement on preliminary issues would be binding in the absence of a global settlement.gillam testified that bank agreed at one point to take a deed in lieu of foreclosure,but that arrangement fell through when the partnership proposed additional conditions.gillam said that bank would sometimes make concessions if the customer kept the loan current and generally lived up to its obligations.here,gillam said,there were so many proposals and the borrower was still unwilling to pay any amount of the past due interest,we did know whether he was serious or not.gillam said he told diller that he thought diller was negotiating in bad faith and trying by his tactics to hold bank hostage.gillam said bank eventually came to believe that they were not serious about any kind of negotiation,that they were just intent on withholding the rent or not paying the interest and on taking as much cash out of the building as they could before eventually they were going to lose it.
on february,bank sent the partnership an effective demand to turn over rents from the project,and the partnership thereafter complied with the demand.diller testified that,before receipt of that demand,he regarded the project revenue as our money.diller acknowledged that his family trust,dns,received a net amount of million from the partnership from december,to april.he said that he still lost million in the project.
the partnership remitted approximately from project revenues to bank in march,and approximately in april.gillam testified that when these funds were delivered the outstanding balance of the loan was about million.bank used these funds in april to pay the then due for the delinquent december property tax installment.
the jury awarded this sum to bank as compensatory damages for bad faith waste,based on findings that borrowers failure to pay the december taxes was not caused solely or primarily by an economic downturn,and that the failure to make this payment was intended to harm,and did substantially impair,bank security interest.the jury found by clear and convincing evidence that the failure to pay the taxes was done with malice,and awarded in punitive damages.borrowers motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied,but their new trial motion was granted unless bank agreed to remit all but million of the punitive damage award.bank declined the remittitur and a new trial was ordered.
ii.discussion 
motion for summary disposition of appeals 
judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
liability for bad faith waste 
borrowers contend that they were entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that their failure to pay the property tax installment can not be deemed to have been an act of bad faith waste.the bad faith waste cause of action was established in cornelison kornbluth cal d,and extended in osuna albertson d,to situations where the defendant has failed to pay real property taxes.borrowers contend that osuna misconstrued cornelison and that osuna was incorrectly decided.
the plaintiff in cornelison sold a residence and took back a note and deed of trust.the home was subsequently conveyed by buyers to the defendant and eventually condemned as unfit for human habitation.the plaintiff caused the property to be sold at a trustee sale,and bought it for a full credit bid.she then sued the defendant for breach of contract and waste.summary judgment was entered for the defendant on the contract claim on the ground that he had not assumed the secured debt and thus was not liable for breaching covenants in the deed of trust,and on the waste claim on the ground that plaintiff full credit bid precluded any claim that her security had been impaired.the supreme court affirmed,but concluded that the plaintiff might have had a claim for bad faith waste had she not made a full credit bid for the property.
the court noted that the common law action for waste was partially codified in civil code section,which provides that n o person whose interest is subject to the lien of a mortgage may do any act which will substantially impair the mortgagee security.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.the court reasoned that the prohibitions against deficiency judgments on purchase money obligations code civ,or following trustee sales,would bar an action for impairment of security where failure to maintain the property was caused by a general decline of real property values.cornelison,at.however,the court concluded that bad faith waste resulting from reckless,intentional or malicious conduct would be actionable despite those prohibitions.id.at.
the osuna case held that an action for waste could be predicated on the failure of a trustor of a deed of trust or a mortgagor to pay real property taxes,finding that this conclusion was supported by a fair reading of the holding in cornelison,in relation to the facts alleged.osuna albertson,supra,d at.the cause of action for waste in cornelison alleged in substance that defendant owed a duty to properly and adequately care for the property and that defendant negligently failed to fulfill this duty,thereby causing plaintiff to be damaged in specified particulars and amounts by reason of the loss of improvements to the real property as well as by reason of the loss of its use.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.while these allegations did not refer to failure to pay property taxes,the waste claim in cornelison also incorporated by reference the material allegations of the breach of contract cause of action,where the breaches included failure to pay property taxes as well as failure to properly maintain the property.ibid.it also appeared from the trial court ruling quoted in the opinion that the plaintiff in cornelison alleged that the defendant had duties apart from the contract to pay taxes on the property as well as maintain it.id.at,fn.thus,while cornelison did not mention failure to pay property taxes in its analysis of the waste claim,cornelison discussion of that claim could plausibly be construed as it was in osuna to encompass that dereliction.accordingly,we are not persuaded that osuna misconstrued cornelison.
nor are we persuaded that osuna was wrongly decided.osuna acknowledged that the court in krone goff d,a case decided before cornelison,had found no authority for the proposition that failure to pay real property taxes constituted waste.however,that lack of authority was remedied by the discussion in cornelison.osuna albertson,supra,d at.noting timing of the decisions see also miller starr,cal.real estate ed.deeds of trust,fn.characterizing krone references to waste liability for nonpayment of taxes as dicta leipziger,the mortgagee remedies for waste,describing krone as a muddled opinion.osuna also observed that cases in other jurisdictions were split on whether failure to pay property taxes could constitute waste.osuna albertson,supra,d at.however,osuna correctly anticipated the direction of the law on this point.
relatively few courts have had occasion to consider whether waste includes nonpayment of real estate taxes by the mortgagor,but t his broad conception of waste appears to be part of an emerging legal trend with roots dating to the century.american sec.life harris trust sav.bank.for example,willful failure to pay property taxes has been recognized as actionable waste under new york law on facts much like those presented here,where the partnership borrower owned an office building and distributed million to its partners shortly after defaulting on a tax payment.travelers ins.third associates cir.the second circuit opinion in the travelers case noted that a number of other courts had likewise held that failure to pay property taxes could constitute waste.id.at collecting cases.commentators have recognized the split of authority among the states rest d property,mortgages,reporter notes,collecting cases see also,what constitutes waste justifying appointment of receiver of mortgaged property,nonpayment of taxes is generally regarded as waste justifying appointment of a receiver,but have observed that courts are becoming more willing to hold borrowers who fail to pay real property taxes liable for waste notwithstanding nonrecourse provisions of their loans stein,the scope of the borrower liability in a nonrecourse real estate loan lee,hereafter stein.
the commentaries persuasively endorse this liability.the restatement third of property,mortgages,section,subdivision a,page,lists as a form of waste,along with physical alteration or neglect of mortgaged property,a mortgagor failure to pay property taxes secured by a lien with priority over the mortgage.see also,subd.b,damages may be recovered to the extent of the security impairment.waste encompasses default on senior tax liens because the mortgagee has a reasonable and legitimate expectation that the mortgagor will not place a governmental entity in a position to destroy the mortgage,com.b.while there may be disagreement as to the scope of the borrower obligation to maintain the property physically,particularly if the documents are imprecise,there can be little question that the borrower,as owner,is expected to pay all real estate taxes.stein,supra,lee.at.as diller conceded at trial,amounts secured by a tax lien will either have to be paid by the lender rest d property,mortgages,com.a,authorizing advances for this purpose or they will reduce the price paid for the property at foreclosure stein at,fn.unpaid real property taxes thus reduce the chances of full recovery of the debt id.at,fn,and from the secured creditor vantage point may be as costly as a leaky roof travelers ins.third associates,supra,at.
the stein article discusses at length why borrowers should be subject to personal liability for failing to pay property taxes and other forms of waste even if their loans are nonrecourse.on the one hand,the tax payment is just another check that the borrower must write,resembling the obligation to pay principal and interest for which the nonrecourse borrower is not personally liable.stein,supra,lee.at,fn.moreover,the lender failure to require that the borrower expressly assume personal responsibility for the obligation to pay taxes could be interpreted to mean that no such liability was intended.id.at.on the other hand,nonpayment of taxes may be just as damaging to the security as intentional destruction of the property,an act which the lender could not have intended to permit.see id.at,fn,fn.moreover,nonrecourse borrowers have a special responsibility to protect an asset of theirs that they have pledged to another as the sole security for repayment of a debt.id.at.thus,there are circumstances where a nonrecourse borrower should be liable for waste,including failure to pay real property taxes.id.at.
such liability redresses the kind of harm the tort of waste was originally designed to remedy.see travelers ins.third associates,supra,at,fn.the waste doctrine was developed to mediate between the competing interests of life tenants and remaindermen.stein,supra,lee.at,fn,quoting posner,economic analysis of law ed.if the property were a forest,the life tenant would want to cut down the trees before their maturity even if the present value of the timber would be greater if the logging were postponed beyond the tenant expected lifetime.stein at,fn.similarly,the owner of a distressed property will be tempted to scavenge whatever it can for its own benefit and squeeze as much money out as possible before the property is lost,with no regard to the property resulting condition.id.at,fn.see also,fn.likening this situation to the return of a rental car with an empty gas tank.the prospect of tort liability may deter the borrower from thus behaving like a life tenant with very little time left to live.id.at,fn.
such milking of the security has been recognized as a form of bad faith waste within the meaning of cornelison see in re mills cir,and a trier of fact could find that the missed tax payment qualified as milking in this instance.there may be exigent circumstances which would justify a failure to pay real property taxes for example,where a choice must be made between paying the taxes and making loan payments or necessary repairs,a tax default might merely rearrange the lender loss without increasing it.stein,supra,lee.at.in this case,however,the project had not reached such dire straits when diller directed that the taxes not be paid.the evidence shows that diller caused the partnership to pay dns,his own trust,nearly twice the amount of the tax installment on the day the taxes were due,and that dns received a total of million from the partnership while the taxes remained delinquent.it is clear that the partnership had accumulated sufficient earnings to make the tax payment and meet its other immediate obligations when it was decided that the taxes would not be paid.thus,the situation here can not be distinguished from the one in travelers,where the partnership borrower was found subject to waste liability for neglecting to make a tax payment and then distributing millions of dollars to its partners.
this case is distinguishable,however,from in re mills,supra,where a borrower was found not to have milked the security.the borrower in mills had operated the property for only a few months and lost the bulk of his investment.id.at.here,bank officer gillam belief that diller had reaped profits from the project was supported by evidence that the partnership received million of bank loan as a repayment of diller investment in the project,that various diller entities were paid for construction and management of the project,and that the project was operated successfully for a number of years.thus,there were reasons to doubt diller claim that he had lost money on the project.viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,the record does not establish a loss of the bulk of borrowers investment.
the ultimate test proposed in the stein article for waste liability in connection with a nonrecourse loan is whether the lender has suffered losses caused by actions the borrower would not have taken had it been fully liable.stein,supra,lee.at.assuming that this test correctly reflects the bad faith standard for liability under cornelison,it was satisfied here.borrowers can not plausibly claim that the partnership would not have paid the property taxes even if diller and his partners had been personally liable on bank loan.taxes on the project were paid for years when it appeared that the partnership had something of value to lose only when the project was threatened was dns paid in lieu of the tax authorities.stein,supra,lee.at,fn.noting that the nonrecourse borrower is likely to perform like one who is personally liable as long as the project is successful.diller decision not to pay the taxes was apparently made only because he believed that he would not have to pay for its consequences.id.at.
borrowers argue that bad faith waste liability under osuna for failing to pay real property taxes improperly converts conduct which is only a breach of contract into a tort.see applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,that result,borrowers submit,is confined to insurance bad faith cases.borrowers cite authorities indicating that there is no personal liability for real property taxes and that sale of the land is the state sole remedy for nonpayment of those taxes,mcpike heaton cal,garcia county of santa clara d.borrowers reason that in the absence of personal liability to the state for the taxes,or a statute which in so many words makes nonpayment of the taxes a tort,the only possible source of liability for this neglect must be a contract in this case the deed of trust.
this line of argument is unconvincing.tax policy and tort law are separate fields.that the state has chosen not to impose personal liability on property owners for real property taxes says nothing about owners liability to other persons for the tort of waste.the tort codified in civil code section cornelison.kornbluth,supra,cal d at,has long protected lenders from any act which will substantially impair their real property security.that prohibition can properly be extended to nonpayment of real property taxes regardless of whether the omission also creates tax or contract liability.see schroeder auto driveaway cal d,tort damages may be awarded for conduct which incidentally involves a breach of contract.
borrowers contend that osuna is distinguishable because the nonpayment of taxes in that case resulted in tax sales of the properties securing the debt.however,total loss of the lender security is not required mere impairment of the security constitutes waste if the impairment is substantial.
borrowers argue that the impairment of security in this case was insubstantial as a matter of law.on the one hand,as diller admitted,the unpaid tax installment was a substantial sum of money.on the other hand,as diller also noted at trial,the unpaid taxes were a small fraction of the value of bank security.in these circumstances,where reasonable minds might differ as to the substantiality of the impairment,the question was properly left to the trier of fact.
borrowers contend finally that,because bank added the amount it advanced to
