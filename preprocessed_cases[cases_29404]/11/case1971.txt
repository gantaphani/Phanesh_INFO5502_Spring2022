plaintiffs and appellants lee newman,a medical corporation and lee newman,a medical corporation dba beverly hills medical clinic newman appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of defendant and respondent wells fargo bank,wells fargo to the two causes of action pleaded against wells fargo in newman first amended complaint.
the essential question presented is whether a negligence claim may be asserted against a depositary or collecting bank by an employer that has been victimized by dishonest employees who misappropriate and deposit checks through the use of fraudulent indorsements.
although the trial court properly ruled that the california uniform commercial code precludes a common law negligence claim against wells fargo,we reverse the judgment of dismissal because the factual allegations of the first amended complaint are adequate to state a cause of action against wells fargo under california uniform commercial code section,subdivision b 
factual and procedural background 
in february newman hired naomi zamano as bookkeeper and office manager for newman medical practice.in that position,zamano had responsibility for accounts receivable,accounts payable,issuance of checks,bank deposits and related financial matters.in march newman employed jacqueline solis as assistant office manager.solis was responsible for patient management and related financial matters.
during the period of their employment by newman,zamano and solis,acting in concert with a confederate angelica arreola,misappropriated checks and insurance company drafts,totaling more than.zamano and solis used two different methods to misappropriate funds a fifteen checks and drafts made payable to newman and received at newman office were fraudulently indorsed by zamano or solis and thereafter cashed or deposited into their personal bank accounts.b twelve checks and drafts drawn by newman and made payable to newman patients were obtained by zamano and solis,fraudulently indorsed with the name of the payee and thereafter cashed or deposited into their personal bank accounts.
the fraudulently indorsed checks were delivered to wells fargo for collection.each of the checks submitted contained irregularities suggestive of fraud,including utilization of a postal return address mailing stamp instead of a deposit or similar banking stamp,sloppily handwritten entries on business checks,and personal indorsements on large reimbursement checks from insurance companies.nonetheless,zamano,solis and their accomplice were permitted by wells fargo to cash the checks or deposit the funds into their respective personal bank accounts.
newman was not a customer of wells fargo.none of the checks at issue was drawn upon wells fargo.wells fargo thus acted as a depositary and collecting bank,but not a payor bank,within the meaning of the commercial code 
proceedings.
a.the complaint.
newman filed this action against wells fargo,as well as zamano,solis,arreola and other defendants,on june.as it relates to wells fargo,the operative first amended complaint sought to recover damages on theories of common law negligence ninth cause of action and conversion under commercial code section second cause of action based on wells fargo role as a depositary and collecting bank in the alleged scheme by newman employees to misappropriate checks though the use of fraudulent indorsements.newman specifically alleged that the checks at issue were submitted to wells fargo under circumstances sufficiently suspicious to indicate fraud that wells fargo negligently accepted checks with altered payees,forged indorsements,no indorsements and other irregularities and that wells fargo,in the exercise of reasonable care,should have known of the irregularities and illegalities of the checks.
wells fargo demurrer and newman opposition.
on october,wells fargo filed a demurrer and motion to strike.wells fargo argued that the commercial code superseded the common law cause of action for negligence by a bank that had paid a check over a forged indorsement.wells fargo additionally asserted that a bank owes no duty of care to a noncustomer such as newman.respecting the statutory conversion claim,wells fargo argued that no such cause of action exists for the checks drawn by newman.as to the remaining checks identifying newman as payee,wells fargo asserted that all the fraudulent indorsements were deemed effective pursuant to section,that wells fargo is thus a holder in due course and that the conversion action consequently fails.
newman filed an opposition.relying primarily on sun n sand,united california bank cal d,newman contended that plaintiffs common law negligence action is not precluded by the commercial code.newman conceded that no conversion action exists for the checks drawn by newman,but argued that section did not bar the conversion claim for the checks identifying newman as payee.
c.the trial court ruling.
on november,the trial court sustained wells fargo demurrer without leave to amend.with respect to newman negligence claim,the trial court found that sun n sand was not applicable,held that wells fargo owed no duty to newman and further held that the commercial code governed the transactions at issue and did not permit a cause of action for negligence against wells fargo.with respect to the statutory conversion claim,the trial court held that all of the allegedly fraudulent indorsements were effective as to wells fargo within the meaning of commercial code section and,therefore,that no cause of action for conversion could be stated 
newman notice of appeal.
newman filed a notice of appeal on november,from the trial court november,order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.an order of dismissal was thereafter filed on january.wells fargo served a notice of entry of judgment on january.
the november,order,not being a final order,is nonappealable.the notice of appeal was premature as of the date it was filed.however,newman notice of appeal was obviously intended to appeal the final order dismissing the entire case against wells fargo,which was finally filed on january.in addition,the parties have fully briefed the merits of newman appeal.accordingly,the requisite good cause appears,and we shall treat newman notice of appeal as filed immediately after the january,order of dismissal.cal.rules of court,rule c.
contentions 
newman contends the commercial code has not displaced common law negligence actions against collecting banks in cases involving fraudulent indorsements by employees based on the facts alleged in the first amended complaint,wells fargo had a duty of care to newman even though newman was not a wells fargo customer and the conversion claim under commercial code section is not barred by the statutory presumption that the indorsements on the checks submitted to wells fargo were effective.

the commercial code precludes a common law negligence action against banks taking checks fraudulently indorsed by dishonest employees.
commercial code section declares that the code is supplemented by the principles of law and equity,but only if such principles are not displaced by the particular provisions of the code.we agree with the trial court that section articulates a loss distribution scheme that applies to fact patterns such as alleged by newman and therefore displaces common law negligence actions.
in arguing that a common law negligence claim against wells fargo is not precluded by the commercial code,newman places primary reliance on the supreme court decision in sun n sand,united california bank,supra,cal d,which permitted the plaintiffs to proceed with a negligence cause of action against a bank that had accepted for payment altered checks from a dishonest employee.sun n sand,however,is to the particular factual allegations then before the supreme court.in addition,the case was decided well before the amendments to article of the commercial code added a new section which is the particular provision of the code that displaces newman common law tort action for negligence.
a.the supreme court decision in sun sand.
in sun sand,united california bank,supra,cal d,an employee prepared and obtained authorized signatures on checks for small sums made payable to united california bank ucb drawn on her employer bank account with union bank.the employee then altered the checks by increasing the sums payable.upon presentation of the altered checks,ucb permitted the proceeds of the checks to be deposited into the employee personal account maintained at ucb.when the employer discovered the fraudulent activity,it sued ucb not only for breach of the warranties of title and against material alteration set forth in the commercial code,but also for common law negligence.in this regard,sun n sand asserted that ucb had breached its duty of care in permitting checks on which the bank was named as payee to be deposited in the personal account of the company employee.id.at.
the supreme court reversed the trial court order dismissing sun n sand negligence cause of action,holding that ucb had a limited duty of inquiry based on the specific facts alleged and further holding that the common law negligence cause of action was not superseded by the commercial code.sun sand,united california bank,supra,cal d at.we agree that an attempt by a third party to divert the proceeds of a check drawn payable to the order of a bank to the benefit of one other than the drawer or drawee suggests a possible misappropriation.accordingly,we conclude that sun n sand allegations define circumstances sufficiently suspicious that ucb should have been alerted to the risk that sun n sand employee was perpetrating a fraud.by making reasonable inquiries,ucb could have discovered the fraudulent scheme and prevented its success.id.at.
the supreme court emphasized,however,that the duty it was recognizing was narrowly circumscribed it is activated only when checks,not insignificant in amount,are drawn payable to the order of a bank and are presented to the payee bank by a third party seeking to negotiate the checks for his own benefit.sun sand,united california bank,supra,cal d at.
in rejecting ucb assertion that the commercial code precluded sun n sand negligence claim,the supreme court acknowledged that former section,which involved issuance of checks to payees intended to have no interest in them,contemplated that losses resulting from certain fraudulent employee behavior should be risks of the employer business rather than the employer bank.sun n sand,united california bank,supra,cal d at.but the supreme court concluded that this provision of the commercial code did not bar plaintiffs tort action for negligence because it was not intended to apply to the specific factual situation before is,when the payor bank has been presented with checks naming the bank itself as payee the comments to former section assume,however,that such checks will never be delivered to the named payees,whether or not such payees are real persons or entities.we perceive this supposition to be critical to the loss allocative function of section it is clear therefore that the balance struck under section has no application in the present context and does not bar sun n sand from pursuing its remedies in tort.ibid.
revised article of the commercial code provides a comprehensive framework for allocating losses when a check bearing a fraudulent indorsement is paid or taken for collection.
effective january,the california legislature adopted the substantial revisions to article of the uniform commercial code proposed by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws.stats,ch.the conference committee report on.explains that this legislation was introduced to effectuate the recommendation of the california commission on uniform state laws that the revision of article,with conforming and miscellaneous amendments to articles and,of the uniform commercial code promulgated by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws be adopted in california.conf.com.on bill.recorded in daily,assem.daily,see west ann.cal,pocket supp.
the conference committee also declared that,with the exception of only revised comments to sections,and,the official comments of the national conference to these changes in the uniform commercial code reflect the intent of the conference committee in approving senate bill.conf.com.on bill.recorded in daily,assem.daily,see west ann.cal,pocket supp.accordingly,revised article is to be interpreted and applied in accordance with the official comments of the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws.edward fineman superior court th,d.
the amendments to article include the adoption of a new section,expressly governing the rights and liabilities of persons paying or taking an instrument bearing a fraudulent indorsement made by an employee who has been given responsibility by his or her employer for such instruments section covers both forged indorsements made in the name of the employer to instruments payable to the employer,subd.a a and indorsements made in the name of payees of instruments issued by the employer,subd.a b.responsibility is a specifically defined term and includes the authority to sign or indorse checks on behalf of the employer,to process checks received for bookkeeping purposes and to prepare or process checks for issue in the name of the employer,subd.a.
with respect to both categories of indorsements,section,subdivision b provides that,if made by an employee entrusted with responsibility for the check,the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in the name of that person.section thus adopts the fundamental principle that the risk of loss for fraudulent indorsements by employees entrusted with responsibility for checks should fall on the employer rather than the bank that takes the check or pays it.section imposes that loss on the employer whether or not the employer was negligent.official comments on,comment,reprinted in west ann.cal,pocket supp.
this loss allocation principle,however,is tempered by the doctrine of comparative negligence section,subdivision b provides that,if the party paying the instrument or taking it for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure contributes to loss resulting from the fraud,the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.ordinary care is defined in uniform commercial code section,subdivision,as observance of reasonable commercial standards,prevailing in the area in which the person is located,with respect to the business in which the person is engaged.as explained in the official comment to the corresponding uniform commercial code provision,section is based on the belief that the employer is in a far better position to avoid the loss by care in choosing employees,in supervising them,and in adopting other measures to prevent forged indorsements on instruments payable to the employer or fraud in the issuance of instruments in the name of the employer.if the bank failed to exercise ordinary care,subsection b allows the employer to shift loss to the bank to the extent the bank failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.official comments on,comment,reprinted in west ann.cal,pocket supp.
