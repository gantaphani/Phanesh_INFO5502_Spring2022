emmert industrial corporation emmert appeals a summary judgment in favor of artisan associates,incorporated artisan on emmert three contract claims arising from the parties agreement for the transportation of industrial presses and press components.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings below 
an oregon corporation,emmert is an engineering and transportation company that specializes in transporting objects weighing in excess of pounds.artisan is a michigan corporation and transportation broker engaged primarily in coordinating complex heavy haul projects on behalf of its clients,a business in which artisan routinely contracts with carriers such as emmert in may artisan,under a broker contract with general motors gm,solicited bids for the press project,a complex undertaking that involved the transportation and delivery of six industrial presses from japan to gm plants in georgia,michigan,and missouri.emmert submitted the winning bid for transporting the major components of six presses,subsequently receiving a notification letter from artisan stating that emmert would serve as the primary carrier on the press project for transportation of all components that weigh more than pounds.upon receipt of this letter,which also instructed emmert to proceed with the necessary planning,emmert took a number of actions.emmert sent employees to japan to inspect the goods to be moved,surveyed port facilities,prepared a analysis and route survey,and put together route plans for the georgia phase of the project.emmert assigned personnel and equipment to the press project,and paid a third party to monitor and detect strain on bridges over which loaded emmert vehicles would pass.
under artisan master operating agreement with gm,the volume of business tendered to artisan is contingent upon gm requirements for such heavy haul,rigging,and flatbed services.although gm retained control over the flow of work to artisan in the first instance,once a move had been authorized,artisan became primarily responsible for oversight and management.specifically,the contract provided that artisan is required to select and manage a network of certified and permitted carriers and riggers to meet the needs of gm,and that artisan shall arrange transportation for gm,including the hiring of carriers and riggers the gm contract also provided that 
operational control.artisan shall have sole and exclusive control over the manner in which artisan and its employes sic perform their services.artisan shall engage and employ with,such individuals or carriers as it may deem necessary in connection therewith.such individuals shall be considered employes sic or of artisan only and shall be subject to employment,discharge,discipline and control solely and exclusively by artisan.
emmert completed two phases of the press project,transporting and delivering press components to gm plants in georgia and missouri,and invoiced artisan approximately million for this work and for services in preparation for a third project phase involving transportation to gm plants in michigan.however,before emmert performed any further press project work,gm reminded artisan in writing that artisan was scheduled to broker the move of another press in early,and requested a quote for this move using carriers other than emmert.gm logistics liaison also instructed artisan orally not to engage emmert on any further press project moves.at that point,the remaining press project moves consisted of parts of two presses to be moved to michigan one press to be moved to missouri and various press component shipments.
on the same day it received gm letter,artisan notified emmert that emmert did not receive the contract to transport the remaining press parts to michigan and missouri,moves that artisan ultimately brokered through another carrier.artisan also notified emmert that artisan did not receive the contract from gm to broker the remaining component shipments,which gm eventually awarded to a different broker.
artisan objected to numerous individual charges contained in the approximate million claimed due by emmert.after protracted negotiations,artisan paid emmert approximately million and advised emmert in october that it would make no further payments.
emmert brought this action in june.in its amended complaint emmert claimed that artisan breached the contract by failing to pay the remaining balance attempted to state a claim in quantum meruit for the same amount and claimed that artisan failure to broker any further work to emmert in the wake of gm letter constituted an additional,independent breach of the contract.the district court granted artisan motion for summary judgment with respect to all three claims,reasoning that emmert first two claims were under the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,and that because emmert had no exclusive contractual right to handle the press project moves,artisan did not breach the parties contract by ceasing to funnel work to emmert after july.emmert now appeals,invoking our jurisdiction under.
ii.discussion 
this is a diversity action in which none of emmert affirmative claims presents a federal question,and emmert contends the district court erred on two grounds in concluding that its first two claims are barred by the iccta limitations period codified at a.emmert first argues that the statute applies solely to a carrier claims against a shipper for charges owed under a filed tariff.because emmert has no filed tariff,it asserts that a is inapplicable to its first two claims as a matter of law.alternatively,emmert contends that because the statute substantive elements are not satisfied on the facts of this case,a can not bar its first two claims.emmert also argues that the district court erred in dismissing its third claim for breach of contract.each assignment of error is taken up below.
applicability and operation of the iccta limitations period 
emmert contention that a is inapplicable to its first two claims as a matter of law was never argued or briefed in the district court.as artisan correctly points out,we generally will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.cold mountain garber,cir citation omitted.however,in our discretion we may consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal under several recognized circumstances,including where the issue presents a pure question of law that does not depend on the factual record developed below,or the relevant record is fully developed.see also united states carlson,cir.this appeal fits comfortably within that exception.the question whether a applies solely to claims for charges owed under a filed tariff is purely one of law,resolution of which requires no further development of the factual record in this case.further,notwithstanding artisan argument that it has been prejudiced by emmert failure to raise this issue below,this court has already determined that when,as here,an appellee has a full and fair opportunity to address an issue raised for the first time on appeal in its appellate briefing,there is no prejudice.dream palace county of maricopa,cir united states nukida,cir.because emmert argument to this court presents statutory interpretation questions of first impression,and because resolution of those questions is likely to broadly impact entities engaged in transporting goods in interstate commerce,we choose to address emmert argument.
turning to the substance of this issue,there is no merit to emmert contention that the time limitation in a applies only when a carrier seeks to recover charges owed under a filed tariff.although neither this circuit nor any of our sister circuits appears to have directly addressed the issue,there are several reasons to reject emmert proposed construction of a.before evaluating those reasons,we briefly consider the broader statutory framework.
as originally enacted,the interstate commerce act ica was a statutory scheme that imposed substantial regulations on the transportation of goods and persons between the states.see verizon commc ns,fcc,d munitions carriers conference,united states.the
