as part of a december,transaction in which commerce supplied inventory floor plan financing to bierwirth,bierwirth granted commerce a security interest in its inventory,all accounts receivable,contract rights and general intangibles then existing or thereafter owing to bierwirth.bierwirth executed and delivered to commerce a security agreement.commerce perfected its security interest by filing the security agreement with the kansas secretary of state on december.on february,bierwirth executed and delivered to commerce a second security agreement containing similar terms.commerce also filed this security agreement with the kansas secretary of state on february,thereby perfecting its security interest.

defendants argue the district court judgment in favor of commerce worked to improperly relieve commerce from the setoff provision of the dealer agreement in contravention of.stat.ann.a.that statute reads 
unless an account debtor has made an enforceable agreement not to assert defenses or claims arising out of a sale as provided in section the rights of an assignee are subject to 
a all the terms of the contract between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim arising therefrom.
chrysler corporation,which is obligated to pay the dealer receivables to bierwirth,is the account debtor within the meaning of this statute.bierwirth,having assigned its rights to these receivables to commerce,is the assignor and commerce is the assignee.defendants argue that under a commerce interest in the funds paid to chrysler realty is subject to a claim or defense.their asserted defense is the provision of the dealer agreement that allows chrysler corporation to offset any amount bierwirth owes to chrysler corporation or its affiliates against any amount due from chrysler corporation or its affiliates to bierwirth.commerce responds that under the statute,its rights are subject only to the claims and defenses of chrysler corporation as account debtor,not to any setoff based upon chrysler realty claim against bierwirth.
we have located no kansas case precisely on point because the kansas supreme court has not addressed the issue involved,we must predict how it would decide the question.city sanitation dist.am.guarantee liab.ins,cir.in making this determination we may look to other state court decisions,federal decisions,and the general trend and weight of authority.farmers alliance mut.ins.salazar,cir.
the district court relied on cases from other jurisdictions however,those cases are distinguishable from the present one and are unlikely to be followed by the kansas courts.in light of the general trend and weight of authority,we conclude kansas courts addressing the issue would follow the principle of nemo dat qui non one may transfer more than he rule for defendants.
