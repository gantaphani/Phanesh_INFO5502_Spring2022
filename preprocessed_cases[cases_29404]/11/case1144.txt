we must decide whether an association which owns and markets a wireless networking protocol and trademark is entitled to exemption from federal income tax as a business league.
bluetooth is a technological specification that allows for wireless data transmission using radio frequencies between multiple electronic devices over short distances typically less than thirty feet.in less technical and hence less precise jargon,it provides a language for electronic devices to talk to one another.originally,it was primarily used to connect mobile phones and wireless headsets.it is now also used for wireless communication between a great variety of products,including personal computers,printers,digital cameras,keyboards,home audio equipment,and medical devices.
ericsson technology licensing ab began to develop bluetooth.it worked with a few other major manufacturers toshiba,ibm,intel,and nokia in refining the bluetooth technology in an association called bluetooth special interest group.ericsson initially owned the bluetooth name and patents.subsequently,the technology companies caused the special interest group to be incorporated as bluetooth sig sig on november,as a delaware nonprofit corporation to own the name and patents.its stated purpose development and regulation of technical standards for the compatibility and interoperability of wireless products within a wireless personal network.
ericsson sold all of its rights to the bluetooth name and patents to sig on february.according to the terms of the transfer,ericsson was reimbursed for some of its legal expenses and received the right to eighty percent of all net revenue up to a maximum aggregate of all such payments of thirty million united states dollars as consideration.the organizers of sig had some is not clear how running an online store at which consumers could buy devices.for whatever reason,this did not come about,and thus there was no revenue.
sig operations fall into four major categories specification development,marketing,trademark enforcement,and 
first,sig develops,refines,and adapts the bluetooth specification.sig acts as a forum through which different technology manufacturers collaborate in the development process.it does this through meetings,conferences,working groups,and by sharing research results.as a result,the bluetooth specification is constantly evolving.
second,sig engages in marketing,public relations,and other promotional activities designed to influence the acceptance,understanding,and use of bluetooth enabled products.it conducts market research,sponsors trade fairs,and publishes handouts and flyers for trade shows and other events.it also publishes newsletters for members in order to keep them informed of the organization activities.
third,sig enforces its trademark both by ensuring that its members conform to the bluetooth brand book and by detecting unauthorized use of the bluetooth trademark.it employs trademark counsel to protect its mark both in the united states and around the globe.according to sig marketing manager,unauthorized users were encouraged to become part of sig and have their products certified.it does not appear that any infringement suits have been filed.sig works to have infringing products seized and destroyed if they pass through customs.
fourth,sig operates a certification and listing program.the organization does not directly provide product testing services to its members.until,a member desiring certification needed to submit its product to a bluetooth qualification testing facility.the results of the testing would,in turn,be submitted to a bluetooth qualification board for review.the boards and testing facilities were independent entities,but had to be approved by sig and pay an annual fee.the fees charged by the testing facilities varied and were unregulated by sig.once the product was certified by a board,its manufacturer could use the bluetooth trademark on the product by paying a listing fee.the product would also be listed as on the sig website.this process needed to be repeated for each product that used the bluetooth specification 
as of october,sig had members,all independent businesses.sig has three membership classes adopters,associates,and promoters.adopters pay no annual fee,but pay a listing fee of per product.
associates pay an annual fee of either or depending on the size of the manufacturer.they pay a reduced listing fee of per product and have the right to participate in the continuing development of the bluetooth specification.they receive certain marketing and promotional opportunities that may not be available to adopters 
promoters pay no annual fee but enjoy the same benefits as associates,plus a seat on the board of directors.each of the original five companies involved with the technology has promoter status.new applicants must be approved by the board of directors and pay a fee in an amount set by the board.as of the date of the district court ruling,only three additional members had been permitted to join the promoter group.
between its incorporation and the end of,sig realized in income with in expenses.at the end of,it had about million in assets against about million in liabilities mostly deferred revenue.its annual income of about million came from four sources membership fees about million,or of total income brand management about million,or,license fees about,or less than,and about,or.expenses of about million were broken down into brand management about,or of total expenses,development and core services about,or,sales and marketing slightly less than,or,and general and administrative expenses about million dollars,or.net income was thus about million.
at the end of,sig assets had grown to about million,mostly in cash and investments.liabilities were less than two million dollars,mostly in deferred revenue.revenues of over million were primarily derived from membership fees about million,or and product registration fees about million,or.events brought in almost a million dollars in revenues.major expenses included events which cost about,about each for development and core services and,plus around for legal fees.the bulk of the remainder was apparently staff salaries management services and services.total expenses were almost five million dollars.net assets increased by about million in.
in,sig applied for an exemption under c,which exempts business leagues from taxation.in,the irs denied the application,stating 
your primary purpose and activity is to promote a single brand of technology,rather than the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business.in addition,one of your substantial activities consists of providing particular services to individual persons.
sig responded by paying the assessed tax and penalties for,and about and then filing administrative refund requests for those years.after waiting the required time period and receiving no response,it then sued in the western district of washington.the complaint sought a refund of income tax,penalties,additions,and interest paid for under a and.
the district court granted summary judgment for the united states.sig timely appeals.
the district court reviewed the commissioner decision to deny c status de novo.our review of the district court decision is also de novo,because the existence of a business league is a mixed question of law and fact.see eng rs club of united states,cir 
section c of the internal revenue code exempts from income tax 
b usiness leagues,chambers of commerce,realestate boards,boards of trade,or professional football leagues whether or not administering a pension fund for football players,not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
the operative treasury regulation,which merits serious deference,see national muffler dealers ass united states,states that 
a business league is an association of persons having some common business interest,the purpose of which is to promote such common interest and not to engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit.it is an organization of the same general class as a chamber of commerce or board of trade.thus,its activities should be directed to the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business as distinguished from the performance of particular services for individual persons.an organization whose purpose is to engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit,even though the business is conducted on a cooperative basis or produces only sufficient income to be,is not a business league.an association engaged in furnishing information to prospective investors,to enable them to make sound investments,is not a business league,since its activities do not further any common business interest,even though all of its income is devoted to the purpose stated.
reg.c c.we have distilled that regulation into a test 
thus,for an organization to achieve business league status,the requirements as stated in reg.c must be met.section c requires a business league to be an association of persons having a common business interest whose purpose is to promote the common business interest not organized for profit that does not engage in a business ordinarily conducted for profit whose activities are directed to the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business as distinguished from the performance of particular services for individual persons of the same general class as a chamber of commerce or a board of trade.
eng rs club,at.
the district court focused its discussion on factors four and five.we do likewise.
we first consider prong four whether sig does not engage in a business ordinarily conducted for profit.revenue rulings published by the internal revenue service guide our inquiry.revenue rulings are entitled to at least skidmore deference,as they constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.texaco united states,cir quoting skidmore swift,
revenue ruling demonstrates an instance in which business league status was denied.the association there operated for the purpose of promoting uniform business,advertising and fair trade practices in connection with the manufacture and sale of a certain patented product.rul.the association indirectly owned the patent,granted licenses thereunder,and sold equipment and materials needed to manufacture the product.the similarities between the association in the ruling and sig are substantial.here,sig aims to promote uniform practices in connection with a certain patented technology,directly owns the relevant trademark and patent,and grants licenses to its members.
revenue ruling is relied on by both parties.it states that a nonprofit organization formed by manufacturers of a particular product to conduct a program of testing and certification of the product to establish acceptable standards within the industry as a whole qualifies as a business league.rul.the organization permits manufacturers to display its seal of acceptance on all product models that have been certified as meeting its standards.id.it fixes its charges at amounts sufficient to defray only the cost of the program.id.deciding that the organization testing and certification program to enforce its product standards was a measure to prevent trade abuses in the industry,the ruling concludes that the organization is a business league.id.
although the organization in revenue ruling and sig are similar in some ways,there are critical differences.first,the ruling does not address an industry that was created and established by the members themselves.nothing in the ruling suggests that the members very ability to make or to market the product itself was controlled by the organization.whether sig set its charges to cover only certification expenses will be discussed later.
as the district court recognized,the bluetooth trademark is a valuable commodity which is for sale.under different circumstances,ericsson or the original promoters might have licensed its intellectual property for a low price.companies license their intellectual property rights all the time,and competitors could just as easily come up with a different owner will likely license its intellectual property at a low enough cost to prevent the formation of rival standards.if ericsson had decided to license the bluetooth brand and technology,it would be engaging in business activity of the sort ordinarily engaged in for profit.a low selling price and a rights holder do not change the fundamental commercial nature of the transaction.see reg.c an organization whose purpose is to engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit,even though the business is conducted on a cooperative basis or produces only sufficient income to be,is not a business league.emphasis added.nothing about the way sig conducts its business leads to a contrary conclusion.
american plywood ass united states,can be readily distinguished and,in any event,is not controlling authority.in that case,a business league comprised of plywood manufacturers was allowed to test and to certify member plywood in order to promote the acceptance of plywood by the public.as the district court here put it 
whereas the plywood association served as a vehicle for advancing a common and interest between members,sig was formed to create a common interest between its members.put another way,the product in american plywood was something the members were already selling to begin with the product here is something the members banded together to create.thus,the collective enterprise of sig derives from the fact that it has created a thing of value,which its members can then use to enhance the value of the products they sell.
this is a distinction of consequence under the rationale of american plywood,because of that court emphasis on principal and incidental activities.american plywood.at the rule is well established that a trade association whose main purpose justifies exemption from income tax will not forfeit tax exempt status by engaging in incidental activities which,standing alone,would be subject to taxation.in delineating principal activities from incidental activities in that case,it was significant that the association members came together with a common interest in expanding the use of plywood as a building material.while they surely sought to compete with each other over whose plywood was better,they could all agree that selling more plywood was better for everyone,and it was this latter purpose for which the association was principally formed.thus,while that association quality control and promotional activities did create a basis for choosing between plywood manufacturers,this was incidental to the organization main purpose,which was to broaden the use of plywood in the building materials market.in the present case,sig creates,markets,and sells a thing of value.that it also helps sig members sell their products does not change this fact.
next,we turn to prong five whether sig activities are directed to the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business as distinguished from the performance of particular services for individual persons.eng rs club,f d at.first,we consider whether sig activities benefit at least one line of business.we must select between dueling concepts of this term of art.one category of possible definitions does not support sig position,and the alternative is implausible.
most obviously,the line of business could be a broad industry such as the wireless communication industry or the consumer electronics industry.however,sig does not benefit all or nearly all members of any such line of business.it is implausible that most even a substantial amount benefits of sig activities fall upon members and alike.sig claimed that bluetooth had no reasonable commercial substitute while maintaining that nonbluetooth manufacturers would benefit in the words of the district court because consumers would opt for the unreasonable choice,a product with greater frequency because of how impressed they are with the bluetooth brand.as the district court stated,b oth simple logic and sig dominant market position belie this theory.rather,it is clear that the business interests of sig members are advanced at the expense of other industry members.
a review of the case law indicates that a benefit to is a key characteristic of business leagues.for instance,the seventh circuit rejected an organization bid for business league status in guide international united states,cir.although guide stated purpose was to facilitate the use and exchange of information regarding data processing equipment in general,the primary benefit inure d to ibm which was only a segment to of the mainframe computer business,not a line of business.id.at.w hile guide members reflect ed a wide variety of businesses,no single business was enhanced and guide only benefits ibm and those individuals within various lines of business who use ibm mainframes.id.accordingly,the organization was not a business league.accord prime users group,united states.denying business league status to a similar group rul,same,despite rul.finding a business league where users owned computers made by various manufacturers.
likewise,revenue ruling stated that a nonprofit trade association of manufacturers whose principal activity is the promotion of its members products under the association registered trademark does not qualify for exemption under section c of the code.rul.if minimum quality criteria were met,members could sell their products under the trademarked name.a significant number of manufacturers in the industry were not members.id.because the trademark was promoted such as to give members a competitive advantage,the trademarking program did not benefit the industry as a whole.id.
in contrast,revenue ruling states that a business league may be formed to promote the business of a particular industry by conducting a general advertising campaign to encourage the use of products and services of the industry as a whole notwithstanding the fact that such advertising to a minor extent constitutes the performance or sic particular services for its members.rul.the organization receipts were derived from assessments on members and from contributions from the national industry association.id.s ome of the newspaper and radio advertisements urged consumers to buy from an organization member.id.despite the slant of some advertisements,the service found the organization to be a business league m ost of the benefits to members of the organization were indirect and accrued alike to members and other persons in the industry and the advertising favoring association members was only a minor portion of total advertising expenditures.id.
sig advertising campaign is not general or intended to promote the use of products and services of the industry as a whole.it benefits members directly and predominately by giving them a competitive advantage over nonmembers.although consumers using bluetooth products may benefit,that is not enough.sig is more like the organizations in revenue ruling and guide than the organization in revenue ruling.
we can not accept the idea that products constitute an industry.no one can manufacture bluetooth products at least in any meaningful way without joining and contributing money to sig.accordingly,membership in the proposed line of business would be necessarily limited to members of sig.sig has not identified any line of business that has such a requirement.nor has sig pointed to any industry where the industry organization created the industry itself.the bluetooth industry is inextricable from sig itself,which controls the rights to the technology and trademark.to quote the district court,the industry must be what members did aside from the particular organization not what they developed as a result of their membership.
furthermore,while bluetooth may be the best available technical solution for certain wireless applications,it is hardly the only game in town.other protocols have their advantages and disadvantages.while bluetooth is predominant in its home market of cellular headsets and handsets,its superiority in other markets is less clear.for instance,sig discusses other technologies on its website,often emphasizing their shortcomings in relation to bluetooth.if bluetooth were truly the only viable specification,sig would not need to trumpet its superiority over other options.
sig relies heavily on the district court decision in american plywood.the american plywood association the apa was granted business league status from to.am.plywood.at.the district court noted that the apa work in promoting the plywood industry and public acceptance thereof was largely responsible for the massive increase in plywood sales over that period.id.after the apa passed a bylaw which increased its membership dues to be devoted to the promotion of plywood with the apa seal of approval primarily through the medium of television,the commissioner revoked its c status,and the apa sued for a refund of taxes paid thereafter.id.
the court noted that the apa promotional and quality control activities must be viewed in the context of the apa activities as they have developed in the past thirty years,activities which had been carried out to the great benefit of all softwood plywood manufacturers,whether members of plaintiff association or not.id.at.the government countered that,once the bylaw passed,the quality control and promotional activities became more than incidental to plaintiff main purpose and activities.id.at.the court noted that no profits accrued from the quality control activities,that the apa income was derived solely from membership dues,and that there was no possibility that dues may be reduced because of profits.id.at.the court held that the quality control services were not more than incidental and were consistent with the organization long history of promoting quality in other ways.id the benefits derived from the apa quality control were inherently and most immediately group benefits in that quality control insures sic safe plywood,a prerequisite to its acceptance by the public.id.at.
sig is dissimilar to the apa in many important ways.chief among them is that,as discussed above,products do not constitute an industry.we have no difficulty in treating plywood as a line of business apart from the larger building products industry,drywall.plywood is made of a specific material by a specific process.in contrast,products stand in relation to products more as ibm mainframes stood in comparison to other mainframes in guide.
other differences run in favor of the government as well all funding for the apa inspection came from general dues,and the trademark program could not turn a profit or lead to reduced dues.id.at.with sig,in contrast,funding comes from specific licensing fees,and such funding could be keeping membership dues down.the district court found that the apa operation benefitted,id.at the district court here quite properly determined that sig certification and the advertising based on it do not.finally,american plywood places great weight on the trademark activity in the context of the apa tireless history of successfully promoting plywood of all kinds see id.at.in this case,there is no such history to fall back upon.sig advertises bluetooth and only bluetooth,and in no way seeks to promote products which lack the bluetooth trademark.indeed,the key point of the bluetooth advertising message is that consumers should ensure their devices will work together by selecting those products whose manufacturers have paid sig for permission to brand their products with the bluetooth logo.
continuing our analysis of prong five,we also conclude that sig engages in particular services for particular.we recognize that the promotion of products under an organization registered trademark is not necessarily inconsistent with business of a flavor.am.plywood.at.nor do we deny that an industry organization may create a seal of approval for products meeting trade standards to combat abuse in the industry.here,however,there is no industry,only an organization promoting one of a number of possible technologies for the interest of its members as opposed to an industry writ large.
sig is similar to the alleged business league in mib,co
