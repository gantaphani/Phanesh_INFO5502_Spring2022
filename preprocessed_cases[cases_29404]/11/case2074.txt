this case is before the court for review of a question of florida law certified by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit that is determinative of a cause pending in that court and for which there appears to be no controlling precedent 
the coverage issue in this insurance dispute concerns whether,under florida law,the sending of an unsolicited advertisement by fax,in violation of the federal telephone consumer protection act tcpa,is covered by a particular insurance policy provision.the eleventh circuit certified the following question 
does a commercial liability policy which provides coverage for advertising injury,defined as injury arising out of oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy,such as the policy described here,provide coverage for damages for violation of a law prohibiting using any telephone facsimile machine to send unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine when no private information is revealed in the facsimile 
penzer transp.ins,cir.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that,under florida law,the language of this insurance provision provides coverage for infringements of the tcpa.accordingly,we answer the certified question in the affirmative.
background 
in june,michael penzer filed a class action suit in a florida state court against nextel south corporation alleging that nextel or one of its agents sent him an unsolicited facsimile advertisement in violation of the tcpa penzer transp.ins,d.nextel filed a complaint against sunbelt,a advertiser,and southeast wireless,an authorized agent of nextel,seeking indemnity and contributions for any liability nextel may have in the class action.id.nextel also alleged that southeast wireless hired sunbelt to create the advertisement and that nextel did not authorize the fax transmissions.id.penzer then filed a complaint against southeast wireless,and southeast wireless requested that transportation insurance company transportation,its commercial liability insurer,defend it in the class action.id.transportation refused to provide a defense for the class action suit or the nextel complaint,and also disclaimed any coverage on various grounds.id.at.
thereafter,in april,penzer entered into a settlement agreement with southeast wireless in which penzer agreed to release southeast wireless from any liability,and southeast wireless consented to a judgment and assigned its right to seek insurance coverage from transportation to penzer.id.the state court approved the settlement and certified a settlement class.id.penzer then pursued a declaratory judgment action against transportation in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,wherein transportation defended that,based upon the language of the policy,transportation had no obligation to defend or indemnify southeast wireless.id.
the insurance policy at issue here provides coverage for advertising injuries.the policy defines advertising injury as an injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses 
oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services 
oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy 
misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business or 
infringement of copyright,title or slogan.
transportation argued 
t he phrase oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy,read as a whole and in context,provides coverage only for injuries to privacy rights caused by the content of the material.second,florida law interpreting the phrase publication in violation of an individual right of privacy makes clear that coverage exists only when private matters about one person are communicated to another person.although southeast conduct in having the commercial advertisements sent by facsimile may have violated the tcpa,there is no coverage under the policy because there were no privacy violations.
the southern district agreed with transportation.specifically,it found that transportation did not have a duty to indemnify the plaintiffs for southeast violations of the tcpa.id.at it ruled that the policy language was not ambiguous and that advertising injury coverage under this provision exists only when the content of the material published violates a person right to privacy.id.at.the southern district declined to adopt the reasoning of the eleventh circuit in hooters of augusta,american global insurance,app x cir,which reached the opposite conclusion under georgia law,reasoning that hooters did not address the main argument made by transportation here,and florida law calls for a different result.d at.instead,the southern district relied on the reasoning of the third district court of appeal in state farm fire casualty compupay,so d dca,a case holding that an insurer had no duty to defend its insured against a sexual harassment claim under a policy provision that provided coverage for a publication or utterance in violation of an individual right of privacy.d at quoting compupay,so d at.
penzer appealed the southern district decision to the eleventh circuit,which concluded that n either the policy exclusions nor florida public policy lead to denial of coverage.penzer,at.however,the eleventh circuit also found that the disposition of this case rested on an unsettled issue of florida law and that a pure legal question of the interpretation of widely used language in commercial liability insurance is at issue.id.accordingly,it certified its question to this court.id.at.
ii.analysis 
this case presents a question of insurance policy interpretation,which is a question of law,subject to de novo review.see ins.pozzi window,so d.
in interpreting insurance contracts,this court follows the generally accepted rules of construction,meaning that i nsurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning,with any ambiguities construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage.fire ins,so d,citing taurus holdings,fid.guar,so d.if the relevant policy language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,one providing coverage and another limiting coverage,the insurance policy is considered ambiguous.garcia fed.ins,so d,quoting ins.anderson,so d.to find in favor of the insured on this basis,however,the policy must actually be ambiguous.garcia,so d at citing taurus holdings,so d at.a provision is not ambiguous simply because it is complex or requires analysis i f a policy provision is clear and unambiguous,it should be enforced according to its terms.garcia,so d at citation omitted quoting taurus holdings,so d at.
here,the policy language at issue is,oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy.three terms publication,material,and right of privacy are particularly relevant,and none are defined by the policy.consequently,the first step towards discerning the plain meaning of the phrase is to consult references that are commonly relied upon to supply the accepted meaning of the words.garcia,so d at citing gov t employees ins.novak,so d.
the first term,publication is defined as communication as of news or information to the public public announcement or as the act or process of issuing copies as a book,photograph,or musical score for general distribution to the public.webster third new international dictionary.the definition also refers the reader to the definition of publish.id.to publish is to place before the public as through a mass medium disseminate.id.at.here,sending unsolicited advertisements to penzer and others is included in the broad definition of publication because it constitutes a communication of information disseminated to the public and it is the act or process of issuing copies for general distribution to the public.
material has several definitions,two of which are of,relating to,or consisting of matter,and something as data,observations,perceptions,ideas that may through intellectual operation be synthesized or further elaborated or otherwise reworked into a more finished form or a new form or that may serve as the basis for arriving at fresh interpretations or judgments or conclusions.id.at.in this case,the faxed paper containing the unwanted advertisement meets the definition of material since a faxed advertisement consist s of matter,and something that may be synthesized or further elaborated or may serve as the basis for arriving at fresh interpretations or judgments or conclusions.
a right is something to which one has a just claim or something that justly accrues or falls to one something that one may properly claim one due.id.at.this plain meaning of right invokes the legal authority one must possess in order to assert a proper claim.
because the policy provides coverage for a violation of a right of privacy,which can only arise from the law,it is not necessary to separately discern the plain meaning of privacy.if privacy was not preceded by right of then the dictionary definition of privacy would be relevant under a plain meaning analysis.stated another way,the plain meaning of right of privacy is the legal claim one may make for privacy,which is to be gleaned from federal or florida law,rather than defined by a dictionary.in this case,the source of the right of privacy is the tcpa,which provides the privacy right to seclusion.see valley forge,at the receipt of an unsolicited fax advertisement implicates a person right of privacy insofar as it violates a person seclusion,and such a violation is one of the injuries that a tcpa claim is intended to vindicate.hooters,app x at t he findings accompanying the tcpa legislation illustrate that congress was expressly concerned about protecting privacy interests.park,at courts have consistently held the tcpa protects a species of privacy interest in the sense of seclusion.looking at how congress described unsolicited fax advertisements,it is clear that congress viewed violations of the act as private nuisances and invasions of privacy under ordinary,lay meanings of these phrases.quoting universal underwriters ins.lou fusz auto.network,cir res.bankshares paul mercury ins,cir t he harm occasioned by unsolicited faxes involves protection of some sort of privacy.rim,d at the stated purpose of the tcpa is to protect the privacy of individuals from receiving unsolicited faxed advertisements.citing int l sci.tech,inacom commc ns,cir.
as stated previously,the policy provision provides coverage for a written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy.the facts of the instant case demonstrate that there was a written dissemination of facsimiles that violated the tcpa.comparing the policy language to the facts of this case there was a written publication dissemination of material of facsimiles that violated a person right of privacy that violated the tcpa.therefore,applying our plain meaning analysis,we hold that transportation insurance policy provides coverage for sending unsolicited fax advertisements in violation of the tcpa.
transportation argues that the doctrine of the last antecedent,a canon of statutory construction,should apply.according to the doctrine of the last antecedent,
relative and qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding,and are not to be construed as extending to,or including,others more remote.city of petersburg nasworthy,so d,dca.the last antecedent is the last word,phrase,or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence.norman singer shambie singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.
kasischke state,so d.therefore,transportation contends that the phrase that violates a person right of privacy,as written in the policy provision,modifies the term material,as opposed to publication,and thus can only apply when the content of the material violates a person right of privacy.accordingly,transportation urges,only a violation of the secrecy right of privacy will trigger coverage,not a violation of seclusion.we disagree.
first,the doctrine of the last antecedent is not an absolute rule.see united states hayes,d the rule of the last antecedent is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.quoting barnhart thomas,d fortune ins.dep of,so d,dca this rule of statutory construction is not controlling or inflexible.quoting d,statutes.and the doctrine can not be applied in a way that ignores the plain reading of the language.when several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last,the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.fortune,so d at quoting porto rico,light power mor.here,as in fortune insurance,we find that the clause that violates a person right of privacy is applicable as much to publication as to material therefore,the clause should be read as applicable to all.accordingly,we reject transportation assertion that the violation must arise from the content of the material in order to trigger coverage.
furthermore,even if the phrase that violates a person right of privacy only modifies the term material,it does not follow that only the secrecy right to privacy is implicated because material could also invade one seclusion.see motorists mut.ins,ohio app d,the act presumes that all advertising,so long as it is unsolicited,is an offensive intrusion into the recipient solitude.in other words,the unsolicited faxed advertisement itself is the material that is offensive and violative of the individual right of privacy.quoting tig ins.dallas basketball,citations omitted see also terra nova,at on its face,the use of the phrase right of privacy does not evince a plain meaning that is limited in the manner in which the insurers contend.valley forge,at a violation of privacy in the sense of a violation of seclusion is implicit in a tcpa claim.accordingly,we reject transportation argument that the doctrine of the last antecedent requires a different plain reading of the policy 
iii.conclusion 
based upon our plain meaning analysis,we hold that an advertising injury provision in a commercial liability policy that provides coverage for an oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy provides coverage for in violation of the tcpa.we therefore answer the certified question in the affirmative.
it is so ordered.
regardless of whether the insurance policy is read as clearly providing coverage as the majority concludes or whether the policy is ambiguous as justice canady concludes,the answer to the certified question is in the affirmative.the reason for that alternative answer based on an ambiguity in the policy language is that this court construes ambiguous provisions in favor of the insured.rather than deciding this case on the plain language as the majority does,i would acknowledge the existence of two reasonable interpretations but then,in accordance with the rules of construction for insurance policies,apply the interpretation in favor of coverage.
as stated by justice canady in his separate opinion in this case,this court follows the rule that a mbiguous coverage provisions are construed strictly against the insurer that drafted the policy and liberally in favor of the insured.fayad clarendon ins,so d.if there are two competing reasonable interpretations,one favoring coverage for the insured and one denying coverage for the insured,courts uniformly adopt the interpretation conferring coverage.see container of am.cas,so d.
the reasoning for this principle is that the insurer,as drafter of the policy language,has an obligation to make the scope of its coverage and any limitations from coverage clear and unambiguous in the actual language of the policy.as we recently stated in united states fire insurance,so d,if the insurer intended to preclude coverage based on the cause of action asserted,it was incumbent on the insurer to include clear language to accomplish this result.
the insurer in this case has contended that the wording of the policy provides coverage for situations where the content of the not the act of sending a person right of privacy.while that is one reasonable interpretation of the pol
