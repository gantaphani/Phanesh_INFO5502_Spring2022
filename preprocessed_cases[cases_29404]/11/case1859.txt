this is an appeal from judgment entered after a series of motions for summary adjudication disposed of all antitrust causes of action asserted by appellant uas management,against respondents mater misericordiae hospital and its parent,catholic healthcare west collectively,respondent.we will conclude the judgment must be reversed.
facts and procedural history 
for purposes of the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication,the parties stipulated that certain facts were true.as to other facts,in accordance with the relevant standard of review,we set forth the facts most favorable to the party opposing the motions,to the extent such facts are supported by the evidence before the trial court.see federal kemper life assurance cal th,d.as a result,the following statement of facts is only provisional,and the parties undoubtedly will contest some or all of the stated facts if this matter proceeds to trial.
respondent owns and operates an inpatient hospital in the city of merced.respondent is the only provider of inpatient services in the merced geographical market and,as such,has monopoly power with respect to those services.in addition,at the times relevant to this action,respondent operated a separate outpatient surgery center in merced and performed outpatient surgeries at its hospital,as well 
in,appellant opened for business as an outpatient surgery center.appellant is owned by local physicians.
when respondent learned that appellant would be competing for outpatient business,respondent negotiated with local health insurers for the contract provisions at issue in this case.respondent purpose in insisting on the contract provisions was to drive appellant out of business.
the contract provisions in issue embodied respondent refusal to sell inpatient services to the insurers unless the insurers agreed to the contract provisions giving preference to respondent as an outpatient provider.the contracts vary in their precise wording from one insurer to another.however,all of the contracts contain what the parties call exclusivity provisions,in essence,requiring that the insurer would neither add to its network nor contract with any other outpatient surgery center during the period of the contract.because of the contracts,the insurers refused to negotiate with appellant to permit appellant to become an or preferred provider.
of the six relevant insurance companies,two would not pay for any services rendered by nonpreferred providers.as to the other four companies,appellant could not determine in advance how much the insurer would pay for particular services and was required to negotiate individually with each patient concerning that patient copayments and deductibles for each procedure.because of the absence of a preferred provider contract,appellant was required to expend additional staff time in selling its services to prospective patients,in obtaining payment from the insurers,and in assuring that use of appellant facility was preapproved so physicians could be paid for their services by the insurer.
for reasons ranging from the quality of appellant facility,the of physicians who preferred to use a facility they owned,and competitive pricing for the patients share of the charges appellant was able steadily to increase its share of the outpatient surgery market for merced.still,appellant was unable to become an or preferred provider for any insurer in the merced health insurance market until,by coincidence,respondent outpatient facility was destroyed by fire and respondent could no longer provide outpatient services under the contracts.
appellant sued respondent in october of,alleging violations of the cartwright act and the unfair competition law in addition to a tort claim for interference with prospective economic advantage.the complaint alleged two separate theories for the cartwright act violation.in the first cause of action,it alleged respondent conspired with the insurers to create an unlawful exclusive dealing arrangement,which constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade.in the second cause of action,appellant alleged respondent refusal to sell inpatient services unless the insurers agreed exclusively to purchase respondent outpatient services constituted an unlawful tying arrangement.the unfair competition third cause of action and tortious interference claims fourth cause of action were derivative and were based on the unlawfulness of the cartwright act conduct.
respondent moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication.code civ,subds.a,f.after extensive briefing and submission of voluminous evidence,the court granted summary adjudication of appellant tying claim.the court denied summary adjudication of the other three causes of action.appellant filed an amended complaint,adding two additional theories of recovery under the cartwright act,unlawful group boycott fifth cause of action and unreasonable restraint of trade sixth cause of action.respondent filed a second,very narrow,motion for summary adjudication of the exclusive dealing cause of action,which the court denied.on respondent motion for reconsideration of the first summary judgment motion,however,the court granted summary adjudication of the exclusive dealing claim.subsequently,respondent moved for summary adjudication of the remaining causes of action.the court granted that motion and entered judgment for respondent 
appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
statutory background and the trial court rulings 
the cartwright act prohibits combinations in restraint of trade.citations.although the statutory language is,the courts have limited the cartwright act reach to unreasonable restraints.morrison viacom,th,d,italics added.certain restraints which lack redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and illegal.ibid.the cartwright act has two substantive sections potentially relevant in the present case,sections as enforced through section and.
section is primarily concerned with concerted acts by two or more persons or organizations for the purpose of restraining trade.morrison viacom,supra,th at,d.section forbids any person to sell or contract for the sale of goods,merchandise,machinery,supplies,commodities on the condition,agreement or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods,merchandise,machinery,supplies,commodities,or services of a competitor or competitors of the seller,where the effect may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of trade or commerce in any section of the state.morrison viacom,supra,th at,d,quoting from.as can be seen from the language of section,while more specifically prohibiting exclusive dealing contracts,that section is limited to the sale of goods,merchandise,machinery,supplies,or commodities.the section does not concern the sale of services and,accordingly,is not applicable in the present case.see morrison viacom,supra,th at,d.
section is,in terms,addressed to any agreement t o create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.subd.a.in addition,subdivisions b through e of section specify various price fixing schemes that are unlawful.section actually describes those agreements and combinations that constitute a trust section states that,except as otherwise specified in the cartwright act,every trust is unlawful,against public policy and void.the cases,however,tend to discuss section as the operative provision see fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court th,d morrison viacom,supra,th at,d,and we will follow that practice.
section has been held to prohibit,under some circumstances,three types of contractual arrangements alleged in this case exclusive dealing arrangements,group boycotts,and tying arrangements.the requirements to establish a cause of action for each theory differ somewhat.
an exclusive dealing agreement is,as the name implies,one in which,for example,a seller and a buyer agree that the buyer will buy only the seller product or that the buyer will not buy the product of one of seller competitors.such a provision is often a part of a franchise agreement or a distributorship contract.in california,exclusive dealing arrangements are not deemed illegal per se but may be illegal if they unreasonably restrict competition in a particular market.see fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court,supra,th at,d.
a group boycott can involve an agreement that a group of buyers will purchase only from a designated seller.a multiple listing service that releases information only to members of the local realtors association,to the exclusion of nonmembers,would be classified as a group boycott for cartwright act purposes.see marin county bd.of realtors,palsson cal d.as relevant here,an unlawful group boycott requires an express or implicit agreement among competitors to restrict commerce in some manner.mts,d.
a tying arrangement typically involves a seller with monopoly or other extensive market power in a given product,who then refuses to sell that product unless the buyer buys or agrees not to buy from seller competitor a separate product over which the seller does not have extensive independent market power.see cascade health solutions peacehealth,et such arrangements are unlawful unless their effect on commerce is de minimis.suburban mobile homes,amfac communities,d.
in addition to the three foregoing theories of liability,it has been held that any other agreement or arrangement that unreasonably restrains trade is unlawful.corwin los angeles newspaper service bureau,cal d.from the foregoing descriptions,it can be seen that a single agreement or set of agreements can give rise to liability under several different theories in the law,and in this case,one set of agreements for exclusive preferred provider status for outpatient services forms the basis for all of appellant theories of liability.
the trial court concluded appellant failed to establish a triable issue of fact concerning an essential element of liability under each of the foregoing cartwright act theories.the trial court found that the undisputed evidence established that appellant had successfully competed with respondent for a substantial and increasing share of the outpatient surgical services market.as a result,competition in the market was not substantially foreclosed and the exclusive dealing theory could not be proved.the court concluded no group boycott had been established because there was no evidence the insurers colluded with each other to deal only with respondent.the trial court held that appellant had not established an illegal tying arrangement because the exclusivity contracts in question did not require the insurers to purchase any services from respondent and did not prohibit purchase of services from appellant.finally,the court concluded any restraint of trade that did occur was reasonable because,in essence,respondent was not shown to have used its superior bargaining position to obtain a competitive advantage that substantially foreclosed competition by appellant.we will address each of the trial court conclusions.
specific causes of action 
exclusive dealing 
by notice of motion dated december,respondent sought reconsideration of its summary adjudication motion on the exclusive dealing theory,which motion had been denied by the court on january.the motion purported to be based on new evidence,attached to the notice of motion through the declaration noel cohen,one of respondent attorneys.the motion was not in the form required by code of civil procedure section and was not scheduled for hearing in accordance with the requirements of that section.appellant properly objected to these failings both in its response and at the hearing.the trial court concluded appellant had an opportunity to present any relevant factual information but had not done so.it found respondent actions had not substantially foreclosed competition between appellant and respondent it granted the motion for summary adjudication.
appellant contends the court was precluded from considering the new evidence presented because respondent motion failed to comply with code of civil procedure section.respondent contends it was entitled to elect whether to present the motion as one for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section or as a new summary judgment motion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision f.
in general,a party may move for reconsideration of a motion within days after the motion is denied,based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law.code civ,subd.a.in addition,after expiration of the period to move for reconsideration,a party may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law.code civ,subd.b.such a motion does not seek reconsideration of the earlier motion but,instead,is simply a new motion that is permitted by the existence of new law or effect,it renews the earlier motion by submission of a new motion raising the same issues.the overriding purpose of code of civil procedure section is to prevent duplicative motions.le francois goel cal th,d.the renewed motion for summary judgment on the exclusive dealing cause of action brought more than days after the original motion was a new motion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,renewing the earlier summary adjudication motion on the same grounds,and was not a motion for reconsideration.
code of civil procedure section,applicable only to summary judgment and summary adjudication motions,also prohibits duplicative motions.code of civil procedure section,subdivision f states,in part a party may not move for summary judgment based on issues asserted in a prior motion for summary adjudication and denied by the court,unless that party establishes to the satisfaction of the court,newly discovered facts or circumstances or a change of law supporting the issues reasserted in the summary judgment motion.such a motion is a new summary judgment motion.see patterson sacramento city unified school dist.th,d.
under both code of civil procedure sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision f,the motion made more than days after an original motion is a new motion.both sections authorize the new motion under prescribed circumstances but code of civil procedure section,subdivision b does not purport to authorize a new summary judgment motion that does not comply with the requirements for such motions set out in code of civil procedure section.
motions for summary judgment may be brought only under code of civil procedure section and in accordance with its requirements.respondent renewed motion for summary judgment did not comply with code of civil procedure section in any way,and respondent contended it did not have to.for reasons set forth above,we conclude the motion was required to provide days notice and to be supported by a separate statement of undisputed material facts,as required by code of civil procedure section,subdivisions a and b.the court was without authority to shorten the minimum notice for the motion over appellant objection.mcmahon superior court th,d.
to the extent the judgment is based upon the court grant of summary adjudication of the first cause of action,the judgment must be reversed.
tying arrangement 
appellant contends the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication of its second cause of action,which alleged respondent used its monopoly power in the inpatient hospital services market to unlawfully coerce patients and insurers into using its nonmonopoly outpatient surgery services.we will first,and briefly,summarize the law in this area,then describe the uncontroverted facts,and conclude with an analysis of the trial court determination.
it is unlawful under california cartwright act,as relevant here,for a seller to use its market power in one market to force or coerce a buyer to purchase its product or service in a distinct market in which the seller does not have such market power or to refrain from buying from the seller competitor.the result of such coercion is called a tying arrangement,in which the market controlled by the seller consists of sales of the tying product or service,and the market over which derivative power is exercised consists of sales of the tied product or service.where such an arrangement is found,it is illegal per se that is,the
