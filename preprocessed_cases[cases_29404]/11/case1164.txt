applied medical distribution corporation appeals the district court judgment in its diversity action against the surgical company bv denying injunctive relief that would have prevented surgical from pursuing its suit in belgium for statutory termination damages allegedly available under belgian law.the issue is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the injunction.we have jurisdiction under.we reverse and remand for the district court to enter an injunction.
applied medical distribution corporation applied,a california corporation,and the surgical company bv surgical,a netherlands limited liability company,entered a relationship whereby surgical would purchase surgical supply products from applied for distribution in belgium,the netherlands,and luxembourg.the relationship began without a written agreement in,and in the parties agreed in a written contract that surgical would be the exclusive distributor of applied products in the three countries.
in,the parties entered a new distribution agreement agreement,effective retroactively to january.the parties negotiated for more than a year regarding the terms of the agreement.these terms include the following four provisions important here 
paragraph a unless extended by mutual agreement in writing,the agreement would terminate on december.the parties could also terminate the agreement before then for any reason or no reason with days notice.see paragraph e.
paragraph f,entitled limitation on liability in the event of termination by either party in accordance with any of the provisions of this agreement,neither party shall be liable to the other,because of such termination,for compensation,reimbursement of damages on account of the loss of prospective profits or anticipated sales or on account of expenditures,inventory,investments,leases or commitments in connection with the business or goodwill of either party.termination shall not,however,relieve either party of obligations incurred prior to termination.
paragraph a,entitled governing law and jurisdiction this agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of california.the federal and state courts within the state of california shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of this agreement.
paragraph f,entitled legal expenses the prevailing party in any legal action brought by one party against the other and arising out of this agreement shall be entitled,in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have,to reimbursement for its expenses,including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees.
van schil,surgical ceo,claims that he objected to the forum selection clause,but signed the agreement and accepted it in order to maintain the business relationship.he also claims that he thought the agreement and provisions would not limit surgical rights under belgian law,but he did not assert that such an understanding was ever discussed with applied.
around june,applied notified surgical that under paragraph a of the agreement,applied would not be renewing the agreement,which was then scheduled to expire on december.surgical replied in writing on november,asserting that surgical was entitled to protection under the belgian act of belgian act in the form of compensation.next,applied filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief against surgical on december,in the united states district court for the central district of california.surgical thereafter filed suit in belgium on january.
in its declaratory action in district court,applied filed a motion for summary motion underlying this that the court enjoin surgical from pursuing relief in belgium or any other forum under law declare that the agreement terminated pursuant to its terms on december,declare that goodwill indemnities are precluded and that surgical will take nothing due to termination of the agreement and award applied its costs,expenses,and attorneys fees.
before addressing the injunction,the district court made several holdings that are not appealed by surgical.the district court held that the dispute over goodwill indemnities arises out of the agreement because the determination of whether goodwill indemnities may be recovered requires passing on the applicability of paragraph f limitation on liability for damages resulting from termination.the district court concluded that the and forum selection clauses in the agreement were valid because they were reached through extensive,bargaining between sophisticated parties and there was no evidence of fraud or deceit.therefore,the court held that california law and a california forum apply to the instant dispute and that belgian law is inapplicable to the interpretation of the agreement.
the district court next held that the agreement had terminated under its terms when applied elected not to renew it,and concluded that according to paragraph f,applied could not be liable for compensation,reimbursement of damages on account of the loss of prospective profits or anticipated sales or on account of expenditures,inventory,investments,leases or commitments in connection with the business or goodwill of either party.the district court specifically held that goodwill indemnities are precluded and that surgical shall take nothing due to the termination of the agreement.
the district court rejected surgical argument that paragraph f did not apply to goodwill indemnities.surgical had argued that goodwill indemnities accrued prior to the termination of the agreement and only happened to become due when the agreement terminated.the district court rejected this argument because the only way that applied could potentially incur goodwill liability would be upon a termination of the agreement,and such liability,as the district court saw it,is expressly foreclosed by paragraph f.
next,the district court declined to enjoin surgical from pursuing relief in belgium.the district court determined that the belgian action alleges that certain damages are due aside from goodwill indemnities and other damages,and that the belgian claims under the belgian act were potentially broader than the issues under consideration by the district court.the district court did not explain further which claims were not dependent on the termination of the agreement or otherwise did not aris e out of th e agreement so as to be exempt from the contract forum selection clause.because it concluded that the belgian claims were potentially broader,the district court held that an injunction would be inappropriate.
finally,the district court held that applied was entitled to its costs,expenses,and attorneys fees because it prevailed on its motion for declaratory relief and the agreement expressly provided for fees to a prevailing party.
the district court entered a final judgment on january.only applied appeals,and it appeals only the district court denial of the injunction.
we review a district court denial of an injunction for abuse of discretion.gallo winery andina licores,cir.a district court factual findings in connection with a denial of an injunction are reviewed for clear error.id.the district court interpretation of the underlying legal principles,however,is reviewed de novo.id.when a district court makes an error of law,it is an abuse of discretion.id.
in gallo,at various stages of our analysis,we held that a district court,in evaluating a request for an injunction,must determine whether or not the parties and the issues are the same,and whether or not the first action is dispositive of the action to be enjoined whether the foreign litigation would frustrate a policy of the forum issuing the injunction and whether the impact on comity would be tolerable.id.at,quotation marks and citations omitted.
because we conclude that gallo is controlling,a discussion of that case is helpful to illuminate our analysis.in gallo,the large california winemaker gallo entered a distribution agreement with ecuadorian alcohol distributor andina licores.id.at.the distribution agreement contained forum selection and clauses in favor of california.id.disputes arose between gallo and andina regarding some allegedly late shipments and whether andina was an exclusive distributor of gallo wine.andina filed suit in ecuador under an ecuadorian decree that was intended to protect ecuadorians who entered into distribution agreements with foreign entities.id.after andina engaged in procedural machinations in the ecuadorian courts,gallo filed suit in california state court,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages andina removed the case to federal court.of relevance to this case,gallo filed a motion for a preliminary injunction restraining andina from pursuing the action in ecuador.id.at.the district court denied gallo request for an injunction primarily because the claims arose under different under california law and the other under the ecuadorian decree.id.at.we reversed.
in applying the first prong of the test outlined above,we determined that the issues were the same because both causes of action focused on whether the distributorship agreement had been breached.id.andina argued that the issues were not the same because an injunction would deprive it of its broader rights under ecuadorian law,but we rejected this argument first,it is not clear that andina has claims under ecuadorian law,as the contract contains a clause in favor of california.second,to the degree that ecuadorian law does apply,federal courts are capable of applying it to andina claims.id.citations omitted.
we then turned to considerations of policy and comity respectively.we stressed the strong policy in favor of enforcing forum selection clauses that the united states supreme court has developed over the years.id.at citing carnival cruise lines,shute,d.we explained that w ithout an injunction in this case,the forum selection clause effectively becomes a nullity.id.turning to comity,we reasoned that where private parties have previously agreed to litigate their disputes in a certain forum,one party filing first in a different forum would not implicate comity at all.id.at.we pointed out that a rule that any party seeking to evade the enforcement of an forum selection clause need only rush to another forum and file suit could also have serious deleterious effects for international comity.id.we also dismissed the district court reasoning that the ecuadorian court was more competent to decide whether the ecuadorian decree applied or not t he contract clearly contains a california clause thus,the validity of the forum selection clause should be decided by california law,as the law of the contract,rather than by ecuadorian law.id.and,to the degree ecuadorian law is applicable,the district court is capable of applying it.id.
with this background on the applicable law as explained in gallo,we address whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the injunction.despite our general inclination to affirm when feasible on matters within a district court discretion,we nonetheless conclude here that the district court did abuse its discretion in denying such relief.we in turn rest our decision primarily on the following two reasons first,the district court applied the wrong legal standard by requiring that the claims in the domestic and foreign action be identical instead of engaging in the more functional inquiry concerning dispositiveness required by gallo.second,the district court relied on the clearly erroneous factual determination that surgical belgian claims,other than goodwill indemnities,were available apart from termination.because all of surgical claims,like goodwill indemnities,as a practical matter depend on termination of the agreement,they all aris e out of th e agreement and are subject to the forum selection clause.under gallo,the claims in the two actions are functionally the same and the first action is dispositive of the action to be enjoined in the sense that all of the belgian claims fall under the contract forum selection clause and can be litigated and resolved in the california action.furthermore,we recognize california strong policy in favor of enforcing forum selection clauses and note the comity concerns that would arise if a party to a contract containing a forum selection clause were permitted to proceed with duplicative litigation challenging the rightful authority of the forum court.accordingly,an injunction restraining surgical from pursuing its belgian action is appropriate.a contrary result would effectively nullify the forum selection and clauses,thereby eliminating the certainty of a contractual result that is necessary to foster international trade and commerce.
the first step under gallo in deciding if an injunction is appropriate is determining whether or not the parties and the issues are the same,and whether or not the first action is dispositive of the action to be enjoined.gallo,at citations omitted.applied and surgical argue a great deal about exactly how identical the issues must be between the domestic and foreign action.confusion on this point is understandable because in gallo the local action encompassed the sole issue raised in the ecuadorian suit breach of contract.id.surgical argues that gallo requires that all the issues be identical in both actions.applied argues that complete overlap between issues is not required and that gallo holding disfavors litigants who attempt to evade forum selection clauses by bringing foreign actions.
we concluded in gallo that whether or not the parties and issues are the same,and whether or not the first action is dispositive of the action to be enjoined are both part of the first step of the test.id.citations omitted.in cases like this where the parties are the same,whether the issues are the same and the first action dispositive of the action to be enjoined are interrelated requirements that is,to the extent the domestic action is capable of disposing of all the issues in the foreign action and all the issues in the foreign action fall under the forum selection clause,the issues are meaningfully the same.these interrelated requirements are sensible because the fundamental question the gallo test is designed to address is whether a requested injunction should issue under a contractual forum selection agreement.moreover,our conclusion in gallo that this analysis was equivalent to both the second circuit formulation which asked if the domestic action was dispositive and the first circuit formulation which asked if the issues were the same rested on our recognition that issues are functionally the same if one action is dispositive of the other.id.citing paramedics electromedicina comercial,ltda ge medical.info,cir quaak klynveld peat marwick goerdeler bedrijfsrevisoren,cir.
therefore,the crux of the functional inquiry in the first step of the analysis is to determine whether the issues are the same in the sense that all the issues in the foreign action fall under the forum selection clause and can be resolved in the local action.instead,the district court focused too narrowly on the fact that not all of the issues are identical.emphasis added.gallo did not impose such a specific requirement.for example,it was irrelevant in that case that the ecuadorian suit was under an ecuadorian decree whereas the domestic action was based on california law,because both clearly depended upon the same alleged violation of a distribution agreement.id.
moreover,requiring issues to be precisely and verbally identical would lead to counterproductive,and perhaps unintended,results.for example,forum selection clauses would lose their reliability and robustness if a party could avoid them simply by waiting until a local suit is filed,and then file a foreign action that,despite being easily disposed of by resolution of the local action,is in some way not identical in form,a likely possibility because the verbal form of laws in different countries will inevitably differ.such language differences across national systems,if they invariably allowed competing international litigation,would wholly frustrate the normal purposes of clauses selecting a forum and applicable law.
globalization has enhanced the significance of international trade,and those in business who would trade across national lines confront many varying legal systems in different countries.if we do not give primacy to parties choice of forum and choice of law,there will be insufficient certainty to foster international trade relations.conversely,so long as the parties have no gross disparity in bargaining power,it is difficult to see how holding them to their agreed forum and law is not beneficent.
there is no dispute that the parties are the same in this action and the belgian action.therefore,we turn to whether or not the issues are the same,and whether or not the first action is dispositive of the action to be enjoined.gallo,at.we hold that the present action is dispositive of the belgian action because all of the claims in the belgian action arise out of th e agreement,are subject to the forum selection clause,and therefore must be disposed of in the california forum if at all.therefore,the issues are functionally the same.interpreting the forum selection clause,the district court already held that disputes concerning the applicability of the provision aris e out of th e agreement.however,the district court denied the injunction on the basis of its conclusion that the issues involved in surgical belgian action were not identical to the issues that applied raised in the california action.the proper question,however,was whether the issues in the belgian suit were the same as the issues before the district court in the functional sense articulated above.so framed,it is apparent that surgical belgian claims,like its claim for goodwill indemnities,seek damages that occur only as a result of termination,concern the applicability of the provision,and therefore are disputes arising out of th e agreement that are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts within the state of california under the forum selection clause.
the record indicates that surgical seeks in its belgian action damages for indemnity in lieu of notice,goodwill indemnity,costs and other indemnities,and repurchase of stock the district court determined that i t was only as a result of termination that applied potentially incurred any goodwill indemnity obligations and t he agreement specifically exempts applied from such obligations through paragraph f.similarly,surgical claims for indemnity in lieu of notice,costs and other indemnities,and repurchase of stock occur only as a result of termination and are precluded by the language of the contract.surgical argues that these claims do not depend on termination of the agreement and instead arise from applied failure to comply with the notice provisions in the belgian act.however,surgical prefaced its demand for these damages in its november,letter by stating that t he act provides for the following protection in the case of unilateral termination by the manufacturer without cause.emphasis added.surgical repeats that these claims are available in the case of unilateral termination in its brief.thus,just as the district court reasoned with regard to the goodwill indemnities a holding that surgical did not appeal,none of surgical other belgian claims could arise but for the termination of the agreement.nothing that surgical argues establishes otherwise.the district court disparate treatment of goodwill indemnities and surgical other belgian claims,to this extent,was clearly erroneous.
in support of its argument that its claims under the belgian act do not arise out of the agreement,surgical relies heavily on the following sentence in paragraph f termination shall not,however,relieve either party of obligations incurred prior to termination.surgical argues that any goodwill accrue during the agreement are recoverable without regard to the agreement provision,even if triggered by termination of the agreement.the district court already expressly rejected that argument,stating as follows 
even though goodwill payments increase over time,they are not actually due until termination occurs.thus,the actual obligation to pay damages resulting from loss of goodwill does not arise prior to termination,but instead arises upon termination.if the parties had ultimately decided to continue the relationship,applied would not have incurred any obligations for goodwill indemnities.it was only as a result of termination that applied potentially incurred any goodwill indemnity obligations.the agreement specifically exempts applied from such obligations through paragraph f.
as the district court reasoned,the disputed clause in paragraph f must be read in conjunction with the rest of the paragraph,which provides unequivocally that neither party shall be liable to the other,because of such termination for a nearly exhaustive list of potential liabilities.surgical reading of the last clause of paragraph f would essentially eviscerate the entire paragraph as to most damages.
surgical next argues that the district court ruling only addressed damages and that the district court neglected to consider the numerous other substantive issues,including jurisdictional issues and liability issues that arise under the belgian distributor act.this argument is misplaced the district court already surgical did not appeal that california law controls interpretation of the agreement and that belgian law is inapplicable to the interpretation of the agreement.the district court logic that any determination whether goodwill indemnities are proper requires a determination as to the applicability of the contract provision in f,bringing the dispute within the ambit of the california and forum selection provisions,applies equally to surgical other belgian claims.thus,despite surgical tangential claim that the belgian act requires the belgian court to disregard the agreement provision,the binding contractual language providing for california law and a california forum controls in the first instance,belgian law notwithstanding.see gallo,at rejecting the argument that an injunction would deprive andina of rights under ecuadorian law because it is not clear that andina has claims under ecuadorian law,as the contract contains a clause in favor of california.
surgical relies on the eleventh circuit case,canon latin america,lantech cr,which held that a florida action based on common law contract claims was not dispositive of an earlier action brought in costa rica for violation of a costa rican law creating liability for unlawful termination of an exclusive distributorship,cir.even if we were to adopt its reasoning,canon is inapposite.in canon,the district court did not grant canon summary judgment claim as to a declaration that the florida provision was valid and enforceable,id.at but here,the enforceability of the provision and applicability of california law to interpretation of the agreement is law of the case and not appealed.moreover,canon is not ninth circuit precedent and explicitly recognized that the ninth circuit does not require foreign claims to be identical in form to the local claims.id.at.
surgical further argues that the belgian suit should not be enjoined because applied seeks no declaratory relief based on the specific unwaivable rights under the belgian act,and thus the issues in the two suits are different.this argument imposes an unjustifiably narrow view of how issues can overlap.in its complaint for declaratory relief,applied sought a declaration that any disputes arising out of the agreement must be adjudicated in a california forum under california law and surgical never urged that california law required application of the belgian act.applied claim that surgical should take nothing due to termination of the agreement,a determination ultimately adopted by the district court,is dispositive of surgical belgian claims in the sense that those claims arise out of termination of the agreement and could have been asserted in the district court,whether or not they hav
