this case raises several first amendment issues,including one in which the circuits are substantially divided namely,the extent to which prompt judicial review must be assured in licensing cases.plaintiff gifts,zj brought an action under challenging the city of littleton city or littleton adult business ordinance as unconstitutional,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,attorney fees,and damages.the district court granted summary judgment to the city.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse in part and affirm in part.
in,the city passed an ordinance requiring businesses that specialize in adult entertainment or merchandise to obtain licenses,and restricting those businesses to certain areas of littleton.before passing its ordinance,the city council heard testimony and reviewed reports from other cities concerning deleterious effects of adult businesses on property values and on crime rates.
in the fall of,zj opened its store,known as christal,on south broadway in littleton.prior to the opening of christal,the city informed the owner of the property on which christal was located that adult businesses were not permitted at this south broadway location.in late august before christal filed a suit against the city seeking monetary,declaratory,and injunctive relief.zj complaint alleged that littleton ordinance was unconstitutional because,among other things,it infringed zj first amendment rights.zj also alleged that it did not intend to operate an adult business establishment as defined in littleton ordinance.appellant app.at.
on for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of the city,concluding that zj was covered by littleton ordinance and that the ordinance was,in its entirety,constitutional.after the district court decision in this case and during the briefing for this appeal,the city amended its ordinance,clarifying certain corporate disclosure requirements and changing an age restriction for adult businesses that do not offer live entertainment.littleton,ordinance codified at littleton,city code.
both as originally enacted and as amended,littleton ordinance has two primary functions it requires all adult businesses within littleton to obtain licenses to operate within the city borders,and it restricts those businesses to certain sections of the city and requires that they not locate within a minimum distance of other specified sites.
among the adult businesses covered by littleton ordinance,christal would most likely qualify as an adult bookstore,adult novelty store,or adult video store.littleton,city code.a commercial establishment falls into this category if,as judged by percentage of,revenue,or advertising,it is primarily devoted to the sale of materials that are characterized by the depiction or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas,regardless of whether the establishment has other business purposes.id.specified anatomical areas are further defined as a less than completely and opaquely covered human genitals,pubic region,buttocks,anus or female breasts below a point immediately above the top of the areolae or b human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state,even if completely and opaquely covered.id.specified sexual activities are defined to include masturbation,fondling of the genitals and other specified areas,excretory functions,human genitals in a state of sexual stimulation,arousal or tumescence,and normal or perverted sex acts.id.
no adult business covered by littleton ordinance may operate within feet of a church,school,facility,public park,massage parlor regulated by local ordinances,or community correctional facility.id.adult businesses also may not operate within feet of each other or a massage parlor regulated by state law.id.in addition,multiple adult businesses may not operate within the same structure.id.
under littleton ordinance,operation of an adult business within the city requires a license.among other things,a license application must indicate or provide names of all owners,managers,and employees of the business information about whether the applicant has had an license denied,revoked,or suspended by any jurisdiction an indication whether the applicant has licenses from other jurisdictions the address,driver license number,and social security number of the applicant and all owners,managers,and employees a floor plan for the proposed business a written statement by the city zoning officer that the proposed location is in compliance with the ordinance and a statement of whether an owner,manager,or employee of the business has been convicted of specified criminal acts id.certain specified persons must also be fingerprinted and photographed by the police department.id.
after an application has been submitted,the city clerk has thirty days to approve or deny the license.id.the clerk may deny an application for one or more specified reasons,including the applicant is under years old the applicant has made a false statement on the application the applicant or any owner has had an license revoked or suspended within colorado in the past year the applicant has operated an adult business deemed to be a public nuisance in the past year a corporate applicant is not in good standing or authorized to conduct business in colorado the applicant is overdue in any city taxes,fees,fines,or penalties assessed in relation to an adult business the applicant has failed to obtain the required license or the applicant has been convicted of specified criminal acts.id.specified criminal acts for the purposes of the ordinance are defined as sexual crimes against children,sexual abuse,rape or crimes connected with another adult business,including distribution of obscenity,prostitution,pandering or tax violation.id.
if the clerk denies the application,the applicant then has twenty days to appeal the denial to the city manager who must hold a hearing within thirty days.id.if that appeal is denied,the applicant may seek review in state court pursuant to colorado rule of civil procedure a.id.
licenses are issued for terms and may be renewed only by filing a renewal application.id.licenses may be suspended for one or more specified grounds.id.suspension or revocation may only occur after a hearing before the city manager and may be appealed to state court.id.finally,under the amended ordinance,all adult businesses in littleton that do not provide live entertainment are required to restrict entrance to individuals who are eighteen or older id.
we initially determine whether there is an article iii case or controversy before us.essence,city of fed.heights,cir.standing is an essential part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.there are three elements to article iii standing,causation,and redressability.essence,at.an is an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.quoting defenders of wildlife,at.causation requires a showing that the injury is fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,rather than some third party not before the court.id.quoting defenders of wildlife,at.redressability means that it is likely that a favorable court decision will redress the injury of the plaintiff.id.the burden to establish standing rests on the party invoking federal jurisdiction.id.when the case has been resolved in the district court on summary judgment grounds,a plaintiff must establish that there exists no genuine issue of material fact as to justiciability,and mere allegations of injury,causation,and redressability are insufficient.id.quoting dep t of commerce united states house of representatives,d.
standing usually requires that the plaintiff assert an injury to himself,rather than injuries to third parties not before the court.however,this rule is not strictly enforced in the context of facial challenges to laws as violative of the first amendment,even though a facial challenge to the validity of a statute necessarily entails a challenge to the statute as applied to third parties besides the plaintiff 
in the area of freedom of expression it is well established that one has standing to challenge a statute on the ground that it delegates overly broad licensing discretion to an administrative office,whether or not his conduct could be proscribed by a properly drawn statute,and whether or not he applied for a license.
freedman maryland,d see also,city of dallas,d opinion of,although facial challenges to legislation are generally disfavored,they have been permitted in the first amendment context where the licensing scheme vests unbridled discretion in the decisionmaker and where the regulation is challenged as overbroad.a form of unbridled discretion is the failure to place brief,specific time limits on the process.nightclubs,city of paducah,cir see also,at.opinion of,stating that unbridled discretion includes licensing schemes that create a risk of delay such that every application of the statute creates an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas quotations omitted.
littleton ordinances include within their purview sexually explicit speech,and the city does not contest that this speech is protected by the first amendment.zj challenge to littleton licensing system is based both on a claim that the city vests too much discretion in licensing officials in granting or denying a license,and that the system creates a risk of delay in granting or denying a license.thus,zj has standing to bring a facial challenge to the licensing system on these two grounds.
it is true that the overbreadth doctrine discussed above does not eliminate the need for the plaintiff to demonstrate its own cognizable injury in fact.council for improved health shalala,cir.but this requirement is satisfied where the plaintiff is engaged in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution.babbitt united farm workers union,d.such a plaintiff need not wait until an actual criminal prosecution has begun.id.
zj business depends in part on its ability to sell materials that are protected by the first amendment.zj has alleged in its complaint that the city views it as an adult business that is in violation of the licensing requirements of the ordinance,and it has also presented a letter from the city denying zj license application because zj business may be categorized as an adult business.appellant app.at.zj has thus adequately shown that,at least from the city perspective,its business is proscribed by the ordinance.
finally,the city has proceeded with a civil complaint in state court against zj for violation of the ordinance based on zj failure to apply for an license and zj operation of an adult business without a license while zj license application was denied and a civil complaint was brought in state court only after zj federal complaint was filed,these events nonetheless are evidence that when zj filed its lawsuit there was a credible threat of prosecution under littleton ordinance and that the threat of prosecution continues.babbitt,at.see also id.at.indicating that standing exists when fear of criminal prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional statute is not imaginary or wholly speculative.zj has satisfied the requirement because the city has taken steps to enforce the ordinance against zj 
zj also has standing to challenge the location requirements in littleton ordinance.both parties agree that zj business is located on a site in which adult businesses are not permitted under the ordinance.based on the location of zj business,the city has refused to grant zj a license,and the city complaint in state court is based in part on the location of zj business.this is sufficient evidence for zj to meet the requirement.by enacting and enforcing its ordinance,the city brought about zj injury,and injunctive and declaratory relief,if granted by this court,would redress zj injury.
zj has challenged the provisions in littleton ordinance that require the city to reject license applications when the applicant has been convicted of specified past criminal acts.zj has never alleged that these restrictions would apply to any of the owners or operators of zj business.zj therefore has not even argued that it might be affected by these provisions in littleton ordinance,and accordingly it does not have standing to challenge these provisions.see,at.stating that for a party to have standing to challenge a similar provision in a dallas ordinance,the individual must show both a conviction of one or more of the enumerated crimes,and that the conviction or release from confinement occurred recently enough to disable the applicant under the ordinance.
zj also attacks the ordinance license revocation and suspension provisions.zj,however,has never obtained a license from the city,nor has it indicated that it plans to obtain a license.instead,zj stated in its complaint that it does not intend to operate an adult entertainment establishment in a zone.appellant app.at.zj has neither alleged nor provided any evidence that the licensing suspension or revocation proceedings will apply to it.as it is pure conjecture,essence,at,whether zj will be forced to comply with these provisions of the ordinance,zj likewise does not have standing to challenge these provisions.id.holding that an adult business did not have standing to challenge a city provisions for the granting of a license because the business already had a license and had not alleged any facts indicating that it would need to reapply for a license.
zj decries as overly vague the ordinance definition of an adult bookstore,adult novelty store,or adult video store as a business that devotes a significant or substantial portion of its floor space,inventory,or advertising to adult materials,or that obtains a significant or substantial portion of its revenue from those materials.littleton.city code.
in the first amendment context,the supreme court has determined that a plaintiff may have standing to challenge a statute as overly vague with respect to third parties even if the suspect statute is unquestionably applicable to the plaintiff.young am.mini theatres,d on several occasions we have determined that a defendant whose own speech was unprotected had standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute which purported to prohibit protected speech,or even speech arguably protected.this exception from traditional rules of standing reflects the supreme court judgment that the very existence of some statutes may cause persons not before the court to refrain from engaging in constitutionally protected speech or expression.id.at.
nevertheless,as the court in young explained,if the statute deterrent effect on legitimate expression is not both real and substantial,and if the statute is readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts,the litigant is not permitted to assert the rights of third parties.id.at.citation omitted,quoting erznoznik city of jacksonville,d.
in young,the court concluded that the ordinance in question did not have a real and substantial deterrent effect on legitimate expression because there is surely a less vital interest in the uninhibited exhibition of material that is on the borderline between pornography and artistic expression than in the free dissemination of ideas of social and political significance.id.at.the same rationale applies equally to the present case.adult businesses covered by littleton ordinance are,by definition,likely to carry materials that border on pornography.stated simply,in light of young,littleton ordinance does not have a real and substantial deterrent effect upon legitimate expression.
as to the second issue raised by the ordinance is readily subject to a narrowing note that language similar to the significant or substantial language used in this ordinance has been interpreted previously by state courts in a sufficiently narrow manner to avoid constitutional problems.a common method of narrowing construction has been to develop a percentage that will act as a guide as to what constitutes significant or substantial.see,dandy civil city of south bend,holding that a conviction under a similar ordinance was sustainable where there was evidence that to of the inventory was adult in nature louis county,noting that a local ordinance established a rebuttable presumption that a business carries a substantial portion of items where more than percent of the retail value of the inventory consists of such items city of new york les hommes,noting that the city of new york had clarified that a substantial portion for purposes of its ordinance meant at least forty percent.we conclude that the limited amount of uncertainty in the ordinance is easily susceptible of a narrowing construction.young,at.
in short,we agree with the district court that zj does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of littleton ordinance under the void for vagueness doctrine.appellant app.at.
finally,littleton ordinance as originally enacted prohibited individuals under years of age from being licensees,owners,managers,employees,or customers of an adult business.zj argues that it is unconstitutional to restrict individuals between the ages of eighteen and from entering or working in its business.we need not address zj challenge to the age restrictions,however,because the city has amended its ordinance to provide that anyone over eighteen years of age may enter an adult business that does not offer live entertainment thus,zj challenge to the age restrictions on customers and employees of its business is now moot,and we will not address it.
we now address zj claims that littleton licensing scheme grants excessive discretion to licensing officials.
because this case was decided on summary judgment,we review the district court decision de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.simms oklahoma ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c para.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.simms,at.if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute,we determine whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.id.in the first amendment context,o ur review of the record is more rigorous,and we are obligated to make an independent examination of the record in its entirety.essence,at quotation omitted.
littleton ordinance requires all adult businesses to obtain a license prior to opening for business.adult businesses,as defined by the ordinance,include adult bookstores and adult video stores,see littleton,city code,that sell materials presumptively protected by the first amendment a very similar licensing scheme was analyzed as a prior restraint on speech by six of the justices of the supreme court in,at.opinion of,id.at.brennan,concurring.following,we have concluded that licensing of adult entertainment establishments must be analyzed as a prior restraint.essence,at.
ordinarily,a duly enacted law is presumed to be constitutional.when a law infringes on first amendment rights,however,the proponent of the law bears the burden of establishing its constitutionality.wilson stocker,cir.whether or not littleton ordinance is is not relevant to the burden of proof,because any system of prior restraint comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity,at.quotation omitted.in the present case,therefore,the city bears the burden of establishing that littleton ordinance is constitutional.
standards for analysis of a prior restraint of speech were initially developed in the context of censorship schemes in freedman,where the supreme court held that a censorship scheme must assure the exhibitor,by statute or authoritative judicial construction,that the censor will,within a specified brief period,either issue a license or go to court to restrain showing the film the censorship scheme must assure a prompt final judicial decision following a refusal to license and the burden of proving that the film is unprotected expression must rest on the censor.at.
in,a divided supreme court considered whether freedman procedural requirements applied to licensing schemes as well.two justices joined justice in announcing the judgment of the court that the dallas licensing scheme at issue was unconstitutional,at.three other justices concurred but would have gone further in applying the freedman requirements.id.at.brennan,concurring.justice opinion characterizes freedman as mandating that any prior restraint that fails to place limits on the time within which the decisionmaker must issue the license is impermissible,at,because a scheme that fails to set reasonable time limits on the decisionmaker creates the risk of indefinitely suppressing permissible speech,at.the court in determined that the dallas ordinance failed to meet this general requirement because a license could not be approved without inspection and approval by the fire department,the health department,and the building official as being in compliance with relevant laws and ordinances.id.even though a completed license application had to be approved or disapproved within thirty days after submission,there was nonetheless a risk that the city could endlessly delay those inspections and approvals in order to postpone consideration of a license application because there was no time limit for the inspections and approvals.id.concluded the court thus,the city regulatory scheme allows indefinite postponement of the issuance of a license.id.
justice then reiterated the freedman procedural requirements 
t he following three procedural safeguards were necessary to ensure expeditious decisionmaking by the motion picture censorship board any restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only for a specified brief period during which the status quo must be maintained expeditious judicial review of that decision must be available and the censor must bear the burden of going to court to suppress the speech and must bear the burden of proof once in court.
id.at.concluding that the first two safeguards are essential to preventing undue delay in the licensing process,id.at,and that the dallas licensing scheme fails to provide an avenue for prompt judicial review of a license denial,id.at,justice opinion held that freedman third the censor bear the burden of obtaining judicial action and of not be applied in the context of licensing schemes.id.at.
the remainder of the court was sharply divided.justice brennan,joined by two other justices,agreed that the dallas ordinance was an unconstitutional prior restraint,but would have applied all three of the freedman procedural requirements.id.at.brennan,concurring.justice white,joined by the chief justice,concluded that the dallas ordinance was constitutional and that none of the freedman procedural requirements applied because the ordinance was not a prior restraint.id.at.white,concurring and dissenting.justice scalia concurred in part and dissented in part on other grounds.id.at.scalia,concurring and dissenting.
faced with the fractured decision in,our sibling courts of appeals have struggled to determine which of freedman requirements apply to licensing schemes.joined by several other circuits,we have concluded that the first two freedman of the status quo and expeditious judicial applicable to the licensing context.see essence,at see also,baby tam city of las vegas,cir baltimore boulevard,prince george county,cir tk video,denton county,cir.with respect to freedman third the censor must bear the burden of going to court and of circuit has not yet decided whether it is applicable to licensing schemes.see essence,at.other circuits,however,have held that the third requirement of freedman does not apply to licensing schemes that do not directly regulate content.see macdonald city of chicago,cir ward county of orange,cir steakhouse,city of raleigh,cir.because zj does not argue that the littleton ordinance fails to satisfy the third freedman requirement,we limit our analysis here to the two procedural safeguards clearly adopted in.
our first inquiry is whether littleton ordinance satisfies the requirement that any restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only for a specified brief period during which the status quo must be maintained,at.although the ordinance specifies that a license application must be approved within thirty days,littleton,city code,zj stresses that,before an application is accepted,applicants are required to obtain a written statement from the city zoning official stating that the proposed location is in compliance with the location requirements of the ordinance,specified persons named on the application must be fingerprinted and photographed by the police department and the applicant must obtain a license.zj argues that these provisions present the possibility of indefinite postponement of a license.id.
justice opinion in,which announced the judgment of the court,held that the dallas ordinance in question allowed for indefinite postponement of a license because the premises had to be approved in advance by the health department,fire department and the building official.at.although the prerequisites required by littleton ordinance are arguably less onerous than those in,littleton ordinance similarly does not specify a time limit within which the city must complete them.we therefore consider whether they render littleton ordinance unconstitutional for failure to satisfy the first requirement of freedman and.
every retail business in colorado must obtain a license.because this requirement is not specific to adult businesses,it is irrelevant to the constitutionality of the licensing ordinance at issue in the present case.the city does not argue,however,that the other two requirements are similarly applicable to all businesses,and we therefore presume that they are specific to adult businesses.littleton ordinance provides no assurance that the city will promptly act on a request for a certification of zoning compliance or for fingerprinting or photography.
during oral argument of the present case,counsel for the city offered to make a judicial admission on behalf of the city that if the zoning official does act,the application can be complete without his statement.littleton ordinance,however,explicitly states that the city clerk shall not accept any application that is not complete in every detail.littleton,city code.such details presumably include the provision of the zoning official letter as well as the requirements of photography and fingerprinting by the police department.by interpreting the ordinance as allowing for the submission of an incomplete application in the event of delay by the zoning official,appellee counsel is stating a legal conclusion,and courts are reluctant to treat opinions and legal conclusions as judicial admissions.see macdonald general motors,cir glick white motor,cir new amsterdam cas.waller,cir.a matter as important as the constitutionality of a state statute should not be decided on the basis of an advocate concession during oral argument.virginia am.booksellers ass n,d stevens,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
moreover,freedman requires that either a statute or authoritative judicial construction must specify the time limit within which the license must be issued or denied,at,wall,and there is nothing in justice opinion suggesting that this requirement was changed in.federal courts lack jurisdiction authoritatively to construe state legislation.united states photographs,d.only if a state law is readily susceptible of an interpretation may the federal courts subject it to a narrowing construction,and we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.am.booksellers ass n,at.majority opinion.because littleton ordinance is not readily susceptible to the interpretation offered by the the contrary,it is readily susceptible to the opposite as we are tempted,we can not decide this case on the basis of littleton counsel oral argument offer.
although the colorado supreme court upheld a similar requirement that a zoning permit must accompany the application for a license in city of.springs,a separate zoning ordinance in that case required that a zoning administrator approve or deny a zoning permit application within ten working days of the submittal.id.at.counsel for the city implicitly conceded at oral argument that no such time limit is present in this case.because no time limit is specified in the ordinance or by authoritative judicial construction,we hold that the subject ordinance requirement that a letter from the zoning official accompany the application,along with the fingerprinting and photography requirements,are unconstitutional for failure to specify a time limit within which the city must act see,at.to the extent that the city motion for summary judgment on this point was granted and zj motion for partial summary judgment was denied,the order of the district court is reversed.
having held that littleton ordinance fails to meet the first test of,we must decide whether the unconstitutional provisions are severable.under colorado law,a section of a legislative enactment is severable if the remaining portion of the statute is autonomous and the legislature will in passing the entire statute is not thwarted by the excision.city of lakewood colfax unlimited ass n,en banc.utilization of a severability clause creates a presumption that the legislature would have been satisfied with the remaining portions of the enactment.id.a provision will not be held severable,however,if the remaining enactment is so incomplete or riddled with omissions that it lacks coherence.id.
at issue in the present case is an ordinance that contains a severability clause,both in its original version and in the amended version.littleton,ordinance,littleton,ordinance.more importantly,other requirements of the ordinance do not depend upon the constitutionally suspect requirements for coherence or consistency,and the purpose of the ordinance is not thwarted by their excision.as a result,we conclude that the licensing provisions of the ordinance are severable.
because other provisions of littleton ordinance,if constitutional,may be enforced without the requirements,we must decide whether the remainder of the ordinance is constitutional.thus we consider the prompt judicial review requirement adopted by the supreme court in,at.zj argues that prompt judicial review requires the city to provide a prompt decision from the courts as to whether a license should have been granted or denied.appellant br.at.according to the city,however,prompt judicial review means only that there must be the possibility or an avenue for prompt judicial review,and there need not be a judicial determination within a short period of time.appellee am.resp.br.at.
the circuits are divided over this question.some have held that prompt judicial review,at least with regard to licensing decisions,requires only that the government provide prompt access to the courts.see,boss capital,city of casselberry,cir concluding that access to prompt judicial review is sufficient for licensing decisions tk video denton county,cir same see also graff city of chicago,cir en banc opinion of manion,noting the availability of the writ of certiorari and finding this procedure sufficient under jews for jesus.bay trans.cir implying that access is sufficient.others have concluded that prompt judicial review requires a prompt judicial resolution of license denials.see nightclubs,city of paducah,cir baby tam city of las vegas,cir baltimore boulevard,prince george county,cir.
access to prompt judicial review was selected as the appropriate standard by the eleventh circuit in boss capital,at.that case enunciates two principal bases in support of its holding that mere access is sufficient in licensing cases.first,boss capital holds that justice modified the second freedman requirement relating to judicial review in the licensing context.id.at.second,boss capital reasons that this interpretation of is appropriate given the difference between censorship cases and licensing cases.id.at.
focusing on justice language,the eleventh circuit points out that justice uses different terminology than justice brennan in describing freedman second requirement.id.at citing,at.justice opinion holds that there must be the possibility of prompt judicial review in the event a license is denied,at.opinion of,emphasis added,and states that the dallas ordinance failed to provide an avenue for prompt judicial review,id.at.emphasis added.later,the requirement is characterized by justice as the availability of prompt judicial review.id.at.emphasis added.in contrast,justice brennan concurrence states that a prompt judicial determination must be available.id.at.brennan,concurring emphasis added.
justice language could arguably mean that the court modified the second freedman requirement in the context of licensing cases.see boss capital,at relying partially on the difference of language to distinguish freedman from it is by no means clear,however,that justice intended to change the meaning of the prompt judicial review requirement.first,when justice refers to prompt judicial review,she cites to freedman,which unequivocally stated that the procedure must assure a prompt final judicial determination.at.see also baltimore boulevard,at discussing this point.other decisions following freedman have used the phrase prompt judicial review to indicate a prompt judicial determination,albeit in a censorship context.see baltimore boulevard,at listing several supreme court cases.moreover,elsewhere in her opinion in,justice states that the first two safeguards provided for by freedman are essential,at.although justice inevitably qualifies the prompt judicial review requirement by referring to the possibility,availability,or avenue of such review,such qualification most likely amounts to an acknowledgment that it is up to the plaintiff to decide whether or not to seek judicial review.this language does not necessarily indicate any intent to weaken the second freedman requirement.
parties always have access to the courts.see,at.white,dissenting n o one suggests that licensing decisions are not subject to immediate appeal to the courts.baby tam,at a person always has a judicial forum when his speech is allegedly infringed.quoting graff,at.judicial review is available regardless of whether an applicable state court procedure is expressly mentioned in the ordinance.in order to have prompt judicial review,however,a party necessarily must be able to obtain a decision,for without a decision,the most exhaustive review is worthless.baby tam,at.thus,justice avenue for prompt judicial review requirement in a first amendment context makes far more sense if it is understood to mean a prompt final judicial determination.
the eleventh circuit further points out in boss capital that freedman and the line of cases following it can be distinguished from licensing cases on the grounds that they involved censorship rather than licensing.justice held in that licensing schemes do not involve the grave dangers of a censorship system,and therefore the full procedural protections set forth in freedman are not required.at.citation omitted.as the eleventh circuit notes,licensing schemes primarily involve mundane and ministerial factors,such as the general qualifications of each applicant boss capital,at.in contrast,censorship cases involve a highly subjective judgment about the nature of the suspect material.
in addition,the eleventh circuit notes,unlike movie distributors who might show a given film in hundreds of theaters around the country,applicants for licenses arguably have a greater incentive to stick it out and see litigation through to its end.id.at.freedman rationale therefore arguably makes less sense in the licensing context,and boss capital concludes that the need for a prompt judicial decision is therefore less compelling.see boss capital,at arguing that access to prompt judicial review is sufficient for licensing cases.because the ordinance in dispute contained an explicit judicial review provision,the eleventh circuit held it constitutional.id.at.
boss capital draws a rational distinction between licensing cases and censorship cases.the purpose of justice language distinguishing between these two categories,however,is most logically understood as an attempt at explaining why freedman third the burden of going to court and the burden of proof must be on the not appropriate to the licensing context.see,at.concluding that the third freedman requirement does not apply to licensing cases.if justice had intended to adopt a different judicial review requirement for licensing cases,she could have done so explicitly,just as she explicitly rejected the requirement.
other circuits have held that the judicial review requirement of freedman was not altered by.as the sixth circuit notes,justice gave no indication that she was modifying the second requirement of prompt judicial review in the licensing context.nightclubs,at.according to the ninth circuit,the plurality took issue only with freedman requirement that the censor bear the cost of going to court to obtain judicial review otherwise,offered nothing different from freedman concept of what judicial review meant.baby tam,at see also baltimore boulevard,at reaching the same conclusion.if the court adopted the freedman requirement without modification in,then the distinction between licensing and censorship is not relevant here.
even if the rationale behind freedman is specific to censorship cases,there is an equally valid rationale for requiring prompt judicial review in licensing cases.although licensing ordinances are technically considered,zj gifts,city of aurora,cir,they are distinguishable from other time,place,and manner restrictions insofar as they target businesses purveying sexually explicit speech.thomas chi.park.at,d quoting,at.a licensing official may have little or no discretion in reviewing an application,but he or she may be tempted nonetheless to overstep the bounds of the ordinance.
adult businesses are controversial,and the possibility exists that licensing officials might allow their personal views on the morality of sexually explicit entertainment to sway a decision on an application.given the strong feelings that adult businesses can engender,there must be a prompt judicial determination to ensure that licensing officials do not exceed their authority under the ordinance in their zeal to protect the local community.zj sells sexually explicit magazines and videocassette tapes,which are presumptively protected by the first amendment,see,at,and the danger that an ordinance like littleton may be improperly used as a subterfuge for censorship is too great to overlook the necessity for a prompt judicial determination.
in short,we are not persuaded by those circuits that have concluded that mere access to judicial review is sufficient in licensing cases.following the fourth,sixth and ninth circuits,we hold that,in the event that an license is denied,requires a prompt final judicial decision regarding the validity of the denial.a theoretical possibility of expeditious judicial review is not constitutionally sufficient.nightclubs,at.while we trust state courts to exercise due diligence,we can not be sure that a state judge toiling under a busy docket,will conduct a hearing and render a decision in a prompt manner.id.prompt judicial review,including a prompt final decision,must be assured in all first amendment licensing cases in order for the second requirement of freedman and to be satisfied.what constitutes a prompt judicial determination in the licensing context is to be determined by reference to the supreme court jurisprudence following freedman.see,southeastern promotions,conrad,d holding that a judicial review process lasting more than five months was not prompt.
littleton ordinance allows a party whose license has been denied to appeal to the colorado district court under colorado rule of civil procedure a.this rule allows an adverse decision regarding the license to be given expedited review in the trial court discretion,at citing.civ.a viii.because this rule does not assure that license decisions will be given expedited review,however,it does not save littleton ordinance.accordingly,the or
