this appeal challenges the trial court quashing service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction.we review the issue as a matter of law hall laronde th,and we affirm the trial court determination.
the underlying plaintiff sued appellant bombardier recreational products,bombardier,for personal injuries.he claimed that in,while trying to start a sea doo personal watercraft manufactured by bombardier,the watercraft caught fire,causing him serious injuries.he alleged bombardier was negligent for failing to inform him of a recall for the watercraft allegedly defective fuel tank.
bombardier filed a against respondent dow chemical canada ulc dow canada.dow canada is a successor to union carbide canada,union carbide canada,whose wedco moulded products division wedco,for a time,manufactured fuel tanks bombardier installed in its personal watercraft.
appearing specially,dow canada filed a motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction.it contended it and its predecessors lacked sufficient contacts with california to be subject to suit here.prior to,wedco manufactured fuel tanks and fuel tank filler necks used by bombardier in its personal watercraft.the fuel tanks were manufactured exclusively in canada.wedco sold the fuel tanks to bombardier exclusively in canada pursuant to purchase orders made in canada.bombardier manufactured its personal watercraft in canada.union carbide canada sold wedco to an unrelated third party in.
union carbide canada,including wedco,never had a registered agent in california,never qualified to do business in california,never manufactured any products in california,never had any employees,offices,or facilities in california,and never advertised or sold any personal watercraft fuel tanks or fuel tank filler necks in california.
in,union carbide canada merged with dow chemical canada,and the company was later renamed dow chemical canada ulc.
dow canada is a canadian corporation with its principal place of business in calgary,alberta,canada.it has never had an agent for service of process in california,never qualified to do business in california,never manufactured any products in california,never had any employees,officers or other facilities in california,and never advertised or sold products in california or to customers in california.
in its opposition to the motion to quash service,bombardier did not contest dow canada factual assertions.rather,it argued dow canada had sufficient contacts with california because union carbide canada had known bombardier would incorporate its fuel tanks and fuel tank filler necks in personal watercraft it intended to sell in the united states,including california.bombardier submitted a declaration from one of its component part buyers,pierre biron,stating he had informed union carbide canada its fuel tanks and fuel tank filler necks would be used in watercraft sold across the united states,including california.bombardier also submitted a declaration from its director of intellectual property,jean daunais,stating union carbide canada,as part of its contract to supply bombardier with fuel tanks,had agreed to produce tanks that complied with regulatory standards promulgated by the united states coast guard.
dow canada objected to bombardier evidence in part because the declarations were signed under penalty of perjury under the laws of the united states of america,not the laws of the state of california as required by code of civil procedure section.
the trial court granted the motion to quash,and it sustained the objections against bombardier evidence.it determined california lacked personal jurisdiction because dow canada lacked minimum contacts with the state.dow canada had not purposefully engaged in activities in the state or availed itself of the benefits of conducting business here.the court sustained dow canada objections to bombardier evidence,but it stated that even if dow canada had known bombardier would sell the watercraft in the united states or had agreed to design the fuel tanks in compliance with united states regulations,dow canada contacts with california would be attenuated at best and insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.
discussion 
bombardier contends the trial court erred.it claims dow canada knowledge that its products would eventually enter the stream of commerce in california was sufficient to establish jurisdiction.it also claims the trial court erred in sustaining the objections against biron and daunais declarations.
in dow chemical canada ulc superior court th fandino,our colleagues in the second appellate district faced the same issue we face whether dow canada was subject to california jurisdiction because its predecessors were aware that their fuel tanks and fuel tank filler necks,installed in bombardier watercraft manufactured in canada,would be sold in california.the court of appeal and the california supreme court initially had denied dow canada any relief,but the united states supreme court vacated the judgment and remanded the matter to the court of appeal for further consideration in light of the high court most recent ruling on personal jurisdiction,mcintyre machinery,nicastro d.fandino,supra,th at.relying on mcintyre,the court of appeal concluded dow canada was not subject to personal jurisdiction in california because it did not purposefully avail itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state.fandino,supra,at.
we reach the same result our colleagues did in fandino.
california courts may exercise personal jurisdiction on any basis consistent with the constitution of california and the united states.code civ.the exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant comports with these constitutions if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,vons,quoting internat.shoe washington.pavlovich superior court cal th,pavlovich.
the concept of minimum contacts requires states to observe certain territorial limits on their sovereignty.it ensure s that the states,through their courts,do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.vons,supra,cal th at,quoting world wide volkswagen woodson,d,world wide volkswagen.to do so,the minimum contacts test asks whether the quality and nature of the defendant activity is such that it is reasonable and fair to require him to conduct his defense in that state.kulko california superior court,d,quoting internat.shoe,supra,at pp.the test is not susceptible of mechanical application rather,the facts of each case must be weighed to determine whether the requisite affiliating circumstances are present.kulko,at.snowney harrah entertainment,cal th,snowney.
under the minimum contacts test,p ersonal jurisdiction may be either general or specific.vons,supra,cal th at.because bombardier does not claim general jurisdiction,we consider only whether specific jurisdiction exists here.
when determining whether specific jurisdiction exists,courts consider the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,d,quoting shaffer heitner,d.a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits vons,supra,cal th at the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum,quoting helicopteros,supra,at and the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice vons,supra,cal th at,quoting burger king rudzewicz,d,burger king.pavlovich,supra,cal th at.snowney,supra,cal th at.
the united states supreme court has wrestled with the scope of the purposeful availment requirement.plurality and concurring opinions in asahi metal industry superior court d asahi offered competing views on whether the foreign defendant created minimum contacts with the forum state simply by foreseeing that its products could reach the forum state when they entered into the stream of commerce.more recently,in mcintyre,plurality and concurring opinions again could not agree on the extent to which the foreign defendant foreseeability could establish minimum contacts.
bombardier and dow canada disagree on the effect of mcintyre.we conclude both the plurality and the concurring opinions in mcintyre agree that mere foreseeability,at least where products are not sold in a state as part of the regular and anticipated flow of commerce into that state,is not enough to establish minimum contacts with the forum state.beyond that,the opinions do not significantly add to the state of personal jurisdiction jurisprudence,and we thus rely on existing precedent to define and apply the purposeful availment prong of the minimum contacts test.
in asahi,a california plaintiff sued in state court the taiwanese manufacturer of a motorcycle tire tube in a products liability action.the taiwanese manufacturer in turn filed a for indemnity against asahi,the japanese manufacturer of the tube valve assembly.asahi moved to quash summons on the basis of lack of jurisdiction.asahi,supra,at.the high court concluded asahi lacked minimum contacts with california.id.at.
writing for the plurality,justice rejected the notion that mere foreseeability or awareness was a constitutionally sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction if the defendant product made its way into the forum state while still in the stream of commerce.citation.asahi,supra,at plur.opn.of.she and three other justices concluded t he substantial connection citations between the defendant and the forum state necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state.citations.the placement of a product into the stream of commerce,without more,is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state.additional conduct of the defendant may indicate an intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum state,for example,designing the project for the market in the forum state,advertising in the forum state,establishing channels for providing regular advice to customers in the forum state,or marketing the product through a distributor who has agreed to serve as the sales agent in the forum state,at plur.opn.of,italics omitted.
according to justice,even assuming asahi knew some of the valves it sold to the taiwanese company would be incorporated into tire tubes sold in california,the taiwanese company had not demonstrated any action by asahi to purposefully avail itself of the california market.asahi does not do business in california.it has no office,agents,employees,or property in california.it does not advertise or otherwise solicit business in california.it did not create,control or employ the distribution system that brought its valves to california.citation.there is no evidence that asahi designed its product in anticipation of sales in california.citation.on the basis of these facts,the exertion of personal jurisdiction over asahi by the superior court of california exceeds the limits of due process.asahi,supra,at plur.opn.of.
justice brennan,joined by three justices in his concurrence,rejected justice view of the stream of commerce theory.in his opinion,t he stream of commerce refers not to unpredictable currents or eddies,but to the regular and anticipated flow of products from manufacture to distribution to retail sale.as long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum state,the possibility of a lawsuit there can not come as a surprise.nor will the litigation present a burden for which there is no corresponding benefit.a defendant who has placed goods in the stream of commerce benefits economically from the retail sale of the final product in the forum state,and indirectly benefits from the state laws that regulate and facilitate commercial activity.these benefits accrue regardless of whether that participant directly conducts business in the forum state,or engages in additional conduct directed toward that state.asahi,supra,at conc.opn.of brennan.
the supreme court encountered the issue again in mcintyre.in that case,the plaintiff was injured using a machine that had been manufactured by mcintyre in england,and he sued in new jersey state court.mcintyre was incorporated and operated in england.it sold its machines to an independent united states distributor who agreed to sell the machines in the united states.however,mcintyre did not sell its machines to united states buyers,nor did it market in or ship goods to new jersey.j mcintyre officials attended annual conventions in the united states,but never in new jersey.no more than four machines it manufactured ended up in new jersey.however,mcintyre held both united states and european patents on its technology,and the distributor structured its advertising and sales efforts in accordance with mcintyre direction and guidance.mcintyre,supra,at d at.
the new jersey supreme court held new jersey could exercise jurisdiction.it ruled the state could exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as the manufacturer knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.citation.mcintyre,supra,at d at.
the united states supreme court reversed,concluding mcintyre lacked minimum contacts with new jersey.writing for a plurality,justice kennedy sided with justice in requiring the minimum contacts with the forum state to come about by the defendant actions purposefully directed toward the forum state this court precedents make clear that it is the defendant actions,not his expectations,that empower a state courts to subject him to judgment.mcintyre,supra,at d at plur.opn.of kennedy.t he authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment,consistent with justice opinion in asahi mcintyre,supra,at plur.opn.of kennedy.
justice breyer,writing for himself and justice alito,concurred in the result.he did so,however,based only on existing precedent.none of those precedents,he stated,found that a single isolated sale to a customer who takes an product to a different state was sufficient contact to assert jurisdiction.that scenario would not pass muster under either justice or justice brennan formulations announced in their asahi opinions.the facts showed no regular flow or regular course of sales in new jersey the brennan,approach and there is no something more,such as special design,advertising,advice,marketing,or anything else the,approach.mcintyre,supra,at d at conc.opn.of breyer.
because the case factual record left open many questions,justice breyer believed the case was an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.mcintyre,supra,at d at conc.opn.of breyer.he wrote he was adhering strictly to the court precedents and the facts of the case i would not go further.id.at.
nevertheless,justice breyer went on to explain why he disagreed with the approaches taken by both the plurality and by the new jersey supreme court.he disagreed with the plurality opinion because he felt it was an attempt to establish strict rules limiting jurisdiction without taking account of recent changes in globalized and electronic commerce,issues this case did not present.mcintyre,supra,at d at conc.opn.of breyer.
however,he also disagreed with the approach adopted by the new jersey supreme court that a manufacturer is subject to jurisdiction for a action because it should have foreseen its products might be sold anywhere in the united states.a test based merely on foreseeability would rest jurisdiction upon no more than the occurrence of a accident in the forum state,a notion the high court has rejected.mcintyre,supra,at d at conc.opn.of breyer,see world wide volkswagen,supra,at.
such an automatic rule also could not be reconciled with the constitutional demand for minimum contacts and purposeful availment a rule like the new jersey supreme court would permit every state to assert jurisdiction in a suit again
