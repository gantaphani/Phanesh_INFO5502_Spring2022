alga,an anesthesiologist,brought antitrust claims under section of the sherman act and pendent state law claims against her former employers,the overlapping directors of an anesthesiology group and two hospitals.she alleged that the exclusive dealing arrangement between the hospitals and the group prevented her from competing to offer her services.she also alleged that the defendants engaged in a group boycott to exclude her from the anesthesiology group,which had an exclusive contract at local hospitals,and subsequently denied her certification to practice at those hospitals.
the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim,which the court allowed,with leave to amend.then filed an amended complaint amplifying her allegations.the district court granted the motion to dismiss the amended complaint,holding that had failed to sufficiently allege the relevant geographic market and an antitrust injury.morales villalobos garcía lloréns,d,opinion and order.we reverse,though sympathetic to the difficulties posed by this area of law.

the facts as described in plaintiff complaint are as follows.is an anesthesiologist living in the town of arecibo,approximately miles west of san juan.in july she became an employee of arecibo respiratory care,arc one of the.arc provided anesthesiology services under an exclusive contract to the two hospitals in arecibo performing surgeries hospital susoni hds and hospital regional de arecibo cayetano coll y toste,which was managed by a subsidiary of hds,susoni health community services.this subsidiary later purchased that hospital outright.the complaint provides no information on the length of the exclusive contract.the,josé arturo,and manuel the sole shareholders of arc and members of the board of directors of hds.arc is,in turn,the majority shareholder of hds.josé arturo and manuel matos are themselves certified anesthesiologists.
alleges that josé arturo,miguel,and manuel matos were all hds the decision to award an exclusive contract to arc indeed,no other hds board members participated in the decision.the complaint alleges that the exclusive contract between arc and hds was motivated by corrupt between the directors and stockholders of the two corporations,several of whom are themselves anesthesiologists and presumably benefitted from the exclusive agreement.the inference may be drawn that the reasons for the arrangement,accordingly,were not competitive.received medical privileges as a physician at hds in september,which appear to have extended to the hospital regional de arecibo as well.in september,her privileges were renewed at hds and the hospital regional de arecibo for a further two years.
on december,was fired from her position at arc by miguel,the president of arc,despite the absence of patient complaints as alleged in the complaint,which we must take to be true.the following year,was not recertified for privileges at hds.because of arc exclusive arrangement with hds,once plaintiff was fired by arc,she could not find work as an anesthesiologist at either hospital in arecibo.hds also rejected a request by ramos escoda,former husband and a surgeon who practices in arecibo,to have her administer anesthesia to his private surgery patients at hds.other physicians in the area have also indicated their willingness to use services,but are prevented from doing so at these hospitals.moreover,hds prevented from entering the medical facility by placing fliers on the walls and posting security guards at the hospital doors.
alleges that hds and the hospital regional de arecibo have complete market power in the arecibo region,because they are able to offer a complete line of medical services,and because they are the only hospitals approved as medicare providers.they are the only hospitals within the health region of arecibo,as defined by the health reform program of the government of puerto rico,which provides medical care for indigent patients.patients covered under the health reform program are not allowed to seek services in san juan or other cities in puerto rico.alleges she provides medicare services to patients of escoda.half of the total revenue received by the arecibo hospitals comes from medicare,which provides health coverage for individuals years old or older.an inference may be drawn that such patients are less likely to be able to make a trip to hospitals in san juan.
the other health region relatively near arecibo is the manatí health region,which encompasses the city of manatí,in which there are three hospitals at which surgery is performed.says it would be impossible for her to practice in manatí,because all of these hospitals have exclusive contracts with anesthesiology groups.perhaps more importantly,her referring physicians in the arecibo region do not have privileges in manatí.
also alleges that the quality of patient care has worsened as a result of arc exclusive contract.she cites understaffing,with one anesthesiologist routinely expected to cover two hospitals,and nurses administering anesthesia without the supervision of an anesthesiologist.she also alleges an increase in cost relative to other sectors of the market.
alleges that she has been blocked from practicing anesthesiology in arecibo,her hometown,and that she has also suffered damages to her professional reputation as a result of her termination by arc.she alleges there are doctors who wish to use her as an anesthesiologist but can not because she has been denied privileges at the only hospitals in arecibo.she characterizes herself as a competitor of arc.she requests either renewal of her medical privileges at hds facilities and an order requiring defendants to allow her to administer to elective private patients,or a declaration that the exclusive contract is illegal,economic damages,and an order to open hds to medicare providers.
the district court dismissed complaint on two bases first,that she failed to adequately define the geographic market and second,that she lacked antitrust standing.neither issue can be evaluated without reference to plaintiff theories of recovery.at this most preliminary stage,the bare bones of two different theories are suggested by plaintiff complaint.the first is that,as an anesthesiologist in arecibo,she is a direct competitor of arc and is precluded by the exclusive dealing arrangement from offering her services to the only two hospitals in arecibo.the second is that the defendants have engaged in a group boycott,in a horizontal arrangement excluding her through expulsion,which precludes her from offering her services.neither theory is actionable as a per se violation.
the district court dismissed the claim first for lack of a proper geographic market.here,the plaintiff claim is that,as a seller of services,she was foreclosed from the outlets reasonably available.for an anesthesiologist,the primary outlets for her services are ordinarily hospitals and clinics.of course,even substantial foreclosure in a relevant market is not necessarily unlawful,see tampa nashville coal,d,but whether the restraint is horizontal or vertical,substantial foreclosure is ordinarily a requirement for a seller arguing that she or he has been unreasonably excluded from opportunities to sell.id.
in this instance,the extent of foreclosure depends greatly on whether the plaintiff market is anesthesiology services within arecibo,or whether the market encompasses the neighboring town of manatí,or whether it includes other parts or all of puerto rico,or whether it also includes part or all of the continental u
