background 
securitization of the arlington loan 
although we assume familiarity with our prior opinion in this case,see trust love funding,we briefly recite certain facts relevant to the decision reached today.in april,love funding entered into a conduit lending arrangement with paine webber,which was memorialized in an april,mortgage loan purchase agreement the love mlpa.under the love mlpa,love funding represented to paine webber that no underlying mortgage loan was in default.in the event that love funding breached this,or any other,representation,the love mlpa provided for certain remedies,including the repurchase of the mortgage loan at the repurchase price,love mlpa b,and indemnification from and against all demands,claims or asserted claims,liabilities or asserted liabilities,costs and expenses,including reasonable attorneys fees,incurred by an indemnified party,in any way arising from or related to any breach of any representation,warranty,covenant or agreement hereunder,id.a.
in july,pursuant to the love mlpa,love funding arranged a million mortgage loan the arlington loan to cyrus ii partnership cyrus,which was secured by a mortgage on louisiana property known as the arlington apartments.on november,paine webber sold and assigned loans,including the arlington loan,to merrill lynch mortgage investors,merrill lynch,pursuant to the merrill lynch mortgage loan purchase agreement the merrill lynch mlpa.in the merrill lynch mlpa,paine webber represented,as love funding had in the love mlpa,that none of the mortgage loans was in default.
the loans were then securitized through a process that involved the creation of the plaintiff trust.on november,merrill lynch assigned to the trust all of its right s,title and interest in,to and under i the mortgage loans including the loans sold by paine webber,ii each mortgage loan purchase agreement and iii all other assets included or to be included in the trust.pooling and servicing agreement a.commercial securities,entitling their holders to interest payments generated on the underlying mortgages including the arlington loan,were then issued and sold to investors.
arlington loan default and resulting litigation 
on march,the trust declared the arlington loan to be in default and accelerated payment on the full amount of the loan.the trust then commenced a mortgage foreclosure action in louisiana state court,securing a ruling that cyrus had committed fraud to obtain the arlington loan and that such fraud constituted an event of default.as a consequence,the arlington apartments were sold for approximately million in net proceeds,of which the trust received million.the trust also obtained a judgment of more than million against cyrus and its principals.
in september and october,the trust brought several actions against ubs related to the sale of loans by paine webber to the trust.with respect to the arlington loan,the trust theory was that,because cyrus fraud put the arlington loan in default from the outset,paine webber and,therefore,its successor ubs necessarily breached its representation in the merrill lynch mlpa that there is no material default.merrill lynch mlpa,schedule i.on september,after two years of vigorous litigation,the trust and ubs reached a settlement releasing the trust claims as to loans.while ubs paid the trust million in consideration for releases on loans,the sole consideration for the trust release on the arlington loan was ubs assignment of its rights under the love mlpa.
district court proceedings 
in november,the trust commenced this action against love funding for breach of the love mlpa.on october,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the trust on its claim that love funding had breached its representation that the arlington loan was not in default nevertheless,it allowed love funding to amend its answer to assert the affirmative defense of champerty.
on february,after a bench trial,the district court ruled that love funding had proved champerty because the trust primary purpose in accepting the assignment was to buy a lawsuit against love funding.trust love funding,d at.the district court relied on the fact that the trust carve d out a single loan from a group of loans that were settled,id.at,and thereby negotiated for itself a whole new lawsuit,with the intent to basically continu e a microcosm of the litigation that ha d already been going on for the last three years with ubs,id.at alterations in original.in reaching this conclusion,the district court further found that the trust was motivated by a perception that it could recover more on the arlington loan by suing love funding than by pursuing a cash settlement because it would be able to recoup millions of dollars in simple and default interest that have been accruing on the loan for years and because it could also potentially recover indemnification damages.id.at.
certification of questions to the new york court of appeals

is it sufficient as a matter of law to find that a party accepted a challenged assignment with the primary intent proscribed by new york judiciary law,or must there be a finding of sole intent 
as a matter of law,does a party commit champerty when it buys a lawsuit that it could not otherwise have pursued if its purpose is thereby to collect damages for losses on a debt instrument in which it holds a proprietary interest 
a as a matter of law,does a party commit champerty when,as the holder of a defaulted debt obligation,it acquires the right to pursue a lawsuit against a third party in order to collect more damages through that litigation than it had demanded in settlement from the assignor 
b is the answer to question a affected by the fact that the challenged assignment enabled the assignee to exercise the assignor indemnification rights for reasonable costs and attorneys fees
