the boston pilots,an unincorporated association of licensed marine pilots,appeal from a ruling denying them recovery under the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.the pilots contend that the effort and expense incurred in collecting pilotage fees owed by the marine vessel midnight gambler and its operator,east coast from dilatory conduct by east coast that ran afoul of ch.proscription against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.laws ch.although the conduct of east coast is questionable,we find no clear error in the district court determination that such behavior does not warrant sanction under ch.
the district court,sitting in admiralty under,resolved the underlying fee dispute on summary judgment and awarded fees to the pilots in a total amount of.the pilots prevailed on two separate motions for summary judgment,the first for fees due for pilotage services actually rendered during august and september,and the second for pilotage fees due for october and november of that same year,when east coast claimed the midnight gambler was no longer required to carry pilots because of a revision in the ship tonnage.
a bench trial on the ch.claim followed the second summary judgment order,and the district court held that east coast and the midnight gambler would not be subject to additional penalties under the consumer protection statute.the court denied the pilots claim for attorney fees as well as other costs,expenses and interest,allowed under.laws ch,for frivolous or vexatious litigation.the pilots appeal these orders as well as denial of their motion to reconsider.neither side appeals the judgments awarding pilotage fees.
background 
the dispute between the pilots and east coast arose over the obligation of every foreign flag vessel of tons or more to carry a commissioned pilot while operating in commonwealth waters.see.laws ch.according to an international tonnage certificate registered with lloyd register of shipping,the midnight gambler,a panamanian flag ship that made daily gambling cruises,weighed gross tons.
the gambler grumbled about the statutory pilotage requirement.east coast president dan teitel testified that he was surprised the statute applied to the vessel because of its relatively small size feet in length and the brevity of its excursions.teitel also noted that he was aware of no other port making such requirements of casino vessels traveling in and out of the same port each day,regardless of the ship foreign flag.nevertheless,east coast duly carried a pilot for each of the gambler voyages in august and september.
unfortunately,the pilot daily fees exceeded the gambler profits.teitel contacted a boston admiralty attorney who suggested it might be possible to the tonnage of the vessel.based on this suggestion,teitel contacted a naval architect,who in turn procured a statement of tonnage from the american bureau of shipping 
the parties no longer dispute the fact that the new statement of tonnage,listing regulatory tonnage for the midnight gambler at tons,was never a valid replacement for the official international tonnage certificate.teitel,however,testified that when he received the statement,he did not as a lay businessman,not an admiralty expert,could not have this tonnage was simply hypothetical and did not change midnight gambler tonnage for purposes of the mandatory pilotage statute.maintaining that the vessel was no longer above the applicable tonnage for the pilotage statute,he contacted captain arthur whittemore,then president of the boston pilots,and told him the gambler would no longer be carrying pilots.
the pilots,however,objected and after unsuccessfully demanding payment for services already rendered brought an action in rem against the vessel and in personam against east coast.as a result,the vessel was arrested in november by the marshal service.although east coast recovered the vessel after posting a surety bond,it ceased operations in the face of impending litigation.
as noted above,the district court ordered payment of pilotage fees for the duration of the time the midnight gambler was in operation.it rejected,however,the pilots request for damages based on unfair conduct under ch,and also rejected claims for attorney fees and related costs and expenses under.laws ch.in this appeal,the pilots contend that appellees conduct warranted both damages and an award of attorney fees,costs and interest.

in analyzing a district court disposition of a ch.claim following a bench trial,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.indus.ceramics,wellons,cir.while the determination of whether a particular set of acts is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact,the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a ch.violation is a question of law.commercial union ins.seven provinces ins,cir internal citations omitted.
the pilots claim for recovery under ch.rests on two primary grounds.first,they contend that the american statement of tonnage was obtained as a pretext to evade an indisputable statutory obligation and to delay the inevitable day of reckoning.the pilots argue it was inexcusable for east coast to continue to resist the pilots claims after learning that the statement had no validity.second,the pilots argue that the attempts by east coast to settle the case for an amount less than what was due were tantamount to commercial extortion.the pilots cite clear error in the district court factual findings that the statement of tonnage was not deceptive and that east coast lacked the ability to pay the pilotage fees.in addition,the pilots urge us to conclude that the district court failed to apply the law properly.
we address first the court factual findings and then consider whether the alleged conduct falls within the ambit of ch.
findings of fact 
the statement of tonnage.the district court conclusion that the statement was not deceptively generated is generally supported by teitel trial testimony.teitel learned of the process from an admiralty attorney,suggesting that it was at least a plausible option.although the american bureau of shipping engineer testified that a cover letter included with the statement specified the measurement was merely hypothetical,teitel explained that only a copy of the statement,not the cover letter,was forwarded to him by the naval architect,who was his liaison with the bureau.furthermore,teitel testified that only after the ship was arrested did he begin to doubt the statement validity.moreover,although east coast purpose in securing the statement was undoubtedly to circumvent a statutory obligation,we do not see that its initial reliance on the new measurement was entirely baseless.though dubious,even the pilots did not dismiss the statement outright at trial captain whittemore admitted that there was sufficient uncertainty surrounding its validity to warrant a hearing on the subject by the pilots.
the district court apparent acceptance of teitel testimony as sincere is entitled to deference,see deguio united states,cir it is normally within the exclusive province of the trier to make determinations regarding witnesses credibility.citing anderson bessemer city,d,and we thus find no clear error in the district court finding that the statement was not a deceptive act 
the pilots contend that the district court conclusion does not dispose of the issue even if it was not deceptive,the pilots argue the statement was nevertheless an unfair pretext.we agree that the analysis of unfairness has a somewhat different substantive thrust than that of deception.see cambridge plating napco,cir chapter liability may exist if the defendant conduct falls within at least the penumbra of some,statutory or other established concept of unfairness or is immoral,unethical,oppressive or unscrupulous.internal citations omitted.however,the evidence before the district,east coast initial genuine mistake regarding the validity of the admeasurement performed by supports the conclusion that procuring the statement was not unfair.
