dhx,a freight forwarder,petitions for review of a decision by the surface transportation board stb denying its complaint challenging the reasonableness of certain rates and practices of matson navigation,matson,and service,now horizon lines,llc horizon,two water carriers operating in the noncontiguous domestic trade between hawaii and ports in the continental united states.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and,and we deny the petition for review.
the stb is a successor to the interstate commerce commission icc.in the icc termination act of iccta,stat,congress abolished the icc,revised the interstate commerce act,and transferred regulatory functions under that act to the stb.see ass stb,cir.in,congress began partially deregulating the industries that the icc supervised,with a view toward promoting competition.see,at,as reprinted in,iccta house report,at iccta senate report.the iccta continued this general deregulatory trend and significantly reduce d regulation of surface transportation industries in this country.iccta senate report at.
prior to the enactment of the iccta,the icc had regulatory authority over water carriers who operated along the coasts of the continental united states or on inland waterways.water carriers who operated outside of the continental united states,however,were regulated by the federal maritime commission.the federal maritime commission had regulatory authority over all operations of carriers serving the noncontiguous domestic trade or the domestic offshore trade,operations between ports in alaska,hawaii,or united states territories or possessions on the one hand,and other united states ports,including mainland ports,on the other hand.the iccta centralized all regulatory authority relating to the noncontiguous domestic trade with the stb.see.
in doing so,congress reenacted some,but not all,of the regulatory provisions regarding the noncontiguous domestic trade.in keeping with its trend toward reducing unnecessary regulation,congress removed some of the regulatory restraints previously imposed upon water carriers.moreover,congress affirmatively authorized the water carriers to undertake some activities that motor and rail carriers had already been allowed to pursue after the enactment of earlier legislation.thus,under the iccta,water carriers in the noncontiguous domestic trade remain subject to three main regulatory requirements like all common carriers,they must provide transportation or service on reasonable request,see a they are required to file tariffs,see a and b and they are required to maintain reasonable rates and practices,see a.
despite these regulatory requirements,the iccta also codifies a number of rate freedoms.d is a safe harbor provision,which specifies that any given rate is deemed reasonable if it falls within a zone of reasonableness,if it is not more than higher or lower than what the rate was one year earlier.the iccta allows carriers explicitly to offer rates that vary with the volume of cargo offered over a specified period of time,see b,and it allows carriers to enter into contracts in which the parties can waive any or all of the rights or remedies available under the interstate commerce act,see b.most importantly,with regard to dhx petition for review,congress repealed the statutory provisions that had prohibited unreasonable discrimination in the noncontiguous domestic water carrier trade when it enacted the iccta.see app.repealed.
while some shipments via water carrier are arranged between the carrier and the shipper directly,others are handled through a intermediary such as a freight forwarder.dhx is a freight forwarder,an entity that holds itself out to the general public to provide transportation of property for compensation,usually by assembling and consolidating shipments to take advantage of volume rates offered by the carrier actually hauling the goods.see.a freight forwarder maintains the dual status of both carrier its shippers and shipper the underlying carrier that it uses.exem.of freight forwarders from tariff filing.therefore,dhx is both a user and a competitor of water carriers such as matson and horizon to which it tenders traffic.
in the water trade,freight forwarders aggregate smaller shipments at the point of origin,buy space on a vessel,and then provide distribution services at the destination.freight forwarders earn a profit when the rates they charge to individual shippers are lower than the water carrier rates for small shipments,but higher than the water carrier rates for the consolidated containerloads that the forwarders assemble.see,milwaukee,paul pac.acme fast freight.foreign freight forwarders brokers ass icc.the use of a freight forwarder can benefit the shipper by allowing it to pay rates lower than it could obtain on its own for shipments in small lots,while also benefitting the carrier,who is then free to focus its business on the containerload traffic that is most efficient for it to handle while the freight forwarder consolidates smaller shipments.
the dispute underlying this appeal is between freight forwarder dhx and the two major water carriers currently serving the hawaiian water trade market,matson and horizon.the noncontiguous domestic trade between hawaii and the mainland is experiencing a relatively low volume of traffic,resulting in excess capacity,which in turn,has exerted downward pressure on rates.see generally dep t of,a report to congress competition in the noncontiguous domestic maritime trades,at dot report this downward pressure led to rates in that were substantially below the rate levels in.see id.to address these market constraints and to maximize profitable traffic,matson and horizon tailored their rates to attract profitable traffic away from freight forwarders as well as to draw traffic away from each other.to attract and keep larger shippers like home depot that can provide a steady flow of full containerload fcl traffic,the water carriers began offering volume rates with overflow provisions.
overflow occurs when a particular shipper traffic for a given shipment does not completely fill all the containers used for that shipment.for example,home depot traffic for a particular shipment might fill more than one full container,but less than two.when such overflow occurs,the water carriers charge home depot a rate on the second,container that is lower than the rate that would apply to a container that is not part of a larger shipment by using their overflow provisions.according to the carriers,the purpose of overflow provisions is to accommodate the needs of those regular,shippers,who are the water carriers best customers.
as the stb explained in its june decision,once dhx recognized that lower rates were being charged for partially filled containers that were part of a larger shipment under matson and horizon overflow provisions,dhx began to go beyond the traditional role of a freight forwarder and to instead target the water carriers larger customers that already tendered volume traffic to the carriers directly.specifically,dhx would take the same containerload traffic of large shippers such as home depot,unpack the full containers,redistribute their contents,and repack them in order to create more overflow containers than the shippers themselves would have tendered had they dealt directly with the water carriers,thereby resulting in a larger number of containers subject to the lesser overflow rates.according to matson,at one point upwards of of its revenues for overflow traffic was coming from freight forwarders rather than from the regular direct shippers that the overflow provisions were designed to accommodate.as the stb explained in its december decision 
when defendants matson and horizon realized they were losing some of the profits from their fcl traffic to competitors such as dhx they began taking specific actions designed to induce their fcl shippers to begin dealing directly with them again.such actions included adopting tariffs setting up more favorable rates with specific limitations such as shipper name,street address,and zip code and entering into with large shippers that own the merchandise and have their own logistics departments that manage the transportation and control the routing of their particular rates for specified periods of time.
despite these actions,horizon and matson still continued to offer substantial discounted rates to dhx and other freight forwarders in order to attract traffic away from each other.
dhx filed a complaint with the stb in october against matson and horizon challenging the reasonableness of their rates and practices.the complaint largely focused on the increases matson and horizon had made to their overflow rates,arguing that the increases should be declared unreasonable because they exceeded the zone of reasonableness contained in d.matson and horizon promptly filed motions to dismiss.on december,the board issued a decision denying the motions to dismiss,but agreeing with the defendants that there were substantial shortcomings in dhx complaint.the decision further stated that dhx would have to flesh out the specific rates for specific shipments that it asserts are unreasonable,and it will have to support with particularity its general claim that the carriers practices are unlawful.
dhx filed an amended complaint on april,which in essence argued that any rate charged to dhx was unreasonable if it exceeded the rate charged to another customer.dhx also alleged that matson and horizon tariffs did not comport with statutory and regulatory requirements.in addition to seeking more than million in damages,dhx requested an order requiring the defendants to stop committing these allegedly unreasonable practices and to more openly embrace dhx competition.all parties filed lengthy submissions before the stb with regard to dhx contentions.on may,the stb issued a decision granting horizon motion for partial dismissal of the amended complaint.the stb rejected dhx claim that any rate charged to dhx was per se unreasonable if it was higher than the rate charged to another customer.the board explained 
dhx approach appears to be no more than a allegation that all of defendants rates are discriminatory.but the discrimination remedy was repealed as to this trade in iccta.thus,dhx can not possibly prevail in its argument that the assailed rates are unreasonable even if it did show that different shippers pay different rates for arguably similar services.
while dhx complaint was pending before the stb,dhx filed a civil complaint against horizon in federal district court in august,asserting a claim for rate discrimination.in january,the district court dismissed dhx complaint for failure to state a claim,holding that there is no common law cause of action for rate discrimination against an ocean carrier.the district court further concluded that because the stb has primary jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of a water carrier conduct,particularly with regard to the reasonableness of its rates and practices,the only relief available to dhx was whatever relief might be available under the interstate commerce act as determined by the stb.
on december,the stb issued a decision denying the remaining claims against matson and horizon raised in dhx amended complaint.despite the lengthy nature of the amended complaint with diffuse allegations ranging from discrimination and improper tariff format to deceit and fraud,the board explained that the principal substantive issue that remains to be resolved in this case is whether the actions that defendants took to recapture traffic and profits that they had lost to dhx constitute unreasonable practices.the stb concluded that dhx had not demonstrated that the water carriers had engaged in unreasonable practices in violation of a.instead,the board concluded that 
i t is not an unreasonable practice for a carrier to act in a manner,as here,designed to protect its profits and its market share from diversion to its competitors,and the board will not interfere with actions that have not been shown to be anything more than prudent responses to competitive threats.
in reaching its decision,the stb noted that the matson and horizon had given dhx favorable treatment where it made business sense to do so that dhx is itself the beneficiary of many of the tariff provisions about which it complains and that dhx business in the hawaiian trade has grown since the original complaint was filed.in addition,the stb stated that the provisions of the interstate commerce act had been repealed for water carriers by the iccta,and rejected dhx argument that a discrimination claim could instead be based upon the general statement of transportation policy contained in.
in a motion for reconsideration,dhx argued that either the stb had erred in finding that there was no remedy under the interstate commerce act for discriminatory pricing,or that there had to be a remedy under common law for such a claim.on june,the board issued a decision denying dhx petition,stating that there was no inconsistency between its decision and the district court ruling concluding there was no remedy under common law.the board also found no merit to dhx other claims of error,including its assertions that certain of the water carriers tariffs were deficient.this timely petition for review followed.

where there is a challenge to the agency interpretation of the statute that it administers,we apply the analytical framework set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see ass n,at.if the intent of congress is clear we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if however,the meaning of the statute is ambiguous,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.t he court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute id.
the core of dhx claims is that matson and horizon unlawfully discriminated by not giving dhx identical rates to those offered to direct fcl shippers such as home deport or sears.contrary to dhx assertion,we conclude that congress did not intend to retain a private cause of action against water carriers for discrimination when it enacted the iccta.prior to the iccta,joint and rates for the noncontiguous domestic trade were subject to the rail and motor provisions in former repealed.rates were governed by the provisions of the shipping act of,codified at former app.repealed.when congress enacted the iccta in,it explicitly repealed the relevant shipping act provisions.see,b,stat.repealing former app.moreover,while congress specifically retained an provision for rail carriers in,it did not retain or add comparable provisions for either water carriers or motor carriers.see iccta house report at,as reprinted in at containing a chart with the disposition of existing provisions which shows the retention of the provision for rail carriers in subtitle iv,part a,but not retaining the comparable provisions for motor or water carriers in subtitle iv,part b.
despite this legislative history,dhx contends that an express statutory prohibition is not necessary to support its discrimination claims.while a cause of action may be inferred in some situations when a statute is silent,we decline to infer one here where there was a prior explicit provision that congress knowingly removed.see fox citicorp credit,cir refusing to assume that congress acted contrary to its intentions when it repealed a statutory provision and enacted no substitute see also union pac.icc,holding that the agency could not use its authority to address an unreasonable railroad practice in order to subvert the statutory restriction against the agency examining the reasonableness of a rail rate where the railroad does not have market dominance over the transportation at issue.
to support its position,dhx,in part,relies on language in the iccta house report stating that carriers would be required to file tariffs in order to ensure that similarly situated shippers are treated the same by carriers based on the type and volume of cargo.iccta house report at.however,this language can not support such a claim since congress clear intent in iccta,as well as prior legislation was to move away from a regime of strict rate equalization.see id.indeed,on the same page of the house report,congress discusses its desire to ensure that price watching not result in other carriers follow ing the rates of the highest priced carrier,resulting in higher rates than would otherwise be charged so that no shipper gets the benefit of discounted rates.see id.regardless,dhx can not rely on general report language to create a cause of action that is not provided for in the iccta.see fox,at i solated statements within legislative history can not reintroduce what the congress has eliminated.united states rone,cir the proper function of legislative history is to solve,and not create,an ambiguity.moreover,even if we were to view iccta as ambiguous,the stb conclusion that congress repealed the prohibition against discrimination by water carriers is entitled to deference under chevron.such a conclusion is also buttressed by the department of transportation own interpretation of the iccta.dot report at stating that iccta did not specifically prohibit discriminatory rates by water carriers,as had the previous statute 
nor is there any other basis,statutory or otherwise,on which to sustain dhx claim of alleged discrimination.as it did before the stb,dhx argues that it may bring an action against matson and horizon for discriminatory rates and practices based on the general policy objectives set forth in.specifically,dhx cites to the language in subsection a d which speaks of reasonable rates without unreasonable discrimination and language in subsection a that encourages service and price competition in the noncontiguous domestic trade.as the stb stated at the outset of its december analysis,the transportation policy articulated at a simply sets forth a variety of sometimes conflicting policy objectives for the agency to consider in regulating the industry.see,balt.gas united states,addressing various rail transportation policies global van lines,icc,cir stating that the transportation policy is for general guidance and is not an independent source of power in motor carrier cases accord central forwarding,icc,cir.the stb correctly concluded that a claim under the general transportation policy alone does not provide a right of action.see also trailer bridge,sea star lines,llc,stb docket no,slip op.at stb served.
dhx suggestion that a,which sets forth the common carrier obligation,supports a cause of action for discrimination is similarly unavailing.section a simply directs all common carriers to handle the traffic that is tendered to them.see decatur county comm rs stb,cir the statutory common carrier obligation imposes a duty upon carriers to provide transportation on reasonable request.it does not say that they must charge every shipper the exact same rates.indeed,providing different customers with different rates and services is not inconsistent with a water carrier common carrier duty to provide service to each customer upon reasonable request,if the rates charged are reasonable.see,am.trucking ass ns,atchison,topeka santa fe,d discussing common carrier obligations and stating r ates were required to be reasonable,but discrimination in the form of unequal rates as among shippers was not forbidden at common law.
the stb may,holding that dhx can not possibly prevail in its argument that the assailed rates are unreasonable even if it did show that different shippers pay different rates for arguably similar services because the discrimination remedy was repealed as to this trade in the iccta is not arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of its discretion.rather,it is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law as expressed in iccta and congressional intent.
congress removal of any provisions applicable to the water trade through its enactment of the iccta does not,however,mean that the stb is without authority to review for antitrust considerations as part of its statutory responsibilities.to the contrary,if the stb believed that the oligopolist shippers pricing was aimed at eliminating competition in a manner harmful to consumers,the stb is empowered to step in and regulate any such anticompetitive behavior as part of its statutory responsibilities.see generally aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d recognizing that under certain circumstances a refusal to cooperate with rivals can constitute anticompetitive conduct,thereby violating section of the sherman act see also metronet servs.qwest,cir an offer to deal with a competitor only on unreasonable terms and conditions can amount to a practical refusal to deal.
here however,the conduct dhx complains of does not appear to have been prompted by anticompetitive malice,but rather competitive zeal.see verizon commc ns law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d.indeed,matson and horizon have not engaged in price discrimination because the rates they charge freight forwarders like dhx do not result in pricing which is at an unprofitable level in the short run merely to exclude competition in the long run.metronet,at.we do not,however,address this issue further because dhx did not raise any specific antitrust claims below.instead,we simply note that the stb possesses ample statutory authority to address and remedy any oligopolist pricing concerns arising out of the water carriers conduct under traditional antitrust principles.a a,a,james rill,the evolution of modern antitrust among federal agencies,geo.mason,noting that the stb,while not one of the primary federal antitrust review agencies,ha s jurisdiction over a particular sector.
it was also not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or contrary to law for the stb to conclude that dhx had not shown that it was subjected to unreasonable rates or practices.dhx has mistakenly equated discriminatory pricing with unreasonableness.rates can be discriminatory without being unreasonable,or unreasonable without being discriminatory.reasonableness denotes a range,rather than a single fixed point.see utils.nw.pub.serv.accord fpc conway,d addressing price squeeze and finding that a reasonable rate can be discriminatory icc inland waterways.as respondents argue,dhx theory would turn all rate discrimination automatically into unreasonable rates,and upset the longstanding distinctions.see,davis portland seed.holding that a shipper claiming discrimination was not entitled to reparations based on the difference between the rate it was charged and the lower rate given to someone else,unless it could show consequential damages,lost sales see also pennsylvania int l coal mining.
dhx contends that the rates it was charged by horizon and matson were unreasonable and that it is entitled to damages whenever the rates it was charged were higher than the rates paid by another shipper.dhx claims that such a calculation constitutes the traditional method of determining rate reasonableness and calculation of damages,and that because the stb has not replaced this traditional method with any other rate reasonableness standards,this method along with the pertinent case law continues to apply.these rate reasonableness standards,however,are from the,prior to congress significant shift toward deregulation.see,united states pac.ry.stating that rate comparisons can be used as one test of rate reasonableness,but cautioning that such a test should not be controlling.as respondents persuasively argue and the history of deregulation since then demonstrates,the notion that congress has retained an outdated,approach to rate approach it has labeled as kafkaesque,see iccta house report at without merit,as is the idea that the agency has not modernized its rate criteria since the.
the bulk of the case law relied upon by dhx pertains to railroad rates from decades earlier.since those decisions,the icc and now the stb have developed a c
