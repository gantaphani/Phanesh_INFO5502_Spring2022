we consider in light of gonzales raich,d,whether congress can use its commerce power to ban possession of homemade machineguns.
robert stewart sold parts kits for the manufacture and assembly of caliber rifles he advertised the kits on the internet and in shotgun news,a national firearms magazine.stewart believed the kits were legal to sell because the receivers on the rifles had not yet been completely machined and the rifles were thus not usable as firearms.an agent of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf discovered that stewart had a prior conviction for possession and transfer of a machinegun and decided to investigate stewart business.another agent,acting undercover,purchased one of stewart kits and determined that it could be readily converted into an unlawful firearm,in violation of a a and a a.based on this information,the atf agent secured a federal search warrant for stewart residence.
in addition to numerous rifle kits,the atf search also turned up firearms,including five machineguns.the machineguns had been machined and assembled by stewart.stewart was charged and convicted of one count of felony possession of firearms in violation of g and a,and five counts of unlawful possession of a machinegun in violation of o.no charges were brought against stewart regarding the advertised parts kits that were initially the subject of the investigation.stewart appeals his conviction for unlawful possession of machineguns,claiming that o is an invalid exercise of congress commerce power and violates the second amendment he appeals his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon on second amendment grounds 
in a prior opinion,we held,over judge restani dissent,that as applied to stewart,section o was an invalid exercise of congress commerce power.see united states stewart,cir.after its decision in raich,the supreme court granted certiorari,vacated our decision and remanded.see united states stewart,d mem.
section o makes it illegal to transfer or possess a machinegun.as we recognized in our prior opinion,there is nothing inherently economic or commercial about mere possession of an object,so we must consider whether criminalization of machinegun possession falls within congress commerce power.see const.art.it is that congress can regulate three categories of economic activity under its commerce power the use of the channels of interstate commerce,the instrumentalities of interstate commerce and those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.united states lopez,d.we began our prior opinion by holding that section o could not be justified under either of the first two categories.see stewart,at.so we turned to whether stewart possession of a homemade machinegun substantially affected interstate commerce.we applied the test articulated in united states morrison,d 
whether the regulated activity is commercial or economic in nature whether an express jurisdictional element is provided in the statute to limit its reach whether congress made express findings about the effects of the proscribed activity on interstate commerce and whether the link between the prohibited activity and the effect on interstate commerce is attenuated.
stewart,at citing morrison,at.we held that section o failed the first prong because p ossession of a machinegun is not,without more,economic in nature.id.at.we next determined that the effect of stewart activities on interstate commerce was quite attenuated stewart homemade machineguns did not stimulate a demand for anything the components he bought were legally available from commercial sources.id.at.and his possession did not affect overall demand because there was no evidence that stewart would ever have bought a machinegun from a commercial source,had he been precluded by law from building one himself.id.we then noted that section o contains no jurisdictional element anchoring the prohibited activity to interstate commerce.id.and finally,we noted that congress also failed to make any legislative findings when it enacted the statute that might have explained and justified congress policy choices.id.we held that legislative findings supporting prior firearms legislation were not instructive in our evaluation of section o because the section represented a sharp break from prior legislation in the field.id.at.whereas earlier statutes criminalized transactions,sales or deliveries of economic o criminalizes mere possession.because,as applied to stewart,section o failed all four prongs of the morrison test,we held that it was unconstitutional.
we now turn to whether our prior analysis is consistent with the approach to applied commerce clause challenges articulated in raich.there,the court considered whether the controlled substances act csa could constitutionally be applied to the possession of marijuana authorized by a physician prescription dispensed in accordance with state law.the claims and the statute at issue in raich were nearly identical to those at issue here like raich,stewart makes an challenge he does not contend that the statute under which he was convicted falls entirely outside congress commerce power,as did the defendants in morrison and lopez.see raich.at.and like raich,stewart claims his possession falls within a subgroup of purely intrastate activities that can easily be cordoned off from those congress may constitutionally control.the contested statutes themselves are nearly identical as well.both the csa and section o criminalize activity that,under the morrison framework,seems entirely.neither contains an express jurisdictional element to limit its reach,nor any express congressional findings that intrastate possession will affect interstate commerce 
the supreme court systematically rejected each of raich claims.it began by reiterating its prior holding that congress may regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.raich.at.therefore,when a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce,the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.raich.at quoting lopez,at.see also id.at that the regulation ensnares some purely intrastate activity is of no moment.
the court then held raich arguments were squarely controlled by wickard filburn.congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself commercial,in that it is not produced for sale,if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market raich.at.applying wickard,the court rejected raich attempt to carve out a narrow class of intrastate activities as beyond the reach of the commerce clause.raich claimed that when evaluating her activities under wickard,the court should look only at the effect of homegrown marijuana authorized by state law.however,the court refused to do so after explaining that homegrown under state law or quite easily leak into the interstate market,the court held that congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions.id.at see id.at congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the csa.absent was any analysis of whether marijuana differed from other homegrown marijuana.therefore,the fact that raich did not herself affect interstate commerce was of no moment when congress makes an interstate omelet,it is entitled to break a few intrastate eggs.id.at.
the lack of specific congressional findings regarding the effect of homegrown marijuana on interstate activity did change the court view w e have never required congress to make particularized findings in order to legislate,absent a special concern such as the protection of free speech.id.at internal citations omitted.and the court made clear that courts are not to scrutinize congress conclusions closely.we need not determine whether raich activities,taken in the aggregate,substantially affect interstate commerce
