this litigation arises from a fatal car accident involving philip healy and delaware state police corporal christopher shea.before the accident,healy had consumed alcohol at the home of,kathryn matassa and later at arena bar and deli at the time of the accident,healy had a blood alcohol concentration.both healy and corporal shea died at the scene.susan shea,individually and as executrix of the estate of christopher shea and as parent and next friend of christopher shea,and elizabeth shea,brought this suit against the tavern and matassa in superior court.the complaint alleged that the defendants negligently caused corporal shea death.the trial judge granted the tavern motion for judgment on the pleadings and mattassa motion for summary judgment.shea appealed.
shea argues that this court should create a common law cause of action for dram shop liability and hold the tavern responsible for corporal shea death because they negligently served healy alcohol knowing that he would then drive while intoxicated.further,shea alleges that matassa should be liable for corporal shea death under social host liability theory because she negligently served healy alcohol at her home,thus violating her duty to prevent him from leaving and then driving while intoxicated.shea contends that this court has never rejected a social host liability theory,so such a ruling would not require overturning any precedent.
we conclude that the general assembly,not this court,should decide whether to create a cause of action for dram shop liability or social host liability.the general assembly heavily regulates the sale and use of alcohol and by so doing has clearly announced its intent to occupy exclusively the field of policy making in that subject area.furthermore,the parties raise controversial and competing public policy questions which the general assembly can more effectively debate,consider and resolve through the legislative process.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the superior court.

discussion 
we review a trial judge grant of summary judgment de novo.we will affirm a trial judge grant of summary judgment when,viewing the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,if there are no issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.furthermore,we are reviewing two questions of law regarding dram shop liability and social host liability which are subject to de novo review 
dram shop liability 
shea contends that this court should establish a common law dram shop cause of action,resulting in the tavern being held liable for corporal shea death because the tavern employees served healy alcohol in the tavern knowing that healy would drive away while intoxicated.to support this argument,shea cites cases from several jurisdictions that recognize a common law dram shop cause of action shea contends that because the general assembly has never enacted a dram shop law despite the opportunity to do so,this court should therefore create a common law limited dram shop cause of action to fill the resulting legislative vacuum.
this court,in an unbroken line of cases over the past years,has determined that the establishment of a dram shop cause of action presents a social policy issue for the legislature,not the court the essential rationale underlying this line of cases is that the determination of whether to impose liability on tavern owners for injuries caused by intoxicated patrons involves significant public policy considerations and is best left to the general assembly.as this court has held 
the liability of commercial vendors of alcohol has been traditionally treated through judicial deference to legislative action or inaction.since state regulation of the commercial dispensing of alcohol is the norm,the lack of liability through dram shop acts or comparable legislation mitigates against the creation of such a cause of action on common law grounds.delaware has no dram shop act and,as this court noted in wright,the desirability of such a measure is a matter for the general assembly 
this court also noted that t he general assembly is in a far better position that this court to gather the empirical data and to make the fact finding necessary to determine what the public policy should be as to dram shop law,and the scope of any such law.in wright,we also noted that the scope issue has many practical implications for example 
should any such liability extend to hotel dining room,or restaurant owner or to social host as well as to a tavern owner should it extend to assaults or other torts by an inebriated patron to whom should such an action accrue should there be a special rule for minors and,inevitably,if a cause of action were recognized under any of these circumstances,a commercial dispenser of alcoholic beverages and,probably,a social host would be a party to every suit in which an intoxicated person is alleged to have committed a tortious act 
h istorically,our courts have recognized that the general assembly has the power and responsibility to license and regulate the use and sale of alcoholic beverages for the benefit of the public.the general assembly has traditionally governed the alcoholic beverage business and the various new statutes or recent amendments suggest that the legislature decided to try different ways to reduce alcohol related vehicle accidents as an alternative to enacting a dram shop law.in,in the general assembly,senator peterson and representative keeley sponsored senate bill to create dram shop liability under limited circumstances however,that bill failed to gain support in the general assembly and was not enacted 
instead of passing bills relating to dram shop liability,the general assembly enacted statutes regulating the use and sale of alcohol in delaware in recent years.fo
