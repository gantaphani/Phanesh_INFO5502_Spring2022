today,individuals can share their opinions with the entire world courtesy of a few taps on the keyboard.the appellee in this case,yelp yelp,provides an online forum on which its users express opinions as to services ranging from dog walkers to taco trucks.
the appellees,boris levitt,cats and dogs animal hospital,cats and dogs,john mercurio,and tracy chan,are small business owners collectively,the business owners who allege that yelp extorted or attempted to extort advertising payments from them by manipulating user reviews and penning negative reviews of their businesses.the business owners filed a lawsuit against yelp for violations of california unfair competition law ucl,california business professions code et,civil extortion,and attempted civil extortion.
the district court dismissed the lawsuit for failure to state a claim.we review the dismissal de novo,see wilson hewlett packard,cir,and,holding that the facts and legal theories alleged in the business owners complaint are insufficient to make out a prima facie case of unlawful or unfair business practices against yelp,affirm.
yelp service 
yelp provides an online directory that allows registered users to post reviews and rank businesses on a scale of one to five stars.based on these user rankings,yelp then assigns businesses an overall star rating.businesses can not opt out of being listed on yelp.
not all user reviews submitted appear on a business yelp page or remain there after initially appearing.reviews can be removed by the reviewer,removed by yelp for violating yelp review guidelines or terms of service,or removed by an automated filtering software maintained by yelp.according to yelp website,its filtering system operates as follows 
th e system decides how established a particular reviewer is and whether a review will be shown based on the reviewer involvement on yelp.while this may seem unfair this system is designed to protect both consumers and businesses alike from fake reviews,a malicious review from a competitor or a planted review from an employee.the process is entirely automated to avoid human bias,and it affects both positive and negative reviews.it important to note that these reviews are not deleted they are always shown on the reviewer public profile and may reappear on your business page in the future.
yelp also offers businesses advertising opportunities on its website for to per month.purchasing advertising allows a business to appear in advertisements displayed above yelp search results and on related business pages prevent competitors advertisements from appearing on its yelp page listing enhance its page listing with photos and promote a favorite review to the top of its page 
b.the allegations against yelp 
the business owners maintain that yelp created negative reviews of their businesses and manipulated review and ratings content to induce them to purchase advertising through yelp.they urge that yelp has thereby violated the ucl through acts of extortion and,when not successful in inducing payments to yelp,attempted extortion.they also allege separate causes of action for civil extortion and attempted civil extortion.
the business owners seek to represent two subclasses of businesses those that declined to advertise with yelp nonsponsors,and those that have,at some point,purchased advertising sponsors.they support their claims by alleging that approximately yelp employees or individuals acting on behalf of yelp have written reviews of businesses on yelp and that yelp chief executive officer admitted to a new york times reporter that yelp has paid users to write reviews,although it does not do so directly anymore.
the third amended complaint contains the following allegations 
boris levitt 
levitt,the owner of a furniture restoration business,alleged that several positive reviews disappeared from his business yelp page,causing the overall star rating of his business to decline.levitt contacted yelp to ask why a certain positive review had disappeared from his business page and was told by a yelp agent that she could not assist him.
two months later,a yelp sales representative contacted levitt to invite him to advertise with yelp.levitt declined,stating that he already had a high volume of users reviewing his business page and an overall rating of stars.
according to levitt,two days after he declined to purchase advertising,several reviews disappeared from his page,leaving his business with an overall star rating of stars.levitt asserted that yelp manipulated the reviews of his business because he did not purchase advertising,and did so as a threat made to induce him to purchase advertising.as a result of the lower overall rating,levitt alleged,his business reputation and revenues declined.
cats and dogs animal hospital 
cats and dogs is an animal hospital in santa barbara.its allegations center on reviews from two negative users.
cats and dogs contacted yelp to request removal of the first negative review,posted by yelp user chris,because the review referred to a visit that occurred outside of yelp policy.that review was subsequently removed,but another negative review from a different user,kay,showed up soon afterwards on the cats and dogs yelp page.
cats and dogs states that soon after the appearance of these negative reviews,it began receiving frequent,highpressure calls from yelp sales representatives,who promised to manipulate cats and dogs listing page in exchange for cats and dogs purchasing advertising.cats and dogs alleged it received a call from a yelp sales representative who stated that yelp would hide negative reviews or place them lower on cats and dogs listing page if cats and dogs purchased advertising.cats and dogs declined.according to cats and dogs,a week after it rejected this particularly explicit advertising pitch,the chris review reappeared,followed by a second negative review from kay cats and dogs alleged that yelp the chris r and two kay k reviews manufactured its own reviews to instill fear in cats and dogs to advertise.cats and dogs further alleged that a s a result of yelp conduct,cats and dogs business revenues and reputation were injured.
mercurio owns wheel techniques,an automobile body repair shop.he alleged that yelp posted false reviews,meaning reviews not composed by actual customers,as a threat to induce wheel techniques to advertise.he based his allegation on the appearance of negative reviews on wheel techniques yelp review page that did not correspond to customer records and contemporaneous telephone calls from yelp requesting that wheel techniques purchase advertising.
mercurio stated that he called yelp to inquire about why one of his competitors,known in the industry for its shotty sic work,had a high overall star rating.yelp allegedly responded that the competitor advertised and that yelp work s with your reviews if you advertise with us.later,when mercurio declined an offer to advertise on yelp,he alleges that w ithin minutes,a review was moved to the top of wheel techniques yelp review page as a threat to cause wheel techniques to fear that if it did not pay yelp money to advertise,the negative review would remain at the top of its yelp review page.
mercurio also alleged that he was told that a former yelp employee stated that yelp terminated a group of sales employees as a result of scamming related to advertising.the third amended complaint does not indicate who told mercurio this information,nor does it identify the yelp employee who allegedly made the original statement or of what the scamming related to advertising consisted.
tracy chan 
chan,a dentist,stated that she received calls from a yelp sales representative offer ing her lots of benefits,such as the opportunity to keep chan business ratings high by hiding or burying bad reviews,if she advertised with yelp.according to chan,the sales representative stated that although many yelp reviews were manipulated by a computer system,yelp employees also had the ability to remove reviews from a business yelp page.
chan initially declined to purchase advertising from yelp.two or three days after doing so,yelp removed nine star reviews from her page,causing her overall rating to drop from five to three stars.chan called yelp to ask about the decline in her overall rating,and was told that yelp tweaks the ratings every so often and that yelp could help her if she signed up for advertising services with yelp.chan alleged that yelp removed positive reviews as a threat to cause chan to fear that if she did not purchase advertising her business overall star rating would stay low.
o ut of fear of further manipulations,chan signed an advertising contract with yelp.according to chan,just days after signing the contract,her overall rating increased to stars and various five star reviews were reinstated by yelp.she believes the rating increase was the result of her agreeing to advertise with yelp.
several months later,a yelp sales agent asked chan whether she was interested in increasing her advertising purchase with yelp.when chan declined,she noticed that her reviews were again declining.that same month,chan cancelled her existing advertising contract with yelp.chan alleged that after she cancelled,yelp removed positive reviews and replaced them with negative reviews to cause chan to fear that if she did not pay yelp for advertising,yelp would continue to remove positive reviews from her page.
chan overall rating fluctuated over the next year and a half.she attributed dips in her rating to specific interactions with yelp.for example,chan stated that yelp removed several positive reviews,prompting her to post a negative review about yelp conduct on her yelp page.within two to three days,she alleged,yelp removed more positive reviews,causing her overall rating to fall to stars.over a year later,chan alleged that her overall rating fell again,this time from four stars to three and a half stars,when yelp removed six positive reviews from her page after she posted a negative review about yelp to her own website.chan asserted that the removal of positive reviews was done to induce her to pay for advertising to discourage her from posting negative information about yelp.
district court rulings 
the district court dismissed the business owners second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.with respect to the business owners claim that yelp conduct violated california ucl,the district court ruled that theories of extortion for failure to remove negative user reviews were covered by yelp immunity under the communications decency act of cda,c there were insufficient facts from which to infer that yelp authored or manipulated the negative reviews and ratings and there were insufficient factual allegations from which to infer communication of an extortionate threat.
after the business owners amended their complaint to fix these deficiencies,the district court again dismissed it for failure to state a claim.describing the allegations that yelp manufactures negative reviews as entirely speculative,the district court concluded that the third amended complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to support a conclusion that yelp authored content.even assuming yelp employees had authored reviews,the district court found only a mere possibility that yelp authored content to extort advertising payments.the district court further found that allegations based on yelp purported manipulation of content were immunized by the cda.the separate civil extortion and attempted civil extortion claims failed for the same reasons.
this appeal followed.
the business owners maintain that yelp attempted to extort and did extort advertising payments from them by wrongfully threatening them with economic loss.we hold that the business owners have failed to state a claim under california law on which relief can be granted.accordingly,we do not address yelp defense of immunity under the cda.
california unfair competition law 
california unfair competition law prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.cal.bus.i t establishes three varieties of unfair competition acts or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.cel tech commc ns,cellular,cal th,internal quotation marks omitted.
in prohibiting any unlawful business practice,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also davis hsbc bank,cir.the business owners premise their unlawful ucl claim on yelp allegedly extortionate conduct.
specifically,they allege that the following conduct amounts to extortion yelp manipulating reviews to induce them to buy advertising and yelp creating its own negative reviews of their businesses to induce them to buy advertising.they do not assert any claims based on failure to remove negative reviews of their businesses.
we conclude,first,that yelp manipulation of user reviews,assuming it occurred,was not wrongful use of economic fear,and,second,that the business owners pled insufficient facts to make out a plausible claim that yelp authored negative reviews of their businesses.accordingly,we agree with the district court that these allegations do not support a claim for extortion.
unlawful extortionate business practices 
we first consider whether the business owners have stated a claim of extortionate,and therefore unlawful,business practices under california ucl.
the hobbs act defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.b emphasis added.threats of economic harm made to obtain property from another,are not generally considered wrongful,where the alleged extortioner has a legitimate claim to the property obtained through such threats.brokerage concepts,healthcare,cir.therefore,unless a person has a preexisting right to be free of the threatened economic harm,threatening economic harm to induce a person to pay for a legitimate service is not extortion.see united states vigil,cir citing united states enmons,viacom intern.icahn.
enmons is the starting point for the interpretation of wrongful in the extortion statute.enmons held that the use of violence in a labor strike to obtain higher wages and other benefits did not constitute extortion under the hobbs act.id.at.in so holding,enmons explained that t he term wrongful,which modifies the use of each of the enumerated means of obtaining property actual or threatened force,violence,or fear would be superfluous if it only served to describe the means used.id.at.rather,wrongful limits the statute coverage to those instances where the obtaining of the property would itself be wrongful because the alleged extortionist has no lawful claim to that property.id.at.thus,enmons concluded that the hobbs act does not apply to the use of force to achieve legitimate labor ends.id.at.enmons reasoning created the claim of right defense to charges of extortion under the hobbs act.united states sturm,cir.
as to violent threats,we have declined to extend enmons beyond the context of a labor dispute,united states daane,cir,read ing enmons as holding only that the use of violence to secure legitimate collective bargaining objectives is beyond the reach of the hobbs act,united states thordarson,cir.we have also recognized that,aside from violence,some attempts to obtain property are so inherently wrongful that whether the defendant had a lawful claim to the property demanded is not relevant in determining whether extortion or attempted extortion has been proven.united states villalobos,cir.
though the defense has been limited in other contexts,see,it continues to apply to allegations of extortion involving threats of economic harm.so long as the alleged extortioner seeks payment for services that have some objective value,viacom.at,he has a lawful claim to the property obtained.brokerage concepts,at.consequently,barring any preexisting right to be free of the economic fear utilized on the part of the threatened party,united states tobin,cir,purely economic threats do not violate the hobbs act,see also george lussier,subaru of new england,cir.
in brokerage concepts,for example,the third circuit considered whether payments received by a health maintenance organization hmo were the product of extortion by wrongful use of economic fear.at.in that case,the hmo refused to approve a pharmacy branch application to join the hmo network of medical prescription providers unless the branch discontinued its contractual relationship with a particular health care consulting firm and gave its business to one of the hmo subsidiaries.id.the hmo also applied various negotiation tactics,such as auditing and putting a freeze on the pharmacy other locations,which had previously been approved to join the hmo network.id.at.eventually,the pharmacy branch acquiesced,dropped its existing healthcare consulting firm,and made payments to the hmo subsidiary.
recognizing the undoubted value of access to the hmo network,brokerage concepts concluded that the payments to the hmo subsidiary were not the product of extortion.id.at.no law prohibited the hmo from conditioning access to its network on such payments,and the pharmacy had no right to access the network.id.at.brokerage concepts therefore declined to interpret a mutually beneficial exchange of property between two private parties as the wrongful use of economic fear.id.
similarly,in sturm,the first circuit held that the term wrongful requires the government to prove,in cases involving extortion based on economic fear,that the defendant knew that he was not legally entitled to the property that he tried to obtain.at.insisting that hard bargaining does not amount to extortion,the seventh circuit has likewise concluded that w here the defendant has a claim of right to property and exerts economic pressure to obtain that property,that conduct is not extortion and no violation of the hobbs act has occurred.rennell rowe,cir see also united states capo,cir noting that fear of economic loss plays a role in many business transactions that are entirely legitimate and therefore the hobbs act reaches only the exploitation of the fear of economic loss in order to obtain property to which the exploiter is not entitled,vacated in part on other grounds,cir en banc.
as to what one may threaten to do in the economic context,rothman vedder park management,is instructive.cir.in that case,a group of tenants sued the owner and operator of a park,claiming the owner violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,by using extortionate tactics to induce them to sign leases.id.at.we considered,under both the hobbs act and california law,whether alleged threats that would have to pay their own utility bills and would be subject to future rent increases of undisclosed amounts were wrongful.id.at.
we concluded that these threats were not wrongful and therefore not extortionate.id.at.because the tenants did not allege that the park owner may not raise the rent of those who have not signed the lease or that it may not refuse to pay their utility bills,the tenants had no right to be free of such threats.id.moreover,although the park owner threatened to raise the rent,he had a right to condition use of his park on payment.id.the threats alleged did not,therefore,amount to extortion.id.in so holding,we relied on the general rule that what you may do in a certain event you may threaten to do,that is,give warning of your intention to do in that event,and thus allow the other person the chance of avoiding the consequences.id.quoting mckay retail auto.salesmen local union,cal d.
sosa directv,is similarly instructive,cir.in that case,we considered whether letters sent by directv constituted extortion within the meaning of the hobbs act and california law.id.at.we declined to adopt a broad construction of the hobbs act,noting that while i t is certainly possible,perhaps even likely,that the threat of being faced with a costly lawsuit induced fear in the plaintiffs,extortion requires more than fear.id.citing rothman,at.we emphasized that t he use of the fear must be wrongful.id.citing rothman,at.and,although the assertion of weak claims predicated on unsupportable factual allegations may be said in some sense to be wrongful,we rejected a reading of either the hobbs act or california extortion statute that would impose liability for threats of litigation where the asserted claims do not rise to the level of a sham.id.at 
like the hobbs act,california law states that e xtortion is the obtaining of property from another,with his consent induced by a wrongful use of force or fear.code emphasis added.california law also provides that f ear,such as will constitute extortion,may be induced by a threat t o do an unlawful injury to the person or property of the individual threatened,id.emphasis added,thus excluding fear induced by threat to do a lawful injury,people beggs,cal,see also in re nichols.accordingly,the elements of extortion under federal and california law are substantially the same.see sosa,at rothman,at.the plaintiffs here point to no pertinent distinctions between the federal and california statutes 
in sum,to state a claim of economic extortion under both federal and california law,a litigant must demonstrate either that he had a right to be free from the threatened harm,or that the defendant had no right to seek payment for the service offered.any less stringent standard would transform a wide variety of legally acceptable business dealings into extortion.
given these stringent requirements,the business owners in this case failed sufficiently to allege that yelp wrongfully threatened economic loss by manipulating user reviews.
to start,we note that there is no allegation that yelp directly threatened economic harm if the business owners refused to purchase advertising packages from yelp.while the lack of such express threats does not alone dispose of the extortion claims,see united states marsh,cir,it does make the business owners case considerably more difficult.absent explicit threats of economic harm,the business owners must allege sufficient facts to support the inference,in re century aluminum.sec,cir,that yelp inten ded to induce payment through the use of threats or the exploitation of economic fears,united states greger,cir.
we begin with chan,who alleges that yelp extorted her by removing positive reviews from her yelp page.chan asserts that she was deprived of the benefit of the positive reviews yelp users posted to yelp website,and that,had she received the benefits of the positive reviews,they would have counteracted the negative reviews other users posted.
but chan had no right to have positive reviews appear on yelp website.she alleges no contractual right pursuant to which yelp must publish positive reviews nor does any law require yelp to publish them.by withholding the benefit of these positive reviews,yelp is withholding a benefit that yelp makes possible and maintains.it has no obligation to do so,however.chan does not,and could not successfully,maintain that removal of positive reviews,by itself,violates anything other than yelp own purported practice.w hat yelp may do in a certain event yelp may threaten to do.rothman,at.moreover,chan does not allege that the advertising yelp sold her was a valueless sham,or that she was already entitled to the advertising privileges yelp induced her to buy.see viacom.at.we thus deal with a very narrow subset of the potential universe of extortion cases one involving solely the accusation of the wrongful use of economic fear where two private parties have engaged in a mutually beneficial exchange of property.brokerage concepts,at.
as chan alleges no independent barrier to the of which she complains,and as there is no allegation that yelp advertising services are,objectively,worthless,see viacom.at,any implicit threat by yelp to remove positive reviews absent payment for advertising was not wrongful within the meaning of the extortion statutes.
this conclusion is not entirely the end of the matter,as chan alleges that the ratings manipulation negatively affected her business reputation.but chan does not connect her claim of reputational harm to a specific allegation of wrongful conduct we note,too,that unl
