defendant buckeye rural electric cooperative,buckeye,a cooperative electrical utility,is the exclusive provider of electricity in nine counties in southeastern ohio.defendant buckeye electricity customers are members of the corporation and elect buckeye governing board of trustees.defendant frederick parker is buckeye vice president of finance.
in,while plaintiff was married to larry mays mays,mays sought electricity service from defendants.defendants supplied plaintiff and mays with a membership application form.describing itself as a joint use application,the form required husband and wife to complete it and provided separate lines for the signatures and social security numbers of applicant and spouse.mays signed as applicant and plaintiff signed as spouse.after accepting the application for service,defendants addressed electricity bills to larry e mays.
in october of,plaintiff filed for divorce from mays.mays then moved out of the couple home and into a camper located on the real estate.mays supplied electricity to the camper via extension cords connecting the camper with the home.while living in the camper,mays began neglecting work and failing to pay bills.by january of,the account serving the home and camper was in arrears and defendants disconnected electricity service.within a month,plaintiff secured a restraining order against mays and forced him to leave the property.plaintiff,who had never worked outside the home,then obtained gainful employment.
on march or,about two months after defendants disconnected service,plaintiff sought to establish an individual account with defendants and restore electricity to the home.plaintiff telephoned defendants and learned she could not restore service to the home until the entire outstanding balance on the disconnected account was satisfied.defendants later informed plaintiff she could obtain an individual account without satisfying the outstanding balance if she documented her separation or divorce from mays and documented mays individual responsibility for the disconnected account.
on september,plaintiff filed suit against defendants for discrimination on the basis of marital status in violation of the equal credit opportunity act ecoa,a,and provisions of regulation b of the ecoa,c and d,a,b,and c,and a,b,and d plaintiff also asserted a due process deprivation claim and claims arising under ohio statutes and common law,and sought certification of the litigation as a class action pursuant to.a and b.
on november,defendants moved to dismiss all of plaintiff claims pursuant to.b and b.on january,magistrate judge timothy hogan issued a report and recommendation regarding defendants dispositive motion.because plaintiff and defendants had filed evidentiary materials outside the pleadings,the magistrate judge treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to.the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff ecoa and due process claims,and declining to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff claims under ohio law pursuant to.the magistrate judge reasoned summary judgment was proper because the regulations plaintiff relied upon for the ecoa claims exempted defendants from compliance plaintiff could not assert claims arising out of signing an electricity service application in because the statute of limitations of f had run and defendants actions did not constitute state action for due process purposes.the magistrate judge did not address plaintiff motion for class certification.
on june,the district court issued an order adopting the recommendations of the magistrate judge.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss as to plaintiff claims arising under the ecoa,federal reserve board regulations,and due process,and dismissing without prejudice plaintiff claims arising under ohio statutes and common law.the district court did not rule on plaintiff motion for class certification.

ecoa claims 
the ecoa prohibits creditors from discriminating against any credit applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of race,color,religion,national origin,sex,or marital status.a.as an entity granting members the ability to defer payment of a debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor,defendant buckeye is a creditor within the meaning of the ecoa.d barney holzer clinic,cir quoting statutory definition of credit see also shaumyan sidetex,cir absent a right to defer payment for a monetary debt,property or services,the ecoa is inapplicable.the purpose of the ecoa is to eradicate credit discrimination waged against women,especially married women whom creditors traditionally refused to consider for individual credit.anderson united fin,cir citing markham colonial mortgage serv.
given the similar purposes of the ecoa and title vii,the system of federal employment discrimination law provides an analytical framework for claims of credit discrimination.see lewis acb bus,cir see also rosa park west bank trust,cir looking to title vii in construing the ecoa.but see latimore citibank fed.sav.bank,cir refusing to apply burdine mcdonnell framework to ecoa cases.under this analytical framework,plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of credit discrimination by showing plaintiff was a member of a protected class plaintiff applied for credit from defendants plaintiff was qualified for the credit and despite plaintiff qualification,defendants denied her credit application.see,matthiesen banc one mortgage,cir.
in concluding plaintiff could not establish a prima facie case of credit discrimination on the basis of marital status pursuant to this framework,the magistrate judge effectively focused on the absence of the first element plaintiff membership in a protected class.rather than directly stating plaintiff had failed to satisfy this element,however,the magistrate judge concluded that many of the federal reserve board regulations named in plaintiff complaint exempted defendants from compliance.in other words,plaintiff could not show she was a member of a protected class because the federal reserve board regulations establishing certain of her claims did not apply to defendants.specifically,the magistrate judge determined that defendants provide incidental credit as defined in c,and were therefore entitled to exemptions listed in c.summary judgment,the magistrate judge recommended,would be appropriate on plaintiff claims brought pursuant to regulations for which c provided compliance exemptions.the magistrate judge also recommended summary judgment on plaintiff statutory and regulatory claims outside the exemption provisions,concluding that the statute of limitations of f barred those claims.
although the magistrate judge addressed defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff claims in summary judgment terms,the district court,in adopting the magistrate judge recommendations,did not specifically grant summary judgment.instead,the district court characterized its order as granting defendants motion to dismiss as to plaintiff claims arising under federal law,and dismissing without prejudice plaintiff claims arising under state law.because the district court and the magistrate judge looked to materials beyond plaintiff complaint in ruling on defendant motion to dismiss,the district court dismissal of plaintiff claims amounted to granting summary judgment.see.b where district court considers matters outside the pleadings in ruling on a motion to dismiss,the district court should treat the motion as
