we are confronted here with issues concerning the scope of a guaranty given to secure the buyer obligations under a master agreement and various subsidiary agreements involving the purchase and sale of a motorcycle dealership.in addition,we address the circumstances under which the liability of the guarantor,by virtue of subsequent actions by the seller,may be exonerated.
granville and wanda warren the warrens,through their corporation,warren,warren,owned and operated a motorcycle dealership in salinas for approximately years.intending to retire,the warrens contacted a potential buyer,judson dabney,ii dabney,who owned a dealership in riverside.in november,warren and dabney executed various agreements to accomplish the sale of the salinas dealership,including a master asset purchase agreement agreement that incorporated by reference the other agreements.one of those agreements was a letter of guaranty guaranty signed by dabney,under which he covenant ed and agree d to guarantee the collection and receipt of all amounts required under section of the agreement,under the promissory note s,and under the lease.the agreement also provided that dabney could assign his rights and obligations as buyer to a corporation that he controlled,and that such assignment would relieve dabney of all obligations under the agreement.dabney assigned his rights under the agreement to monterey motorcycles,assignee or mmi.
assignee ultimately defaulted on its obligations under the agreement and the accompanying instruments,and the dealership was sold in august to a third party.warren brought suit against dabney.after a court trial based upon warren claim that dabney was liable under the guaranty for assignee obligations,a judgment was entered in favor of warren for the amount of.
on appeal,dabney contends that the court erred in finding him liable for and under the covenant not to compete agreement and two consulting agreements,respectively.he contends the guaranty did not cover the obligations under those three agreements that were signed by the parties at the time of the sale.dabney also argues that the court erred in finding him liable at all.he asserts that,by virtue of warren having agreed with assignee to extend the deadline for payments and having provided it with additional loans concessions to which dabney did not agree he was exonerated from any liability under the guaranty.
we conclude that the court erred in concluding that dabney was liable under the guaranty for assignee obligations under the covenant not to compete and two consulting agreements.we reject dabney other claim of error.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment and remand the case with instructions that the trial court enter a new and different judgment in favor of warren and against dabney in the amount of,plus interest,costs,and attorney fees.
procedural background 
warren alleged in the first amended complaint filed june,complaint,a single cause of action for breach of contract against dabney.it alleged that it entered into the agreement,as seller seller with dabney,as buyer buyer in november for the sale of its salinas motorcycle dealership for,plus additional consideration.that additional consideration included amounts provided under a lease of the dealership space,a covenant not to compete executed by the warrens,and separate consulting agreements signed by the warrens.warren alleged further in the complaint that the warrens assigned their respective interests in the consulting agreements to warren.the sale of the dealership closed escrow on or about march.warren alleged that the last payments on the obligations under the agreement and accompanying instruments occurred in august,and that dabney had failed and refused to make further payments that were owing.
although no formal amendment of the complaint appears in the record,warren proceeded to trial under the unpleaded theory that dabney was liable under the guaranty that secured assignee obligations under the agreement and accompanying instruments involved in the sale of the dealership.in its pretrial brief,warren noted that the guaranty was not attached to complaint,but that it would seek leave to amend the complaint at trial to conform to proof.further,at trial,counsel for warren stated that his client was seeking recovery under the guaranty of assignee obligations.dabney raised no objection to warren trial of the case under this theory of liability.and the parties respective briefs concerned only dabney potential liability under the guaranty.
after a court trial on september,and submission of the case to receive briefs,the court issued its tentative decision in favor of warren.it found dabney liable under the guaranty and rejected dabney affirmative defenses.formal judgment was later entered on january,awarding warren damages against dabney in the amount of,plus interest,costs of,and attorney fees according to proof in a separate proceeding.the monetary judgment was based upon the following components adduced through evidence presented by warren accountant promissory note,lease,covenant not to compete,consulting agreements,less escrow payment from subsequent sale of dealership.dabney appealed from the judgment.on april,a modified judgment was entered,reflecting the inclusion of an attorney fee award of in favor of warren.dabney thereafter filed a notice of appeal from the order after judgment identified as having been entered on the date of entry of the modified judgment 
discussion 
summary of relevant agreements 
in order to effectuate the sale of the motorcycle dealership,the parties entered into the agreement and various other instruments referenced in the agreement.hereafter,the agreement and other instruments referenced therein are referred to collectively as the purchase documents.although the precise date of execution of the purchase documents can not be gleaned from the record,it is apparent that they were signed by the parties in november.
the agreement provided in the opening paragraph that it was being entered into between warren,as seller,and dabney subject to assignment under section hereof to his designated corporation or other entity,as buyer.included among the recitals were that seller wished to sell,and buyer wished to buy the motorcycle dealership and that the parties also wished to enter into a lease where the dealership was located.
the agreement contained specific references to other instruments that were contemplated in the transaction,and the form of each instrument was attached to the agreement.the remaining agreements signed by the parties consisted of,inter alia,a promissory note in the amount of signed by dabney as maker a lease of the business premises signed by dabney as tenant,with monthly rent fixed at a covenant not to compete noncompete agreement signed by warren,as seller,the warrens,as principals,and dabney,as buyer,calling for dabney to pay the warrens per month for a term of five years total separate consulting agreements signed by granville and wanda warren,as consultants,and dabney,as buyer,calling for dabney to pay the warrens per month,each,for a term of five years total and a letter of guaranty signed by dabney.
ii.liability of dabney as principal 
before addressing dabney chief claims of error,we consider the question of dabney liability as the principal obligor under the purchase documents.a brief review of this issue is necessitated by the ambiguity created by the allegations of the complaint,as compared with the theory of the case presented by warren at trial.
dabney asserts in his opening brief that the case was tried and decided solely upon his alleged liability as surety under the guaranty.he contends that it was clear that he could not be held liable as a principal because any such liability was terminated by his assignment of the buyer rights to assignee,a proper assignment as contemplated under the terms of the agreement.
warren makes two arguments in its respondent brief in favor of dabney liability as a principal.first,it contends that there was no effective assignment by dabney to assignee relieving dabney of personal liability under the purchase documents.second,warren asserts that by the terms of the noncompete agreement,any assignment by dabney would not relieve him of personal liability under that agreement.these arguments fail for several reasons.
first,as noted above,although the case was initially pleaded as one for dabney liability as a principal under the purchase documents,the case was tried under the theory that he was liable as surety under the guaranty.this was confirmed on multiple occasions by counsel for warren when he stated toward the conclusion of the trial that warren was seeking recovery from dabney under the guaranty of assignee obligations did not contend at trial that dabney assignment of his rights as buyer to assignee was ineffective or that the terms of the noncompete agreement precluded dabney from assigning his rights thereunder to relieve himself of obligations as principal and limited his argument in his brief to dabney liability under the guaranty,stating that n otwithstanding the apparent assignment,dabney remained liable to warren by virtue of a written letter of guaranty.
moreover,contrary to warren assertion in its appellate brief,the trial court did not base its decision on dabney liability as principal under the purchase documents.instead,the court noted in its tentative decision that upon sale,the dealership was placed in a corporation formed by dabney and three others,changing the business name to mmi as a result of a later economic downturn,mmi defaulted on the required payments warren in the action sought recovery from dabney under the guaranty and that dabney defenses under the guaranty were without merit.warren is precluded from now asserting that the judgment should be affirmed based upon dabney liability as a principal.see beroiz wahl th,fn.plaintiff can not assert new theory of liability for the first time on appeal richmond dart industries,d,same.
second,at no time did warren assert below that dabney assignment of his rights as buyer to assignee was ineffective or that any assignment would not relieve dabney of obligations as principal under the noncompete agreement.warren has therefore forfeited these arguments.see in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,fn.
third,the contentions,in any event,lack merit.as to the assignment of the agreement,warren states conclusorily in respondent brief that dabney did not offer evidence of a signed,written assignment,as required.in the introductory paragraph,the agreement defined the buyer as judson dabney,ii subject to assignment under section hereof to his designated corporation or other entity.section provided in relevant part assignment.this agreement shall not be assignable by any party without the prior written consent of the other party provided,however,that buyer may assign its interests hereunder to any corporation or other entity in which buyer has a controlling interest whereupon that assignee shall automatically and without need for consent or approval of any other party become the buyer,with the assignor buyer being fully and completely relieved of any obligation or duty hereunder.contrary to warren assertion,there was no requirement under section that the contemplated assignment by dabney be in writing or delivered to the seller.further,wanda warren testified that she understood that dabney had assigned his rights under the agreement to assignee,mmi had along with her husband signed a bill of sale in which the buyer was identified as mmi had accepted payments from mmi and had no objection to such assignment.
as to the assignability of the noncompete agreement,warren argues on appeal that any such assignment would not relieve dabney of liability as a principal.it cites to section of the noncompete agreement as expressly prohibiting its assignment by the buyer.section provided in part no party may assign duties and benefits hereunder this agreement shall be binding upon,and shall inure to the benefit of,the parties to it and their respective heirs,legal representatives,successors,assigns.but warren argument ignores the fact that the preamble of the noncompete agreement identified the buyer as insert judson dabney ii or designated assignee entity.this description was consistent with the preamble of the agreement in which,as noted above,the buyer was identified as dabney,subject to the assignment provisions of section of the agreement.reading the two agreements together,it is plain that section of the noncompete agreement prohibited only further assignments by buyer after the contemplated assignment by dabney to an entity he controlled,as specified in the agreement.
accordingly,there is no basis for warren contention here that dabney remained liable as principal under the various purchase documents.
iii.challenge to judgment based on guaranty liability 
dabney asserts two claims of error with respect to the trial court imposition of liability under the guaranty.first,he argues that the judgment included liability for three obligations under the purchase and sale transaction that were not subject to the guaranty,namely,the obligations under the noncompete agreement and the two consulting agreements.second,he contends that the court erred in imposing any liability at all,because any undertaking he assumed under the guaranty to satisfy the obligations of the principal buyer was exonerated as a result of the seller alteration of the principal obligations without dabney consent.we address these two arguments below.
judgment exceeded scope of guaranty 
the second paragraph of the guaranty provided in relevant part dabney covenant s and agree s to guarantee,in favor of the warrens and warren,the collection and receipt of all amounts to be paid under sic by buyer under section of the agreement,the maker obligations under the promissory note s,and the tenant under the lease.section of the agreement provided that t he consideration to be paid by buyer for the purchased assets is the sum the purchase price of the following section went on to list monetary payments based upon specific formulae or assigned values for six categories of assets,namely,a new motorcycles b used motorcycles c goodwill,proprietary rights,and other intangible assets d fixed assets,equipment,and miscellaneous supplies e motorclothes,parts,accessories,boutique items,merchandise,and miscellaneous inventory and f.section of the agreement did not identify any other assets or items that comprised the purchase price.
dabney contends that the guaranty,by its specific terms,embraced only particular obligations of the principal buyer under the various purchase documents.he argues that,simply stated,since the noncompete and consulting agreements were not mentioned,the obligations thereunder were not secured by the guaranty.warren responds that the guaranty included all obligations under the purchase documents because the goodwill of the business that was referenced in section of the agreement included amounts that were allocated in the sale to payments under the noncompete and consulting agreements the agreement adopted and incorporated by reference all instruments signed in connection with the sale and the warrens understood that the payments made by buyer under the agreement and accompanying instruments including the noncompete and consulting agreements were all part of one purchase price for the dealership.
a surety or guarantor is one who promises to answer for the debt,default,or miscarriage of another civ.code.a guarantor or surety can not be held beyond the express terms of his contract.bloom bender cal d,bloom.but a contract of a surety or guarantor is to be interpreted by the same rules used in construing other types of contracts,with a view towards effectuating the purposes for which the contract was designed.citations.citations.leasing,supra,cal d at,quoting bloom,at see also.
accordingly,in determining the scope of the guaranty here,we invoke familiar principles for the interpretation of contracts.the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting.civ.code,citation.when a contract is reduced to writing,the parties intention is determined from the writing alone,if possible.the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.civ.code,citation.founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th,founding members.contract formation is governed by objective manifestations,not the subjective intent of any individual involved.citations.the test is what the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe.citation.citation.allen smith th.thus,t he parties undisclosed intent or understanding is irrelevant to contract interpretation.citations.founding members,at.
the guaranty on its face secured only specified obligations assumed by the buyer in the purchase and sale transaction.in the instrument,dabney guaranteed the collection and receipt of all amounts to be paid by the buyer under the purchase price as defined in section of the agreement,under the promissory note,and under the lease agreement.as noted,the elements of the purchase price described in section of the agreement consisted of specific amounts paid for new and used motorcycles,inventory,fixed assets,equipment,supplies,merchandise and accessories,and goodwill,proprietary rights and other intangible assets.in another section of the agreement section,provisions were made for the buyer to undertake additional obligations over a term by signing four separate instruments a lease,noncompete agreement,and two consulting agreements in the aggregate.and the parties apparent intention to identify in the agreement the obligations under the purchase price as being separate and apart from the buyer other obligations was demonstrated in section there,the buyer obligation to furnish the purchase price section b was listed separately from the obligations to provide the signed lease,noncompete agreement,and consulting agreements section c e.
further,the guaranty is described in the agreement in one subsection as a personal guaranty of the promissory note executed by judson dabney,ii in the form of exhibit hereto.italics added.and the agreement identified as one of the conditions precedent to the buyer obligations as the execution of a lease agreement in a form attached to the agreement and personally guarantied by judson dabney,ii in the form and content of exhibit hereto.these descriptions of the guaranty and the omission in the agreement of any reference to the guaranty as securing the buyer obligations under the noncompete or consulting agreements constitute further evidence of the parties mutual intention,as expressed in the purchase documents,that the guaranty was limited to specific obligations of the buyer.had the parties intended the guaranty to embrace the obligations of the buyer under these three agreements,they could have easily so provided.stephenson drever cal th,under the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius,fact that contract expressly provided a consequence to follow from an event tend ed to negate any inference that the parties also intended another consequence to flow from the same event.
but warren argues that the mutual intentions of the parties and the circumstances under which the purchase documents were executed show that the guaranty was intended to embrace the obligations under the noncompete agreement and consulting agreements.it adverts to the testimony of wanda warren that the parties relied on their respective accountants to structure the transaction to their mutual tax advantage the warrens did really retain an attorney,but had an attorney look at the purchase documents after they were prepared by dabney attorney she understood that the consideration to be paid by the buyer under the consulting agreements was part of the purchase price and she and her husband thought it would be prudent to obtain the guaranty.warren asserts further that dabney,in his testimony,did not contradict wanda warren testimony concerning her understanding of the transaction.
we note that the language of the contract governs its interpretation when it is clear and explicit,when it does not involve an absurdity.and,generally speaking,the parties intentions are to be ascertained from the contract language alone,where possible.extrinsic evidence is admissible to interpret the instrument,but not to give it a meaning to which it is not reasonably susceptible citations,and it is the instrument itself that must be given effect.parsons bristol development cal d,see also pacific gas thomas drayage rigging cal d,extrinsic evidence admissible to explain contract not because contract language is clear on its face but when it is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.here,the language of the guaranty is clear and explicit and on its face bears the meaning dabney ascribes to it,namely,that he,as guarantor,agreed to stand behind the buyer obligations under section of the agreement,the consideration comprising the purchase price,the promissory note,and the lease.and while one may envision a sale of a business structured differently so that the party issuing a guaranty might agree specifically to stand behind all obligations undertaken by the buyer,the language in this instance guaranteeing only certain obligations does not involve an absurdity.ibid.
further,while warren urges based in part upon wanda warren testimony as to her understanding that the parties mutually intended that the guaranty include the buyer obligations under the noncompete and consulting agreements,the objective intent,as shown by the words of the document,rather than the subjective intent of one of the parties,controls.founding members,supra,th at see also winet price th,fn.evidence of the undisclosed subjective intent of the parties is irrelevant to determining the meaning of contractual language.thus,c ontract formation is governed by objective manifestations,not subjective intent of any individual involved.citations.the test is what the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe.citation.roth malson th.thus,the fact that the warrens may have subjectively intended or believed that the guaranty would secure all obligations of the buyer where that intention or belief was not disclosed to dabney is of no consequence in construing the guaranty.
but warren contends that under the plain meaning of the agreement,the goodwill of the business,as referred to in section,includes the compensation allocated to the noncompete and consulting agreements.we acknowledge that,practically speaking,there is a close connection between the transfer of goodwill in the sale of a business and a covenant not to compete obtained from the seller.as has been explained c ourts may enforce nonsolicitation covenants barring the seller from soliciting the sold business employees and customers.citation.these covenants prevent the seller from unfairly depriving the buyer of the full value of its acquisition,including its goodwill.citations.a covenant not to solicit the sold business employees and customers prevents the seller from eroding the very goodwill it sold,while allowing the seller otherwise to pursue its chosen business with whatever employees and customers it can attract.citation.strategix,infocrossing west,th.nothing in either the agreement or guaranty,however,suggests that the buyer compensation of the seller under the noncompete agreement was one of the obligations secured under the guaranty.thus,there is no support for warren bare statement that the goodwill include d the compensation allocated to the noncompete and consulting agreements.to the contrary,there is no reference in section c of the agreement in which the buyer agreed to an allocation of of the purchase price to goodwill,proprietary rights and other intangible assets to payments under the noncompete and consulting agreements that are described elsewhere in the agreement.
lastly,we reject warren argument that because the agreement incorporated by reference the remaining purchase documents,the business had one purchase price,allocated among several contracts,including the noncompete and consulting agreements.as mentioned,the purchase price was specifically described in sectio
