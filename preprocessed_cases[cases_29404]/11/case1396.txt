defendant fulton county,georgia,concerned about the secondary effects on its communities of the mixture of alcohol and live nude dancing,passed an ordinance in prohibiting the sale,possession,and consumption of alcohol in adult entertainment establishments.plaintiffs flanigan enterprises,owner and operator of the mardi gras strip club,and other owners and operators of strip clubs in fulton county brought this first amendment challenge to the ordinance,arguing that the ordinance infringed on their right to free speech.the district court,concluding that the ordinance failed to further an important governmental interest,granted summary judgment and awarded damages to flanigan.the county now appeals the judgment and flanigan on several issues not reached by the district court.
this is the second time that we have been asked to consider a first amendment challenge to a fulton county ordinance proscribing the sale of alcohol at adult clubs.the county had passed a similar ordinance in,but this court struck it down,reasoning that the county had ignored the most relevant evidence in enacting the regulation.see flanigan,of fulton county,cir.this case is different.this time around,the county relied on ample statistical,surveillance,and anecdotal evidence,the live testimony of the chief of police and the chief judge of the juvenile court,among others,and dozens of foreign studies,all of which support the county efforts to curb the negative secondary effects of alcohol and live nude dancing in its communities.we are satisfied that the county reliance on this factual foundation was reasonable,and because we determine that the ordinance furthers an important governmental interest,we reverse.
the essential facts presented in this summary judgment record are these the plaintiffs in this consolidated enterprises,flanigan roswell road,roswell harry freese fannies,william parks,and ceeda enterprises,ceeda collectively,the clubs are owners and operators of strip clubs in fulton county,georgia.the clubs they operate include mardi gras,flashers,fannies,and riley restaurant and lounge riley.these clubs sell and serve alcohol,and feature live nude dancing on the premises.
in,fulton county began to investigate the impact of strip clubs within its borders on crime and property values in the surrounding communities.the county board of commissioners directed the police department to study the issue,which the department did.the resulting police investigation,which considered two and a half years of statistical data,revealed no relationship between alcohol,nude dancing,and crime.in fact,the report suggested that crime was a greater problem in and around bars which did not feature live nude dancing.in response to the county investigation,the strip clubs commissioned a study of their own,which revealed that there was no relationship between the strip clubs and reduced property values in fulton county.
the county investigation continued.it,too,commissioned a study on property values in the area,which confirmed the finding of the clubs the clubs had no impact on the property values in the surrounding areas.the county also directed its staff to collect a number of studies on the impact of strip clubs in other american cities.these foreign studies,which considered the impact of clubs in austin,indianapolis,minneapolis,and los angeles,concluded that strip clubs were indeed a blight on the surrounding communities.
the county held two public meetings to review the results of its investigation.despite the three local and recent studies indicating no relationship between the clubs,crime,or reduced property values,the county relied on the foreign studies indicating a correlation.as a result,on december,the board of commissioners passed an ordinance forbidding the service and consumption of alcohol in facilities featuring adult entertainment.
the strip clubs sued,and a panel of this court determined that the ordinance violated the first amendment of the constitution.relying on united states,d,the court observed that the county was not required to perform empirical studies,but,having done so,the board could not ignore the results.flanigan,of fulton county,cir internal citation omitted.
after this court struck down the first ordinance,the board commissioned two more studies.the first of these studies,called adult and entertainment establishments statist i cal analysis from to,conducted by the fulton county police department,and completed in march march report or adult and entertainment establishments statistical analysis,reviewed police data from january to december.it found that adult entertainment establishment s which served alcoholic beverages did not have a significant impact on the police department as it relates to an increase in calls for police service,nor an increase in crime as a secondary e ffect.moreover,the march report concluded that bars without nude dancing had higher crime rates than those bars with nude dancing.
the second of the studies commissioned by the county was completed in july july report,made a variety of findings,and reached a different result.titled report on fulton county adult entertainment businesses,it described operation summit up,a sweep conducted by the fulton county police department in september.the sting operation,which focused on an industrial area in which the strip clubs fannies,riley and babes were located,resulted in arrests and convictions.of the total charges filed,were for prostitution and other crimes,and were for crimes.
the report featured photographic evidence chronicling the same industrial area,and stated that the area was marked by dilapidated buildings,streets in disrepair,and cheap hotels catering to prostitutes and johns.an affidavit from patrick stafford,executive director of the fulton industrial business association,further described the hotels,stating that t hey rent locally,engage in cash transactions with customers,and rent hourly or for portions of days,and that their exteriors are characterized by parking lots,lack of lighting in parking lots,lack of security in parking lots,pandering and general unsafe conditions.
notably,the july report contained an extensive discussion of south fulton precinct beats and,and,in particular,a one of land within them called grid.grid contains three of the nude clubs,fannies,riley,and babes.the report stated that,from to,beats and accounted for a disproportionately high amount of crime within the south fulton precinct,and that grid contributed to more than its fair share of crime within those two beats.the report noted that beats and saw an increase in crime during the evening hours,even though most businesses in the area operated during standard business hours.the report also compared incident data from six strip clubs,five of which served alcohol and one of which did not but allowed customers to bring their own the byob club.it showed that,from to,the byob club accounted for only fifteen of the reported incidents,or.
the report described in great detail the results of surveillance operations conducted by the fulton county police during may and june of.the surveillance conducted at the adult clubs which served alcohol revealed a number of criminal violations and arrests the report states,however,that no violations were observed,and no arrests were made,at the byob club.
the report also presented what it described as anecdotal evidence.an affidavit from the honorable nina hickson,presiding judge for the juvenile court of fulton county,described how some of the girls who had appeared before her in her two years as presiding judge had worked in the adult clubs and had performed sexual acts in their parking lots.some of these girls got work at private parties,where they performed sexual acts.judge hickson also reported her belief that adult entertainment clubs are a burden on the juvenile justice system.the july report also contained excerpts from a number of newspaper articles from to describing the strip clubs and their negative impact on the community.the articles discuss the clubs,crime,child prostitution,and the prosecution at the gold club,an area club of ill repute now closed.
appended to the july report were a number of foreign studies,which considered data from and the experiences of a variety of american cities.in particular,the july report included a summary produced by the national law center for children and families nlc of studies of the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses across america the studies tended to show that businesses,including strip clubs and adult book stores,had harmful secondary effects on their surrounding communities.specifically,the foreign studies documented increased crime rates and reduced property values in the neighborhoods near strip clubs.in fact,of the studies discussed in the nlc that had not been presented to this court when we reviewed the county earlier ordinance in flanigan enterprises,of georgia fulton county,georgia,cir thirteen of them suggested that there was a correlation between adult clubs and depressed property values 
for instance,the nlc report summarized the results of a study of sexually oriented businesses in adams county.it concluded that there was a clearly demonstrated rise in crime and violence,and an increase in the attraction to transients to the area as a result of nude entertainment establishments.in particular,the adams county crime statistics showed that,in one area featuring two adult establishments,of all crimes occurring in were linked to the adult businesses,and half involved alcohol.in another area featuring five adult businesses,of crimes committed in involved alcohol.
a study of sexually oriented businesses in phoenix,found that the number of sex offenses was greater in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses were located.these sex crimes included indecent exposure,rape,lewd and lascivious behavior,and child molestation.property crimes and violent crimes were elevated as well and,respectively.a study conducted in new york showed that concentration of sexually oriented businesses had resulted in significant negative impacts,including economic decline,decreased property values,and deterrence of customers,and significantly increased crime incidence.likewise,the newport news study,conducted in,drew this conclusion when adjusted for population differences,the study area had higher police calls and higher crimes than the control area.
the july report also reproduced two foreign studies in their entirety,both of which had been summarized in the nlc report.the first of these studies considered houston in and made a variety of findings.it stated that lewd behavior and sexual contact was occurring at adult entertainment establishments,but that much of the criminal activity was obscured by secluded areas,dim lighting,and private rooms.moreover,the houston police had difficulty investigating crime in the clubs because the refusal of undercover vice officers to engage in inappropriate behavior such as removing their clothing led strip club employees to assume that they were dealing with the police,thereby curtailing any ongoing or pending criminal behavior.
the other complete foreign study considered ellicottville,ellicottville did not have any adult businesses in,but the town decided to take a preemptive approach to try to maintain the character of the community as a family oriented recreation destination and stave off the negative secondary effects associated with adult businesses.after surveying a variety of other jurisdictions the ellicottville study concluded that the negative secondary effects of adult businesses include d crime,decreased market values,public resentment,a general blighting of the commercial district and a negative influence upon community character.the report recommended adopting zoning amendments in order to keep the adult businesses out.
on july,fulton county held another public hearing at which it received the july report,and heard live testimony.george coleman,the chief of police,testified,largely summarizing the criminal findings contained in the july report.he concluded investigation conducted by the fulton county police department ha s resulted in the documentation of various criminal activities occurring both inside and in the outer vicinity of the adult entertainment establishments located within unincorporated fulton county.judge hickson likewise summarized material from the report,concluding,we are seeing a number of our children involved in the illicit activities through the adult entertainment industry where there is alcohol served and that it does have a negative impact upon the juveniles that i seeing in my court on a regular basis.patrick stafford testified about the impact of the clubs on the business district.he said of the strip clubs,
they are not productive.they are helping us.the alcoholic beverages served in those establishments lead to secondary approaches to those folks going and doing criminal activity.those folks moving on and doing things in hotels that accept lots of cash.stop those predators.help our image.help the existing businesses.help enhance the area of economic vitality.help this county by passing this resolution.
the county then heard testimony from two county residents in support of the ordinance.eva galantos stated that she had lived with an abomination of one of these clubs in the heart of sandy springs for more years than i care to recall,and graddie tucker said that the proposed ordinance was a long time coming.two lawyers from a pair of clubs one of which is a plaintiff in this action then spoke out against the ordinance.
the county,on august,passed a resolution to adopt the adult entertainment establishment ordinance at issue today.the resolution contained a number of findings.it stated that nudity and sexual conduct and depiction thereof,coupled with alcohol in public places,encourages undesirable behavior and is not in the interest of public health,safety and welfare.elaborating,the county found that public nudity and depictions thereof,under certain circumstances,begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions such as community blight and property deterioration.in support of this proposition,it cited the testimony received at the public hearing,the july report,the findings incorporated in a number of court cases and the experience of other urban counties and municipalities.the board further found that,included 
among the undesirable community conditions identified with live nude entertainment are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood,increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order,and an increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior.
the board adopted the ordinance,which provided,among other things,that n o alcoholic beverages of any kind shall be sold,possessed or consumed on the premises of an adult entertainment establishment.fulton county,code 
on november,flanigan,roswell,freese,fannies,and parks sued the county and its commissioners in the northern district of georgia under,seeking injunctive relief,a declaratory judgment,damages,and fees.they asserted that this ordinance,like the earlier version,violated their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments of the constitution.ceeda sued the county as well,and the cases were consolidated in february of.
the defendant commissioners moved for summary judgment,asserting absolute and qualified immunity.the court determined that the commissioners were entitled to absolute legislative immunity without reaching the question of qualified immunity and granted the motion.see order at,flanigan,of fulton county.
the defendant county also moved for summary judgment,and in an order on april,the district court denied the motion.relying on flanigan and,it held that the ordinance did not further an important governmental interest.see order at,flanigan,of fulton county.specifically,it found that the march report,which found no relationship between the clubs and crime,was t he most probative evidence regarding the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.id.at.the court noted,conversely,that the july report was filled with extensive anecdotal evidence.id.at.it therefore concluded that it was unreasonable to ignore the most relevant local study in favor of a less comprehensive study and foreign studies.id.at.because the court denied the defense motion under,it did not address the plaintiffs other arguments as to why the ordinance is unconstitutional.id.at.
the district court also criticized the behavior of the county.it stated,the court is somewhat skeptical of these investigations in which the police officers are no doubt aware of the defendant desired result.it is unclear whether the police investigations on the two dates in may and june were conducted only after the march study failed to achieve the desired result.id.at.it further chastised the county for its failure to disclose the march report the court is somewhat troubled by the fact that it appears that this report was withheld from the plaintiffs until less than one week prior to the date on which the vote on the ordinance was scheduled.id.at.
the plaintiffs subsequently moved for summary judgment,and the district court,stating that it saw no reason to change its view of the case,granted the motion.see order at,flanigan,of fulton county,wl.it again said that it would not address the plaintiff other arguments as to why the ordinance was unconstitutional.see id.at.the court subsequently awarded damages to the clubs.order at,flanigan,of fulton county.

nude dancing is a form of expression protected by the first amendment.see krueger city of pensacola,cir flanigan,at.to determine what level of scrutiny applies,we must decide whether the state regulation is related to the suppression of expression.if the governmental purpose in enacting the regulation is unrelated to the suppression of expression,then the regulation need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny under.flanigan,at citing city of erie pap,d.

the fulton county ordinance considered today does not prohibit nude dancing.rather,it prohibits the sale,possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of an adult entertainment establishment.fulton county,code.the ordinance is content neutral and its enactment is unrelated to the suppression of speech.we,therefore,subject it to intermediate review under united states,d.under,an ordinance is valid if it serves a substantial interest within the power of the government the ordinance furthers that interest the interest served is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and there is no less restrictive alternative.flanigan,at citing,at.

in their resolution to adopt the ordinance,the board of commissioners eleven times discussed the negative secondary effects of live nude dancing moreover,the ordinance itself states its purpose in the preamble 
the purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments with the intention that,through this ordinance,many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values and on the public health,safety,and welfare of the county,and on its citizens and property,and on the character of its neighborhoods and development,will be curtailed prevented this article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
fulton county,code.without question,fulton county passed this ordinance out of a concern over the secondary effects of alcohol and live nude dancing on the community.these effects are,specifically,increased criminal activity,decreased property values,and urban blight and decay generally.it is undeniable that the government has a substantial interest in curtailing such effects.
the third prong of the unrelated to the suppression of free easily met.both this court and the supreme court have expressly held that an ordinance focusing on the secondary effects associated with the combination of nude dancing and alcohol consumption is unrelated to the suppression of free expression.flanigan,at citing pap,at,and wise,unified gov t of county,cir.as the prior analysis demonstrates,this ordinance focuses on the secondary effects associated with alcohol and live nude dancing.moreover,the board of commissioners said that it was not its intent to deny to any person the right to speech or expression protected by the united states or georgia constitutions,nor is it the intent to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented performance or materials protected by the united states or georgia constitutions.the ordinance itself states this article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression.fulton county,code.the ordinance is,therefore,unrelated to the suppression of free expression.
the fourth least restrictive easily met as well.because the ordinance targets only adult entertainment establishments where alcohol is consumed,it is sufficiently narrow to meet the test the ordinance does not prohibit all nude dancing,but only restricts nude dancing in those locations where the unwanted secondary effects arise.wise,at cited in flanigan,at.
we focus our analysis,then,on the second prong of the the ordinance furthers the governmental interest.to meet the furtherance prong,a municipality must have some factual basis for the claim that adult entertainment in establishments serving alcoholic beverages results in increased criminal activity and other undesirable community conditions.flanigan,at alteration in original quoting grand faloon tavern,wicker,cir.the government must show that the articulated concern had more than merely speculative factual grounds,and that it was actually a motivating factor in the passage of the legislation.krueger,at citations omitted.
the factual basis may come from a number of places.a city need not conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities,so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.daytona grand,at quoting alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.although a municipality must rely on at least some evidence,such evidence can consist of a municipality own findings,evidence gathered by other localities,or evidence described in a judicial opinion.id.quoting lounge of bradenton,manatee county,cir see also city of erie pap,d plurality opinion discussing the role of prior legal opinions in an analysis.governments are also empowered to rely on their own wisdom and common sense,sammy of mobile,city of mobile,cir,cert.denied,d,and c ommon sense indicates that any form of nudity coupled with alcohol in a public place begets undesirable behavior.id.alteration in original quoting state liquor auth.bellanca,d.
while a governmental entity need not support its regulations with voluminous data,it may not rely on shoddy data or reasoning and its evidence must fairly support its rationale.lounge,at alteration in original citing alameda books,at.plurality opinion see also daytona grand,at.nevertheless,a necdotal evidence is not shoddy per se.daytona grand,at.
in order to establish that secondary effects pose a threat,the city need not conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.flanigan,at alteration in original quoting pap,at.however,if a governmental entity does perform empirical studies,it can not later ignore the results.id.at.
ultimately,the test hinges on the reasonableness of the government regulation in light of the available evidence our own cases demonstrate that we require some reasonable justification for legislation which suppresses,albeit incidentally,protected expression.id.at citing sammy,at,and wise,at.the test requires deference to the reasoned judgment of a governmental entity a city must have latitude to experiment,at least at the outset,and very little evidence is required.daytona grand,at quoting alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.
a plurality of the supreme court has directed that local legislatures receive this latitude because deference 
is the product of a careful balance between competing interests.on the one hand,we have an obligation to exercise independent judgment when first amendment rights are implicated.on the other hand,we must acknowledge that the governmental entity is in a better position than the judiciary to gather and evaluate data on local problems.
alameda books,at.plurality opinion citations and quotation marks omitted.as justice kennedy stated in the controlling opinion,t he los angeles city council knows the streets of los angeles better than we do.it is entitled to rely on that knowledge and if its inferences appear reasonable,we should not say there is no basis for its conclusion.id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment citations omitted.in the end,o ur review is designed to determine whether the city rationale was a reasonable one,and even if the plaintiff demonstrates that another conclusion was also reasonable,we can not simply substitute our own judgment for the city.daytona grand,at.
with these legal principles in mind,and affording proper deference to the county expertise on the nature of problems confronting its communities and its citizens,we consider the constitutionality of the fulton county ordinance.we conclude that it was reasonable for the county to rely on the voluminous evidence before the many findings of the july report,the numerous foreign studies appended to it,and the live testimony of the chief of police and the chief judge of the juvenile that the ordinance therefore survives intermediate scrutiny.
the report was full of evidence of crime occurring around the county strip clubs.thus,for example,operation summit up,described in the report,established that the areas surrounding the strip clubs are rife with sex and drug crimes.over a period in,county police made arrests.these arrests arose from total charges,including for crimes and for crimes.and from the arrests,prosecutors secured convictions.similarly,the report discussion of beats and shows that those beats accounted for a disproportionate amount of crime in the precinct,and that grid,which contains three of the strip clubs,made for a disproportionate amount of crime in those two beats.moreover,the surveillance operations suggest strongly that crime did occur at the clubs themselves.
the report also described the impact of the clubs on the county youth.the hickson affidavit discussed how many prostituted girls worked in the clubs and performed sex acts for money around the clubs and at private parties.the strip clubs,according to judge hickson,in addition to contributing to the sexual exploitation of these underage girls,also imposed a burden on the judicial system when the girls were brought before the juvenile court.
the report also addressed the negative secondary effects of the clubs in a context.the stafford affidavit,along with the accompanying photographs,suggest that the areas around the clubs are indeed blighted.the image created is one of deterioration and neglect,an urban landscape dominated by cheap hotels catering to the sex trade.the newspaper articles further portrayed adult entertainment establishments as a drag on property values,neighborhood development,and community safety.
completing the july report were the foreign studies.all told,fulton county considered the experiences of thirty american jurisdictions.these foreign studies,summarized by the nlc and in two cases reproduced in their entirety by the county,painted a moribund picture of the adult business and the communities surrounding them.they told of crime,disease,violence,blight,and depressed property values.
the plaintiff clubs argue,nevertheless,that the principal thesis of the july the mixture of alcohol and nude dancing leads to undercut by the march report,which found that crime was a greater problem at bars without nude dancing.yet the the di
