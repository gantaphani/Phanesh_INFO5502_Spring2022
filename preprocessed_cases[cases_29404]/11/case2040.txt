we decide two issues in this case whether a noteholder must take affirmative steps towards foreclosure,in addition to serving a debtor with notice of acceleration,to effectively accelerate a note secured by real property and thereby trigger limitations and whether the texas or the federal statute of limitation applies to the noteholder claim in this case.
holy cross church of god in christ sued johnny wolf seeking a declaratory judgment that the texas limitations statute barred wolf foreclosure of the church property.the trial court granted the church summary judgment on that ground.the court of appeals held that an optional acceleration clause can not be effectively exercised without the noteholder taking specific affirmative steps towards foreclosure.because the church did not present evidence that wolf predecessor had taken these affirmative steps,the court of appeals reversed the summary judgment,concluding that the church did not carry its burden of proving conclusively when wolf cause of action accrued.for this reason,the court did not reach the question of whether the or statute of limitations applied.
we hold that,absent evidence of abandonment or a contrary agreement between the parties,a clear and unequivocal notice of intent to accelerate and a notice of acceleration is enough to conclusively establish acceleration and therefore accrual.thus,we conclude the church did conclusively prove when the church note was accelerated,and consequently,when wolf cause of action accrued.we also conclude that the texas limitations period applies here.we hold that the fdic limitations period only enures to a subsequent noteholder benefit if a claim accrues on the note before the fdic transfers the note.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for the church.
background 
in june,holy cross church executed a,promissory note payable to wynnewood bank and secured by a deed of trust on its south dallas church property.wynnewood bank failed and continental bank succeeded it.continental bank also eventually failed and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic became its receiver and holder of the church note.while the fdic held the church note,the church could not make its monthly payment but paid a month to show good faith.the fdic and the church agreed to settle the note for.the church was unable to pay this amount on the due date.however,even though the church remained in default,the fdic did not accelerate the note.the fdic then sold the note to mortgage investment trust corporation mitc.
on july,mitc sent the church a notice of default and intent to accelerate.on august,and again on september,mitc sent the church letters indicating it had accelerated the note.both letters specified dates for nonjudicial foreclosure sales.but mitc never actually foreclosed and the church did not resume payments.on august,mitc sold the note to great plains capital corporation.finally,on february,great plains sold the note to johnny wolf.
on february,wolf attorney sent the church a letter informing it that wolf now owned the note and that the note was in default.on july,wolf attorney sent another letter stating that the maturity of the aforesaid note has occurred and full payment of the balance of same is now due and owing.on september,wolf attorney sent a notice of foreclosure on the promissory note explaining a foreclosure sale was scheduled for october.on the sale date,a trial court granted the church a temporary injunction to prevent the sale.nevertheless,the trustee held the sale and wolf purchased the property.
the church sued wolf for a declaratory judgment that the foreclosure sale was void because limitations barred wolf foreclosure.the church also pleaded wrongful foreclosure,unjust enrichment,and constructive trust but later nonsuited these claims without prejudice.the parties then agreed to a temporary injunction.subsequently,the church moved for summary judgment,arguing that mitc august,demand and acceleration triggered the limitations period on wolf claim.thus,the church argued,limitations had run on august,almost two months before the foreclosure sale.
in response,wolf agreed that limitations began to run on august.however,he argued that because the fdic had once owned the note,the limitations period afforded federal receivers applied rather than the texas period.he filed a for summary judgment,contending that limitations did not bar the foreclosure because the federal statute applied.he also argued the church lacked standing to sue,but he abandons that argument here.see.f.the trial court granted the church motion on limitations grounds,declared the church obligations under the deed and note,declared the sale void,and ordered the church vested with fee simple title to the property.
wolf appealed,arguing that the federal limitations period governed his claim.the court of appeals did not reach the limitations issue.instead,the court concluded that a fact question existed about when wolf claim accrued.thus,it held that the trial court erroneously granted the church motion and reversed and remanded the claims.at,wl.

summary of review 
a party moving for summary judgment must conclusively prove all elements of its cause of action or defense as a matter of law.civ.c,steel,walker harris.when both sides move for summary judgment and the trial court grants one motion but denies the other,the reviewing court should review both sides summary judgment evidence,determine all questions presented,and render the judgment that the trial court should have rendered.fm props.operating city of austin.a party moving for summary judgment on limitations grounds must prove when the cause of action accrued.burns thomas.

if a note or deed of trust secured by real property contains an optional acceleration clause,default does not ipso facto start limitations running on the note.rather,the action accrues only when the holder actually exercises its option to accelerate.hammann mcmullen,curtis speck,writ ref.effective acceleration requires two acts notice of intent to accelerate,and notice of acceleration.see shumway horizon credit,ogden gibraltar sav.ass n.both notices must be clear and unequivocal.shumway,at.even when a noteholder has accelerated a note upon default,the holder can abandon acceleration if the holder continues to accept payments without exacting any remedies available to it upon declared maturity.city bank pope,antonio,no writ see also san antonio real estate,loan ass stewart,explaining that the parties agreement or actions can have the effect of obviating the default and restoring the contract to its original condition as if it had not been broken denbina city of hurst,no writ explaining that an option to accelerate may be withdrawn or revoked after it is exercised by the noteholder,effectively restoring the note original maturity date.
federal law provides a different scheme for determining accrual of foreclosure actions brought by the fdic.the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea provides that limitations on fdic claims begins to run on the later of the date the fdic is appointed receiver,or the date the cause of action accrues.d b.

iii.analysis 
the court of appeals did not reach the limitations issue because it concluded that the church had not conclusively established the date wolf claim accrued.accordingly,we consider that question first.
under its terms,the church note would mature in june,the month the last installment was due.see tex.civ.prac.e.the church claims,and wolf agreed,that mitc august,letter accelerated this maturity date.the parties also agreed that,upon this acceleration,any cause of action for unpaid amounts accrued,thereby triggering limitations under both state and federal law.
the court of appeals correctly noted that when a cause of action accrues is a question of law,not fact.see moreno sterling drug.it then concluded that the parties agreement about the acceleration and accrual date was an impermissible attempt to stipulate to a legal question.the court explained that it was incumbent upon the church to prove the actual accrual date rather than rely on the parties agreement.because it determined that the church had not carried this burden,the court of appeals reversed the trial court summary judgment for the church and remanded the case for further proceedings.at,wl.
the church argues that the court of appeals violated rule c by reversing summary judgment on grounds other than those presented in the trial court.see.civ.c mcconnell southside indep.sch.the church also argues that the court of appeals erred in holding that it did not present evidence conclusively establishing that the note was accelerated on august,and that limitations began running on that date.
wolf responds by arguing that the trial court recognition during the hearing that everybody seems to agree on the accrual date establishes that the issue was before the trial court and thus the court of appeals could review it.he also contends that the court of appeals correctly held that the church did not establish the accrual date,and that,in fact,the record shows that mitc attempted august acceleration was ineffective or abandoned.
we disagree with the court of appeals analysis and hold that the parties agreement about the acceleration date and the evidence each provide independent bases for the trial court to find the church had conclusively established an accrual date.while accrual is a legal question,whether a holder has accelerated a note is a fact question to which parties may,and in this case did,agree.see,mclemore,at treating whether note was accelerated,and when as fact question texas airfinance lesikar,dist,no writ treating whether promissory note had been accelerated as fact question.
assertions of fact,not plead in the alternative,in the live pleadings of a party are regarded as formal judicial admissions.houston first am.sav.musick.a judicial admission that is clear and unequivocal has conclusive effect and bars the admitting party from later disputing the admitted fact.gevinson manhattan constr.here,wolf response and for summary judgment states defendant accepts plaintiff argument that the note was accelerated by the sic mitc on august,and that the statute of limitations began to run on that date.and at the hearing and in his court of appeals brief wolf consistently agreed that mitc accelerated the church note on august.wolf agreement amounted to a judicial admission of the acceleration date.once wolf judicial admission established the acceleration date,the trial court could apply the law to conclude as a matter of law that accrual occurred upon this acceleration and that limitations then began running.
and,even without wolf admission,the evidence conclusively establishes an august,accrual.the church evidence included a copy of the deed of trust containing optional acceleration and power of sale clauses in favor of the original mortgagee and its successors and assigns documents tracing the note ownership from wynnewood bank to each successor,including mitc and wolf and a july,notice of intent to accelerate and an august,notice of acceleration signed by mitc attorneys.
the court of appeals held that this evidence was not enough to establish effective acceleration,or,in the alternative,that mitc had abandoned acceleration 
mitc was required to serve the church with written notice of the sale,post written notice at the courthouse door for days,and file a copy of the notice with the county clerk.there is no evidence in the record that mitc posted the property for sale or filed the notice with the county clerk.there is nothing in the record stating that mitc actually conducted a foreclosure sale.accordingly,based on the record before us,it appears that,although the church was in default and mitc served the church with notice of a sale,mitc did not comply with the contractual or statutory conditions necessary to exercise its option to accelerate the note as declared.apparently,mitc abandoned the note acceleration.
at,wl citations omitted.we disagree.
acceleration 
in holding that mitc acceleration was ineffective,the court of appeals concluded that an optional acceleration clause can not be exercised without actually taking steps towards foreclosing on the property.it relied on section of the texas property code and swoboda wilshire credit,christi,pet.denied.
section establishes the procedures for conducting a foreclosure sale.the court of appeals held that mitc could not have accelerated the church note without following section posting and notice procedures.in other words,the court held that the cause of action on the church note could not have accrued absent compliance with section.however,section has nothing to do with accrual or limitations it only governs the procedures noteholders must follow if they choose to exercise their power of sale.rather,section of the texas civil practice and remedies code governs accrual,and it provides that a cause of action accrues and limitations begins to run from an installment note maturity date.
swoboda holds that 
exercise of the right of acceleration requires the mortgagee to make a clear,positive,and unequivocal declaration in some manner of the exercise thereof,followed by affirmative action towards enforcing the declared intention a declaration alone does not amount to an election to accelerate without accompanying enforcement action,steps to execute foreclosure on the real property.
at citations omitted.several other cases have likewise required affirmative steps towards foreclosure to accelerate a note secured by real property,shepler kubena,no writ intention to mature the note may be evidence d by declarations,which alone do not amount to an election,unless followed by affirmative action toward enforcing the declared intention.national debenture smith,writ dism judgm t cor.d eclaration alone does not amount to an election to accelerate the maturity to be effective as such,it must be followed by affirmative action toward enforcing the declared intention.joy nob hill,no writ holding acceleration may be accomplished by either declaring entire debt due or taking some other unequivocal action indicating debt is accelerated.
we disapprove of swoboda and this line of cases to the extent they can be read to require affirmative action towards foreclosure to trigger acceleration of a note secured by real property when the parties agreement does not require such action.to hold,as the court of appeals did here,that acceleration does not occur and thus an action does not accrue until a foreclosure posting or sale takes place would,in essence,mean the foreclosure posting or sale would be the triggering event bringing about the right to hold a foreclosure sale.this resu
