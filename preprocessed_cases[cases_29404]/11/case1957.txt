appellant casa herrera,casa herrera prevailed at trial in an underlying lawsuit brought against it by respondents am mex food industries,am mex and nasser beydoun beydoun.on appeal from judgment in the underlying lawsuit,this court in an unpublished opinion affirmed the judgment in favor of casa herrera,concluding that the parol evidence rule precluded am mex and beydoun from establishing their claims against casa herrera for breach of contract and fraud in connection with casa herrera sale of a tortilla oven to am mex.this court also affirmed an award of attorney fees in favor of casa herrera against am mex and beydoun.beydoun casa herrera,nonpub.opn.
casa herrera then filed the current action pleading malicious prosecution claims against am mex and beydoun,and a separate malicious prosecution claim against respondents community first national bank and tom ferrara collectively bank,which alleged bank instigated and encouraged the filing and continuation of the underlying action.casa herrera complaint also pleaded a claim against bank under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b section,alleging that although bank was not a party in the underlying action,because it had a proprietary and financial interest in the judgment and controlled the underlying action,bank was bound by the judgment and was liable to pay all costs and attorney fees awarded to casa herrera by the judgment.
the trial court,relying on hall harker th,d hall,granted am mex,beydoun and bank motion for judgment on the pleadings on casa herrera malicious prosecution claims.the trial court ruled that,under hall,a termination of a lawsuit based on the parol evidence rule as a matter of law is not a favorable termination of the underlying action,thereby precluding casa herrera from establishing an essential element of its malicious prosecution claims.the trial court also granted bank motion for judgment on the pleadings on casa herrera section claim on the ground that section did not impose liability on nonparties for awards of costs and attorney fees.casa herrera appeals the judgment dismissing the current action.
we hold that casa herrera malicious prosecution claims should not have been dismissed because we conclude,contrary to hall,that a defendant exonerated from liability in the underlying action based on the parol evidence rule has obtained a favorable termination on the merits.however,we hold the trial court correctly dismissed casa herrera section claim.
factual and procedural backgrounda.facts giving rise to underlying action 
in am mex,owned by beydoun,purchased a tortilla oven and related equipment from casa herrera that am mex intended to use to manufacture tortillas for sale to its distributors beydoun guaranteed a loan to pay the purchase price.the written contract contained several warranties,including a warranty that the oven would produce tortillas at certain rates the oven was delivered to am mex on june.the contract provided that after installation am mex had days to operate the oven and to return it if not satisfied with its operation.am mex did not sign the written acceptance of the oven for more than a month because it was having difficulty satisfactorily operating the oven casa herrera made some repairs and advised am mex on how to properly operate the oven.on july,after casa herrera and am mex personnel monitored the oven for several shifts,am mex signed the written acceptance acknowledging they had observed the oven in operation and were satisfied with the quantity and quality of production beydoun casa herrera,supra.
am mex encountered financial difficulties and was unable to service its debts to valley de oro bank,the predecessor to bank,and in valley de oro bank filed a lawsuit to enforce the security interest it held in am mex assets and obtained an order appointing a receiver to take control of am mex assets after the receiver was appointed,am mex and beydoun filed the underlying action against casa herrera alleging breach of contract and fraud in connection with the sale of the oven.am mex claims relied on its assertions that casa herrera promised and represented the oven would produce tortillas at the rate of dozen per hour,casa herrera knew the oven could not maintain that rate of production,and the oven inability to produce tortillas of that size at that rate caused am mex financial downfall beydoun casa herrera,supra.
b.the underlying judgment 
the trial court granted casa herrera motion for nonsuit against beydoun and,after hearing additional evidence,also granted casa herrera motion for nonsuit against am mex,reasoning that neither beydoun nor am mex had standing to sue for fraud or breach of contract.on appeal,this court affirmed the ruling but did not reach the issue of standing.instead,this court concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the breach of contract or fraud claims because the written contract obligated casa herrera to provide an oven producing tortillas at the rate of dozen per hour,and the parol evidence rule barred am mex from attempting to show casa herrera breached a promise or fraudulently promised to provide an oven producing tortillas at the rate of dozen per hour.beydoun casa herrera,supra.
c.the current action and rulings 
casa herrera filed this action alleging all of the elements required for its malicious prosecution claims against am mex,beydoun and bank,including the allegation that the appellate opinion in beydoun casa herrera,supra,was a favorable termination of the underlying action bank,joined by am mex and beydoun,moved for judgment on the pleadings.they argued that,under hall,when the plaintiff in the underlying action was unable to establish his claim because the parol evidence rule barred him from introducing evidence to support his claim,the termination in favor of the underlying defendant does not qualify as a favorable termination the defense judgment is considered based on procedural or technical factors rather than a substantive termination on the merits of the claim.casa herrera opposed the motion.the trial court ruled that,under hall,the opinion in beydoun casa herrera,supra,as a matter of law precluded casa herrera from showing the favorable termination element of a malicious prosecution action.
casa herrera claim under section alleged that because bank had a proprietary and financial interest in the judgment and controlled the underlying action,bank was bound by the judgment and liable to pay all costs and attorney fees awarded to casa herrera by the judgment.bank filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing section merely codified the common law rules of res judicata and did not provide authority to add it as an additional judgment debtor on the judgment.casa herrera opposed the motion,arguing that section,subdivision b expressly allows a court to enter a judgment against a nonparty.the trial court rejected casa herrera interpretation of section,subdivision b,granted bank motion for judgment on the pleadings,and entered judgment against casa herrera.
analysisa.termination based on the parol evidence rule is a favorable termination 
the trial court,recognizing the binding effect of hall see auto equity sales,superior court cal d,ruled the judgment in the underlying action was not a favorable termination for purposes of a malicious prosecution action because it was based on the parol evidence rule.however,we conclude hall holding was incorrect and should not be perpetuated.
the favorable termination element 
a termination of the underlying action in the defendant favor,although required,is not alone sufficient to satisfy the favorable termination element required for a malicious prosecution action.hall,supra,th at,d.although i t is not essential to maintenance of an action for malicious prosecution that the prior proceeding was favorably terminated following trial on the merits,the termination must reflect on the merits of the underlying action.lackner lacroix cal d,original italics.lackner explained that i f the termination does not relate to the on neither innocence of nor responsibility for the alleged termination is not favorable in the sense it would support a subsequent action for malicious prosecution.lackner,at,fn.omitted.lackner ultimately held a termination based on the statute of limitations must be deemed a technical or procedural as distinguished from a substantive termination that is in no way dependent on nor reflective of the lack the underlying action and therefore would not qualify as a favorable termination.id.at.other courts have concluded that other grounds for terminating the underlying action in favor of the defendant are also not favorable and do not support a subsequent action for malicious prosecution.see asia investment borowski d.dismissal of underlying action based on laches not favorable termination haight handweiler d.dismissal of underlying action against nonsettling defendant when required as condition of settlement between other parties not favorable termination oprian goldrich,kest associates d.dismissal of complaint to avoid additional costs of litigation not favorable termination.
in contrast,a termination will be deemed favorable when the action is terminated for reasons that do reflect on the defendant innocence of or lack of responsibility for the alleged misconduct.see,jaffe stone cal d,dismissal of criminal action by magistrate for lack of probable cause is favorable termination minasian sapse d.dismissal for failure to prosecute is favorable termination because one does not simply abandon a meritorious action once instituted.in berman rca auto d,the court examined whether a termination in favor of the defendant based on the immunity conferred by former civil code section,subdivision was a favorable termination for purposes of a subsequent malicious prosecution action.in the underlying action,rca sued several defendants and berman,attorney for one of the defendants,made certain representations to the court while defending his client.rca claimed berman representations were false and therefore amended its underlying complaint to add berman as a defendant,alleging berman false statements had injured rca.the trial court in the underlying action dismissed the claim against berman because his statements were absolutely privileged under former civil code section,subdivision.berman,at.
berman then filed a malicious prosecution claim against rca.the trial court dismissed berman claim because it concluded dismissal of the underlying claim based on privilege can not satisfy the favorable termination element.on appeal,rca argued the trial court was correct because a termination based on privilege is a procedural or technical termination rather than one that substantively evaluated the merits of the alleged wrongfulness of the defendant conduct.berman rca auto,supra,d at.the berman court rejected rca argument,reasoning that although the privilege is similar to a procedural defense to the extent it must be raised by the defendant,it is substantive because 
the privilege is a limitation upon liability.citation.when a publication is absolutely privileged,there is no liability,even though it is made with actual malice t he absolute protection from liability it provides makes the privilege quite unlike the procedural defenses.procedural defenses are designed to protect the integrity of the judicial system they are rules by which lawsuits are tried.procedural defenses do not absolutely shield a defendant from liability the s ection,subdivision,privilege,on the other hand,creates an immunity.citation.it is a bar to liability designed to protect the rights of the individual speaker,to insure that nothing will impede the individual access to the courts.the privilege focuses not on the timing or the manner of a lawsuit,but solely on the defendant in this instance the termination reflects the opinion of the legislature that the action lacks merit because the protection of the right of an individual access to the courts outweighs an individual right to a civil remedy for harm resulting from misrepresentations made at a judicial proceeding the legislature has in effect said that suits based on privileged statements are suits without merit.berman,supra,at.
with this background,we examine hall application of the favorable termination element of a malicious prosecution action.
hall harker 
in hall,the defendant in the underlying action prevailed against the underlying plaintiff claim for breach of an oral contract because the parol evidence rule and statute of frauds barred the plaintiff from establishing the oral contract the underlying defendant then sued for malicious prosecution,and the trial court found the favorable termination element was satisfied.hall,supra,th at,d.the hall court reversed,concluding the parol evidence rule was a procedural rather than substantive rule that did not relate to the merits of defendant innocence of or responsibility for the alleged misconduct id.at,d.the hall court discussed the parol evidence rule at length,noting 
the parol evidence rule is problematic because it is not merely a rule of evidence exclusion based on policy or probative value,but is a substantive rule of law.citation.the rule derives from the concept of an integrated contract.when the parties to an agreement incorporate the complete and final terms of the agreement in a writing,such an integration in fact becomes the complete and final contract between the parties.such a contract may not be contradicted by evidence of purportedly collateral agreements.quoting hayter trucking,shell western e p,th,d.citations.the purpose of the parol evidence rule is to make sure that the parties final understanding,deliberately expressed in writing,shall not be changed.witkin,cal.evidence ed.documentary evidence.according to this substantive rule of law,when the parties intend a written agreement to be the final and complete expression of their understanding,that writing becomes the final contract between the parties,which may not be contradicted by even the most persuasive evidence of collateral agreements.such evidence is legally irrelevant.citations.epa real estate partnership kang th,d hall,supra,at.
after this lengthy discourse recognizing the parol evidence rule constitutes a rule of substantive law,the purpose of which is to ensure that a deliberate expression in writing of the parties final agreement is the final contract and may not be contradicted by even the most persuasive evidence of a different agreement,hall nevertheless concluded a termination based on the substantive bar of the parol evidence rule is not a legal determination of the underlying defendant culpability.hall,supra,th at,d.hall rationale for this conclusion was that the parol evidence rule may render evidence of collateral agreements legally irrelevant,but it can not erase the existence of the agreements hall,at,original italics.
evaluation 
we disagree with hall analysis and holding because we conclude that,when an action is terminated because the parol evidence rule mandates the defendant liability be determined by the provision embodied in the written contract rather than by any prior inconsistent oral promises,the action has been terminated for reasons that do reflect on the merits of the plaintiff underlying claim that the underlying defendant was responsible or liable for allegedly breaching his contractual obligations.the court in estate of gaines cal d,discussing the purpose and effect of the parol evidence rule,explained 
the parol evidence rule,as is now universally recognized,is not a rule of evidence but is one of substantive law.it does not exclude evidence for any of the reasons ordinarily requiring exclusion,based on the probative value of such evidence or the policy of its admission.the rule as applied to contracts is simply that as a matter of substantive law,a certain act,the act of embodying the complete terms of an agreement in a writing the integration,becomes the contract of the parties.the point then is,not how the agreement is to be proved,because as a matter of law the writing is the agreement the rule comes into operation when there is a single and final memorial of the understanding of the parties.when that takes place,prior and contemporaneous negotiations,oral or written,are excluded or,as it is
