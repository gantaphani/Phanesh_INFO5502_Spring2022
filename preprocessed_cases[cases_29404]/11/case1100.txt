this litigation arises out of a franchise agreement between west coast hotels,and mahmoud mike karimi.the successor in interest to west coast hotels is red lion hotels franchising,red lion.west coast hotels was,and red lion is,incorporated in washington state with their headquarters in spokane.karimi and his hotel management company mak,llc collectively,karimi operated a red lion franchise in modesto,california.red lion terminated the franchise and sued karimi for breach of contract.karimi counterclaimed,asserting claims,including a claim based on the franchisee bill of rights of the washington franchise investment protection act fipa.
the district court granted summary judgment to red lion on karimi counterclaim under fipa bill of rights on the ground that fipa does not apply extraterritorially.after a bench trial,the court held for red lion on its contract claim.
the primary question before us is whether a franchisee may assert a claim against a washington franchisor under fipa bill of rights.for the reasons explained in this opinion,we conclude that an franchisee may assert such a claim against an franchisor.
background 
mike karimi has worked in the hotel industry since the.he owns a hotel management company,mak,llc,and operates several hotels through mak.
in,the khatri brothers,friends of karimi,asked him to take over the operation of a hotel they owned in modesto,california.karimi was concerned about doing so because the hotel was in poor condition only out of guest rooms were usable and needed significant renovations.nonetheless,karimi assumed the former operator year lease on december.shortly thereafter,karimi negotiated a franchise agreement with west coast hotels.for convenience,we will refer to west coast hotels,and to its successor in interest red lion,simply as red lion.karimi asked for and received certain concessions in the franchise agreement.the franchise term was shortened to five years the royalty fee for the first year of operations was reduced and karimi was given the option to terminate the agreement in the first year without having to pay liquidated damages.
the franchise agreement contained several sections relating to hotel quality and improvements.one section provided that 
red lion may from time to time require you to modernize,rehabilitate upgrade the hotel fixtures,equipment,furnishings,furniture,signs,computer hardware and software and related equipment,supplies and other items to meet the then current standards and specifications specified in the manual y ou will make all these changes at your sole cost and expense we may make limited exceptions to some of those standards based on local conditions or special circumstances but we are not required to do so.
red lion reserved the right to change its manual,a written collection of standards and requirements for franchises,at any time.the agreement required karimi to bear the costs of complying with any new standards.the agreement also gave red lion the right to inspect the hotel at any time to determine whether it complied with standards set forth in the agreement and the manual.
the franchise agreement also contained provisions relating to termination of the franchise.section a gave red lion the power to terminate the agreement if the franchisee failed to cure an event of default within thirty days after notice.that section provided 
an event of default will occur if you fail to satisfy or comply with any of the obligations,requirements,conditions,or terms set forth in this agreement,the manual,or any attachment to this agreement an event of default will also occur if you make any misrepresentations to us,whether in entering into this agreement,or in the performance of your obligations to us.
section c provided that if red lion terminated the agreement under section a,red lion would receive liquidated damages.
finally,the agreement contained a provision in the event of litigation.section b provided 
t his agreement,all relations between us,and any and all disputes between us,whether sounding in contract,tort,or otherwise,are to be exclusively construed in accordance with governed by as applicable the laws of the state of washington without recourse to washington or any other choice of law or conflicts of law principles nothing in this section is intended to invoke the application of any franchise,business opportunity,antitrust,implied covenant,unfair competition,fiduciary or any other doctrine of law of the state of washington or any other state which would not otherwise apply absent this paragraph.
after the franchise agreement became effective on february,karimi began renovating the hotel.among other things,he purchased new bedding,furniture,wallpaper,pedestal sinks,and units,and replaced the exterior brick face with stucco.karimi testified at trial that he spent around million on the renovations.
in early,red lion began a concerted effort to improve the quality of its hotels.a central part of the effort was the creation of new brand standards,which were to apply to all hotels in the chain.the new brand standards were based on aaa rating system,which awards hotels between one and five diamonds.red lion standards were based on aaa standard.the new standards were announced to franchise owners at a meeting in january.franchise owners were told that they would receive a property improvement plan,or pip,that contained individualized lists of required improvements for each hotel.
karimi was unable to attend the january meeting because he was hospitalized,but he was told in a february,letter from red lion that he would be given a pip that would have to be completed by december.at some point in early,michael castro,then the director of brand services at red lion,met with karimi at the red lion modesto to prepare the pip for the hotel.castro sent the completed pip to karimi on may.the pip contained more than required improvements.karimi refused to sign the pip because of one requirement.he had installed pedestal sinks as part of his improvements to the hotel the pip required,instead,granite vanities with undermounted sinks.karimi testified at trial that he had discussed the sink issue with castro,and that castro had granted him a waiver for pedestal sinks.castro testified that he could not recall granting such a waiver.karimi testified that he asked for a revised pip,but that none was ever sent.
under the original pip sent by castro,mak was required to receive written confirmation from red lion that all furniture,fixtures,and equipment met or exceeded brand standards.the pip also required written approval from red lion of any changes or revisions to the scope of work or design elements.finally,any extensions of more than days after the december,deadline required written approval from red lion.
in july,john taffin,an executive vice president at red lion,toured the red lion modesto to assess progress on the pip.in september,taffin sent karimi a letter reminding him of the december deadline.on october,a contractor conducted an annual inspection of karimi franchise,as specified in red lion brand standards manual.karimi received a grade of percent,one point less than the passing grade of percent.in late november,todd cooley,who had succeeded mike castro as the director of brand services,inspected the red lion modesto.he testified at trial that the hotel looked old and tired,and that the renovations were substantially incomplete.
from november until june,there was no contact between karimi and red lion about either the pip or the december,deadline.in early june,mark fielding,an accountant at red lion,stayed in the modesto hotel while attending a wedding.cooley had given fielding a brand standards manual and had asked him to look around the hotel,although fielding had no experience evaluating compliance with brand standards.fielding testified that he observed that several fixtures in the bathroom did not comply with brand standards and that the hotel looked old,tired,worn out,kind of well used.he reported to cooley that the hotel needed some tlc.
on june,two weeks after fielding stay at the hotel,red lion sent karimi a notice of default and termination.taffin testified that the notice of default was prompted by a decision to deal aggressive ly with franchises that had not completed the pips by the december,deadline.the notice of default included an updated pip containing a list of improvements that were required to cure the default and avoid termination.the notice stated 
you must immediately demonstrate to us that mak,llc is making the necessary improvements to the hotel in compliance with the pip,and has a reasonable expectation of completing all required improvements in a time frame that is acceptable to us.
if mak,llc defaults are not timely cured to red lion satisfaction,mak,lcc franchise license agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated without further notice to mak,llc days from the effective date of this notice.
emphasis in original.
karimi replied on june,stating that all but four items from the updated pip had been completed,and that the remaining items would be completed by august.karimi also wrote that should that scheduled completion time be unacceptable to red lion hotels we are prepared to complete our entire pip within days from the effective date of red lion notice.since we have no guidance as to what would be an acceptable time frame to red lion hotels,i trust that if our current scheduled completion date is unacceptable in the judgment of red lion hotels,the fact of that judgment will be communicated to me without delay.
red lion did not send a letter in response to karimi june letter.instead,cooley personally visited the hotel on july.in an inspection that lasted about ten minutes,cooley determined that the improvements that karimi said had been completed were,in fact,substantially incomplete and the things that karimi had implied were accurate.cooley took several photographs during his inspection.at trial,the parties vigorously disputed whether the photographs were actually from july rather than from cooley november visit.lori knoll,the red lion modesto manager,and michel cockrum,who did hotel maintenance,testified that the photographs could not have been taken in july,because they depicted features of the hotel that had been changed by july.however,gurdial dhatt,red lion director of information technology,testified that metadata in the electronic files showed that the pictures were indeed taken on july,and karimi expert agreed that the metadata on those pictures did not appear to have been altered.
after cooley july inspection,red lion decided that karimi letter was not an accurate portrayal of what was happening at the property.on july,red lion sent karimi a letter terminating his franchise agreement on the ground that the improvements were not consistently applied to the entire property as represented in karimi letter.
red lion then sued mak,karimi,and karimi wife in federal district court,asserting breach of the franchise agreement and its accompanying personal guarantees,and seeking liquidated damages.defendants counterclaimed for violations of washington franchise investment protection act fipa,washington consumer protection act cpa,and breach of the franchise agreement.
red lion moved for summary judgment on karimi fipa and cpa counterclaims.the district court granted summary judgment on the fipa claim,holding that a california company operating a franchise in california could not invoke fipa against red lion because the overall statutory scheme evinces the legislature intent to confine fipa reach to franchises operating in this state,washington.because karimi cpa claim was predicated on his fipa claim,the court also granted summary judgment on the cpa claim.
after a bench trial on the remaining claims,the district court found that karimi had not complied with red lion brand standards or the pip,and that he had not been granted waivers that would excuse his noncompliance.the district court credited taffin,cooley,and castro testimony,and found that cooley photographs had been taken during his july hotel inspection.the court further found that karimi june,letter had misrepresented the state of the improvements to the hotel.the court held that karimi had failed to comply with the franchise agreement and that red lion was justified in terminating the agreement.the court did not specifically address karimi affirmative defense that red lion was equitably estopped from terminating the franchise agreement.the court entered judgment in favor of red lion and awarded damages and attorney fees to red lion.
karimi timely appealed.in his appeal,he argues that fipa bill of rights applies to his franchise,even though it is located outside washington state,red lion was equitably estopped from terminating the franchise agreement,and entry of judgment against his wife was improper because she was not a party to the franchise agreement or its accompanying personal guarantee.

iii.discussion 
fipa claim 
under the provision in the franchise agreement,washington law applies to this dispute without recourse to washington or any other choice of law or conflicts of law principles.we construe the provision to mean that we should apply washington law only insofar as that law,according to its own terms,would be applicable.
the question before us is whether washington franchise investment protection act fipa applies to mak,a franchisee in its relationship with red lion,a washington franchisor.fipa was enacted to curb franchisor sales abuses and unfair competitive practices.corporate,eagle hardware garden.fipa deals mainly with registration and disclosure requirements,but it also contains a franchisee bill of rights,which is intended to ameliorate the nature of the relationship.east wind express,airborne freight.code.karimi alleges that red lion violated provisions of fipa bill of rights.fipa does not specify a remedy for a violation of the bill of rights,but a franchisee may bring an action under washington consumer protection act based on a fipa violation.id.consumer protection act see also nelson fund raising consultants,the legislature has provided that violations of the franchise investment protection act are per se unfair trade practices under the consumer protection act.
fipa bill of rights does not contain indeed,has never contained language limiting its application to the relation between a franchisor and franchisee in this state.the bill of rights provides 
relation between franchisor and franchisee rights and prohibitions.
without limiting the other provisions of this chapter,the following specific rights and prohibitions shall govern the relation between the franchisor or and the franchisees 
the parties shall deal with each other in good faith.
for the purposes of this chapter and without limiting its general application,it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition and therefore unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to 
listing prohibited acts,practices,and unfair methods of competition 
by contrast,several of fipa provisions contain an explicit statement that they apply to actions in this state,with the clear implication that they apply only in this state.these provisions are as follows,with emphasis added throughout.the sale,or offer of sale,of a franchise in the state must be registered in the state.code it is unlawful for any franchisor or subfranchisor to sell or offer to sell any franchise in this state unless the offer of the franchise has been registered.advertisements published in the state for sale of a franchise that is subject to fipa registration requirement must be filed with the state director of financial institutions.id.no person shall publish in this state any advertisements offering a franchise subject to the registration requirements of this law unless a true copy of the advertisement has been filed in the office of the director.no advertisement concerning a franchise subject to fipa registration requirement may be published in the state after the director has found it contains a false or misleading statement.id.no person shall publish in this state any advertisement concerning a franchise subject to the registration requirements of this chapter after the director finds that the advertisement contains any statements that are false or misleading.any franchise broker selling or offering to sell a franchise in the state must register with the state.id.it is unlawful for any franchise broker to offer to sell or sell a franchise in this state unless the franchise broker is registered under this chapter.untrue statements of material fact or the employment of any fraudulent device,scheme,or artifice,in connection with any offer or sale of a franchise in the state are forbidden.id.it is unlawful for any person in connection with the offer,sale,or purchase of any franchise or subfranchise in this state directly or indirectly to make any untrue statement of material fact in any application,notice,or report filed with the director under this law to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud.
in,the washington legislature amended fipa to provide a definition of the phrase in this state contained in the statute.the legislature did so largely based on a law review article written some years earlier by professor donald chisum of the university of washington law school,who had pointed out that the meaning of in this state was unclear.see donald chisum,state regulation of franchising the washington experience.professor chisum recommended that washington adopt a definition comparable to the definition contained in california franchise investment law.id.the washington legislature amended fipa to include a definition similar to that which professor chisum had recommended.legis.serv.ch.west.
by its terms,the definition of in this state provided by the amendments applies only to.see.code for the purposes of this section,an offer to sell a franchise is made in this state when a the offer is directed by the offeror into this state from within or outside this state and is received where it is directed,b the offer originates from this state and violates the franchise or business opportunity law of the state or foreign jurisdiction into which it is directed,c the offeree is a resident of this state,or d the franchise business that is the subject of the offer is to be located or operated,wholly or partly,in this state.id.for the purpose of this section,a sale of any franchise is made in this state when a an offer to sell is accepted in this state,b an offer originating from this state is accepted and violates the franchise or business opportunity law of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which it is accepted,c the purchaser of the franchise is a resident of this state,or d the franchise business that is the subject of the sale is to be located or operated,wholly or partly,in this state.
the district court recognized that,the fipa provision at issue here,does not contain the phrase in this state or any other a territorial limitation.it nonetheless concluded that the overall statutory scheme,as well as the amendments prompted by professor chisum recommendation,evince the legislature intent to confine fipa reach to franchises operating in this state.in support of its conclusion,the district court cited the provisions of fipa that do contain territorial limitations.we disagree with the court conclusion.
in recommending that a definition of the phrase in this state be added to,professor chisum did not suggest that all of fipa was territorially limited.on the contrary,he distinguished between the provisions of fipa,which were modeled after a california law,and the franchisee bill of rights,which he called unique to washington.chisum,state regulation of franchising.at.as to the latter,he wrote that the act does not indicate the territorial coverage of the franchisee bill of rights.id.at.chisum did not recommend that the legislature add a territorial limitation to the franchisee bill of rights.he recommended only that the legislature define the limitation where it already existed in fipa.the washington legislature did no more than what professor chisum recommended.
fipa bill of rights applies to the relation between the franchisor or subfranchisor and the franchisees.code.franchisor is defined in fipa as a person who grants a franchise to another person.id.franchisee is defined as a person to whom a franchise is offered or granted.id.a franchise is defined as a n agreement,express or implied,oral or written,by which i a person is granted the right to engage in the business of offering,selling,or distributing goods or services under a marketing plan prescribed or suggested in substantial part by the grantor or its affiliate ii the operation of the business is substantially associated with a trademark,service mark,trade name,advertising,or other commercial symbol designating,owned by,or licensed by the grantor or its affiliate and iii the person pays,agrees to pay,or is required to pay,directly or indirectly,a franchise fee.id.
as a matter of general principle,i f a state law does not have limitations on its geographical scope,courts will apply it to a contract governed by that state law,even if parts of the contract are performed outside of the state.gravquick trimble navigation int l,cir.the fact that fipa provisions relating to sales of franchises contain a territorial limitation does not lead us to conclude that fipa bill of rights is similarly limited.indeed,the inclusion of explicit territorial limitations in the provision,and the failure to include such a limitation in the bill of rights,suggests the opposite conclusion.under ordinary rules of statutory construction,we presume that the washington legislature made a deliberate choice to impose territorial limitations on some,but not all,of fipa provisions.w here the legislature includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that the legislature acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.kucana holder,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also in re detention of,when a statute or rule provides for specifically enumerated exceptions,we presume that the absence of other exceptions is intentional.
the district court relied on taylor got junk,llc,d,in reaching its conclusion that fipa does not protect karimi.in taylor,plaintiff franchisees were residents of oregon who owned and operated a franchise in oregon.defendant franchisor was a delaware corporation with headquarters in vancouver,british columbia,canada.the franchise agreement provided for the application of washington law.id.at.after the franchisor terminated the franchise agreement,plaintiffs sued,alleging fraud.id.at.the franchisor argued that plaintiffs had waived their fipa claims in a previous settlement.the plaintiffs,in response,pointed to fipa provision.code,which invalidates certain settlements of fipa claims.id.at.taylor thus turned on whether fipa provision applied.id.at.
the taylor court concluded that the presence of territorial limitations in the provisions of fipa,combined with the amendments,means that fipa does not apply to a franchise agreement in which both franchisor and franchisee are located outside washington,and in which the plaintiffs claims are based on events that occurred outside washington.id.at.the court concluded that the settlement was valid and that plaintiffs had therefore waived their claims.id.at.
to the degree that the district court opinion in taylor can be re
