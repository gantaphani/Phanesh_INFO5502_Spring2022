plaintiffs,the buena park motel association and of its members,filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant city of buena park,contending two local zoning ordinances violate their constitutional rights.ordinance,adopted in,made it unlawful for motel owners to rent their rooms to the same guest for days or more.three years later,the city council adopted ordinance to amend the earlier ordinance by making it unlawful for motel owners to rent a room to the same guest for days or more in any day period.plaintiffs challenged the ordinances as an unreasonable and irrational exercise of defendant police powers,as an unlawful taking of private property without just compensation,and as a violation of their right to the equal protection of the laws.the trial court entered judgment for defendant following a bench trial.
plaintiffs appeal,contending the trial court erred in concluding their challenge to ordinance is barred by the statute of limitations and by ruling that the ordinances did not amount to an unlawful taking and did not violate plaintiffs right to equal protection.we disagree with their contentions and therefore affirm.
the individual plaintiffs are ethnic minority owners and operators of small to motels located in defendant city of buena park the city.several of the plaintiffs testified at trial that a significant portion of their to to stay at their motels for more than days.such guests were comprised of business people,families,victims of domestic abuse,and individuals with a basis of income.plaintiffs are unable to fill their room vacancies with guests,tourists,and need guests to survive economically.
prior to,some,but not all,of the plaintiffs had been issued conditional use permits which precluded them from renting a room to the same guest for longer than days.gary hicken,the city chief of police,testified that in or,a neighborhood improvement task force was formed with the intent to reduce the blight deterioration in the community and to improve the quality of life members of the task force inspected motels,hotels,apartments,and rental properties and found problems associated with motel guests,such as cockroach infestations and filth.according to chief hicken,ordinance was created,in part,to enforce conditional use permits which limited guest stays to days.
ordinance,adopted by the city council in mid,added section to the buena park city code,making it unlawful for any hotel,motel or motor hotel to rent or let,or otherwise provide for compensation,any room therein to any person,firm,partnership,corporation,association or other business entity for thirty or more consecutive days the ordinance stated purpose was to ensure the continued availability of transient lodging within the city of buena park and to ensure the continued use of hotels,motels and motor hotels in the manner intended at the time of adoption of the zoning ordinance of the city of buena park.a violation of the ordinance constitutes a misdemeanor,and violators are subject to being fined per day for each violation imprisonment for up to six months.only hotels or motels meeting certain development criteria,having a minimum of guest rooms and a restaurant on or abutting the property,could qualify for a conditional use permit to exceed the limit.
chief hicken testified ordinance had a d ramatic impact,but it failed to eliminate the problems it was intended to rectify because motel owners had found ways to circumvent the stay rule.in some cases,guests desiring to stay long term would check out after days,leave their belongings in the room,and then check back in the next day.in other cases,rather than check out after days,multiple parties staying in the same room simply would be allowed to register under a different name.as a result,some rooms were not regularly cleaned.
deborah holland,a city code enforcement officer,had seen rooms where the odor was so bad no one could enter.odors from cooking foods,from urinating,from body odor,just uncleanliness.she had also seen rooms where there were rats,mattresses covered in feces,and cockroach infestations.these conditions typically were associated with stays in motels.
in late,the city council adopted ordinance to prevent motel owners from circumventing the stay rule.the new ordinance amended subsection b of section of the buena park city code,making it unlawful for any hotel,motel,or motor hotel to rent or let,or otherwise provide,any room therein to any person,firm,partnership,corporation,association or other business entity for thirty or more consecutive days,or for more than sixty total days in any one hundred and eighty consecutive day period the ordinance further provided,it is the intent of this section that if a room is rented,let or otherwise provided to any party for either of the maximum time periods allowed by this section,then such room may not again be rented,let or otherwise provided to the same party or to any individual,firm,or entity that was a member of said party.the penalties for violating the ordinance remained the same as before the development criteria for obtaining a conditional use permit to exceed the or stay limits likewise were unchanged.
in march,plaintiffs filed suit contending the ordinances violated their constitutional rights.specifically,they alleged the ordinances were an unreasonable and irrational exercise of the city police powers,resulted in a taking of their private property without just compensation,and deprived them of their right to the equal protection of the laws.as to the latter claim,plaintiffs asserted the motivation for the adoption of the ordinances was to rid the city of motels owned and operated by ethnic minorities and the guests who stay at such hotels.a moratorium against enforcing the ordinances has been imposed pending resolution of the case.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of the city after a bench trial.the court concluded plaintiffs challenge to ordinance was barred by the day statute of limitations set forth in government code section.the court found ordinance constituted a valid exercise of the city police power and that it had a substantial relation to the public health,safety,morals and general welfare.the court further found the ordinance did not constitute a prohibited taking as it was not arbitrary and it did not unduly restrict the use of private property,but merely diminishe d the owners use or value of their property.moreover,the court found that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to show that they had a preexisting right to rent rooms for longer than days or that renting their rooms to residents was otherwise lawful.as to the equal protection claim,the court determined there was no shred of evidence the city intended to discriminate against plaintiffs because of their ethnicity or that it was trying to drive out low income people.thus,the court concluded t he ordinances are not arbitrary and are rationally related to legitimate government interest s.
discussion 
plaintiffs challenge to ordinance is barred by the statute of limitations 
plaintiffs arguments on appeal encompass both ordinances,but defendant contends the trial court correctly held that plaintiffs are barred from challenging the validity of ordinance.we agree.
there is a limitations period on challenges to the validity of a local zoning regulation,subd.c b.if the challenge is to the facial validity of a regulation,the statute of limitations runs from the date the statute became effective.hensler city of glendale cal th,d,see also save our ntc,city of san diego th,d.once the statute of limitations has expired,all persons are barred from any further action or proceeding,subd.e.
ordinance,which first imposed the stay rule and created city code provision section,was adopted in august.plaintiffs did not challenge its validity until march.it is evident their challenge to this ordinance and the related code provision is untimely.thus,plaintiffs are precluded from challenging ordinance and those portions of the related city code provision which were not altered by the later ordinance.garat city of riverside th,d,disapproved on other grounds in morehart county of sant
