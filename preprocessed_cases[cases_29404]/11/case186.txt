home to more than a million dogs and cats new york city collectively with two individual defendants,the city has long worked to address a tangle of problems surrounding the companion animal business including irresponsible breeding of animals destined for the city market,their subsequent sale to unwitting consumers,and an overpopulation of unwanted animals.armed with a new grant of authority from the legislature,the city enacted a package of laws in that aimed to mitigate these issues by regulating the sale of dogs and cats in pet shops.
on the day they were to take effect,the new york pet welfare association nypwa brought this suit to block two of these mandates.the first the sourcing law requires that pet shops sell only animals acquired from breeders holding a class a license issued under the federal animal welfare act awa,and the second the law requires that pet shops sterilize each animal before releasing it to a consumer.nypwa claims that the sourcing law violates the dormant commerce clause and is preempted by the awa,and that the law is preempted by new york law the district judge dismissed nypwa entire complaint.pet welfare ass n,city of new york,supp.gleeson.nypwa appeals,and we affirm 
background 
federal,state,and city regulation of commerce in animals 
the commercial breeding and sale of companion animals is subject to a web of overlapping federal,state,and local regulation.the animal welfare act,et,is the only federal law addressed to the trade and treatment of dogs and cats intended for use as pets.the awa applies broadly,covering any dealer a person who,in commerce,for compensation or profit,delivers for transportation,or transports,except as a carrier,buys,or sells,or negotiates the purchase or sale of any dog or other animal for use as a pet,id.f but the statute itself does not deal in details.rather,it sets up a general structure and tells the secretary of agriculture to fill in the blanks.the awa requires most dealers to be federally licensed,id,but leaves it to the secretary to design the licensing scheme,see id,and define specific standards of care that dealers must abide by,id.a.
the secretary has created three licensing categories of dealers class a breeders,class b distributors,and exempt breeders.class a breeders include all dealers subject to licensure whose business involving animals consists only of animals that are bred and raised on the premises.class b distributors include all dealers subject to licensure whose business includes the purchase resale of any animal,including brokers who negotiate or arrange for the purchase or sale of animals,but do not take possession or ownership of them.id.exempt breeders do not need licenses so long as they have four or fewer breeding females,and sell only their offspring.a iii,vii.
despite its breadth,the awa has always explicitly contemplated continuing state and local regulation of commerce in animals.the act authorizes the secretary to cooperate with the officials of the various states or political subdivisions thereof in effectuating the purposes of this act and of any state or municipal legislation or ordinance on the same subject.pub.b,stat,codified as amended at b.moreover,in,congress directed that the federal standards applicable to dealers under the awa shall not prohibit any state from promulgating standards in addition to those promulgated by the secretary.pub.b,stat,codified at a.
indeed,many states have specifically regulated the sale of dogs and cats.many of these laws are motivated by concern that commercial breeders often maligned whether fairly or not as puppy mills prioritize profit over humane treatment and responsible breeding,and target them for special scrutiny.see,agric.mkts.law requiring yearly inspections of dealers who sell more than animals per year see also american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals,state puppy mill chart last updated june,archived at.
in addition to regulating large breeders directly,some jurisdictions have also opted to regulate the pet shops through which poorly bred or animals are often sold.some of these laws simply provide consumers additional protection by strengthening warranties and mandating disclosures about the animal.see,bus.law.over the last several years,however,many jurisdictions have enacted laws that sharply limit or simply eliminate pet shops ability to acquire dogs and cats from commercial sources.three states limit pet shops sale of commercially bred dogs to animals obtained from federal licensees with clean records and numerous local governments have gone farther,banning pet shops from selling any animal not acquired from a shelter or humane society 
until recently,new york law blocked any efforts by the city to regulate its own pet shops.the pet dealer act,ch,laws,codified at agric.mkts.law repealed bus.law repealed,expressly preempted any local law regulating or licensing pet dealers.in the legislature changed course,explicitly providing that nothing in the pet dealer act should be construed to limit or restrict any municipality from enacting or enforcing a local law governing pet dealers including a law governing the source of animals sold or offered for sale by pet dealers,and the spay or neuter of such animals.act of,ch,laws codified as amended at agric.mkts.law bus.law.
ii.the challenged laws 
shortly thereafter,the new york city council began considering several new laws regulating pet shops.after multiple hearings and extensive testimony on the proposed regulations,the city enacted,inter alia,the sourcing law,local law,codified as amended at admin.code,and the law,local law,codified as amended at admin.code b.
the sourcing law provides that city pet shops may obtain dogs or cats only directly from class a breeders who sell only animals bred and raised on their own premises.admin.code a.moreover,pet shops may buy only from breeders whose federal license has not been suspended within the last five years,have not been recently cited for violating the awa by the department of agriculture,see id.a,and provide a sworn affidavit that they have never been convicted of violating certain animal protection laws,id.a.pet shops are also expressly forbidden from selling animals knowingly obtained from class b distributors who purchase and resell animals,id.b,and forbidden by implication from selling animals obtained from exempt breeders who can not obtain a class a license because they have fewer than five breeding females.notably,the same sourcing rules do not apply to animal shelters or animal rescue organizations.
the law prohibits pet shops from releasing any dog or cat to a consumer unless it has been sterilized by a veterinarian.id.b.the law specifically defines sterilization as such an operation performed on a dog or cat that is at least eight weeks of age and that weighs at least two pounds.id.i.animal shelters are also generally required to sterilize dogs and cats before releasing them,id.a,but their obligation to do so is subject to a number of exceptions not applicable to pet shops,see id.a.

federal preemption 
obstacle preemption 
nypwa argues that the district judge erred in holding that the sourcing law is not preempted by the awa.there are several categories of preemption,see generally arizona united states,but nypwa alleges only that one obstacle preemption applies here.federal law preempts conflicting state laws,and the supreme court has long recognized that a conflict exists when a state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of federal law.id.at quoting hines davidowitz.nypwa argues that the sourcing law obstructs the animal welfare act by interfering with its system of licensing for animal dealers.we disagree.
preemption analysis rests on two fundamental principles.wyethv.levine.first,every preemption case starts with the presumption that congress did not intend to displace state law.id.because this presumption rests on our respect for the states as independent sovereigns in our federal system,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,it is especially strong in areas where states traditionally wield police powers,in re mtbe prods.liab,cir.see also hillman maretta.the heavy burden of overcoming this presumption falls on the party alleging preemption,entergy nuclear.yankee,llc shumlin,cir.citing silkwood,who must show that the conflict between the federal and state laws is so direct and positive that the two can not be reconciled or consistently stand together,in re mtbe,at quoting madeira affordable hous,cir.
second,since preemption is ultimately a question of statutory construction,it is always a matter of intent,even where that intent must be inferred.in re tribune.fraudulent conveyance,cir,petition for cert.pending,filed.we look to the intent of congress to determine the preemptive force of a statute,but in evaluating preemption by a regulation,we focus on the agency intent,city of new york.divining congress intent is always a matter of judgment,to be informed by examining the federal scheme as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.crosby foreign trade council.we apply the same ordinary principles whether the relevant federal law is a statute or a regulation.see geier am.honda motor.we turn to that inquiry now.
b.the animal welfare act does not preempt the sourcing law 
because obstacle analysis hinges on the purposes of the federal scheme,we must first ascertain those objectives as they relate to the federal law s at issue.in re mtbe,at.nypwa federal preemption claim is very specific,arguing only that the sourcing law obstructs the system of dealer licenses authorized by the awa and implemented by the secretary of agriculture.the threshold task,then,is to determine the purpose of that licensure scheme as it relates to the broader objectives of the awa and its implementing regulations.
nevertheless,despite nypwa narrow focus,neither party squarely addresses the issue.the city argues wrongly that the awa does not preempt the sourcing law because they share the goal of promoting the humane treatment of animals.broad harmony of purpose will not save a state law from preemption if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach its goal.int l paper oullette.nypwa misses the point as well when it focuses too narrowly on the fact that the sourcing law blocks particular pet dealers from acting in ways that federal law standing alone would allow.it explains how those strictures interfere with the business models of individual licensees,but not how they interfere with the role of the licensing system in advancing the statute overall goals.the question is whether the sourcing law blocks the licensure system from fulfilling the specific role that congress and the secretary of agriculture intend it to play in advancing the goals of the awa.
neither congress nor the secretary has explained the purpose of licensure in the overall awa scheme.nevertheless,a careful analysis of the awa provisions suggests that licensure is best understood as a system of compulsory registration designed to require dealers to provide information that would facilitate the act objective of creating a nationwide system of animal welfare inspections.
inspections are central to the awa the statute directs the secretary to carry out inspections to determine whether dealers are violating the act,a,and requires that federal inspectors have access to dealers premises,animals,and records,id.the regulations implementing that provision give federal officials broad latitude to inspect and document all aspects of a dealer business without giving prior notice.see.indeed,the portion of the statute captioned administration and enforcement deals exclusively with empowering the secretary to inspect and otherwise investigate regulated parties.see.put simply,the secretary nationwide authority to proactively inspect for violations is the awa primary enforcement mechanism.see department of agriculture,animal welfare act enforcement last modified,archived at.
of course,to make a nationwide inspection program effective,the secretary has to know what to inspect.at a minimum,he has to know who the dealers are and where to find them.but that presents a problem how is the secretary supposed to get that information to be sure,congress could have directed him to simply start looking for dealers on his own.but even in the awa swept broadly,covering live dogs,cats,monkeys,guinea pigs,hamsters,and rabbits,see pub.h,stat,and the job of finding every dog and cat dealer in the united states to say nothing of its hamsters would have been enough to make the secretary,in his few,fleeting,hopeful moments,wish longingly to trade places with sisyphus.the awa aims to solve this problem through a system of compulsory licensure.in requiring dealers to obtain federal licenses,the act and the secretary regulations require regulated parties to make themselves known to regulators,and to turn over the information that is pertinent to enforcing the act.
we also note that this view of licensure as facilitating inspection finds some measure of support in the department of agriculture approach to the awa.wyeth levine,noting that courts may consider an agency explanation of how state law affects federal regulation.its regulations,for example,generally do not prescribe the information required to obtain a license,except to expressly require that applicants provide a mailing address and a valid premises address where animals,animal facilities,equipment,and records may be inspected for compliance.a.the secretary decision to require a satisfactory inspection as a precondition to the issuance of a license also suggests that the agency intends licensure to further the awa enforcement mechanisms.see b.moreover,in a recent statement of basis and purpose,the secretary justified his decision to exempt certain small breeders from licensing on the grounds that,as facilities,they did not need federal oversight.fed.reg.since inspection constitutes the bulk of oversight,the agency decision to forego licensing where oversight is unnecessary is consistent with our view that licensure is an administrative mechanism meant to facilitate the inspection regime that gives the awa teeth.
the second step in our analysis is ascertaining whether the sourcing law stands as an obstacle to that purpose.it clearly does not.breeders and distributors ability to sell to city pet shops has no bearing on the licensing scheme ability to facilitate federal enforcement activities.distributors will still have to get licenses,will still have to provide information to federal officials,and will still have to open their facilities to federal inspection.and of course,exempt breeders will still be excluded from the licensing system as a matter of federal law.
nypwa preemption arguments are meritless 
nypwa arguments appear to rest on a very different view of licensure role that is never clearly articulated,but that we nevertheless consider and reject.nypwa argues that the awa regulations grant animal dealers a federal right to engage in any line of business they wish without state interference.nypwa finds these rights in both federal action licensing certain animal dealers and federal inaction determining that other animal dealers do not need licenses.the unspoken but inescapable implication of nypwa position is that the secretary intent was simply to preempt the field of trade in animals.
where congress legislates in an area that is within the states traditional police powers,intent to preempt the field will ordinarily not be inferred unless such intent is clear and manifest.english,internal quotation marks omitted.this is just such a field,see,reid colorado,upholding a state statute regulating trade in cattle and horses sourced from certain areas as a valid exercise of police powers,and we do not detect the requisite intent in the licensure system.the mere creation of a federal licensing scheme does not indicate that congress wanted to displace state law.see.lime avocado growers,paul.
significantly,the text of the awa unambiguously envisions continuing state animal welfare regulation.congress has expressly authorized the secretary,in implementing the act,to cooperate with local officials in carrying out the purposes of the awa and of any state,local,or municipal legislation or ordinance on the same subject.b.the secretary may preempt only to the extent that congress has delegated him the power to do so.fid.fed.sav.and loan ass de la cuesta.section b explicit grant of authority to the secretary to cooperate with state officials carrying out state law makes it clear that congress did not intend that the statute displace all state regulation of the field.
ii.commerce clause 
the commerce clause empowers congress to regulate commerce among the several states,const.art.i,cl,but also has a corresponding negative or dormant aspect that limits the power of local governments to enact laws affecting interstate commerce.town of southold town of east hampton,cir.analysis of state and local laws under the dormant commerce clause treads a path.first,we determine whether the challenged law discriminates against interstate commerce,or regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce.id.
in this context,discrimination means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality,see also automated salvage,wheelabrator envtl,cir.discriminatory laws are permissible only if the state shows they are demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.wyoming oklahoma.this justification must show a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.dep t of revenue ofky.davis,quoting oregon waste,at.
laws that impose only incidental burdens on interstate commerce,however,are subject to a much more forgiving standard.under the balancing test of pike bruce church,we will uphold a nondiscriminatory law unless the challenger shows that the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.
b.the sourcing law does not discriminate against interstate commerce 
the supreme court has recognized three modes of discrimination against interstate commerce a law may discriminate on its face,harbor a discriminatory purpose,or discriminate in its effect.town of southold,at.on appeal,nypwa raises three different theories of discriminatory effect.
first,nypwa contends that the sourcing law discriminates against breeders,because many not all,see second amended complaint at,of them can not afford the expense of reaching the new york city marketplace except by selling to class b distributors,who resell animals to pet shops but are now prohibited from engaging in such commerce within the city.the commerce clause,however,protects the interstate market,not particular interstate firms.exxon maryland.the sourcing law may make it difficult or impossible for some breeders to sell to city pet shops,but so long as others are able to,interstate commerce is not subjected to an impermissible burden simply because a regulation causes some business to shift from one interstate supplier to another.id.
based on nypwa complaint,we have every reason to believe that some breeders will sell directly to city pet shops.after all,nypwa alleges that pet shops depend on puppy sales for a significant portion of their revenues,second amended complaint at,and that the vast majority of class a breeders are located outside new york,id.with or without the sourcing law,city pet shops will need to import puppies into new york,and the interstate market will have every incentive to meet demand.the sourcing law is not invalid merely because it favors breeders who are able to make direct sales over those who are not.
nypwa second theory of discriminatory effect is that by shifting the city pet market away from pet shops which buy most of their animals from dealers outside new york and towards animal shelters and rescues rescue entities,the sourcing law disadvantages pet dealers in favor of local rescue entities for access to the city pet market.the city,in turn,contends that commercial dealers and rescue entities are so dissimilarly situated as to be incomparable.see motors tracy.we need not resolve the city argument,because even assuming that the two are similarly situated,nypwa still fails to show discrimination against interstate commerce.the complaint alleges that rescue entities are vigorous participants in the interstate market for companion animals.rescue entities obtain dogs and cats from across the country,second amended complaint at,which they sell throughout the city,id.to the extent the sourcing law makes it easier for rescue entities,and harder for breeders,to compete in the city,it merely shifts business from one interstate actor to another.
finally,nypwa argues that the sourcing law discriminates against interstate commerce because the vast majority of class b distributors who buy from breeders for resale to pet shops,and are barred by the sourcing law from selling to city pet shops are located outside new york.the supreme court has considered and rejected the argument that a statute is discriminatory because it will apply most often to entities in a market that has more than participants,cts dynamics.of,and there is no need to say any more here.
c.the sourcing law survives pike balancing 
because the sourcing law does not discriminate against interstate commerce,under the pike balancing test,we will uphold it unless nypwa can show that the incidental burden it imposes on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the local benefits.at.an incidental burden is one that weighs more heavily on interstate commerce than intrastate commerce.town of southold,at quoting mfrs.ass sorrell,cir.we have recognized three types of incidental burdens regulations that have a disparate impact on in versus entities,laws that regulate beyond the state borders,and laws that create regulatory inconsistencies between states.id.quoting united haulers ass n,solid waste mgmt,aff.
first,nypwa fails sufficiently to allege that the burden of selling directly to city pet shops,rather than through distributors,will fall disproportionately on breeders.even drawing the extremely favorable inference that the burden of direct sales will correlate directly with the seller distance from the city,nypwa still has not pled a disparate impact.the cost of doing business in many markets is higher for faraway sellers than for nearby ones,and the sourcing law does not violate the commerce clause merely because of that fact.where the cost of compliance with the sourcing law would be the same in pittsburgh as in buffalo,the law can not be said to impose a special burden on interstate commerce.
second,nypwa does not demonstrate that the sourcing law directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside of new york.see healy beer.it argues that the sourcing law will have such an effect when exempt breeders increase the scale of their operations in order to qualify for class a licenses,which are only available to breeders with more than four breeding females.the commerce clause,however,does not void every law that causes behavior to change in other states.rather,the measure of extraterritoriality is whether the sourcing law inescapably require s breeders to operate on the city terms even when doing business elsewhere.see mfrs.ass sorrell,cir.that standard is not met here,where the sourcing law attaches no significance to breeders conduct with respect to animals sold outside the city.
finally,nypwa has pled no facts indicating that the sourcing law is in substantial conflict with a common regulatory scheme in place in other states.id.at.the complaint contains no allegations at all that the sourcing law will create an interstate regulatory conflict.even if we were to consider allegations raised for the first time on appeal,nypwa opening brief simply concludes,without support,that the sourcing law conflicts with the laws
