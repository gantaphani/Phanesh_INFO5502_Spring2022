kevin gagnon,doing business as mister computer gagnon,appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of asset marketing systems,ams.gagnon contends that ams infringed his copyright in six computer programs that he wrote for ams by continuing to use and modify them without his consent,and that ams misappropriated trade secrets contained in the programs source code.gagnon also challenges the denial of his ex parte application for an order denying or continuing summary judgment.the district court concluded that gagnon had granted ams an unlimited,implied license to use,modify,and retain the source code of the programs that defeated his copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation claims.the district court also denied gagnon ex parte application.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court.
factual and procedural background 
ams and gagnon relationship 
ams is a field marketing organization offering sales and marketing support to insurance marketing entities.from may to september,gagnon was an,independent contractor for ams,hired to assist with its information technology needs.subsequently,gagnon was asked to develop custom software for ams.ams was gagnon largest client,accounting for of his business.jay akerstein,a partner at ams who later became the chief operating officer,was gagnon primary contact.over the course of their relationship,ams paid gagnon over million,of which was for custom software development and computer classes.gagnon developed six computer programs for ams.
in may,ams and gagnon entered a technical services agreement tsa,which was scheduled to expire on april.the tsa,printed on mister computer letterhead,set forth gagnon fees and the services to be provided.the services included custom application will provide contractor with specific products to enhance contractor current database application,and mentioned nothing about a license.the tsa was not renewed,though the relationship continued.
ams claims that on june,gagnon signed a vendor nondisclosure agreement nda the nda would have given ams ownership of all intellectual property developed for ams by gagnon.gagnon claims that the document is a forgery and that his signature can not be authenticated.
in june,gagnon proposed that ams execute an outside vendor agreement ova.the ova included a proprietary rights clause providing 
client agrees that all designs,plans,specifications,drawings,inventions,processes,and other information or items produced by contractor while performing services under this agreement will be the property of contractor and will be licensed to client on a basis as will any copyrights,patents,or trademarks obtained by contractor while performing services under this agreement.on request and at contractor expense,client agrees to help contractor obtain patents and copyrights for any new developments.this includes providing data,plans,specifications,descriptions,documentation,and other information,as well as assisting contractor in completing any required application or registration.any source code or intellectual property will remain the property of contractor.trademarks,service marks,or any items identifying said company shall remain the company said property.contractor will allow company non exclusive,unlimited licensing of software developed for company.
akerstein declined to execute the ova,but countered with a redlined version of the ova,which substantially rewrote the proprietary rights clause to read 
contractor agrees that all designs,plans,specifications,drawings,inventions,processes,and other information or items produced by contractor while performing services under this agreement will be the sole property of client.any source code or intellectual property agreed to and documented as contractor will remain the property of contractor.
by the end of june,ams had decided to terminate gagnon services.ams extended an employment offer to gagnon,but he declined to accept the offer.ams and gagnon then discussed an exit strategy,and by late july,the parties had set a target exit date of september.
in august,gagnon responded to akerstein redlined ova draft with a letter asserting that his position has always been that asset marketing systems shall be entitled to unlimited software licensing as long as my company had a business relationship with asset marketing systems.the parties never executed the ova.
in a letter to ams dated september,gagnon demanded million for ams to have the right to continue to use the programs and million for gagnon agreement not to sell or disclose the programs to ams competitors.
in a letter dated september,ams terminated its relationship with gagnon.according to ams,a consultant identified numerous problems with gagnon work.it also stated 
recently,we had discussed employee and intellectual property issues which have yet to be resolved.despite the foregoing,i learned that we did not have copies of the source code for the software we developed and that copies of our saleslogix software and our entire database may be maintained by you and your agents offsite.
the letter then demanded 
in connection with that separation,you must immediately provide any and all copies of the source code for all software developed by and on behalf of asset marketing systems immediately.you are not authorized to utilize that software which we believe is owned and all copyrights belong to asset marketing systems.furthermore,despite your claimed ownership in that copyright,we believe that asset marketing systems trade secrets are embedded and utilized throughout that software which would preclude use by you as well.
we also demand that you return to us any copies of the saleslogix software or asset marketing databases,programs or other materials that may have come into your possession during our relationship.
also on september,seven of gagnon twelve employees resigned and were hired by ams to provide directly to ams the same services they previously provided to ams through gagnon.according to ams,gagnon former employees approached ams for jobs,and ams never solicited them.gagnon disputes this.each employee had signed an employee work agreement with gagnon.the agreement specified that the intellectual property arising out of or related to work performed for gagnon was his property.the employment agreement also stated that all information relating to ams disclosed to employee by employer,and all information generated by employee in the performance of the above work is a valuable trade secret of employer to be treated as confidential and safeguarded.finally,the employees agreed not to engage in any employment or personal contractual agreement with ams for months without written consent from gagnon.
in october,gagnon sent ams a cease and desist letter,asserting that the use of the programs was unauthorized.it also asserted that the hiring of gagnon prior employees violated their employment agreement with him.gagnon demanded that ams certify that it had undertaken to remove all original and derivative source code and all related files for the programs from ams computers.
ams responded by asserting that gagnon could not unilaterally stop ams from continuing to use and update the programs because it had an irrevocable license to use,copy,and modify the programs based on the course of conduct of the parties over the past years.ams also asserted that gagnon could not use the programs because it contained ams trade secrets.ams also declined to pay gagnon the to million he had requested in september.
b.the programs 
specifically at issue are the six programs that gagnon created for ams.he included a copyright notice,copyright mister computer,in the splash screens for each program.
according to a declaration by one of gagnon former employees,the programs were designed to work with ams databases and included detailed information concerning ams network of sales persons,including information related to ams agent lists,their territories,and the criteria used by ams to qualify an agent or create a territory.the source code for these programs was installed on several of ams development computers,which were located at ams facilities the employee was not instructed by gagnon to maintain the source code at any location other than ams,and gagnon made no attempt to hide the source code from ams employees.
in his deposition,gagnon admitted that after he hired employees,the source code was stored on ams computers in the development room.the room could not be accessed without a pass that gagnon software developers and a few key ams personnel,including akerstein,possessed.gagnon never received any promises of confidentiality with respect to his trade secrets from the ams personnel who had passes to the development room nor did he discuss terms of a potential license or royalty agreement with them.
a week prior to his termination,gagnon registered the copyright for these six programs with the united states copyright office.
procedural history 
this case has a convoluted procedural history.the case began when ams filed a complaint in california superior court against kevin gagnon,mister computer,two of his employees and gagnon new company,national marketing technologies alleging,among other things,misappropriation of trade secrets and conversion.gagnon removed the case to federal court.gagnon then filed counterclaims,alleging copyright infringement,unfair competition under california law,misappropriation of trade secrets,interference with contractual relations,intentional interference with prospective business advantage,negligent interference with prospective business advantage,and sought accounting and declaratory relief declaring gagnon the copyright owner of the programs.the district court then judge jones remanded ams claims back to the state court.ams then filed its remanded state law claims as to gagnon federal.
the district court subsequently granted ams motion for summary judgment as to gagnon counterclaims.the court found that gagnon had granted ams an implied,nonexclusive license to use,modify,and retain the source code of the programs.consequently,gagnon trade secret misappropriation claim was also defeated,and because no trade secret existed as between gagnon and ams with respect to the source code,gagnon noncompetition agreements were deemed invalid under california law.for the same reasons,gagnon remaining state law claims failed.
the court also denied gagnon ex parte applications for an order denying or continuing summary judgment and to file written objections to evidence.gagnon ex parte application requested a continuance to obtain the backup tapes of ams computers because they might contain emails establishing ams allegedly unlawful solicitation of gagnon employees,and would establish the location of the source code at all relevant times.
the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be denied because it was untimely,and the district court judge adopted that recommendation.the district court first reasoned that because the clause in gagnon employment agreements was unenforceable under california law,any emails evidencing solicitation were irrelevant.second,because gagnon had already admitted that the source code was located on ams computers,computer backup tapes conclusively locating the source code on ams computers were unnecessary.third,the motion was untimely because gagnon did not request the continuance until after the motion for summary judgment was fully briefed by both parties.gagnon was able to file his opposition to summary judgment without raising any discovery objections,and several days later,counsel for both parties requested a stay of pending discovery issues until summary judgment.gagnon filed his ex parte motion a week after the district court ordered the case submitted,causing undue delay in the resolution of both the summary judgment motion and the discovery motion.
gagnon next filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.the case was then reassigned from judge jones to judge brewster.at that point,the parties stipulated to a dismissal of all,and ams moved for attorneys fees and costs.gagnon appealed the grant of summary judgment.the district court then indicated that it wished to reconsider its order granting summary judgment and stayed the proceedings regarding the attorney fees.gagnon successfully moved this court for a limited remand so that judge brewster could reconsider judge jones grant of summary judgment.after remand,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration,deferred resolution of attorneys fees until the resolution of the appeal,and returned the case to this court.

discussion 
copyright infringement claim 
gagnon alleges that ams continued use of the six programs constitutes copyright infringement because the programs were used by ams without its obtaining a license or gagnon permission.ams asserts three defenses to gagnon copyright infringement claim an implied license,a transfer of copyright ownership via the nda,and.we hold that ams has an implied unlimited license for the programs,and we do not reach the other defenses asserted by ams.
though exclusive licenses must be in writing,grants of nonexclusive licenses need not be in writing,and may be granted orally or by implication.foad consulting group,azzalino,cir.we have previously considered the grant of an implied license in the context of movie footage and architectural drawings.effects,cohen,cir.
in effects associates,a movie producer hired effects associates to create certain special effects for a movie.effects,at.though the film footage containing the special effects was used without the producer obtaining a written license from effects associates,we found that an implied license had been granted because the footage was created at the producer request with the intent that it be used in the film with no warning that use of the footage would constitute infringement.id.at.we determined that t o hold that effects did not at the same time convey a license to use the footage would mean that plaintiff contribution to the film was of minimal value,a conclusion that ca be squared with the fact that cohen paid effects almost for this footage.id.at.
thus,we have held that an implied license is granted when a person the licensee requests the creation of a work,the creator the licensor makes that particular work and delivers it to the licensee who requested it and the licensor intends that the copy and distribute his work,shaver,cir citing effects,at footnote added.we apply the same analysis we did in effects to implied licenses for computer programs.the last prong of the effects test,however,is not limited to copying and distribution instead we look at the protected right at,whether gagnon intended that ams use,retain,and modify the programs.
ams requested the creation of the programs 
gagnon argues that ams never specifically requested that he create the programs,but rather relayed its needs to gagnon and he satisfied them by providing either computer hardware or computer software at his discretion.we find this interpretation of request to be strained.gagnon did not create the programs on his own initiative and market them to ams rather,he created them in response to ams requests.moreover,after prototype software was developed,he made changes to the programs in response to akerstein and other ams employees requests.no genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether ams requested the programs.
gagnon created the software for ams and delivered it 
though gagnon argues that th
