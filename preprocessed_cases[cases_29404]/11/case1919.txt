plaintiff jerry roberts owned cable park shopping center the shopping center in his capacity as trustee of the vernon cable trust.he retained defendant patricia lomanto as his agent to sell the shopping center.lomanto eventually offered to buy the property in her capacity as trustee of her family trust the parties executed a purchase agreement which stated the price as million.
while still acting as roberts agent,lomanto assigned the contract to a third party buyer,with roberts consent.although lomanto disclosed to roberts that the third party was paying her an assignment fee,she refused to disclose the amount of the fee or the price the buyer had agreed to pay.after the deal had gone through,roberts learned that lomanto assignment fee was million and the buyer had paid million for the property including the assignment fee.
roberts filed suit against lomanto,seeking damages and equitable relief on multiple theories.on for summary judgment,the trial court granted lomanto motion and denied roberts motion,finding lomanto had not breached any duty to roberts.
we disagree with the trial court conclusion that lomanto breached no duty to roberts.rather,we conclude that lomanto,who was at all times acting as roberts agent and owed him a fiduciary duty,breached that duty by refusing to disclose to roberts the details of the assignment transaction.we shall therefore reverse the summary judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.

the complaint 
the first amended complaint,which is the operative one,begins this action arises from a real estate broker taking of secret profits in commercial real estate transactions with her client.it then alleges 
lomanto was the exclusive listing agent and the exclusive leasing agent for the shopping center at all times after june.in the listing agreement between roberts and lomanto,she agreed her compensation would be limited to percent of the sales price.
on or about august,lomanto made an unsolicited offer to buy the shopping center from roberts she represented that it was not worth more than million,and that she could arrange financing to close the deal promptly.thereafter,she did not present any other buyers to roberts.
relying on lomanto expertise and the trust he reposed in her,roberts entered into a written contract of purchase and sale with her on october.although this agreement did not require consummation of the purchase until may,lomanto was unwilling to complete it by then subsequently,at lomanto request,the agreement was extended and modified.
after certain contingencies in the agreement were removed,lomanto informed roberts she would not close the transaction in her own name and requested permission to assign her rights to pan pacific.roberts agreed to the assignment on lomanto express representations that the property was still worth no more than million.lomanto knew it was worth much more,but misrepresented the facts to induce roberts to sell it for less than its true value.
during the close of escrow,lomanto advised roberts regarding many details and met with him for hours to resolve the final points.although she provided him one document disclosing her receipt of an assignment fee from pan pacific,she did not disclose its amount nor did she disclose any information to correct her claim that the shopping center was worth no more than million.
after escrow closed,roberts paid lomanto as her commission on the sale.thereafter,he read in the newspaper that pan pacific had bought the shopping center for million.he immediately called lomanto to ask about the discrepancy between this price and the million he had received.lomanto claimed she did not understand it.roberts now believes that,in breach of lomanto agreement to limit her compensation to percent of the sales price,she received an undisclosed profit of million on the transaction,which she has refused to pay to roberts.
lomanto conduct was wrongful on theories including fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,constructive fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract,common count money had and received,and violation of business and professions code section et sequitur.roberts is entitled to general and special damages of not less than million and exemplary damages according to proof,plus restoration of commissions of not less than.the court should also impose a constructive trust on lomanto and require an accounting from her.
the evidence 
the following facts,which were adduced upon the motions for summary judgment,were undisputed.
lomanto,a licensed real estate broker,became the exclusive leasing agent for the shopping center in.in,roberts became the successor trustee of the cable trust,which owned the shopping center.lomanto remained the leasing agent for the shopping center until it was sold.
in,roberts undertook to sell the shopping center.on june,he entered into an exclusive sales listing agreement with lomanto the parties extended the agreement on february.the extended agreement expired by its terms on december.
during the period of lomanto listing agreement,she submitted several third party letters of intent to roberts.none resulted in a sale.
on october,lomanto in her capacity as trustee of the family trust entered into a purchase agreement with roberts to buy the shopping center for million.however,a required contingency did not occur.the agreement thereafter expired by its terms.
on july,after the expiration date on the face of lomanto sales listing agreement,roberts and lomanto entered into a second purchase agreement under which lomanto again agreed to buy the shopping center for million.this agreement contained the following provision,repeated verbatim from the prior purchase agreement contingencies.american stores.seller acknowledges that buyers principal,patricia lomanto,is and has been seller exclusive agent for leasing and selling of the property and in that capacity has ongoing responsibility for negotiating a new ground lease with american stores or its successor buyers acknowledge that their principal,lomanto,shall continue to exercise her best efforts on seller behalf in this regard and is not in any respect released from her fiduciary obligations.italics added.the agreement also provided,under the heading,good faith performance buyers and sellers shall each,diligently and in good faith,undertake all actions and procedures reasonably required to place the escrow in condition for closing as and when required by this agreement.the agreement further provided that the buyer could assign her rights to a third party only with the seller prior consent.
on or about november,pan pacific retail properties,pan pacific solicited lomanto about assigning her rights under the second purchase agreement to pan pacific.she replied positively.
on november,lomanto and pan pacific entered into an assignment and assumption of purchase and option agreement.under this agreement,lomanto assigned her right to purchase the shopping center to pan pacific in return for an assignment fee of million.the agreement gives the a ssumption p rice for the shopping center as million.
also on november,roberts executed a written consent to the assignment.this document does not state any of the assignment terms,other than the assignee name.
on december,lomanto instructed the escrow holder to pay her a brokerage commission of out of the sales proceeds on the transaction at close of escrow.
on or around december,the parties met to sign the closing papers for escrow.at this time,roberts and his attorney learned that lomanto would get an assignment fee however,lomanto refused to disclose its amount.roberts signed the escrow instructions and closing documents without objection.
the transaction closed on or around december,and pan pacific received title to the shopping center.pan pacific paid million in consideration for lomanto assignment of her contract rights.lomanto also received her commission from roberts.
summary judgment 
after lomanto answered the complaint and the parties engaged in discovery,both sides filed motions for summary judgment.
the trial court issued an order granting lomanto motion and denying roberts.after finding that the material facts were undisputed,the trial court reasoned 
the second purchase agreement is a standard sale agreement,as lomanto argues.as stated in the agreement,however,lomanto was acting as roberts agent and owed him some fiduciary duties until the purchase agreement closed.
these duties did not include disclosing the amount of her assignment fee.first,roberts could not unreasonably withhold his consent to the assignment.second,the amount of the fee was not a material fact requiring disclosure because roberts completed the transaction after being told that that amount was confidential.
based on this reasoning,the trial court summarily denied roberts motion.
the trial court thereafter entered judgment in favor of lomanto.roberts filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
ithe complaint 
first,we must identify roberts cause of action.although his complaint alleges numerous legal theories,he asserted on summary judgment that it states only one cause of action breach of fiduciary duty.it is that cause of action we shall review.
a triable issue of material fact exists with respect to whether lomanto was at all times acting as roberts selling agent 
although lomanto disputed her role as roberts selling agent on summary judgment,she does not directly attack the trial court finding that,for purposes of summary judgment,she was indeed roberts agent at all relevant times.in a footnote,however,she repeats her prior assertion that her fiduciary duties after the negotiation of the second purchase agreement were restricted to her role as leasing agent.we disregard this assertion because it is not raised in a properly headed argument.cal.rules of court,rule a b opdyk california horse racing bd.th,fn,d.in any event,it lacks merit on summary judgment,because the second purchase agreement plainly states that patricia lomanto is seller exclusive agent for selling of the property the fact that this clause goes on to describe a specific fiduciary duty with respect to lomanto role as leasing agent is hardly enough to prove as a matter of law that the clause was meant to deal with only that form of agency.moreover,lomanto requested and received a commission on the sale of the shopping center because she was roberts selling agent.in short,the evidence on summary judgment,at the very least,creates a triable issue of fact with respect to whether lomanto was roberts selling agent at all times material to the sales transaction.
triable issues of material fact exist with respect to whether lomanto breached her fiduciary duty 
to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,a plaintiff must show the existence of a fiduciary relationship,its breach,and damage proximately caused by that breach.pierce lyman th,d.it is not disputed that roberts pleaded these elements.to be entitled to summary judgment,therefore,lomanto had to show that roberts could not establish a triable issue of fact on at least one element or that an affirmative defense bars recovery.code civ,subds.o,p.lomanto has not met her burden.
fiduciary duties of real estate agents 
the law imposes on a real estate agent the same obligation of undivided service and loyalty that it imposes on a trustee in favor of his beneficiary.citations.this relationship not only imposes upon him the duty of acting in the highest good faith towards his principal but precludes the agent from obtaining any advantage over the principal in any transaction had by virtue of his agency.citation.such an agent is charged with the duty of fullest disclosure of all material facts concerning the transaction that might affect the principal decision.citations.batson strehlow cal d,see also field century realty th,d jorgensen beach bay realty,d.ford cournale d.
when a broker is engaged by an owner to market the owner property,an agency relationship is created.the agent has fiduciary duties to the seller to disclose all material facts.if the agent,or a relative or associate of the agent,purchases the property,the agent fiduciary duties continue even though he or she may be a principal in the transaction.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,miller starr italics added,footnotes omitted.in other words,o nce an agency relationship has been created between the agent and the seller,the agent is not absolved of fiduciary duties merely because he or she is also buying or selling as a principal,italics added.thus,o ne who acts as an agent and also deals with his principal as to the subject matter of the agency can not take advantage of his principal by withholding from him information secured by means of the agency.rattray scudder cal d,rattray see also steve schmidt berry d.
a real estate licensee who claim s or tak es any secret or undisclosed amount of compensation,commission or profit or fail s to reveal to the employer of such licensee the full amount of such licensee compensation,commission or profit under any agreement authorizing or employing such licensee to do any acts for which a license is required,is subject to discipline by the real estate commissioner.bus,subd.g.such a licensee also violates his or her fiduciary duties toward the employer and will not be allowed to retain the undisclosed profit a real estate licensee,while acting in his or her capacity as such,must not receive any benefit from the transaction of his or her agency other than that which is known and accepted by the principal.the agent will not be permitted to retain anything that might otherwise derive from participation in the transaction unless the agent fully discloses the nature and amount of the benefit and receives the approval of the principal.it is totally immaterial that the transaction is otherwise fair to the principal,or that the principal receives exactly the price wanted for the property miller starr,supra,first second italics original,others added footnotes omitted see also crogan metz cal d,bate marsteller d.menzel salka d.bell scudder d.t he principal right to recover does not depend on any deceit of the agent,but is based upon the duties incident to the agency relationship and upon the fact that all profits resulting from that relationship belong to the principal.crogan metz,supra,cal d at.
the scope of lomanto fiduciary duties toward roberts 
lomanto asserts that whatever fiduciary duties she owed were fully discharged as a matter of law before roberts consented to her assignment.we disagree.
the parties continue to dispute the character of their second purchase agreement,apparently seeing this point as dispositive on the scope of lomanto duty.as we explain,it is not.
lomanto asserts that,as the trial court found,the parties second purchase agreement was a binding and enforceable contract of purchase and sale as soon as the parties executed it.relying on mcpherson real estate commissioner d,mcpherson,lomanto maintains that her fiduciary duties to roberts terminated when the parties executed the purchase agreement.
roberts continues to assert that either the second purchase agreement merely gave lomanto an option,or that if it was a contract of purchase and sale it was not binding and enforceable when executed.he relies on rattray,supra,cal d at,which holds that where a seller agent has an option to purchase the seller property,the agent may not find another buyer willing to pay a higher price,then exercise the option,then resell the property to the other buyer without full disclosure to the seller.
we conclude that mcpherson,supra,d,is distinguishable without regard to the nature of the contracts in that case,and in any event does not stand for the sweeping proposition asserted by lomanto.we also conclude that the holding of rattray does not depend on whether the agent there had an option or a binding contract of sale.
in mcpherson,supra,d,a real estate discipline case,the subject broker was exonerated of making secret profits by fraud on the following facts the broker agent procured a buyer for the broker principal,the seller.the buyer and seller executed a written contract of sale.after putting down a deposit,the buyer wanted out of the deal.the broker agent told the seller he would try to resell the property for the buyer,but would need a commission.the seller said he did not care what was done with the property.the broker agent then got a second buyer and closed the deal with him at a higher price than the original selling price.the original seller testified he did not care that the property resold for a higher price and had no complaint against anyone.mcpherson,supra,d.
the trial court and the reviewing court rejected the real estate commission finding that the broker had unlawfully obtained a secret profit due to the higher resale price.the reviewing court found that once the broker had negotiated a binding contract of sale with which the seller was satisfied,he had completed his services to the seller.mcpherson,supra,d.the court then generalized while a real estate salesman owes to his client the highest degree of good faith once he has secured a binding and enforceable contract with a purchaser his services to his client have been performed.no case has been cited to us holding that under such circumstances the broker breaches any duty to the first client by then undertaking in good faith to make a second sale of the same property for the purchaser.italics added.
mcpherson is inapposite.unlike in our case,the broker there was not acting simultaneously as an agent and a principal,and did not arguably fail to disclose material facts to the seller.nor did the broker enter into a purchase agreement with the principal which expressly stated that the broker was still the principal selling agent.mcpherson,supra,d,see bate marsteller,supra,d.because the mcpherson court did not consider a case involving such facts,its purported rule,that an agent who obtains a binding contract for a client has no further duty toward the client,can not be extended to cover the situation in our case.ginns savage cal d,fn,cases not authority for propositions they do not consider.
as for rattray,supra,cal d,although the facts of the case involve an agent option,its holding goes beyond those facts.the court expressly located that situation within the compass of an agent general fiduciary duty to his principal one who acts as an agent and also deals with his principal as to the subject matter of the agency can not take advantage of his principal by withholding from him information secured by means of the agency.id.at.the court went on to find that the agent violated his fiduciary duty of disclosure toward the principal by failing to advise the principal fully about pending negotiations over the property,among other things.id.at.nothing in that holding depends on the fortuity that the agent had an option to buy the principal property,rather than a binding contract of sale.in fact,as we have discussed above,rattray is one of the leading cases establishing the rule that a real estate agent fiduciary duty toward his client does not terminate merely because the agent transacts business with his client as a principal.
thus,contrary to the parties belief,nothing at this stage turns on whether we construe their purchase agreement as a binding contract of sale,a nonbinding contract of sale,or an point we do not decide.whatever that agreement may be,its execution did not terminate lomanto fiduciary duties toward roberts.a real estate agent who has undertaken to represent a principal in a transaction does not cease to be his fiduciary merely because she enters the transaction as a principal in her own right.miller starr,supra.
lomanto breach 
lomanto asserts that as a matter of law she did not breach any fiduciary duties of disclosure toward roberts by refusing to reveal the amount of her assignment fee because that fact was not material to his decision to complete the sales transaction.we are not persuaded.
it is immaterial that lomanto did not know about the assignment when the parties executed the second purchase agreement.
lomanto asserts that she could not have breached her duty of disclosure to roberts by not telling him the amount of her fee because she had no knowledge of that fact before entering into the second purchase agreement with him.we disagree.lomanto argument depends on her claim that because the purchase agreement was a binding contract of sale,its execution completed the purposes of her agency toward roberts and ended her fiduciary duties to him.we have already rejected that claim.
to put it another way,lomanto argument depends on the premise that the second purchase agreement is the only material agreement in this case.that premise is mistaken.after pan pacific solicited lomanto about the assignment on or around november,she assigned her rights to pan pacific through a written contract executed on november.she knew when she executed that contract,and presumably earlier,that she would get an assignment fee of million and that pan pacific would pay a total purchase price of million.yet the written consent to the assignment she obtained from roberts on november,did not mention these facts it did not even disclose the existence of an assignment fee.it is immaterial that she did not know them when she entered into the second purchase agreement with roberts in july,because that agreement did not complete the transaction for which she served as his agent.lomanto contract of assignment with pan pacific,under which she in effect substituted pan pacific for herself as the buyer,became an essential part of the transaction,as did roberts consent to the assignment.thus lomanto duty of disclosure extended to the assignment.
lomanto has not shown as a matter of law that it would have been unreasonable for roberts to withhold consent to the assignment had he known the undisclosed facts.
lomanto asserts that the amount of her assignment fee was not material to roberts decision whether to consent to the assignment because he could not have unreasonably withheld consent and withholding consent would have been unreasonable where the assignee was ready,willing,and able to perform exactly as the assignor had agreed to do.we conclude that lomanto has not supported these claims.
as noted,a real estate agent fiduciary duty of disclosure extends to all material is,all facts that might affect the principal willingness to enter into or complete a transaction.see,batson strehlow,supra,cal d.the test of materiality is objective whether a reasonable person in the principal position would have acted differently had he known the undisclosed facts.jorgensen beach bay realty,supra,d.
to support her assertion that roberts could not have unreasonably withheld consent to the assignment,lomanto cites civil code section,which bars conditions restraining alienation when repugnant to the interest created.however,she does not explain how roberts refusal of co
