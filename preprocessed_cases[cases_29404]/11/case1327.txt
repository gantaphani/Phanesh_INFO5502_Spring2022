beal bank beal appeals the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment in favor of the debtor,crystal properties crystal.beal asserts that the bankruptcy and district courts incorrectly concluded that crystal was not required to pay interest at the default rate on seven defaulted loans beal acquired from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.the central issue is whether,and,if so,when,the default interest rate,as provided in the original loan agreement between beal predecessors and the ngs later crystal is triggered.beal argues that the default interest rate was triggered the moment the ngs failed to make interest payments to its predecessors early.crystal contends that the default rate became applicable after the first quarter of,when beal recorded the notices of default.we agree with the bankruptcy and district courts,concluding under authority,that the default interest rate did not apply to crystal loans until the first quarter of,when the holder first took affirmative action to put the debtor on notice that it intended to exercise its option to accelerate,and thus invoked the default rate under the contract at issue.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d,and we affirm.
background 
this case arises out of nine loans issued by guardian bank guardian to thien koan ng and carol ng,either directly or indirectly through one of the entities they controlled.each of the loans was executed in california.the collateral for the loans consisted of real property pledged promissory notes secured by real property in california.the contract rate set forth in each loan document was bank of america prime interest rate,plus one percent.each loan also included a premium interest rate clause providing that the unpaid balance would accelerate on default and bear interest at a rate higher than the contract rate.the premium interest rate clause or default interest clause in each note states 
should default be made in any payment provided for in this note,at the option of the holder hereof and without notice or demand,the entire balance of principal and accrued interest then remaining unpaid shall become immediately due and payable,and thereafter bear interest,until paid in full,at the increased rate of five percent per annum over and above the rate contracted for herein.no delay or omission on the part of the holder hereof in exercising any right hereunder,shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right under this note 
although the ngs originally acquired at least nine loans from guardian,only the seven loans set forth below are at issue in this appeal 
of these seven notes,three loans e,f,and g matured prior to the first quarter of date upon which the parties agreed the default interest rate became applicable.
by early,the ngs had missed payments on their loans.thien ng entered into negotiations with guardian to induce the bank to accept a fifteen percent discount on the loan balances.on january,the fdic placed guardian into conservatorship.after the fdic assumed control of guardian affairs,thien ng continued to attempt to negotiate a pay out.
on february,the fdic secured a written demand that the ngs bring their loans current and informed them that failure to do so would result in the fdic imposing the default rate.the letter notified the ngs that the fdic had frozen three of their accounts at guardian,but had not set off any outstanding loan balances against the funds held in the frozen accounts.although the letter concluded that the loans are in default,which involks sic the default interest clause,it contained no statement regarding the amount of the default interest rate or whether the fdic wished to accelerate the loans.
on march,the fdic again demanded that the ngs bring their loans current.this letter specifically stated that because the ngs had transferred the real property security for three loans identified in the letter only one of which is among the seven loans in this appeal to a third party,the fdic had triggered the default interest provision of the deeds of trust.notwithstanding that statement,the calculations of the principal and accrued interest owed to the fdic set forth in the letter were based on the contract not the default rate.
on may,the fdic communicated with the ngs again in a letter erroneously dated march.the correspondence included a list of the outstanding balances of remaining principal and unpaid interest calculated at the contract rate.this letter made no reference to the default interest clause.
ten days later,on may,the fdic wrote to the ngs outlining their negotiations about a possible discount on the outstanding loans.the fdic indicated that because guardian had negotiated a discount on the loans,it might be willing to consider a discount if the ngs provided financial statements and agreed to keep interest payments current during the negotiations.the letter also represented that the fdic would withhold taking action on the three loans discussed in the march letter during discount negotiations.
the fdic and the ngs subsequently reached an agreement to allow the ngs to pay off all outstanding loans at a discount.on august,the fdic sent the ngs an accounting statement calculating the principal and accrued interest due on each loan at the contract rate.the letter also noted that the agreement that we had entered into with you to allow a discounted payoff will expire on september.despite reaching this agreement,the ngs failed to make the negotiated payments to the fdic and never tendered the loan balances.
around december,guardian,through the fdic,assigned its beneficial rights in the ngs loans to beal.because beal could not reach any settlement agreement with the ngs as to the overall payoff amount,beal sent notices of acceleration and default to the ngs.by the first quarter of,beal recorded notices of default for all seven loans,an act that the parties agree was legally sufficient to trigger the default interest provision in the notes.
on june,crystal,a real estate venture corporation owned and controlled by the ngs,commenced a bankruptcy proceeding by filing a chapter petition in the central district of california.one day before crystal filed its chapter petition,the ngs transferred the real property collateral for the seven loans to crystal.to determine the maximum amount of beal claims,crystal filed a motion for estimation on august,which was granted.beal filed proofs of claims for the seven loans on september.
in april,the parties for summary judgment to determine,inter alia,whether beal was entitled to apply the default interest rate before the date it filed the notices of default.the bankruptcy court held that it was not 
the real question is,as has always been,can beal bank come in as a successor in interest and go back and retroactively apply default interest from a period long before it had any connection with this loan,notwithstanding anything else that went on,and the answer,i think,ca be yes.
the bankruptcy court further reasoned that it would be inequitable to allow beal to recover the default interest rate in a period during which it was not actively enforced by beal predecessors in interest.it concluded that the fdic and guardian had waived their right to default interest for the periods in which they were holders of the notes.
the bankruptcy court ruled on the remaining issues presented in the for summary judgment and entered final orders on may.
beal timely appealed the single issue of applicability of the default interest rate to the district court,which heard argument on april.affirming the bankruptcy court,the district court held that because guardian and the fdic did not take any affirmative action to exercise the option to accelerate,neither entity had triggered the default interest rate.the district court also concluded that the plain language of the notes precluded beal from collecting default interest on the matured loans because the default interest clause was tied to the option to accelerate.again,beal timely appealed.
ii.right to default interest 
construction of the contract 
beal argues that because the notes expressly state that default interest is due and payable upon default without notice or demand,the default interest rate should begin to accrue the moment crystal defaulted on the notes.based on our reading of the notes at issue,we disagree.
a written contract must be read as a whole and every part interpreted with reference to the whole.kennewick irrigation dist.united states,cir quoting shakey,covalt,cir.furthermore,a court must give effect to every word or term employed by the parties and reject none as meaningless or surplusage cree waterbury,cir quoting united states hathaway,cir.therefore,we must interpret the contract in a manner that gives full meaning and effect to all of the contract provisions and avoid a construction of the contract that focuses only on a single provision of the note.
as noted above,all of the notes executed between crystal and beal predecessors provide 
should default be made in any payment provided for in this note,at the option of the holder hereof and without notice or demand,the entire balance of principal and accrued interest then remaining unpaid shall become immediately due and payable,and thereafter bear interest,until paid in full,at the increased rate of five percent per annum over and above the rate contracted for herein.no delay or omission on the part of the holder hereof in exercising any right hereunder,shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right under this note 
thus,the entire balance of principal and accrued interest then remaining becomes immediately due and payable at the option of the holder.therefore,the right to accelerate the unpaid debt is at the lender option.the notes further provide that if the option is exercised,the notes will thereafter bear interest at the increased rate of five percent per annum over and above the rate contracted for herein.the use of the word thereafter can only mean that the default interest rate does not become effective unless the holder of the note exercises its option to accelerate.therefore,we read the contract language,as did the district court,to require the holder to exercise its option to accelerate before the default interest rate is triggered.
nevertheless,beal cites to in re pch associates,in support of its contention that the default interest in the notes can be invoked without acceleration.although pch associates holds that the default interest rate in the pch associates contract was triggered even though the lender failed to exercise its option to accelerate,the contractual language examined by the court in pch associates differs significantly from the contractual language at issue here.the default interest provision in pch associates stated following the occurrence of an event of default,interest shall accrue on the principal amount hereof at the rate of twelve percent per annum and shall be payable upon demand.pch,at.the bankruptcy court interpreted this and the other accompanying provisions as providing the lender with two options the option to accelerate the entire debt,in which event interest would accrue on both the first and second parts,or simply accept the missed payments,albeit late,at a higher default interest rate to compensate for the time value of money.id.at.here,the provision we are interpreting simply is not analogous to the contract provision at issue in pch associates.the notes at issue in this case require that the default interest provision be triggered after acceleration and only provide the lender with one option.therefore,pch associates is inapposite.
option to accelerate 
affirmative action required 
beal argues that even if it was required to exercise its option to accelerate,it was not required to give crystal notice of its intent to apply the default interest rate.crystal counters that despite the language in the contract,a creditor must take affirmative action to put the debtor on notice that it intends to exercise its option to accelerate.we believe that crystal has the better of the argument.
while california law governs the issue the question is closed to debate.both state and federal courts have made clear the unquestionable principle that,even when the terms of a note do not require notice or demand as a prerequisite to accelerating a note,the holder must take affirmative action to notify the debtor that it intends to accelerate.see green carlstrom,d.holding that t he option to accelerate a promissory note does not operate automatically but some act is required to effect such acceleration.citation omitted trigg arnott,d,holding that the holder of the note must act in a manner that effectively provides notice that the holder has exercised his option what is essential to exercise of option to accelerate maturity of bill or note,a party having an option to declare a note due and payable can not simply by his own secret intention,never disclosed by act or word,claim that he declared the note due and payable.the addition of the words without demand or notice does not alter the requirement of an affirmative act of the holder of the note for the valid exercise of the option.see also united states rollinson,following precedent holding that,because acceleration was optional on the part of the holder,affirmative action must be taken to make it known to the debtor that he has exercised his option to accelerate internal quotations and citation omitted alterations in original united states feterl,cir holding that,a s a general rule,affirmative action by the creditor must be taken to make it known to the debtor that the creditor has exercised his option to accelerate.citation omitted united states hosko,wl,citing rollinson in holding that where the acceleration of the installment payments in cases of default is optional,on the part of the holder,then the entire debt does not become due on the mere default of payment but affirmative action by the creditor must be taken to make it known to the debtor that he has exercised his option to accelerate,aff.cir unpublished disposition curry united states,concluding that t he general rule is that where the acceleration of the installment payments in cases of default is optional,then the entire debt does not become due on the mere default of payment but affirmative action by the creditor must be taken to make it known to the debtor that he has exercised his option to accelerate.citation and internal quotations omitted alterations in original emphasis omitted united states cardinal,the law is well settled that where the acceleration of the installment payments in cases of default is optional on the part of the holder,then the entire debt does not become due on the mere default of payment but affirmative action by the creditor must be taken to make it known to the debtor that he has exercised his option to accelerate,even though the note itself,as is the case here,waives notice of demand.emphasis added moresi far,same in re holiday mart,it is well established that to exercise an option to accelerate the maturity of a note the holder must take some affirmative action that evidences its intention to accelerate this requirement applies even where the note provides for acceleration without notice.
we find the overwhelming weight of authority persuasive and note the lack of any law that would contradict the requirement of affirmative action to accelerate.we therefore conclude that the california supreme court would adopt the rule that the addition of the words without demand or notice does not alter the requirement that the holder of the note must carry out some affirmative act to exercise its option to accelerate even though the note here provides that upon default the note can be accelerated without notice or demand,beal or its predecessors must take some affirmative action before acceleration and,in turn,before the default interest rate becomes effective.
this conclusion is further supported by the language of the deeds of trusts for each loan,which provides that the beneficiary may declare all sums secured hereby immediately due and payable by delivery to trustee of written declaration of default and demand for sale and of written notice of default and of election to cause said property to be sold,which notice trustee shall cause to be duly filed for record.because a note and a deed of trust must be read and construed together,kerivan title insurance,d,the language in the deed of trust supports the conclusion that beal was required to take some affirmative action declaring that it had exercised its option to accelerate and thus triggered the default interest clause.
therefore,the district court did not err in holding that beal and its predecessors were required to give crystal notice of its intent to exercise its option to accelerate the note.
notice and demand not provided 
beal argues,in the alternative,that the two letters sent by the fdic,its immediate predecessor in interest,constituted affirmative action and notice sufficient to accelerate notes a,b,c,d,and g.it contends that,because the letters accelerated these notes and notified crystal that it was invoking the default interest rates,the default interest rate should be applied to the outstanding loan amounts dating from the date of each letter,february,and march,not from the recordation dates in the first quarter of.because these letters did not accomplish what beal now urges,however,this argument is unavailing.
the exercise of the option to accelerate must be in a manner that is clear and unequivocal and effectively informs the maker that the option to accelerate has been exercised in re holiday mart,see also first bank investors trust tarkio,cir a right to accelerate should be clear and unequivocal,and if there is a reasonable doubt as to the meaning of the terms employed preference should be given to the construction which will prevent acceleration of maturity.alterations in original citation omitted d bills and notes the creditor must perform some clear,unequivocal affirmative act evidencing an intention to take advantage of the acceleration provision.
neither the february letter,the march letter,nor any other correspondence from the fdic clearly and unequivocally triggered beal option to accelerate and,concomitantly its right to apply the default interest rate.
a.the february,letter 
on february,the fdic wrote 
the fdic has not setoff any account,nor has it taken any action of any kind under either real property secured or personal property secured loans.all the fdic has done is to freeze accounts for which there are delinquent loans outstanding.your loans however,are in default which invokls sic the default interest clause.
emphasis in original.the letter is silent as to the fdic option to accelerate.if any inference is to be drawn from this letter,it is that the fdic had not exercised its option to accelerate because it states that the fdic had not used crystal accounts at guardian to pay down the loan.although the fdic did warn crystal that its loans were in default,it failed to discuss acceleration,a necessary predicate for invocation of the clause.
the eighth circuit has found less ambiguous language in a letter from the lender to be insufficient to trigger an option to accelerate and a default interest clause.see tarkio,at.in tarkio college,the holder of the note,first bank,on may,wrote the debtor 
this is to advise you,that first bank deems tarkio college in default of its promissory note to first bank with respect to the referenced loan transaction.accordingly first bank requests tarkio college to now come forward within the next ten days with full payment of the unpaid principal,and unpaid and accrued interest of as of this day.interest is accruing at a rate of per day.
id.at.even though this letter clearly stated that the debtor was required to come forward with the full amount within ten days and that interest was accruing at a higher rate,the eighth circuit concluded that it was ambiguous and,therefore,was not a clear and unequivocal statement of the bank intent to accelerate the loan.id.at.
because acceleration clauses are often considered a penalty and inserted for the benefit of the creditor,stewart claudius,d,and because if there is a reasonable doubt as to the meaning of the terms employed preference should be given to the construction which will prevent acceleration of maturity,tarkio,at citation omitted,the february,letter from the fdic,like that in tarkio college,did not trigger the option to accelerate or the default interest clause.
b.the march,letter 
as judge morrow order concluded,the march,letter from the fdic to crystal is even less persuasive evidence of an unambiguous intent to accelerate.the letter contains conflicting statements that also fail to clearly invoke the option to accelerate and the default interest clause.the march letter,which actually pertains to only one loan on appeal loan g,the montclair property provides 
because you have transferred title to the following properties without permission of the fdic as required by the deeds of trust,your actions have triggered the default interest provision of those deeds of trust in addition to the above,there is a default interest due on all remaining principal and unpaid interest.unless we receive payment in full of all principal and accrued interest by may,on of the loans where you have sold the property,we will be filing a notice of default.
although,in this letter,the fdic states that crystal actions have triggered the default interest provision with respect to three identified loans,it calculates the debtors outstanding principal and interest balances at the contractual interest rate.and although the fdic later states that a default interest rate will apply in addition to the contract rate,the manner in which the letter is phrased merely advises the debtors that the fdic could invoke the default interest clause in the future.see tarkio,at lender letter did not clearly state an intention to accelerate or charge the default interest rate when it applied the contractual interest rate of twelve percent in computing the amounts and did not state clearly when,if ever,the default interest rate of sixteen percent would apply to the outstanding balance of the loan.beal argues that tarkio college is clearly distinguishable on its facts because the promissory notes at issue in tarkio college were ambiguous as the letter specifically applied the contractual interest rate in computing the amounts noted in the letter.this argument fails because the fdic march letter to the debtors,like the letter in tarkio college,applied the contractual interest rate in computing the amounts calculated in the letter.
moreover,the last sentence in the march,letter reads unless we receive payment in full of all principal and accrued interest by may,we will be filing a notice of default.this statement threatening future action demonstrates that the acceleration option had not been exercised and that the fdic was not demanding immediate payment.because the debtors were given almost three months to pay the outstanding balances on their loans,the letter did not clearly and unequivocally accelerate the loan or trigger the default interest clause.
finally,in its papers before the district court,beal admitted that the march letter did not invoke the default rate.specifically,beal noted that in the march letter,ng was notified that a premium interest rate would be imposed if the loans were not brought current.although beal did not make this same admission in its appellate briefs,it did not deny having made it before the district court.because a judicial admission made at the district court is binding on this court,see united states bentson,cir judicial admissions before district court that defendant failed to file tax returns for years at issue are binding on the appellate court,beal is bound by its admission.
subsequent correspondence from the fdic to the debtors 
correspondence between the debtors and the fdic following the march,letter also fails to indicate any affirmative action or invocation of the default interest provision.on may,the fdic wrote to the debtors setting forth its calculations of the remaining balances on the loans at the contract rate,and failed to mention its option to accelerate or the default interest clause.
on may,ruth daugherty from the fdic sent a letter to the debtors stating that the fdic was
