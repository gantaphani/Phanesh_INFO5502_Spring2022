sabinsa corporation appeals the district court judgment in favor of creative compounds,llc,on sabinsa trademark infringement and unfair competition claims.the district court found that there was no likelihood of confusion between sabinsa mark,forslean,and creative compounds mark,forsthin,both of which refer to coleus forskohlii extract,an ingredient used in weight management products.because the district court erred in its findings on the lapp factors and its ultimate finding on likelihood of confusion,we will reverse the judgment.further,because the undisputed facts weigh heavily in favor of sabinsa so that any reasonable fact finder,weighing the lapp factors properly,would find that sabinsa had demonstrated a likelihood of confusion,we conclude that there is no need to remand for a by the district court of the lapp factors.we therefore remand this case for entry of judgment in favor of sabinsa.
background 
the following facts are undisputed.
forskohlin is an extract derived from the roots of the plant coleus forskohlii,a member of the mint family,found primarily in india.it is manufactured by harvesting and drying the coleus forskohlii root and then extracting the forskohlin into a slurry.the slurry is then combined with inactive ingredients to make various concentrations,which are sold in powder form.
sabinsa,an ingredient supplier for manufacturers,was founded in by muhammed majeed,a scientist with experience in the pharmaceutical industry.in,majeed began research into the potential use of forskohlin to promote lean body mass.after completing a clinical trial,sabinsa filed an application for the trademark,forslean,formed by combining fors from forskohlin with lean for lean body mass.sabinsa first marketed forslean to nutraceutical manufacturers in.sabinsa has also created pamphlets marketing forslean directly to the public.forslean was sabinsa highest product for at least five years preceding the trial in the district court.
in,a severe drought struck india and affected sabinsa supply of forskohlin.as a result,sabinsa both worked to keep its customers interested in forslean and spent significant resources helping farmers in india cultivate coleus forskohlii to ensure a continued supply in the future.forskohlin was available again in the spring of,in part due to sabinsa efforts.sabinsa thereafter created the forslean promise,a commitment to its customers to ensure the supply of forskohlin in the future.
creative compounds is also an ingredient supplier to the nutraceutical industry although it operates with only seven employees,none of whom is a scientist or,and it conducts no research and development.creative compounds began selling forskohlin at the end of.it did not,however,adopt the trade name forsthin for its product until the spring of as sabinsa supply problems were coming to an end.though there is no indication that creative compounds ever had a problem with supply associated with the drought in india,it heavily promoted the return of coleus as it introduced its new forsthin brand not long ago,coleus was one of the most powerful options in weight loss.that was until raw material shortages and extracts made maintaining a coleus formula a nightmare.those days are over.creative compounds made very few sales of forskohlin in,and,but sold more than kilograms in,nearly kilograms in,and nearly kilograms in.
sabinsa sent a letter to creative compounds in the summer of,soon after the latter began using the name forsthin.within a week and without contacting sabinsa,creative compounds filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the district of missouri.sabinsa then filed this suit,and the missouri suit was dismissed in favor of this one.
sabinsa complaint alleged five claims,all of which required that it prove both its ownership of a valid and legally protectable trademark and a likelihood of confusion caused by creative compounds use of the mark forsthin.browne drug cococare,cir.creative compounds has conceded that sabinsa owns the forslean mark and that the mark is valid and legally protectable.therefore,the only issue for trial was whether or not defendant use of the mark forsthin is likely to create confusion in the marketplace when compared to plaintiff mark fors l ean.
on june,after a bench trial,the district court read into the record an oral decision in favor of creative compounds.sabinsa appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.standard of review 
we exercise plenary review over the district court legal conclusions regarding the lanham act.see checkpoint,check point software,cir.factual findings concerning the likelihood of confusion are reviewed for clear error.see a h sportswear,victoria secret stores,cir.clear error exists when,giving all deference to the opportunity of the trial judge to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.though l ikelihood of confusion is a factual question,legal principles govern what evidence may,or must,be considered by the district court in reaching that conclusion,and also what standards apply to its determination.id.at.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,a trial court must make clear factual findings to support its conclusions.wright miller,federal practice procedure,at.rule is not satisfied by the statement of the ultimate fact without the subordinate factual foundations for it which also must be the subject of specific findings.united states,f d,cir.if subordinate findings did not enter into the process by which the ultimate factual finding was made,then it was without any supporting foundation.prang trucking,local union,cir citation omitted.
iii.the district court likelihood of confusion analysis 
to prove likelihood of confusion,plaintiffs must show that consumers viewing the mark would probably assume the product or service it represents is associated with the source of a different product or service identified by a similar mark.checkpoint sys,at internal quotation marks removed.in interpace lapp,we set forth the factors which may indicate a likelihood of confusion 
the degree of similarity between the owner mark and the alleged infringing mark 
the strength of the owner mark 
the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase 
the length of time the defendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion arising 
the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark 
the evidence of actual confusion 
whether the goods,though not competing,are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same media 
the extent to which the targets of the parties sales efforts are the same 
the relationship of the goods in the minds of consumers because of similarity of functions and 
other factors suggesting the consuming public might expect the prior owner to manufacture a product in the defendant market or that he is likely to expand into that market.
at.none of these factors is determinative in the likelihood of confusion analysis and each factor must be weighed and balanced one against the other.checkpoint,at.in reviewing a district court analysis of the lapp factors,we can reverse the court conclusions if the relevant factors are not properly set forth and not properly weighed.see kos pharmaceuticals andrx corporation,cir.
in kos,a trademark case involving the marks advicor and altocor,we reversed a district court likelihood of confusion decision because it had erred in its analysis of mark similarity,overemphasized customer sophistication,applied the wrong standards regarding intent,and ignored several other relevant lapp factors.id.at.the same district judge made similar errors here.in finding that there was no likelihood of confusion between forslean and forsthin,the district court engaged in detailed analysis of only three of the relevant lapp factors and failed to discuss much of the evidence presented by sabinsa.the district court then asserted,this court is not going to comment on all of the testimony offered at trial.suffice it to say,i am satisfied that the testimony taken as a whole amply supports the court decision.however,while it is true that a district court may find that certain of the lapp factors are inapplicable or unhelpful in a particular case,the court must still explain its choice not to employ those factors.see a h sportswear,at.here,the district court failed to explain whether it viewed these remaining factors as neutral or irrelevant or how it weighed and balanced the combined factors.further,its reasoning concerning the three factors it chose to analyze is flawed.
typically,when a district court fails adequately to support its findings,we merely remand for a of the applicable factors.where the facts are largely undisputed,however,we need not remand if application of the correct standard could support only one conclusion.kos,at quoting duraco,joy plastic,cir see also lapp,at reversing and directing entry of judgment.such a remand would be a waste of judicial resources.in kos,for example,we observed,regardless of how the factual disputes might be resolved,any reasonable factfinder weighing the lapp factors in accordance with the correct legal standards would hold in favor of kos.kos,at.accordingly,as we did in that case,we will review the findings of the district court,along with the evidence presented by the parties,to determine whether,in light of the controlling legal principles,the facts the failures in the district court analysis compel a result as a matter of law.
iv.the individual lapp factors 
similarity of marks lapp factor one 
the single most important factor in determining likelihood of confusion is mark similarity.a h sportswear,at.marks are confusingly similar if ordinary consumers would likely conclude that the two products share a common source,affiliation,connection or sponsorship.fisons horticulture,vigoro,cir.the proper test is not a comparison but,rather,whether the labels create the same overall impression when viewed separately.kos,at.overall impression is created by the sight,sound,and meaning of the mark.see a h sportswear,at.the degree of similarity needed to prove likely confusion will vary with the difference in the goods where the goods are directly competitive,the degree of similarity required to prove a likelihood of confusion is less than in the case of dissimilar products.kos,at quoting thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.
the district court found that this factor favors creative compounds,asserting that,beyond the shared letters fors,forslean and forsthin have no other similarity.the court reasoning,however,contains clear errors.first,for its visual analysis,the district court focused on minute differences in the products logos while ignoring evidence that both marks are often used in plain text without the surrounding graphics the district court devoted only one sentence to a visual comparison of the words forslean and forsthin apart from their logos and that sentence only contrasted the words thin and lean rather than the overall impression.however,looked at as a whole,forslean and forsthin share all but three letters,have the same dominant syllable and end letter,and have the same number of syllables.under these circumstances,the district court clearly erred in finding that the words are not visually similar.see kos,f d at because advicor and altocor are b oth,words that begin and end with the same letters and the same sounds the district court clearly erred in failing to recognize that this factor weighs in the senior user favor.
likewise,in analyzing the connotative differences between forslean and forsthin,the district court ignored evidence and failed to make sufficient subordinate findings.the court stated that it accepts defendant arguments that a different commercial impression is made by the word lean versus thin and that t hin would convey to the consumer weight loss,whereas lean would convey a lean body type.as an initial matter,again the district court erred by comparing lean and thin rather than forslean and forsthin.see fisons horticulture,at.more centrally,the district court finding is contrary to undisputed evidence at trial,none of which was cited in its opinion creative compounds uses thin and lean interchangeably in its other weight loss products,creative compounds sales manager and one of its customers conceded at trial that lean invokes weight loss and that sabinsa promotes forslean to end users as a weight management product.indeed,during the trial,the district court took judicial notice that there are products out there,when they use the word lean,that are weight loss products.its ultimate finding that the words thin and lean would convey different mental impressions to consumers is impossible to reconcile with this earlier recognition that the terms are interchangeable to consumers.
in sum,the district court clearly erred in failing to find that this factor favors sabinsa.
strength of mark lapp factor two 
to determine the strength of the mark,courts look to the inherent features of the mark contributing to its distinctiveness or conceptual strength and the factual evidence of the mark commercial strength or of marketplace recognition of the mark.see a h sportswear,at.
courts classify the distinctiveness or conceptual strength of a mark as either generic,like diet chocolate fudge soda descriptive,like security center suggestive,like coppertone or arbitrary or fanciful,like kodak.id.arbitrary or fanciful marks use terms that neither describe nor suggest anything about the product.id.suggestive marks require consumer imagination,thought,or perception to determine what the product is.id.descriptive marks forthwith convey an immediate idea of the ingredients,qualities or characteristics of the goods.id.generic marks function as the common descriptive name of a product class.id.
the district court acknowledged that the fors in forslean and forsthin is apparently an abbreviation of the generic term of the product,coleus forskohlii.it then concluded that fors is not a mere arbitrary term,but,rather,a prefix used by each party combined with either the word lean or thin.never,however,did the court assign a classification for the forslean mark rather,in evaluating the mark strength,the court merely stated 
defendant argues that plaintiff mark is conceptually weak because it is highly suggestive.sabinsa argues that its mark is commercially strong based on its advertising efforts,press mentions and its receipt of two industry awards regarding its product.however,testimony at trial reflected the parties sophisticated target customers were aware of both parties marks and that there is no confusion.this factor does not support plaintiff position.
this analysis amounts to legal error,and it culminated in a clearly erroneous finding.
first,it does not follow that because sabinsa and then creative compounds used fors as an abbreviation for coleus forskohlii,the term is conceptually weak.as sabinsa points out,the v in stands for vegetable and the stands for the fact that the juice has eight vegetables,but is still an arbitrary term.see fisons horticulture,at citing standard brands,smidler,cir the letter v by itself no more signifies vegetable than it does any other word of which it is the initial letter as much is true of the figure.there was no evidence presented that fors is a generic term for forskohlin.accordingly,to the extent that the district court meant to imply that the parties use of fors as an abbreviation makes forslean a generic or descriptive term,this is not the law.
second,beyond its brief discussion of the abbreviation fors,the district court did not analyze either the conceptual or commercial strength of forslean.instead,as set forth above,it described the parties arguments and then reiterated its finding that there had been no confusion between the two companies among its sophisticated customers.actual confusion and the sophistication of a party customers,however,are different prongs of the lapp test and were impermissibly conflated by the district court.see kos,at.creative compounds argues that the district court merely found that the lack of confusion among the parties customers trump ed the parties arguments concerning the conceptual and commercial strength of forslean and that the strength of the mark is a less significant confusion factor when the buyers know the actual source of each product.this argument mischaracterizes the court analysis.if the court had meant to find that the strength factor was in sabinsa favor but less important than other factors,it could have said so.instead,the district court found that the strength of the forslean mark does not support plaintiff position.this was clear error.
once again,because the facts underlying the strength analysis are manifest and undisputed,we will review the facts and law to determine whether they compel a particular result.sabinsa argues that forslean is arbitrary or suggestive,while creative compounds argues that it is a descriptive mark because it combines a description of the product fors with its intended application lean.while lean is certainly a generic term,fors is not yet one.the parties to this case are the only two that use fors as an abbreviation for forskohlin,and while forslean is not a term that was created completely out of whole cloth,it certainly requires consumer imagination,thought,or perception to determine the nature of the product.see a h sportswear,at.it would,thus,appear that forslean is a suggestive mark.moreover,it was undisputed that the forslean mark is commercially strong.accordingly,this factor favors sabinsa as a matter of law.
purchasers care and sophistication lapp factor three 
when consumers exercise heightened care in evaluating the relevant products before making purchasing decisions,courts have found there is not a strong likelihood of confusion.where the relevant products are expensive,or the buyer class consists of sophisticated or professional purchasers,courts have generally not found lanham act violations.checkpoint,at.however,where the group of buyers is a combination of professionals and ordinary consumers,the class as a whole is not held to the higher standard of care.id.at.
under the heading p rice and customer sophistication,the district court found that the product is expensive and the customers are sophisticated purchasers who purchase the product after careful thought and analysis usually,the customers are repeat customers.these customers exercise a high level of care,and,therefore,eliminates sic the likelihood of confusion.the district court also noted that these products are not sold over the counter and that both parties customers regularly ask technical questions about the scientific and safety merits of the product prior to purchase.the court thus concluded that this factor favors creative compounds.the court further weighed this factor heavily in its ultimate conclusion that there is no likelihood of confusion.
the district court reasoning inappropriately treats the products direct,the manufacturers of the only relevant consumers.in kos,we criticized the parties and the district court for treating medical professionals as the only relevant consumers of pharmaceuticals,noting that drugs are increasingly marketed directly to potential patients through,for example,style advertising.see kos,at.here,sabinsa presented disregarded by the district it directly markets forslean through just this type of advertising,distributing pamphlets to retail outlets for distribution to the public.the appropriate standard of care to be exercised,therefore,should have been equal to that of the least sophisticated consumer in the class the general consumer reading a forslean pamphlet who then chooses a nutraceutical containing forskohlin.see checkpoint,at quoting ford motor summit motor,cir morgenstern chem.searle,cir recognizing that physicians and pharmacists are carefully trained to detect differences in the characteristics of pharmaceutical products,but holding that this does not open the door to the adoption by manufacturers of medicines of trademarks or names which would be confusingly similar to anyone not exercising such great care.the district court thus committed legal error when it concluded that this factor weighs heavily in favor of creative compounds.
once again,the facts are undisputed.though the price of forskohlin to suppliers is relatively high,the neutraceuticals that contain forskohlin are clearly affordable to most interested consumers.further,the sales process is as quick as a trip to the counter.in addition,nutraceuticals,unlike pharmaceuticals,require no consultation with a professional and may often be impulse purchases.moreover,there was no showing that consumers of nutraceuticals are highly sophisticated.accordingly,this factor weighs in favor of sabinsa.
length of time without confusion lapp factor four evidence of actual confusion lapp factor six 
evidence of actual confusion is frequently difficult to find.see checkpoint,at.as a result,we have determined that actual confusion is not necessary to demonstrate a likelihood of success.see fisons horticulture,at.evidence of actual confusion is nevertheless highly probative of a likelihood of confusion.see checkpoint,at.it was undisputed that forslean and forsthin had for approximately years at the time of trial without any evidence of actual confusion.moreover,sabinsa failed to submit survey evidence concerning actual confusion.accordingly,the district court did not err in concluding that these factors favor creative compounds.
intent of the defendant in adopting the mark lapp factor five 
evidence of a defendant intent is not a prerequisite for finding a lanham act violation such evidence,however,weighs heavily in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion.see id.at.in evaluating this factor,courts must look at whether the defendant chose the mark to intentionally confuse consumers,and thereby capitalize on the senior user goodwill,and whether the defendant gave adequate care to investigating its proposed mark.see,at.a defendant mere intent to copy,without more,is not sufficiently probative of the defendant success in causing confusion to weigh such a finding in the plaintiff favor rather,defendant intent will indicate a likelihood of confusion only if an intent to confuse consumers is demonstrated via purposeful manipulation of the junior mark to resemble the senior.a h sportswear,at.
the district court did not mention specific evidence regarding creative compounds good or bad intent rather,the court found that there is nothing in the record to suggest that creative compounds attempted to pass off its goods as sabinsa.in fact,the evidence is to the contrary creative compounds has made efforts to distinguish itself and its forsthin product from sabinsa.the record belies these conclusions.in fact,far from there being nothing in the record to suggest bad intent,there was ample evidence that creative compounds attempted to pass off its product as sabinsa.creative compounds personnel offered inconsistent testimony concerning their trademark searches prior to the company adopting the forsthin mark.there was also evidence that creative compounds president and ceo falsely claimed to have conducted research that expanded on sabinsa discoveries regarding forskohlin.in addition,the timing of creative compounds adoption of the forsthin mark and its pamphlet touting the return of coleus both of which coincided with forslean renewing its supply of forskohlin following the drought in india and issuing a forslean promise to its customers regarding continued support an inference that creative compounds intended to trade on sabinsa goodwill and confuse customers as to the source of its product.indeed,the fact that creative compounds chose fors,not coleus,or cole,or col,as the first syllable of its brand name,while also promoting the return of coleus,would suggest that the adoption of the forsthin brand name was aimed at forslean.
the district court was,of course,permitted to credit or discredit certain pieces of testimony and weigh them accordingly.but in stating that there was nothing in the record to suggest creative compounds bad intent,the district court failed even to acknowledge the existence of contradictory
