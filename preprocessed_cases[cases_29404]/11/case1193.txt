able time,imported a shipment of watches into the united states.the watches bore the mark tommy,which is a registered trademark owned by tommy hilfiger licensing.the bureau of customs and border protection seized the watches pursuant to the tariff act,which authorizes seizure of any merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark.e.tommy hilfiger did not make or sell watches at the time of the seizure.customs later imposed a civil penalty upon able time pursuant to f,which authorizes the imposition of a fine upon any person who imports merchandise that is seized under e the district court concluded that,because tommy hilfiger did not make watches at the time of the seizure,the watches imported by able time were not counterfeit,and the civil penalty imposed by customs was unlawful.
the government argues that the tariff act does not require the owner of the registered mark to make the same type of goods as those bearing the offending mark.the government acknowledges that such a requirement is commonplace in many related trademark statutes but maintains that congress did not intend to include such a as an identity of goods or services the tariff act.able time responds by arguing that congress expressed its intent to require identity of goods in related statutes and legislative history.
we conclude that the tariff act does not contain an identity of goods or services requirement.we hold that customs may impose a civil penalty pursuant to f upon an importer of merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark,even though the owner of the registered mark does not manufacture or sell the same type of merchandise.we reverse the district court order granting able time motion for summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
tommy hilfiger registered the trademark tommy in international class,which encompasses cosmetics,cologne and similar products,in september.customs seized a shipment of watches imported by able time bearing the mark tommy on may.at the time,tommy hilfiger did not manufacture or sell watches,nor was its mark registered in international class,the class that includes watches.tommy applied for registration in that class on november,and received it on september.tommy hilfiger currently sells watches with the tommy mark.
a.the forfeiture action 
customs filed an in rem forfeiture action against the watches pursuant to e on november.the district court granted able time motion for judgment on the pleadings on september.the government appealed,and we vacated the district court judgment and remanded for further proceedings.see united states watches,cir.the district court dismissed the forfeiture suit without prejudice for defective service of process on september.the government was unable to the forfeiture suit because the statute of limitations had run.it returned nearly all of the watches to able time on april.
b.the civil penalty action 
customs issued able time several notices of civil penalty in february and march of.customs filed this civil penalty action pursuant to f on april.able time filed a motion for summary judgment which the district court initially denied,concluding that jurors could reasonably return a verdict for the government that the watches bore a counterfeit mark.the district court subsequently issued sua sponte an order to show cause why it should not reconsider its decision.after further briefing,the district court granted able time motion for summary judgment,concluding as a matter of law that the imported watches could not be counterfeit because tommy hilfiger did not make watches at the time of the seizure.the government timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.universal health,thompson,cir.the district court interpretation of a statute is a question of law also subject to de novo review.beeman tdi managed care,cir.we first consider whether this case is moot,which is an issue subject to de novo review that the parties may raise at any time.or.barter fair jackson county,cir.
able time argues that this case is moot because customs has returned nearly all the watches.a case becomes moot when there no longer exists a present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted.vill.of gambell babbitt,cir internal quotation omitted.
this action is not moot because the civil penalty remedy is still available.see friends of the earth laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d reasoning that the availability of civil penalties rendered the case not moot ecological rights found.pac.lumber,cir same.the provision that authorizes civil penalties,f,does not require customs to retain possession of the offending merchandise during the pendency of a civil penalty suit,nor does it require customs to successfully attain forfeiture of the merchandise.subsection f requires only that the merchandise be seized under subsection e,which it was.f.if the forfeiture action in this case had been dismissed with prejudice,or if able time were to show that the seizure was otherwise invalid,then a civil penalty would not be appropriate.but the forfeiture action here was dismissed without prejudice,and able time has not shown that the seizure was unlawful.accordingly,the civil penalty remedy is still available and the case is not moot.
relevant statutes 
we turn next to the language of the relevant statutes.see consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d t he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.the government argues that the tariff act and the statutes that it incorporates do not require the owner of the trademark to manufacture the same goods as those bearing the offending mark.the government argues in the alternative that the agency interpretation is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,a position we decline to adopt and discuss below at.able time responds by arguing that other sources,such as other statutory language and legislative history,show congress intent to require identity of goods or services in the tariff act.we conclude that the plain language is unambiguous and does not contain an identity of goods or services requirement.on remand,the district court will consider whether the other requirements of the tariff act have been met.
the tariff act prohibits the importation of merchandise bearing a registered trademark without the permission of the owner of the trademark 
i t shall be unlawful to import into the united states any merchandise of foreign manufacture if such merchandise bears a trademark owned by a citizen of,or by a corporation or association created or organized within,the united states unless written consent of the owner of such trademark is produced.
a.the tariff act also authorizes seizure and forfeiture if the merchandise bears a counterfeit mark 
any such merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark within the meaning of section of title imported into the united states in violation of the provisions of section of title,shall be seized and,in the absence of the written consent of the trademark owner,forfeited for violations of the customs laws.
e.the tariff act authorizes the imposition of a civil penalty upon an importer whose goods are seized,in an amount not more than the value the merchandise would have had if it were genuine 
any person who directs,assists financially or otherwise,or aids and abets the importation of merchandise for sale or public distribution that is seized under subsection e of this section shall be subject to a civil fine.
for the first such seizure,the fine shall be not more than the value that the merchandise would have had if it were genuine,according to the manufacturer suggested retail price,determined under regulations promulgated by the secretary.
f.none of these provisions require the owner of the registered mark to make or sell the same goods as those bearing the offending mark.
subsection e of the tariff act incorporates two other statutes,and.both are part of the trademark act of,known as the lanham act,and neither contains an identity of goods or services requirement.the tariff act incorporates the definition of the term counterfeit from the first statute a counterfeit is a spurious mark which is identical with,or substantially indistinguishable from,a registered mark.able time argues that also defines other terms,such as trademark and use in commerce,that do contain an identity of goods or services requirement.the tariff act incorporates only the definition of counterfeit.other definitions contained in are not at issue here.
the tariff act incorporates from the second statute the requirement that the offending merchandise copy or simulate a registered trademark,which amounts to a requirement that the offending merchandise be likely to cause confusion.the second statute provides n o article of imported merchandise which shall copy or simulate a trademark registered in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be admitted to entry at any customhouse of the united states.customs has defined a copying or simulating trademark as one which may so resemble a recorded mark or name as to be likely to cause the public to associate the copying or simulating mark or name with the recorded mark or name.a.this is equivalent to the traditional likelihood of confusion test for trademark infringement.see ross cosmetics distrib,united states ross i,equating the copy or simulate requirement from with the likelihood of confusion standard ross cosmetics distrib,united states ross ii,same thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy the copy or simulate test is the same as that used to determine the infringement of a federally registered mark in ordinary litigation.see also amf sleekcraft boats,cir listing factors relevant to likelihood of confusion analysis,including the strength of the mark,the proximity of the goods,and the similarity of the marks,among others,abrogated on other grounds by new kids on the block news am.publ g,cir.while public confusion may be more likely where the owner of the registered mark manufactures the same goods as those bearing the offending mark,identity of goods or services is not a requirement,particularly where the other factors weigh in favor of finding confusion.
to run afoul of the civil penalty provision of the tariff act,then,the offending merchandise must bear a mark identical to or substantially indistinguishable from a registered trademark owned by a united states citizen or corporation,where the offending merchandise copies or simulates the registered trademark,meaning that it is likely to cause the public to associate the offending merchandise with the registered trademark under the sleekcraft factors.see e f,a.nowhere does this statutory scheme require the owner of the registered mark to make the same goods as those bearing the offending mark.
able time argues that the reference to genuine merchandise and its retail price in f,quoted above at,shows that congress intended a civil penalty to apply only where there is,in fact,a genuine article with which to compare the merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark,where the owner of the registered mark manufactures the same goods as those bearing the offending mark.the reference to genuine goods does not establish such a requirement,however,because the provision in which it appears affects the calculation of the civil penalty,not the initial determination of whether a penalty should apply.this language at best implies that the drafters did not anticipate the specific circumstances of the instant case,not that they intended the civil penalty to be limited to cases involving identity of goods or services.and on its face,the language of f does not require the genuine merchandise to be manufactured by the trademark owner.here,the term genuine could refer to genuine watches generally.
able time makes the related argument that it is impossible to calculate the fine in the manner required by f,since there can be no retail price for genuine tommy watches if genuine tommy watches did not exist at the time.able time argues that this impossibility shows that congress intended to require the owner of the registered mark to manufacture the same goods as those bearing the offending mark.we disagree.the tariff act specifies that the fine must be no more than the manufacturer suggested retail price that the merchandise would have had if it were genuine.the legislative history of f provides that the fine should be meted out at the discretion of the customs service,within the boundaries set out by congress in the bill,at.in this case,customs acted within its discretion when it used the domestic value of the merchandise as an approximation in accordance with a customs directive applicable in similar circumstances 
congressional intent 
in order to overcome this plain language,able time must identify a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary.gte sylvania,at.able time argues that the presence of an identity of goods or services requirement in related statutes and legislative history shows congress intent to require identity of goods or services in the tariff act.we disagree.the plain language of the tariff act is unambiguous,so related statutes are of limited help.the sequence of enactments of and amendments to the relevant statutes strongly supports the inference that the omission of an identity of goods or services requirement from the tariff act was intentional.and the legislative histories of the statutes at issue,and of related statutes,support the plain text interpretation.
the lanham act 
able time argues that numerous portions of the lanham act contain an identity of goods or services requirement,see,a,b,b,a,a,and d b i,and that we should read the tariff act consistently with the lanham act because they are related statutes.the principle that related statutes should be interpreted harmoniously applies only where the plain language of the statute at issue is ambiguous.see jonah carmona,cir quoting jett dallas indep.sch,d w here text permits,statutes dealing with similar subjects should be interpreted harmoniously.emphasis added scalia,concurring.the statutory provisions cited by able time are not at issue here.the plain language of the statutes that are at issue is unambiguous and does not require tommy hilfiger to have manufactured watches at the time of the seizure for a civil penalty to be imposed.and the presence of an identity of goods and services requirement in related statutes does not constitute a clearly established legislative intention to include a similar requirement in the tariff act.
sequence of statutory enactments 
congress has shown more than once that it is able to impose an identity of goods or services requirement when it wishes by saying so explicitly in the relevant statutory text.congress enacted the definition of counterfeit in,at issue here and discussed above,in the lanham act in.congress created the seizure and forfeiture provision of the tariff act,e,also discussed above,in the customs procedural reform and simplification act of the act,stat.congress created criminal and civil provisions that contain an explicit identity of goods or services requirement in the trademark counterfeiting act of the act,ch.xv,res,stat.the act also amended portions of the lanham act,but it did not alter the definition of counterfeit in,nor did it add an identity of goods or services requirement to the seizure and forfeiture provision,e.
congress created the civil penalty provision of the tariff act discussed above,f,in as part of the anticounterfeiting consumer protection act acpa,stat.in,congress amended the language in the criminal provision definition of counterfeit mark to make the identity of goods or services requirement even clearer once again,it did not change the definition of counterfeit in,nor did it add an identity of goods or services requirement to the provisions of tariff act at issue here,e and f.
that congress included an explicit identity of goods or services requirement in both the civil and criminal provisions of the act,amended the lanham act in,amended the tariff act in,and then clarified the requirement in the criminal prov
