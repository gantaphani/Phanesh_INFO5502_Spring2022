plaintiff below,brandon windom was injured while participating in a football practice supervised by the capital trail football league on october.windom sued the league for his injuries and the league then discovered that it did not have commercial liability insurance.a default judgment was entered against the league and the league assigned any claims it may have had against an insurer to windom.
windom brought claims against michael alpaugh the league former nationwide insurance agent,and william ungerer a general insurance agent.alpaugh wrote insurance for the league through nationwide insurance company until september of.when nationwide policy expired,nationwide and alpaugh informed the league that nationwide would no longer issue a commercial liability policy covering the league activities.alpaugh,exclusively a nationwide agent,contacted ungerer with the league knowledge to determine if ungerer,a general agent,could find a carrier that would provide the coverage the league desired.ungerer received a proposal for insurance coverage from pawtucket mutual insurance company and the league accepted the proposal.ungerer then provided the league with a temporary insurance certificate which purported to provide coverage dependent upon payment of a premium until the carrier issued or declined to issue a policy providing the coverage the league desired.on its application for coverage the league supplied both a property address and a mailing address as requested.ungerer claims he sent a letter to the property address on the application notifying the league that pawtucket declined to issue a policy.the league asserts it never received the letter.the league further asserts it had reason to believe pawtucket provided coverage at the time of windom injury.
before the case went to trial,alpaugh and ungerer both moved for summary judgment.alpaugh asserted that he had no duty to notify the league of pawtucket declination because he merely acted as a messenger and specifically told the league that he could not provide coverage to them because he worked exclusively with nationwide.ungerer acknowledges his duty to notify the league but asserts that he acted reasonably in carrying out that duty by notifying the league that pawtucket declined to issue a policy by mailing a letter so indicating to the league property address.the trial judge granted summary judgment to both alpaugh and ungerer.
windom now claims on appeal that the trial judge erred by granting summary judgment in favor of alpaugh.windom suggests that alpaugh had a duty to notify the league of pawtucket declination because he acted as a broker when he contacted ungerer to determine if ungerer could provide coverage to the league and because he relayed all communications between the league and ungerer.windom also claims that the trial judge erred by granting summary judgment in favor of ungerer because ungerer acted unreasonably in carrying out his conceded duty to notify the league of pawtucket declination when he sent a letter to the league property address rather than the league mailing address.we find that alpaugh owed no duty to the league because he merely acted as a messenger between the league and ungerer.he informed the league,and they clearly knew from past dealings,that he could not provide them with insurance because he dealt exclusively with nationwide and nationwide would not renew the league policy.moreover,we find genuine issues of disputed material fact about whether ungerer acted reasonably when notifying the league that pawtucket declined to issue a policy,by allegedly sending a letter to the league property address rather than to its mailing address.accordingly,the judgment of the superior court is affirmed in part,and reversed in part.
the league is a junior football program for minors.on october,windom fractured his femur while participating in a football team evening practice supervised by the league at a site where the lights were inoperable.at the time of windom injury,the league did not have commercial liability insurance.the facts surrounding the lack of insurance form the basis of the windom claims.
beginning in,alpaugh procured insurance for the league through nationwide.alpaugh is an exclusive agent for nationwide.on may,nationwide notified alpaugh that it would not renew the league commercial liability policy when it expired on september.nationwide also sent notice directly to the league on may.chris verucci,president of the league,contacted alpaugh on june,to discuss nationwide decision not to renew the policy.alpaugh informed verucci that he could not procure alternative coverage because he dealt exclusively with nationwide,and suggested that she contact a few other agencies.on september,alpaugh learned during a telephone conversation with verucci that the league had yet to obtain alternative insurance coverage alpaugh then told verucci that he would check around to see if he could find a general agent that could procure commercial liability insurance coverage for the league.after his conversation with verucci,alpaugh happened to run into william ungerer at a local bank.alpaugh explained the league situation to ungerer ungerer,who operated a general insurance agency,indicated that he might be able to procure insurance for the league through pawtucket.
alpaugh then provided ungerer with the league information and,on september,ungerer sent alpaugh a proposal for comprehensive general liability insurance coverage for the league,to be underwritten by pawtucket.alpaugh contacted verucci to notify her that he had obtained a proposal from ungerer.verucci orally accepted the proposal,and alpaugh relayed verucci acceptance to ungerer.ungerer then prepared an application for coverage for the league to complete.
on september,verucci and darla chaffin,the league treasurer,met with alpaugh to sign the insurance application verucci and chaffin also gave alpaugh the initial insurance premium payment of six hundred dollars the next day alpaugh hand delivered the application and payment to ungerer.ungerer gave alpaugh a certificate of insurance from pawtucket for alpaugh to give to the league 
on october,ungerer received a fax from pawtucket indicating that it would not issue a policy to the league five days later on october,ungerer also received a letter from pawtucket in which it declined to issue a policy along with the league uncashed six hundred dollar check.ungerer claims that on october,he sent to the league the uncashed check together with a letter stating that pawtucket had declined coverage.ungerer mailed the letter and uncashed check to the league property address as indicated on the league application for insurance the league claimed that they never received ungerer letter and therefore had reason to believe that it had commercial liability insurance coverage in place on the date of windom injury.the league asserts that it first learned that it had no coverage when it informed ungerer and pawtucket of windom injury.
