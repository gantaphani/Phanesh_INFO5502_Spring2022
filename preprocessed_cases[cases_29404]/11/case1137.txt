in this case,we consider whether the crux of the complaint rule requires the question of arbitrability to be determined by the arbitrator when a plaintiff challenge to the arbitration clause does not appear in his complaint.we hold that,as long as the plaintiff challenge to the validity of an arbitration clause is a distinct question from the validity of the contract as a whole,the question of arbitrability is for the court to decide regardless of whether the specific challenge to the arbitration clause is raised as a distinct claim in the complaint.
bridge fund capital and big bad,llc collectively,plaintiffs filed suit against fastbucks franchise fastbucks,or franchisor in california state court,alleging various claims sounding in contract.one of the claims alleged was the unconscionability of certain provisions of the franchise agreement,but through apparent clerical error,plaintiffs neglected to include in the complaint the list of the specific provisions of the franchise agreement they claimed were unconscionable.fastbucks removed to federal court,and moved to compel arbitration.the district court declined to order the parties to arbitrate their dispute,agreeing with plaintiffs,based on their motion papers,that the arbitration clause is unconscionable under california law.this appeal followed.
we address first fastbucks argument that the question of arbitrability was itself a question for the arbitrator to decide,and affirm the district court decision that it was not.we also affirm the district court determination that california law governs the unconscionability question,and that under that law the arbitration clause of the franchise agreement is unconscionable.finally,we affirm the district court decision to invalidate the entire arbitration clause rather than sever its offending provisions.
facts and procedural background 
bridge fund,a california corporation,and big bad,a california llc,entered into franchise agreements with fastbucks for the operation of payday loan franchises in california 
fastbucks is a nevada corporation with its principal place of business in texas.the franchise agreements include a texas clause,as well as an arbitration provision directing that any and all disputes between the parties and any claim by either party that can not be amicably settled shall be determined solely and exclusively by arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association,in addition,the arbitration clause provides,in pertinent part,that the arbitrator,a texas bar member,shall hear the dispute in dallas county,texas the claims subject to arbitration shall not be arbitrated on a basis while the franchisor may institute an action for temporary,preliminary,or permanent injunctive relief,the franchisee is not afforded the same remedy there is a one year statute of limitations for all claims and the parties are limited to recovery of actual damages,and waive any right to consequential,punitive or exemplary damages.in addition,the franchise agreement included an addendum which mentioned that certain provisions of the franchise agreement may not be consistent with california law,and that i f the franchise agreement contains provisions that are inconsistent with the law,the law will control.
on february,plaintiffs filed a complaint in california state court,alleging breach of the franchise agreements,fraud and deceit,negligent misrepresentation,violation of the california franchise investment law cfil,cal.et,declaratory relief,and unfair trade practices under california state law.generally,plaintiffs allege that fastbucks made numerous material misrepresentations in its uniform franchise offering circular ufoc,such as representing that fastbucks offered a unique system of training fastbucks would provide a manual for its business system and that fastbucks provided a system for ensuring the collection of loans.plaintiffs also asserted that certain provisions of the franchise agreement were unconscionable,but apparently neglected to insert into the complaint the list of specific provisions being challenged on that ground.plaintiffs sought rescission of the franchise agreement,damages including punitive or exemplary damages,declaratory relief,costs,and attorney fees.
on april,fastbucks removed the action to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.thereafter,fastbucks moved to dismiss,or in the alternative,stay the action pending arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that the arbitration clause within the franchise agreement is unconscionable and unenforceable,pursuant to,which permits a court to refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement based on generally applicable contract defenses such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.doctor,casarotto.additionally,plaintiffs argued that the arbitration provision within the franchise agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable namely,that the agreement was not mutually entered into it improperly limits plaintiffs damages it impermissibly shortens the statute of limitations it contains invalid place and manner restrictions it seeks to negate plaintiff unwaivable rights under the cfil and it wrongly bans class and consolidated actions.
the district court agreed with the plaintiffs,and denied fastbucks motion.on appeal,fastbucks argues that the district court committed three errors it failed to apply the crux of the complaint rule,pursuant to which it was for the arbitrator to decide the threshold issue of arbitrability it erred in applying california rather than texas law and it abused its discretion in refusing to sever the portions of the arbitration provision it held to be unconscionable under california law.

discussion 
abritrability 
the arbitrability of a particular dispute is a threshold issue to be decided by the courts,nagrampa,at,unless that issue is explicitly assigned to the arbitrator,see,jackson,holding that arbitrability is a question for the arbitrator where the agreement explicitly assigns that decision to the arbitrator.while the validity of an arbitration clause can be a question for the arbitrator where the crux of the complaint is that the contract as a whole including its arbitration provision is invalid,the court determines the validity of the clause where the challenge is specifically to the validity of the agreement to arbitrate.buckeye check cashing,cardegna.
in other words,when a plaintiff legal challenge is that a contract as a whole is unenforceable,the arbitrator decides the validity of the contract,including derivatively the validity of its constituent provisions such as the arbitration clause.see buckeye,at explaining that as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law,an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.u nless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself,the issue of the contract validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.however,when a plaintiff argues that an arbitration clause,standing alone,is reasons independent of any reasons the remainder of the contract might be is a question to be decided by the court.see cox ocean view hotel,cir o ur case law makes clear that courts properly exercise jurisdiction over claims raising defenses existing at law or in equity for the revocation of the arbitration clause itself.
after buckeye,we have applied the crux of the complaint rule as a method for differentiating between challenges to the arbitration provision alone and challenges to the entire contract.nagrampa,at.in buckeye,the court held that because the plaintiffs challenge d the agreement,but not specifically its arbitration provisions,those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract.the challenge should therefore be considered by an arbitrator,not a court.at.in nagrampa,we distinguished buckeye because the complaint in buckeye,unlike nagrampa complaint,did not contain claims that the arbitration provision alone was void and unenforceable,but rather alleged that the arbitration provision was unenforceable because it was contained in an illegal usurious contract which was void ab initio.nagrampa,at.fastbucks contends that buckeye,and not nagrampa,applies here because plaintiffs complaint does not contain a specific challenge to the arbitration clause 
we disagree.this case presents a third scenario not described in either buckeye or nagrampa namely,a specific challenge to the arbitration clause that is not raised as a separate claim in the complaint.see winter window fashions prof ls,d,distinguishing buckeye and nagrampa and holding that arbitrability was for the court to decide where the plaintiff specific challenge to the arbitration clause was raised in response to a petition to compel arbitration rather than in the complaint.because the material question is whether the challenge to the arbitration provision is severable from the challenge to the contract as a whole,buckeye.at,the inclusion of,or failure to include,a specific challenge in the complaint is not determinative.see winter,d at.what matters is the substantive basis of the challenge.
the crux of the complaint matters when the complaint itself makes clear that the challenge to the arbitration clause is the same challenge that is being made to the entire contract.nagrampa,at where,as here,no claim threatens to invalidate or otherwise directly affect the entire contract,the federal court must decide claims attacking the validity of the arbitration provision.the crux of the complaint rule,and our language in nagrampa,did not create a pleading rule whereby the plaintiff must plead a separate and distinct challenge to the arbitration clause in order to have the court determine arbitrability.see winter,d at see also.at explaining that the law requires the basis of the challenge to be directed specifically to the agreement to arbitrate before the court will intervene,not that the complaint must be so directed.the rule was instead designed to be an analytical tool for use by courts in determining the nature of the plaintiff challenge to the arbitration clause.indeed,in cases in which the arbitration clause invalidity is an entirely distinct issue from the contract claims in the clearest cases in which arbitrability is to be decided by the would not generally expect the plaintiff to raise claims against the validity of the arbitration clause in the complaint,because such claims generally would be unrelated to plaintiff principle prayer for relief.an independent challenge to the arbitration clause would become relevant only at the point plaintiff is required to oppose a motion to compel.in such a case,like the present one,the challenge to the validity of the arbitration provision would usually appear not in the complaint,but in the pleadings resisting a motion to compel arbitration.indeed,in,the court specifically looked to the arguments the plaintiff made in his opposition to the motion to compel,rather than strictly to the claims contained in the complaint.see.at see also,burden check into cash of,llc,cir involving challenge to arbitration clause raised in opposition to motion to stay pending arbitration,not complaint.mut.fin,llc bailey,cir same.accordingly,we look not only to the complaint,but to plaintiffs motion papers,to determine if plaintiffs objections to the arbitration clause are severable from plaintiffs challenge to the validity of the franchise agreement as a whole.
contrary to fastbucks assertions,plaintiffs argument that the arbitration provision contained in the franchise agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable,because the arbitration agreement was not mutually entered into improperly limits plaintiffs damages impermissibly shortens the statute of limitations contains invalid place and manner restrictions seeks to negate plaintiffs unwaivable rights under the cfil and wrongly bans class and consolidated actions,are clearly arguments marshaled against the validity of the arbitration clause alone,and separate from plaintiffs fraudulent inducement claims.the question of arbitrability,therefore,was properly decided by the district court.
ii.choice of law 
fastbucks next argues that the district court erred in applying california law on the question of unconscionability because the franchise agreement contains a texas choice of law clause.
a federal court sitting in diversity applies the forum state choice of law rules.hoffman citibank,cir per curiam.therefore,since this lawsuit was brought in california,we must apply california choice of law rules to determine whether to apply california or texas law to the unconscionability issue.
when an agreement contains a choice of law provision,california courts apply the parties choice of law unless the analytical approach articulated in of the restatement second of conflict of laws dictates a different result.id.under the restatement approach,the court must first determine whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction,or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the parties choice of law.nedlloyd lines superior court,cal.if either test is met,the court must next determine whether the chosen state law is contrary to a fundamental policy of california.id.if the court finds such a conflict,it must then determine whether california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue.id.quoting restatement second of conflict of laws,subd.if california possesses the materially greater interest,the court applies california law despite the choice of law clause.
texas is fastbucks principle place of business and the place it receives royalties and franchise fees.the franchise agreements were formed in texas and the franchisees received their training there.accordingly,the parties do not dispute that texas has a substantial relationship to the parties and the transaction.
at the second step of the restatement analysis,we ask whether application of texas law concerning the unconscionability question would be contrary to a fundamental public policy of california.see nedlloyd,at.in oestreicher alienware,the district court held that california had a fundamental policy against enforcing class action waivers contained in arbitration agreements,so california law applies to the unconscionability question in such a contrary choice of law.d,aff app x cir see also omstead,at same by analogy,the question here is whether california has a fundamental policy against enforcing arbitration agreements that provide that the arbitrator shall hear the dispute in dallas county,texas the claims subject to arbitration shall not be arbitrated on a basis while the franchisor may institute an action for temporary,preliminary,or permanent injunctive relief,the franchisee is not afforded the same remedy there is a one year statute of limitations for all claims and the parties are limited to recovery of actual damages and waive any right to consequential,punitive or exemplary damages.
enforcement of the arbitration clause in the franchise agreements in this case would contravene the fundamental california public policy in favor of protecting franchisees from unfair and deceptive business practices,as established by the cfil.see wimsatt beverly hills weight loss clinics int l,d.in cases involving claims under the cfil,california has an established public policy against arbitration clauses that force franchisees to waive the limitations period,bar class actions,or limit punitive and consequential damages in violation of the statute provisions.see,see also indep.ass of mailbox ctr.owners,superior court,d,t o the extent the arbitration clauses purport to deny the arbitrators the
