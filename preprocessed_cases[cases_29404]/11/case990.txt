wingert,a sales representative organization domiciled in minnesota,entered into a verbal agreement in to be a sales representative for paramount,a missouri corporation which manufactures apparel and headwear.under their agreement wingert solicited wholesale orders for paramount golf headwear line,and paramount payed wingert a fifteen percent commission on the sales.the duration of the agreement was not specified.wingert employed its own sales force,which consisted of at least twenty agents who received a ten percent commission on their sales,two thirds of the contract commission.
on december,paramount sent wingert a letter terminating the relationship effective december,but indicating it would pay commissions on sales through january.paramount subsequently contacted eighteen of the agents working for wingert and contracted directly with them for a twelve percent commission.
the minnesota termination of sales representatives act provides that a sales representative agreement of indefinite duration shall be treated as if it were for a definite duration expiring days after the giving of written notice of termination,subd.when the agreement is terminated,the sales representative is entitled to be paid for all sales as to which it would have been entitled to commissions pursuant to the provisions of the sales representative agreement,made prior to the end of the notification period,subd.thus,a representative terminated without days notice is entitled to commissions earned within days of the termination.the statute also separately provides for an award of damages without a time limitation.see,subd.
wingert brought this diversity action against paramount,asserting that paramount failure to give days notice violated the act and then amended its complaint to add claims of tortious interference with contract and unjust enrichment based on paramount hiring of its agents.paramount filed an answer and an amended answer and later moved for summary judgment on the common law claims and for limiting wingert statutory claim for recovery to net commissions five percent of sales for the days after its written notice of termination.the district court granted summary judgment on the non statutory claims but refused to limit the commissions.
one week before trial paramount moved to amend its answer to include a defense based on wingert failure to enforce noncompete clauses against its agents.the district court denied the motion as untimely,but indicated that paramount would be allowed to cross examine wingert about its failure to mitigate.it granted wingert motion in limine to exclude evidence of the noncompete agreements,including evidence of prior litigation to enforce such an agreement.wingert motion to exclude evidence of settlement negotiations was also granted.despite wingert failure to include in its cause of action a request for damages beyond the statutory period,the district court decided to allow limited testimony about lost profits beyond that six month period.
at trial wingert introduced expert testimony from accountant arthur cobb concerning its damages.cobb testified that the amount of wingert lost commissions during the day period following paramount notice was approximately.he also testified over paramount objection that wingert lost profits for the next four and a half year period were approximately.cobb explained that because wingert had not received days notice,it did not have sufficient agents to serve a new replacement line and could not arrange for replacements.during cobb testimony wingert introduced a document that contained booking information on paramount headwear line.paramount objected that it was a settlement document,but the court admitted it after redaction of a reference to settlement.paramount unsuccessfully sought to introduce cobb expert report,but was able to question him about it.
before closing arguments,paramount requested judgment as a matter of law on the issue of damages beyond the day notice period and based on insufficiency of the evidence of lost commissions.the motion was denied,and the jury found in favor of wingert and awarded damages of for failure to provide days notice and for damages beyond the day period.paramount filed a post trial motion requesting judgment in its favor on damages outside the day period and asking the district court to vacate and amend the judgment on commissions during the day period.in the alternative it requested a new trial.the district court denied the motion,and paramount appeals,challenging the damages awarded and several evidentiary rulings.wingert cross appealed the grant of summary judgment on its common law claims but has since limited its focus to the dismissal of its unjust enrichment claim.
on its appeal paramount challenges both damage awards.it argues that the award for lost commissions during the statutory notice period should have been limited to wingert net loss of only five percent commissions since the agents would have received ten percent.judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted for any damages beyond the day notice period it claims because they are not authorized by the act.in the alternative,paramount requests a new trial so that it may introduce additional evidence.we review the district court rulings under rule e for abuse of discretion,mathenia delo,cir,and the denial of judgment as a matter of law de novo.keenan computer assocs.int l,cir.we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.crane sullivan,cir.
the act provides that the payment for sales during the day notice period shall be in accordance with the terms of the sales representative agreement.see,subd.the agreement between paramount and wingert was for commissions of fifteen percent under the language of the statute,wingert is entitled to the full amount of those commissions.the district court did not abuse its discretion in overruling paramount objection to evidence regarding the gross commissions lost or in denying the motion to amend the judgment.
the award of damages beyond the notice period is supported by the plain language of the act and minnesota case law.the act gives terminated sales representatives the option of arbitration or court action and specifies the available remedies in subdivision,which include reinstatement of the sales representative agreement,or damages payment of commissions due under subdivision reasonable attorneys fees and costs to a prevailing sales representative.in this case,the jury award included both commissions under subdivision in the amount of and other damages in the form of lost profits for years in the amount of.subdivision of the act provides for damages in addition to commission payments for the day period under subdivision,and it does not limit the period for which such damages may be awarded.paramount asserts that the act does not permit future damages beyond the day period allowed by subdivision.such an interpretation of the statute effectively excises subdivision and is therefore unreasonable.a statutory provision should not be interpreted to make other provisions meaningless or superfluous.see cody hillard,cir.
the interpretation advocated by wingert is consistent with the minnesota court of appeals decision in blass bredeson,wl,in which the court determined that n othing in the language of the statute limits commissions due a sales representative under an agreement to those earned within the period.it upheld a damage award based on conduct approximately one year before term
