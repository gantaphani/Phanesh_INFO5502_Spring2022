we venture into the world of motocross racing to determine whether federal trademark law protects a motorcycle apparel company use of a stylized o on its products.
motocross is a popular form of,rough terrain motorcycle racing.jim distributing,is a leader in the industry.founded in,equips riders with boots,jerseys,helmets,and other racing indispensables.by,had captured of the market for motocross apparel and the same proportion,according to the record,as ford share of the car market.
though motocross racing is all about dirt and dust,success apparently also depended on fashion.in,began decorating its products with a stylized o followed by an apostrophe the o mark.over the years,experimented with different versions of the o mark.in,flattened the original,creating a compressed mark.a year later,created a slanted mark.in,developed a thicker,boxier o mark with rounded corners the rounded o mark.finally,in,adopted the current o mark,which abandons the rounded corners of the mark in favor of an angular approach the angular o mark.the graphical timeline below shows the evolution of o mark 
products also often feature a stylized the mark 
compared to,one industries,llc,is a newcomer to the motocross world.founded in by a graphic designer,one industries began by selling stickers and decals.by,one industries had added helmets and clothing to its product lines,putting it in direct competition with.
style is also a pillar of one industries success.in,one industries developed the one icon,which it describes as two interlacing number ones 
also in,one industries created the one angular mark 
like,one industries now uses the one icon and the one angular mark on apparel and headgear.
as one industries grew from a decal and sticker producer to a motocross apparel company,it attracted unwelcome eye.in,accused one industries of infringing the angular o mark and the mark.asserted that the o mark had been in use for over a decade,and the mark had been in use for over years.
one industries did not give an inch,denying that its one icon and one angular marks infringed trademarks.one industries accused of falsely representing that its o mark had been in use for over a decade,pointing out that the angular o mark was created in.according to one industries,the one icon and one angular marks,which were created and registered in,are senior to the angular o mark.two days later replied,reiterating its position that one industries marks infringed the angular o mark and the mark.
one industries subsequently sought a declaratory judgment in the united states district court for the southern district of california that the one icon and one angular marks did not infringe trademarks,in its answer,asserted six counterclaims for trademark infringement of the o and marks,trade dress infringement,and unfair competition under california state law.also brought a complaint against one industries founders,alleging trademark infringement and trade dress infringement.
before discovery,one industries moved for a more definite statement under federal rule of civil procedure e,claiming that complaint did not identify the particular iteration of its o mark that was allegedly infringed.in opposition,contended that t here is no need for a more definite statement because has used a singular o mark that has changed slightly over the years o nly one mark is at issue in trademark infringement claim.
the district court granted one industries motion for a more definite statement.it reasoned that two of the marks alleged to be one have been registered separately and the marks presented appear to this court to be more than just slightly different.accordingly amended its answer and counterclaims to assert infringement of the rounded o mark.later,the district court granted summary judgment to one industries on all claims.timely appealed.
primarily contends that the district court erred by refusing to tack the different versions of the o mark dating back to.according to,each iteration of the o mark constituted a continuation of the same mark rather than a creation of a new mark.tacking matters because one industries first used the one icon in developed the rounded o mark but before created the angular o mark.it is a cardinal principle of federal trademark law that the party who uses the mark first gets priority.see brookfield commc ns,coast entm t,cir it is axiomatic that the standard test of ownership is priority of use t he party claiming ownership must have been the first to actually use the mark in the sale of goods or services.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,if the rounded and angular o marks are the same mark,then the district court should have compared the one icon with the angular o mark if the marks are different,however,then the district court correctly compared the one icon with the rounded o mark.
before we reach the merits,we must confront dueling procedural arguments.
at the outset,one industries insists that forfeited the tacking argument by failing to raise it in the district court.a party normally may not press an argument on appeal that it failed to raise in the district court.see allen ornoski,cir a party can not treat the district court as a mere bunker to be circumvented on his way to this court where he will actually engage his opponents.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
one industries emphasizes that amended counterclaims,which alleged infringement of the rounded o mark,did not raise the tacking issue.it also notes that the district court summary judgment order did not address tacking.in response,contends that the district court rejected the tacking argument in its order granting one industries motion for a more definite statement.in view,the law of the case doctrine precluded it from raising tacking again during the summary judgment proceedings.also argues that this entire case has been predicated from the beginning on the doctrine of tacking.it points to the original exchange of litigation threats with one industries in which the parties disputed whether had used the angular o mark for over a decade.tellingly,however,notice of appeal refers only to the summary judgment order,not to the order granting the motion for a more definite statement.
after picking through the tangled procedural posture of this case,we are satisfied that did not forfeit its tacking claim.tacking was fleshed out during the proceedings surrounding the motion for a more definite statement.while did not use the word tack in its opposition to the motion for a more definite statement,it raised the essence of the claim 
objects to boinnard and blanchard attempt to characterize o mark as five distinct marks.plainly lays out the evolution and continued use of the o mark since its inception in its complaint consequently,no further statement is necessary concerning infringement claim of the o mark,given the extremely law that a party is entitled to modify a mark over the years if the change neither creates a new mark nor changes the commercial impression created by the old mark,especially where the only change concerned is lettering style.
in addition,the district court expressly considered and rejected such argument this court is unpersuaded by claim that it uses only one mark that has been slightly altered over the years because two of the marks alleged to be one have been registered separately and the marks presented appear to this court to be more than just slightly different.thus,the district court had an adequate opportunity to rule,and actually did rule,on the tacking issue,making it the law of the case and not subject to reopening.see agostini felton,d under the law of the case doctrine,a court should not reopen issues decided in earlier stages of the same litigation.this is hardly a case in which a party treated the district court as a mere bunker to be circumvented on his way to the appellate court.allen,at.
though we are persuaded that raised the tacking issue in the district court,there remains the problem of notice of appeal.federal rule of appellate procedure requires a party notice of appeal to designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.it is undisputed that notice of appeal references only the summary judgment order,not the order granting the motion for a more definite statement.
because we construe rule c liberally,this omission is not fatal.just this year,we held that a mistake in a notice of appeal does not necessarily doom a case 
a mistake in designating the judgment appealed from should not bar appeal as long as the intent to appeal a specific judgment can be fairly inferred and the appellee is not prejudiced by the mistake.in determining whether intent and prejudice are present,we apply a test first,whether the affected party had notice of the issue on appeal and,second,whether the affected party had an opportunity to fully brief the issue.

the tacking issue was central to the case before and during litigation and was discussed extensively in opening brief on appeal.accordingly,the appellee was not prejudiced by the mistake and had notice of the issue on appeal.ahlmeyer,at.discussion of tacking in its opening brief also displays an intent to appeal a specific judgment.id.in addition,one industries had an opportunity to fully brief the issue and did so.id.this case does not involve an attempt to sandbag the opposing party with a new issue presented for the first time on appeal.accordingly,we conclude that did not forfeit the tacking claim.
satisfied that the tacking issue was preserved for appeal,we turn to procedural challenge.it contends that the district court improperly resolved the issue on a rule e motion for a more definite statement rather than in the context of a summary judgment motion.according to,because one industries rule e motion occurred early in the litigation,discovery was not yet completed and had no opportunity to demonstrate that the evolving versions of the o mark created the same,continuing commercial impression to consumers.
we sympathize with complaint about the appropriateness of resolving this issue on a rule e motion.because tacking requires a highly inquiry,the better practice is to resolve it on summary judgment,after full discovery.here,by contrast,the tacking ruling was locked inside an order granting a motion for a more definite statement.we encourage district courts to avoid resolving merits issues,especially questions,on rule e motions.preserving such questions until later in the litigation will help prevent claims like this one,where the losing party complains that it never had a chance to make its case.
nevertheless,in this case,we are persuaded that there is no reversible error.while was on notice that tacking was at issue on the rule e motion,it failed to ask the district court to postpone ruling until after discovery.nor did move for reconsideration.having acquiesced in the resolution of the issue in the disposition of the rule e motion,can not now complain that the district court should have acted differently 
having cleared both procedural roadblocks,we turn,finally,to the merits of tacking claim a trademark owner may claim priority in a mark based on the first use date of a similar,but technically distinct,only in the exceptionally narrow instance where the previously used mark is the legal equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguishable therefrom such that consumers consider both as the same mark.brookfield,at internal quotation marks omitted.tacking is a question of fact.see quiksilver,kymsta,cir.a question of fact may be resolved as a matter of law if reasonable minds can not differ and the evidence permits only one conclusion.id.
the standard for tacking is exceedingly strict t he marks must create the same,continuing commercial impression,and the later mark should not materially differ from or alter the character of the mark attempted to be tacked.brookfield,at internal quotation marks omitted.our precedent demonstrates that tacking is allowed only in narrow circumstances.in brookfield,we concluded that can not be tacked onto the movie buff movie store.id.at.there,we reasoned that the movie buff movie store and are very different,in that the latter contains three fewer words,drops the possessive,omits a space,and adds.com to the end.id.similarly,in quiksilver,we held that the district court erred in tacking quiksilver roxy onto roxy.quiksilver,at.we reasoned that a reasonable jury could easily conclude that quiksilver roxy and roxy did not create the same,continuing commercial impression at the time the roxy brand was introduced.id.
here,because one industries first used the one icon in,the most relevant comparison is between the rounded o mark,developed in,and the angular o mark,created in 
because the district court resolved the tacking issue as a matter of law,we must decide whether the rounded o mark and the angular o mark differ to such a degree that no reasonable jury could conclude that they create the same,continuing commercial impression.
we recognize that this is a close case,but we agree with one industries and with the district court that can not meet the exceedingly strict standard for tacking.although both marks consist of a styled o followed by an apostrophe,the similarities largely end there.the apostrophes are markedly different in the rounded o mark it is entirely separated from the o and appears to be a standard apostrophe.in contrast,the angular o mark apostrophe is connected to the main image and looks like a triangle.the lower and upper horizontal lines on the rounded o mark are thinner than the corresponding lines on the angular o mark.while the rounded o mark is boxy,the angular o mark looks like the outline of a lemon.these differences,in our view,establish that the two marks are not indistinguishable.brookfield,at.like the marks at issue in brookfield and quiksilver,the rounded and the angular differ in several material respects.
cases from other circuits and from the trademark board confirm that tacking will be allowed only if the marks are virtually identical.the sixth circuit has held that dci may not be tacked onto dci.data concepts,digital consulting,cir.the federal circuit has concluded that clothes that work.for the work you do can not be tacked onto clothes that work.van.the trademark board has refused to tack the phrase american mobilphone paging with a stars and stripes background onto american mobilphone with the same background.am.paging am.mobilphone.the trademark board has also refused to tack onto.enters.in one of the few reported cases allowing tacking that we have found,the trademark board allowed a company to tack hess onto hess.hess of allentown,bellas hess.
based on this precedent,we conclude that the district court properly granted one industries motion for a more definite statement.the material differences between the rounded o mark and the angular o mark,described above,convince us that this is not one of those exceptional instances in which tacking should be permitted.
persuaded that the district court properly compared the rounded o mark with the one icon,we next consider claim that the district court erred by finding no likelihood of confusion between the two marks.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.surfvivor media,survivor,cir.although disfavored in trademark infringement cases,summary judgment may be entered when no genuine issue of material fact exists.id.
to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists,we employ the eight factor test set forth in amf sleekcraft boats,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds as recognized in mattel,walking mountain,cir.strength of the mark.proximity of the goods.similarity of the marks.evidence of actual confusion.marketing channels used.type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser.defendant intent in selecting the mark and.likelihood of expansion of the product lines.whether there is a likelihood of confusion between two competing marks is a question of fact.quiksilver,at.
