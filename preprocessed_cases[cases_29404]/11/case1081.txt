in this appeal we consider whether principles of administrative law and a controlling statute governing railroad extensions and applicable protections of environmental laws require us to grant a petition for review of a specialized agency decision to permit the extension of a railroad line to port mackenzie,alaska.petitioners alaska survival,sierra club,and cook inletkeeper seek review of the surface transportation board stb decision authorizing alaska railroad corporation arrc to construct about miles of new rail line between port mackenzie,located in alaska cook inlet,and the railroad main line,located near wasilla,alaska.the stb granted arrc an exemption under of the interstate commerce commission termination act of iccta and authorized arrc to construct the rail line.petitioners challenge the stb authority to exempt the railroad from the full licensing provisions of and the agency compliance with the national environmental policy act nepa.respondents claim that petitioners did not administratively exhaust the issue of whether the stb properly granted the exemption and that the issue is not properly before us.we have jurisdiction under a,and,and we deny the petition for review.
we first identify the parties.petitioners alaska survival,sierra club,and cook inletkeeper are nonprofit organizations dedicated to protecting wild lands,waters,and wildlife in susitna valley and the cook inlet watershed.respondent stb is a federal agency with exclusive licensing authority for the construction and operation of new rail lines.respondents intervenors are the state of alaska,a financial supporter of the project the arrc,a public corporation partially owned by the state of alaska that will build and operate the railroad and the matanuska susitna borough,the owner and operator of the port mackenzie dock and adjacent uplands.
ii.factual background 
we next review the factual background.arrc seeks to build and operate miles of rail line connecting port mackenzie,located miles across the cook inlet from the port of anchorage,to arrc main line near wasilla.the proposed rail line would consist of a rail line with a right of way,buried utility lines,an access road,communication towers,and a terminal reserve area.the purpose of the rail line is to provide rail service to port mackenzie and to connect it with the existing arrc main line,providing port mackenzie customers with rail transportation between port mackenzie and interior alaska.the proposed rail line will pass through the waters and wetlands of the susitna lowland that provides a home to wolves,bear,foxes,salmon,and other wildlife.
in february,the stb office of environmental analysis oea initiated the environmental impact statement eis public scoping process in anticipation of arrc request for authorization to construct the rail line arrc filed its petition in december,requesting an exemption from the full licensing procedures required under.oea released the draft eis deis in march.elected officials,organizations,citizens,and various agencies submitted around comments on the deis.the final eis feis was released in march.it recommended that arrc employ one hundred mitigation measures to reduce environmental impacts but acknowledged that even with mitigation,construction of the rail line would increase erosion and sediment transport to water,cause nutrient loading,and likely leak petrochemicals to nearby waters.construction would also lead to loss of wetland habitat,water degradation,and potentially a change in the hydrology of the wetland system.the feis identified the mac east variant connector variant houston houston south alternative as the environmentally preferable alternative for the proposed line.
oea did not request comment on the feis,but the environmental protection agency epa,the alaska department of natural resources adnr,sierra club,and several citizens submitted comments noting various deficiencies.for example,the epa expressed concern that the purpose and need statement did not contain sufficient information on the project need or public necessity.in response to these and other concerns,the oea prepared an environmental memorandum em addressing the comments and concluding that a supplemental eis was not necessary.
after reviewing the entire environmental record,including the feis,the em,and public comments,the stb issued a decision on november,granting the exemption and authorizing the rail line.the stb determined first that an exemption was appropriate because it was consistent with parts,and of the transportation policy and second that full consideration under was not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market power.the stb concluded that the record showed that the eis took a hard look at the potential environmental impacts of the proposed action and that it carefully considered alternatives to the planned action.the stb then adopted all of the oea environmental review and conclusions,authorized construction of the environmentally preferable alternative,and imposed on arrc the one hundred mitigation measures recommended by oea to address the project adverse impacts on surface waters,wetlands,fisheries,and recreational trail access.commissioner mulvey dissented from the stb decision based on the project likely substantial adverse impact on the environment and the poor showing of a purpose and need for the line and on his belief that the project is not in the public interest.
petitioners seek review of the stb decision 
iii.statutory framework 
before reaching the merits,we consider the statutory framework relevant to this petition for review.
the iccta amended existing railroad statutes,replaced the interstate commerce commission icc with the stb,and provided that icc precedent applies to the stb.see plains res.council,surface transp,cir hereinafter nprc,stat.codified at.under,the board has exclusive licensing authority for the construction and operation of new railroad lines and may certify rail line construction and operation unless the stb finds the project to be inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.nprc,at.to determine public convenience and necessity,the stb looks at a variety of circumstances surrounding the proposed action,which can include consideration of the applicant financial fitness,the public demand or need for the service,and the potential harm to competitors.see id.at quoting navajo ranchers ass interstate commerce comm n.as an alternative to the detailed procedures,provides that the stb 
shall exempt a person,class of persons,or a transaction or service whenever the board finds that the application in whole or in part of a provision of this part is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section of this title and either 
a the transaction or service is of limited scope or b the application in whole or in part of the provision is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.
obtaining an exemption streamlines the regulatory process by eliminating notice and comment in some cases,by making a hearing unnecessary,and by expediting the final decision.vill.of palestine interstate commerce comm n.

iv.discussion 
petitioners argue that the stb improperly exempted the proposed rail line from the procedural requirements of.before we reach that issue,we must first address whether it is properly before us.respondents and respondents intervenors arrc and matanuskasusitna borough assert that it is not.they contend that petitioners did not raise the issue of the agency use of the exemption at the appropriate time under the agency practice,and that this failure to exhaust prevents us from deciding these issues now.petitioners respond that the supreme court plurality decision in sims apfel,d,makes issue exhaustion requirements inapplicable here.we conclude that petitioners are not procedurally barred from raising their challenge to the exemption.
the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to permit administrative agencies to utilize their expertise,correct any mistakes,and avoid unnecessary judicial intervention in the process.lands council mcnair,cir.but in sims,the supreme court indicated that judicially created issue exhaustion is not always appropriate.sims,u.at.the court considered whether a person claiming social security benefits waived judicial review of issues not raised before the agency appeals council.id.at.a plurality determined that when neither statute nor regulation requires issue exhaustion,judicially created issue exhaustion is inappropriate where the administrative proceeding was informal and inquisitorial rather than adversarial,and the claimant exhausted administrative remedies.id.at.justice concurred,noting that the issue exhaustion inquiry requires careful examination of the characteristics of the particular administrative procedure provided.id.at,concurring quoting mccarthy madigan,d.similarly,we have noted that there is no test to determine whether a party has properly exhausted a claim to the agency the determination must be made on a basis.buckingham sec y of dep t of,cir.and it is a clear rule in our court that the exhaustion requirement should be interpreted broadly.parks conservation ass bureau of land,cir hereinafter npca.because neither statute nor regulation required issue exhaustion in this matter,we must consider whether judicially imposed issue exhaustion is appropriate here.
we have applied sims in the adjudicatory context,vaught scottsdale healthcare.health plan,cir,but determined that sims offers no guidance in the rulemaking context,universal health,thompson,cir.neither case is directly on point.although the stb conducts rulemaking when it grants an exemption,see cmc real estate interstate commerce comm n,universal health services is distinguishable because it addresses rulemaking,which is not generally employed by the stb during the exemption process.see a stating that the e xemption proceedings are informal,and public comments are generally not sought during consideration of exemption petition proposals.although the adjudicatory nature of the erisa proceeding distinguishes vaught from the stb grant of the exemption,vaught is instructive because it concludes that when an agency engages in a,informal proceeding and does not provide notice of issue exhaustion requirements,then judicially created issue exhaustion is likely inappropriate.at.similarly,the stb procedures were informal and provided no notice to interested parties that to later challenge the stb decision one must submit comments during the exemption process.in other cases,the stb,or its predecessor the icc,explicitly requested public comment on exemptions.see,or.public util.comm interstate commerce comm n,cir hereinafter opuc noting that the icc granted an exemption subject to public comment.commerce comm interstate commerce comm n,stating that the icc issued a notice proposing a blanket exemption 
respondents argue that petitioners should have commented on the exemption during the eis process,but the record does not show that the stb ever said that was the appropriate time in which to raise issues with the exemption process.although the stb published notice of its eis proceedings,which included reference to arrc application,it never provided direct notice of or requested public comment on the exemption.see,the alaska railroad corporation petition for exemption to construct and operate a rail line extension to port mackenzie,ak.further,the agency has stated that it does not usually rely on comments to frame issues for its review of exemption petitions.see modification of procedure for handling exemptions filed under,stating that c omments have added very little to the icc determination of exemption petitions sims,at stating that the social security appeals council does not depend much,if at all,on claimants to identify issues for review.because this administrative process lacks an adversarial component,the reasons for us to require issue exhaustion are much weaker.sims,at 
based on the informal nature of these proceedings and the lack of notice to interested parties of the appropriate time in which to raise their objections to the agency decision to apply the exemption,we conclude that the question of whether the stb violated or in granting the exemption for the port mackenzie rail line is properly before us.
iccta exemption from public convenience and necessity review 
petitioners contend that the stb did not properly apply the standards set forth in and when it granted arrc application for an exemption to construct the proposed rail line.they challenge the stb decision not to consider the public convenience and necessity of the project and the stb assessment of the transportation policy under.we hold that it was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or contrary to law for the stb to grant arrc an exemption under from the full licensing procedures required by.we further hold that substantial evidence supports the stb findings favoring its grant of the exemption.
section a states that the stb shall grant an exemption from a provision of the statute if application of that provision is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy and the transaction is of limited scope or the application of the full statutory procedures is not needed to protect shippers from abuse of market power.a.this exemption procedure reflects congress determination that there be continuing evaluation of the appropriateness of regulation and continuing deregulation where consistent with the act policies.coal exps.ass of the,united states.section sets forth a more detailed procedure for authorizing construction and operation of rail lines,which requires a determination that the activities are consistent with the public convenience and necessity.a c.
we review the stb statutory construction of the iccta under chevron,nat.res.defense council,d.see nprc,at.first,we inquire whether congress has addressed directly the issue before the court,and if so,the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.quoting chevron,at.if congress has not unambiguously addressed the specific issue before us,then we must determine whether the agency construction of the statute is permissible.id.at.
petitioners argument that we should review the stb action pursuant to the standards set forth in lacks merit.petitioners rely on vague precedent to argue that when the stb grants a exemption it summarily issues a certificate of public convenience and necessity as required under.holrail,llc surface transp,reviewing an stb decision concerning a railway right to cross another railway right of way.they contend that holrail should be read to mean that the stb should have performed a full analysis of public convenience and necessity.petitioners also assert that the stb erred in not analyzing the public convenience and necessity of the proposed rail line when the project financial viability was called into question.these arguments are not persuasive.we do not read holrail as requiring that the stb engage in a public convenience and necessity analysis before granting an exemption from that very procedure.such a conclusion would run contrary to the plain language of a,which mandates that the stb grant exemptions from the full proceedings required under the statute.see a.further,neither nor the stb implementing regulations indicate that an exemption proceeding is improper when the project financial viability is questioned.it might be argued with some force that it is not the best practice to employ the exemption process for a contentious project,but that is for the agency and not us to decide.see city of carmel by the sea dep t of,cir stating that the court should not substitute its judgment for that of the agency.
petitioners also argue that the stb does not have authority to exempt a project as large as the proposed spur.this argument misreads the statute.section a allows the stb to grant an exemption if the project is either of limited scope or the full statutory proceedings are not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market power.a.the plain language of the statute does not require the stb to consider both factors.here,the stb chose to analyze the project impact on shippers instead of its scope.because the stb concluded that the full statutory proceedings were not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market power,the stb had no duty to consider whether the project was of limited size.the stb acted within its authority when it applied the analysis required by a without considering the public convenience and necessity under.
petitioners also contend that the stb did not consider relevant parts of the rail transportation policy and that for those factors considered the stb failed to explain how the record supported its findings.we disagree.the stb did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in determining the applicable sections of the rail transportation policy set out in,and substantial evidence supports the stb findings for those factors considered.
when the stb grants an exemption from a portion of the interstate commerce act,the stb needs to take into account only the purpose of that portion of the statute from which exemption is granted.opuc,at.stated another way,t he scope of the stb review in an exemption proceeding is a function of the relationship between the section from which an exemption is sought,here,and the rail transportation policy enumerated in.vill.of palestine,at internal quotations omitted.this rule ensures that the stb will not be faced with the impossible task of reconciling a variety of different objectives of the rail transportation policy.opuc,at.t he stb need not explicitly discuss in its decision each factor enumerated all that is necessary is that the essential basis of the stb rationale be clear enough so that a court can satisfy itself that the stb has performed its function.coal,at quoting alamo express,interstate commerce comm n,cir.
the stb did not act arbitrarily by failing to consider additional policy factors.petitioners contend that the stb should have considered three additional factors promoting a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues,as determined by the board,encouraging honest and efficient management of railroads,and encouraging and promoting energy conservation.petitioners do not show how these factors relate to the purpose of.such a showing would make it necessary for the stb to consider those provisions.see opuc,at.nor do they show that the stb interpretation of which factors are relevant to the purpose of is an unreasonable interpretation of the statute.
petitioners claim that illinois commerce commission and coal exporters impose a heavy burden on the stb to identify all the relevant policies furthered by an exemption.but the stb does not have a duty to make findings about each aspect of the rail transportation policy possibly affected by its grant of the exemption.vill.of palestine,at.to require such analysis would make the exemption process broader and possibly more onerous than the proceeding from which exemption was sought.id.petitioners also contend that illinois commerce commission and coal exporters show that the stb is not entitled to wide deference in choosing which factors of the policy apply.such an assertion runs contrary to our standard of review under the apa.see nprc,at stating that the stb decision on railroad application approvals must be upheld unless arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or not in accordance with law.we conclude that the stb decision to consider only factors,and was reasonable.
likewise,the stb provided sufficient findings supporting its consideration of factors,and.the stb explained that the record supported its conclusion that construction would be consistent with factors,ensuring the development and continuation of a sound rail transportation system,and,fostering sound economic conditions in transportation and ensuring effective competition and coordination between rail carriers and other modes.the stb noted that the rail line would be more efficient than truck transportation and would enhance intermodal competition by providing an alternative to freight to meet the needs of shippers.further,the eis discussed the economic and transportation benefits of the rail line.
the stb also found that the exemption would reduce the need for federal regulation and decrease regulatory barriers to entry in support of factors,minimizing the need for federal regulatory control,and,reducing regulatory barriers.these findings are reasonable when the exemption made it unnecessary for arrc to go through otherwise lengthy regulatory procedures under.the stb explanations are sufficient for us to determine the stb rationale and satisfy ourselves that the stb performed its function as required by the statute.see coal,at.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency findings.see in re transcon lines,cir describing the substantial evidence standard.
petitioners raise a second issue of whether the stb eis complied with nepa.they contend that the stb violated nepa by adopting an unreasonable purpose and need statement,refusing to consider an alternative route without an access road,and inadequately assessing the project adverse effect on wetlands.we disagree.
purpose and need statement 
petitioners argue that the stb erred by adopting a purpose and need statement focused exclusively on the goals stated by arrc.they contend that the stb did not take into consideration public goals when defining the purpose and need.respondents assert that the purpose and need statement properly focused on both the stb enabling statute and arrc goals.we agree with respondents,and we hold that the stb did not act arbitrarily or capriciously by generating the purpose and need statement based on the statutory context and arrc objectives.
a statement of purpose and need must briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action.courts review purpose and need statements for reasonableness giving the agency considerable discretion to define a project purpose and need.westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir.a purpose and need stat
