background 
and his business partner,coyne,each owned a percent interest in a parcel of undeveloped property located at lombard street the property.has been a real estate developer and builder for approximately years.
in,appellants began leasing the property to tower valet parking incorporated tower valet for use as a parking lot.the lease allowed tower valet use of the lot seven days per week and hours per day,and was terminable upon days notice.testified that interim use of a development site in this manner is typical in the development business.no physical structures or improvements were located on the property after appellants purchased it,other than the parking lot pavement itself and a small kiosk for the parking attendant.
in connection with the proposed development project,appellants formed an entity called lombard llc.appellants registered that entity with the state of california and listed the business address as clementina street,not lombard street.appellants did not maintain an office or store any real estate development records or files on the property.appellants did not receive mail delivery at the property,and there were no phone or fax lines installed there.periodically parked his truck on the property to review documents,conduct business on his cell phone,and meet with surveyors,architects,and neighbors.
in june,the ccsf planning commission approved appellants application to build a residential condominium with ground floor retail space on the property.on february,the ccsf board of supervisors passed a resolution of necessity,which stated that public interest and necessity required the acquisition of the property by eminent domain so that it could be developed and maintained as open space.
before ccsf passed its resolution of necessity,appellants had commissioned and received architectural and engineering plans for the proposed development of the property,and had secured approval for the proposed project from the ccsf planning commission.they had not obtained a building permit to construct the condominium project,begun construction,or secured construction financing.appellants also had not presold or preleased any of the residential or commercial units.appellants had invested approximately in the project,not including the purchase price of the land,mortgage costs,property costs,or compensation for their own time.the only income appellants derived from the property was the rental income from tower valet.
in february,ccsf filed its first amended and operative complaint in eminent domain against appellants.in april,appellants filed their second amended answer,claiming compensation for loss of business goodwill under code of civil procedure section in june,the trial court granted ccsf motion to strike this claim.appellants filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking relief from the trial court order and we granted relief,concluding there was an insufficient factual record to support the order.coyne superior court of san francisco county,wl,nonpub.opn.however,we specifically declined to reach the question of whether appellants claim for lost goodwill to their business of developing the property was cognizable under section.
the trial court bifurcated trial with respect to the proposed taking.the phase i court trial addressed whether ccsf had the right to take the property and whether appellants had satisfied the statutory conditions for entitlement to business goodwill.the phase jury trial determined the just compensation for the taking of the property.prior to the court trial,ccsf filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence in support of appellants goodwill claim.the court deferred ruling on the motion until after the presentation of evidence at the court trial.
the court trial commenced in april.appellants goodwill expert,aaron amster,testified that appellants real estate development business lost between and million in goodwill as a result of the eminent domain action.ccsf experts,chris carneghi and david bohegian,both real estate appraisers,opined that there was no goodwill associated with the property prior to the taking,and,therefore,appellants had not suffered a loss of goodwill.
following trial,the court ruled that appellants had failed to establish entitlement to lost goodwill under section and were precluded from introducing evidence thereof to the jury citing section,subdivision a,the court determined that appellants failed to meet their burden of proving that they are the owners of a business conducted on the property taken.the court also concluded that appellants failed to establish that they suffered a loss of goodwill typical of an ongoing small business forced to move and give up the benefits of its former location.appellants have not shown that they lost patronage or name recognition as another business might if it was forced to move.appellants failed to establish the loss of any benefits that accrue to a business as a result of its location,reputation for dependability,skill or quality,and any other circumstances resulting in probable retention of old or acquisition of new patronage.appellants have not shown that they lost anything other than an amount remaining after the fair market value of the land,as well as construction and marketing costs,are deducted from the projected income from the sale of the units.since the complex was never built or marketed and no units were sold,this remaining by ccsf as profit and a portion of which is labeled by appellants as goodwill is somewhat speculative.the court went on to state that appellants had met the other threshold requirements for goodwill compensation,subd.a.a jury trial to determine the value of the property followed,and the jury found that just compensation for the property was.
appellants filed this timely appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
i.the statutory scheme 
the state power to take property by eminent domain is conditioned on its obligation to pay just compensation to the owner.citations.just compensation is defined as fair market value citation,which in turn is defined as the highest price on the date of valuation that would be agreed to by a seller and a buyer each dealing with the other with full knowledge of all the uses and purposes for which the property is reasonably adaptable and available citation.the constitutional guarantee of just compensation is obviously intended to protect the landowner,but it also protects the public by limiting its liability to losses that can fairly be attributed to the taking.a landowner is not entitled to be placed in a better position financially than he was before the condemnation neither is the state required to pay more than land is worth merely because of some theoretical,intangible concept.citations.emeryville redevelopment agency harcros pigments,th,d emeryville redevelopment.
historically,lost business goodwill was not recoverable under eminent domain law.inglewood redevelopment agency aklilu th,d aklilu.however,in the legislature enacted section in response to widespread criticism of the injustice wrought by the legislature historic refusal to compensate condemnees whose ongoing businesses were diminished in value by a forced relocation.citations.the purpose of the statute was unquestionably to provide monetary compensation for the kind of losses which typically occur when an ongoing small business is forced to move and give up the benefits of its former location.people ex rel.of transportation muller cal d,muller.thus,a business owner right to compensation for loss of goodwill is a statutory right,not a constitutional right.redevelopment agency international house of pancakes,th,d.
by statute,if the owner of a business being conducted on the property taken establishes certain preconditions,he or she is entitled to compensation for the loss of goodwill that results from the taking.the owner of a business conducted on the property taken,or on the remainder if the property is part of a larger parcel,shall be compensated for loss of goodwill if the owner proves all of the following the loss is caused by the taking of the property or the injury to the remainder.the loss can not reasonably be prevented by a relocation of the business or by taking steps and adopting procedures that a reasonably prudent person would take and adopt in preserving the goodwill.compensation for the loss will not be included in payments under section of the government code.compensation for the loss will not be duplicated in the compensation otherwise awarded to the owner,subd.a.the statute defines goodwill as the benefits that accrue to a business as a result of its location,reputation for dependability,skill or quality,and any other circumstances resulting in probable retention of old or acquisition of new patronage,subd.b.
compensation for loss of goodwill in eminent domain proceedings involves a process.whether the qualifying conditions for such compensation citation have been met is a matter for the trial court to resolve.only if the court finds these conditions exist does the remaining issue of the value of the goodwill loss,if any,go to the jury.citations.city of santa clarita nts technical systems th,d,fn.omitted.under section,subdivision a,the business owner has the initial burden of showing entitlement to compensation for lost goodwill.aklilu,supra,th at,d.where,as here,the entitlement to business goodwill is disputed,the determination of that dispute,including the resolution of any disputed factual issues is for the trial court.emeryville redevelopment,supra,th at,d.
section does not provide any guidance as to how the value of lost goodwill should be calculated.consequently,the courts have recognized that there is no single method by which to measure goodwill citation and that e ach case must be determined on its own facts and circumstances citation.nevertheless,the evidence presented to a jury regarding lost goodwill must be such as legitimately establishes value citation and generally represents the present value of the anticipated profits of the business.citations.in other words,while there are no explicit statutory requirements regarding an expert use of a particular methodology for valuing lost goodwill,the expert methodology must provide a fair estimate of actual value and can not be based on hypothetical or speculative uses of a condemned business.citations.redevelopment agency of san diego mesdaq th,d mesdaq.in goodwill proceedings,as with other proceedings,a trial court has a special obligation to oversee the admission of expert testimony and,where an objection has been made,shall exclude testimony in the form of an opinion that is based in whole or in significant part on matter that is not a proper basis for such an opinion.citation.a challenge to the trial court admission or rejection of expert testimony regarding the calculation of lost goodwill is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citation.id.at,d.
ii.appellants did not have an ongoing business located on the property taken 
section provides for compensation for losses resulting from the forced relocation of an ongoing business conducted on condemned land,subd.a muller,supra,cal d at,matteoni veit,condemnation practice in cal.just compensation.there is no evidence of an ongoing business located on the property,aside from the parking lot appellants expert,amster,calculated goodwill based on the profits to be derived from the sale of residential and commercial units in a condominium complex located on the property.at the time the land was taken,however,the condominium complex did not exist.the ccsf planning commission had approved appellants development application,but no building permit had been issued and no construction had begun.moreover,none of the units had been presold or preleased.thus,at the time ccsf initiated the eminent domain proceeding,there was no ongoing business devoted to retailing the condominium units to potential customers.
appellants concede their business had no patrons,but argue under muller loss of patronage is legally irrelevant to a determination of goodwill.that is an overstatement.in muller,a veterinary business was forced to relocate when the property on which it was located was taken by the department of transportation dot.muller,supra,cal d at.the owner selected a nearby site,with higher rent,in order to avoid a loss of patronage.the dot argued there was no loss of goodwill because patronage had remained steady.the supreme court rejected the contention that section authorized compensation only for a loss of patronage itself,concluding that the higher rent,incurred largely to forestall such a loss,was compensable.muller,at.that is,muller held recovery for business goodwill did not require a net loss of patronage and expressly permitted recovery for expenses necessarily incurred to prevent such a loss.san diego metropolitan transit development bd.hotel,th,d.in any event,at the time of the taking appellants lacked not only customers,but a product or service as well they had no ongoing business conducted on the property.
appellants focus on their role as developers and argue they were actively engaged in the business of developing a residential and commercial complex,and that business lost its goodwill as a result of the taking of the property.they contend they are entitled to recover for lost goodwill because the legislature has decided,as a matter of public policy,that a business owner whose business is damaged by the taking of property upon which the business depends for its operations should be compensated for any resulting loss of goodwill.italics added.but appellants mischaracterization of the legislature policy decision highlights the error in their claim for recovery.
a property development business may be entitled to compensation for loss of goodwill when it is located on property taken by eminent domain.for example,if a real estate developer has an office on parcel a,where it presells units to be built on parcels x and y or a for that matter,the condemnation of parcel a will deprive the developer of a business conducted on the property.however,the condemnation of parcels x or y will not have this result,even if the business depends upon those parcels,because the business is not located on them.
appellants had no development business located on the property.they had no office,no telephone or fax machine,no mail delivery,and no business records located at that site at the time of the taking.when they registered their business with the state of california,they listed a different site as their place of business.to be sure,testified he was occasionally present at the property and made cell phone calls related to the development and met with surveyors,architects,and neighbors.but these few acts are insufficient to demonstrate appellants development business was located on the property,even if that business depended on that site.
appellants also argue b y its nature,the business of developing a particular piece of property is conducted on the property itself.they cite no legal authority for that proposition and we are aware of none.the absence of such authority suggests the novelty of appellants claim for lost goodwill.and appellants position as owners of raw land taken by eminent domain is sufficiently common that the novelty of the argument demonstrates its weakness.
at bottom,accepting appellants argument would mean that they would be able to recover the fair market value of their land and
