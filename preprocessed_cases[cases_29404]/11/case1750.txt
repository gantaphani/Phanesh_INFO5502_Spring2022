patricia ramirez appeals from an order denying her motion to certify a class on her unfair competition claim ucl against balboa thrift and loan balboa.ramirez ucl claim is based on balboa alleged violation of the rees levering motor vehicle sales and finance act rees levering act or act,et 
ramirez contends the court erred in denying her class certification motion because the court based its denial on an erroneous legal analysis of the rees levering act.we conclude this contention has merit and reverse the order.we remand to permit the court to consider the propriety of the class certification motion without the improper legal analysis.
factual and procedural background 
in december,ramirez purchased an automobile from a honda dealer under a conditional sale contract obligating her to make monthly payments.as part of the purchase,ramirez filled out a credit application.shortly after the purchase,the dealer assigned the contract to balboa.during the next three years,ramirez often missed required payments.in about may,ramirez stopped making payments and voluntarily surrendered her vehicle to balboa.
after the surrender,on july,balboa sent ramirez a notice of intention to dispose of motor vehicle noi,notifying her that it intended to sell the vehicle.the noi stated that ramirez had the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the total outstanding amount due or she had the right to reinstate the installment contract and obtain a return of the vehicle.with respect to the reinstatement right,the noi stated that ramirez must pay within days of the notice date or request an extension and you must also pay any payment,fees,or charges that comes due within the reinstatement period.italics added.the notice also stated that to learn the exact amount you must pay,call us at the telephone number stated above.
ramirez did not make any efforts to redeem the vehicle or reinstate the contract.
more than days after sending the noi,on september,balboa sent a letter to ramirez notifying her that her vehicle had been sold for,and after deducting the sale proceeds and related charges,there was a balance of.the letter stated you are required to pay the remaining balance and demand is hereby made upon you to contact the undersigned by october.if you do not respond to this legal demand as requested,we may be obligated to institute litigation to liquidate this balance,and you may be assessed all costs and fees.
about one week later,ramirez sent balboa,which she said was a payment on the deficiency balance.soon after,ramirez credit report reflected her loan default and voluntary surrender of the vehicle,and that a deficiency of was written off.
several days later,on september,ramirez filed a class action lawsuit against balboa,alleging that balboa engaged in an unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business practice based on its violation of the rees levering act.she alleged balboa violated the act because the noi sent to her did not specifically include the conditions precedent to contract reinstatement.see juarez arcadia financial,th juarez.specifically,ramirez alleged that balboa failed to inform her of all amounts that she must pay to balboa to cure the default,including additional monthly payments coming due after the date of the noi but before the end of the notice period,as well as any late fees or other fees and the amount of those fees.balboa also failed to tell ramirez the names and addresses of the third parties that had to be paid in order to reinstate the subject vehicle,and the amounts that must be paid to those third parties in order to reinstate the subject vehicle.she alleged that she has been injured based on the payment and the fact that balboa reported the deficiency claim to credit bureaus.
ramirez brought the action on behalf of the following class all california residents whose vehicles were repossessed by or voluntarily surrendered to balboa or its agents pursuant to a conditional sales contract and against whom balboa has asserted a deficiency claim during the period beginning four years before the filing of this action to the date of class certification.this class excludes all balboa employees and all persons whose conditional sales contract obligations have been discharged in bankruptcy.
ramirez sought various remedies,including a determination that the noi failed to comply with the act and therefore balboa lost the right to assert a deficiency claim restitution to class members based on the amount of money each class member paid on balboa invalid deficiency claims during the relevant period and an injunction prohibiting balboa from attempting to collect or recover on invalid deficiency claims.
balboa answered the complaint and filed a alleging a single breach of contract cause of action,claiming ramirez failed to pay the amounts owed on the contract and seeking a deficiency judgment of.
balboa then moved for summary judgment summary adjudication on the complaint,asserting that as a matter of law ramirez could not prevail on her ucl claim because balboa had a legal basis under section b to have denied her reinstatement right based on false statements she made on her credit application in.ramirez opposed the motion,asserting that balboa legal argument that it could successfully defend the ucl claim based on a retroactive denial of her reinstatement right was unsupported by the rees levering act,and,in any event,the facts showed that she did not make any false statements on her credit application.after reviewing the parties papers and factual submissions,the court did not rule on the legal argument,but denied balboa motion based on its finding that triable issues of fact exist as to whether the statements made on ramirez credit application were truthful.
ramirez then filed a class certification motion,seeking to certify the proposed class of california residents whose vehicles were repossessed by or voluntarily surrendered to balboa.based on balboa interrogatory response as to how many individuals fall within the class definition,ramirez asserted there were at least individuals in the proposed class.
in her supporting papers,ramirez addressed each of the elements of a class certification motion.with respect to the predominance issue,ramirez argued that common legal and factual issues would predominate because the juarez court interpreted the rees levering act to require that,as a precondition to seeking a deficiency,a creditor must issue an noi specifically identifying all conditions precedent to reinstatement,and balboa nois uniformly failed to give consumers these conditions precedent to reinstating their loans,including how much they must pay to reinstate their loans and the names and addresses of those who are to be paid.see juarez,supra,th at.ramirez also argued that the requested injunctive and restitutionary relief requires the resolution of common factual and legal questions.
balboa opposed the motion on numerous grounds,including individual legal and factual issues predominate among class members ramirez is an inadequate class representative ramirez did not incur an injury within the meaning of the ucl standing requirement ramirez claims were not typical and class treatment is not superior under the totality of the circumstances.
with respect to the first predominance issue,balboa argued primarily that there were eight different versions of the noi during the class period,many of which raise different legal and factual issues regarding whether the noi complied with the rees levering act,and therefore the court would be required to undertake an individual analysis of each noi to determine the class member recovery right.balboa also identified several other individual issues that would make the class action unmanageable.of particular relevance here,balboa argued that many class members received noi that denied them a reinstatement right,and,with respect to the class members who received an noi providing a reinstatement right,the court would be required to engage in an individual analysis of each class member entitlement to recover because balboa had the right to assert an affirmative defense as to each class member concerning whether he or she fell within an exception identified in section b.
balboa additionally proffered evidence indicating that although balboa total outstanding deficiency balance is approximately million,balboa does not collect on over of the deficiencies balboa explained in a declaration that after we send the notice of deficiency and a couple of months go by,except in the rare occasion,balboa does not pursue the customer o n the deficiency balance according to the evidence,the total amount collected on deficiencies from all the noi sent during the class period was.
after considering the parties arguments and submissions,the court issued a tentative ruling stating ramirez motion to certify the class is denied.individual issues of fact predominate over common questions of fact.specifically,it is unclear whether there were grounds to deny reinstatement as to each individual class member pursuant to civil code section b.
during oral argument,ramirez counsel argued that the court conclusion was based on a faulty legal premise that the section b exception pertaining to misrepresentation on a credit application allows a creditor to obtain a deficiency even if the exception was not identified in the noi sent to the buyer.
balboa counsel countered that the court reliance on section b to show the existence of individual factual issues was proper because balboa had the ability to raise this statutory misrepresentation defense as a matter of due process.counsel also noted it had identified many other individual issues and discussed the fact that balboa had repeatedly modified its standard noi form and had used eight different versions of the noi during the class period.balboa counsel also argued that ramirez did not sustain sufficient injury to show standing under the ucl claim,but the court specifically stated that it was not making any determination on that issue,stating i saw that in the documents,but i do think that part of this analysis.
in response to defense counsel reliance on the different versions of balboa noi form,ramirez counsel asserted that the different versions would not require an individual analysis because each of the different iterations are defective in the same way,including that t hey require payment of storage charges and additional payments that come due and these amounts are not stated in those nois ramirez counsel also clarified that the persons who were denied reinstatement in the noi are not in the class.the class includes only those persons who received an noi that allowed them reinstatement.
at the conclusion of the arguments,the court stated i appreciate everybody presentations.not an easy case.i still do think i can certify this as a class.there too many individual issues in this.i going to confirm the tentative ruling.
the court thereafter entered its final order stating that plaintiff motion for class certification is denied pursuant to the reasons stated on the record and the court tentative ruling on may,individual issues of fact predominate over common questions of fact.specifically,it is unclear whether there were grounds to deny reinstatement as to each individual class member pursuant to civil code section b.

discussion 
class action certification principles 
class actions serve an important function in our judicial system.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress.richmond dart industries,cal d,seastrom neways,th.however,because group action has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.linder thrifty oil cal th,linder seastrom,supra,th at.
the party seeking certification must establish the existence of an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citation.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at see also code civ.the proponent must show the class action is superior to individual lawsuits or alternative procedures for resolving the controversy.bufil dollar financial group,th,accord city of san jose superior court cal d.
on the issue whether common issues predominate in the litigation,a court must examine the plaintiff theory of recovery and assess the nature of the legal and factual disputes likely to be presented.brinker restaurant superior court cal th,brinker,italics added.the court may consider the elements of the claims and defenses,but should not rule on the merits unless necessary to resolve the certification issues.lockheed martin superior court cal th,linder,supra,cal th at.the ultimate question is whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.brinker,supra,at.in conducting this analysis,a court must examine the allegations of the complaint and supporting declarations citation,and consider whether the legal and factual issues they present are such that their resolution in a single class proceeding would be both desirable and feasible.as a general rule if the defendant liability can be determined by facts common to all members of the class,a class will be certified even if the members must individually prove their damages.id.at,fn.omitted.
trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action and therefore are afforded great discretion in evaluating the relevant factors and in ruling on a class certification motion.sav on drug stores,superior court cal th,accord brinker,supra,cal th at.a certification order generally will not be disturbed unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence,it rests on improper criteria,or it rests on erroneous legal assumptions.citations.fireside bank superior court cal th,see sav on,supra,at.
on appeal from the denial of class certification,we review only the reasons given by the trial court for its ruling.kaldenbach mutual of omaha life ins.th,accord bartold glendale federal bank th,bartold.appeal of an order denying class certification presents an exception to the general rule on review that we look only to the trial court result,not its rationale.citation.erroneous legal assumptions or improper criteria may require reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citation.caro procter gamble th.in other words,we review only the reasons given by the trial court for denial of class certification,and ignore any other grounds that might support denial.bartold,supra,th at.however,a ny valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.linder,supra,cal th at see kaldenbach,th at.
under these principles,if a trial court bases its denial of class certification on an incorrect legal analysis,a reviewing court must reverse and remand,unless the trial court independently relied on at least one other legally valid and factually supported ground.see in re tobacco ii cases cal th,when a trial court decision rests on an error of law,that decision is an abuse of discretion fletcher security pacific nat.bank cal d,reversal and remand warranted where trial court erroneously held that an unfair trade practice class action required proof of each individual borrower lack of knowledge mcadams monier,th,reversing court order denying class certification where trial court used improper criteria and made erroneous legal assumptions knapp v.at t wireless services,th,w e will reverse an order denying class certification if the trial court used improper criteria or made erroneous legal assumptions,even if substantial evidence supported the order ticconi blue shield of california life health ins.th,denial of motion to certify class reversed where trial court erroneously concluded that the defense of unclean hands was available in a ucl action based on the violation of certain insurance code sections.
ii.the ucl 
in her complaint,ramirez alleged a single cause of action under the ucl.the ucl prohibits unfair competition,including unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business acts.bus.it embraces anything that can properly be called a business practice and that is forbidden by law.korea supply lockheed martin cal th.the ucl borrows violations from other laws by making them independently actionable as unfair competitive practices.ibid.
ramirez ucl claim is based on her allegation that balboa violated the rees levering act by failing to comply with the act requirement that an noi contain the specific conditions precedent to reinstatement of her vehicle loan.a.she sought to certify a class of individuals whose vehicles were repossessed by or surrendered to balboa and against whom balboa asserted a deficiency claim.she claimed that with respect to this class of persons,balboa violated the rees levering act in identical ways and thus common issues would predominate.she also alleged that she had standing because she suffered monetary injury in the form of her payment and a negative report on her credit report.
in analyzing whether the court erred in denying certification of the class,we first summarize the relevant provisions of the rees levering act.we then examine whether the court stated reasons for denying the motion were based on a correct legal analysis and supported by substantial evidence.
iii.the rees levering act 
the act provides detailed rules governing motor vehicle conditional sale contracts such as the one signed by ramirez.et see juarez,supra,th at.the act purpose is to provide more comprehensive protections in financing for the unsophisticated motor vehicle consumer.salenga mitsubishi motors credit of america,th,salenga,disapproved on other grounds in aryeh canon business solutions,cal th.
two code sections of this statutory scheme are of particular relevance in understanding ramirez claim section and section.
section governs a party right to reinstate a loan upon the buyer default after a repossession or voluntary surrender.under section,i f after default by the buyer,the seller or holder repossesses or voluntarily accepts surrender of the motor vehicle,any person liable on the contract shall have a right to reinstate the contract and the seller or holder shall not accelerate the maturity of any part or all of the contract prior to expiration of the right to reinstate,unless the seller or holder reasonably and in good faith determines that any of the following has occurred the statute then sets forth six specific exceptions to the reinstatement right,including the one contained in section b the buyer or any other person liable on the contract by omission or commission intentionally provided false or misleading information of material importance on his or her credit application.
under this code section,if the does not reasonably and in good faith determine one of the exceptions applies,the buyer has a right to reinstate and if the buyer wishes to do so,the buyer must reimburse the seller for all costs,including the defaulted payments,applicable delinquency charges,and all reasonable and necessary collection and repossession costs and fees incurred,including attorney fees and legal expenses expended in retaking and holding the vehicle.d.although these costs to reinstate may be substantial,the option of reinstating a contract is often preferable to redemption,because reinstatement allows the buyer to recover the car without having to pay the full balance due on the contract juarez,supra,th at.
section governs a creditor notice obligations after a repossession.see juarez,supra,th at.the code section requires a creditor to provide the buyer with a notice of intention noi to dispose of the repossessed vehicle.a.under the statutory provisions,the noi must conform to specific mailing requirements,must be given within days following repossession,and must provide extensive information on numerous subjects set forth in nine separate paragraphs.a.under section a,this notice must include information about the reinstatement right,including the timing of this right and all the conditions precedent thereto or that there is no right of reinstatement and provides a statement of reasons therefor.
in juarez,we interpreted the statutory requirement contained in section a that the noi must identify all conditions precedent to reinstatement of the contract.juarez,supra,th at.we held the noi must provide a level of specificity as to the conditions precedent to reinstatement sufficient to inform the buyer without need for further inquiry as to exactly what the buyer must do to cure the default.thus,the statute requires that a creditor inform the consumer of any amounts the buyer must pay to the creditor to third parties and provide the buyer with the names and addresses of those who are to be paid.the creditor must also inform the consumer regarding any additional monthly payments that will come due before the end of the notice period,as well as of any late fees,or other fees,the amount s of these additional payments or fees,and when the additional sums will become due.id.at.in so holding,we acknowledged there may be instances in which the creditor does not possess information about the amount a buyer must pay to a third party to satisfy a condition precedent to reinstatement.id.at.but we said the creditor must provide the buyer with all of the relevant information it possesses information it has the ability to discern,concerning precisely what the buyer must do to reinstate his or her contract.id.at.
in juarez,as here,a car buyer whose vehicle was repossessed brought a class action alleging the creditor violated the ucl by failing to comply with the rees levering act requirements.juarez,supra,th at.after the court certified the class,the court granted summary judgment in the creditor favor based on the court conclusion that the noi satisfied statutory requirements and thus the creditor did not engage in an unlawful,unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of the ucl.id.at.this court reversed,holding the noi did not provide a level of specificity as to the conditions precedent to reinstatement sufficient to inform the buyer without need for further inquiry as to exactly what the buyer must do to cure the default.id.at.we thus remanded for the trial court to consider the class claims under all three prongs of the ucl.id.at fn.
we have since reaffirmed that a buyer may potentially recover under the ucl for claimed violations of the rees levering act noi notice requirement.see salenga,supra,th at.the california supreme court has additionally upheld the certification of class claims based on a violation of the rees levering act noi requirements.see fireside bank superior court,supra,cal th at class claim under the act and the ucl on behalf of all persons who had received postrepossession notices in which the listed redemption amount improperly failed to subtract the credit for unearned finance charges.
iv.analysis 
in denying ramirez class certification motion,the court stated i ndividual issues of fact predominate over common questions of fact.specifically,it is unclear whether there were grounds to deny reinstatement as to each individual class member pursuant to civil code section b.
ramirez challenges the court reliance on section b to deny her class certification motion.we agree this ground was not a proper basis for denying class certification.the court conclusion was based on an improper legal assumption,that balboa would be entitled to assert this statutory exception as a valid affirmative defense to the ucl claim alleged by class members who were given a reinstatement right in the noi 
under section,a defaulting buyer whose car has been repossessed by or voluntarily surrendered to a creditor must be given the opportunity to reinstate the contract,absent proof of certain statutory circumstances,including t
