factual and procedural background 
in may,first commercial made a purchase money loan to juan lima and roberto bracamontes,secured by a deed of trust on real property,namely,a duplex located on north alma avenue in los angeles.first commercial alleges it was induced to make the loan,in part,by an appraisal report prepared by reece wherein he grossly inflated the property value to,when in fact the property was worth less than.andrade was the loan broker.

first commercial verified complaint pled causes of action against both reece and andrade for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,as well as a cause of action against andrade for breach of contract.
defendants answered and thereafter moved for summary judgment.defendants did not offer any evidence to dispute the allegation in first commercial complaint that first commercial was contractually obligated to indemnify nationwide.defendants simply contended first commercial claims were barred as a matter of law by nationwide full credit bid.defendants adopted as an undisputed fact the allegation in first commercial complaint that first commercial made a loan based in part upon the presentation of a false and misleading appraisal report.the defense theory on summary judgment rested on the undisputed fact that o n april,the property was acquired with a credit same amount as the unpaid debt.
in opposition,first commercial argued its claims were not barred by the full credit bid at the trustee sale.first commercial emphasized the full credit bid was made by nationwide first commercial was compelled to repurchase the property from nationwide pursuant to their written agreement.therefore,the notion that first commercial should bear the consequences of the actions of its successor in interest at a foreclosure sale,which first commercial did not control,is contrary to the stated policy of the full credit bid rule,that policy being to make the bidder bear the consequences of its bid.
on july,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court granted summary judgment,ruling the april full credit bid at foreclosure satisfied the loan debt herein as a matter of law and that,therefore,plaintiff can prove no recoverable damage.
first commercial filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.

discussion 
standard of review.
as stated in pmc,saban entertainment,th,d,summary judgment motions are to expedite litigation and eliminate needless trials.citation.they are granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.citations.
a defendant meets its burden upon such a motion by negating an essential element of the plaintiff case,or by establishing a complete defense,or by demonstrating the absence of evidence to support the plaintiff case.once the moving defendant has met its initial burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists.pmc,supra,th at,d leslie perry associates th,d.

the full credit bid rule.
at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale,if the lender chooses to bid,it does so in the capacity of a purchaser.citation.the only distinction between the lender and any other bidder is that the lender is not required to pay cash,but is entitled to make a credit bid up to the amount of the outstanding indebtedness.citations.the purpose of this entitlement is to avoid the inefficiency of requiring the lender to tender cash which would only be immediately returned to it.citation.a full credit bid is a bid in an amount equal to the unpaid principal and interest of the mortgage debt,together with the costs,fees and other expenses of the foreclosure.citation.if the full credit bid is successful,results in the acquisition of the property,the lender pays the full outstanding balance of the debt and costs of foreclosure to itself and takes title to the security property,releasing the borrower from further obligations under the defaulted note.citation.alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,d.
under the full credit bid rule,when a lender makes such a bid,it is precluded for purposes of collecting its debt from later claiming that the property was actually worth less than the bid.citations.thus,the lender is not entitled to insurance proceeds payable for prepurchase damage to the property,prepurchase net rent proceeds,or damages for waste,because the lender only interest in the property,the repayment of its debt,has been satisfied,and any further payment would result in a double recovery.citation.alliance mortgage,supra,cal th at,d.
in cornelison kornbluth cal d,the supreme court addressed the effect of a full credit bid in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale.in cornelison,the plaintiff sold a dwelling,taking back a promissory note secured by a first deed of trust on the property.id.at.the property was subsequently resold and ultimately condemned as unfit for human habitation.the original purchasers defaulted on the note,and plaintiff caused the property to be sold at a trustee sale.ibid.she purchased the property at the sale by making a full credit bid.id.at.
plaintiff then sued one of the subsequent purchasers,inter alia,for waste.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.cornelison first concluded that a lender claim for bad faith waste was not precluded by the antideficiency statutes.id.at.however,cornelison further concluded that even assuming that defendant is liable on such basis,nevertheless plaintiff can not recover since she purchased the subject property at the trustee sale by making a full credit bid.id.at,fn.omitted.cornelison explained,the measure of damages for waste is the amount of the impairment of the security,that is the amount by which the value of the security is less than the outstanding indebtedness and is thereby rendered inadequate.citation.ibid.t he mortgagee purchase of the property securing the debt by entering a full credit bid establishes the value of the security as being equal to the outstanding indebtedness and ipso facto the nonexistence of any impairment of the security.ibid accord alliance mortgage,supra,cal th at,d.
the alliance exception full credit bid rule is inapplicable where the lender was fraudulently induced to make a full credit bid.
treating the full credit bid rule as a bright line rule ultimately led to an undesirable result.lenders that relied on supposedly valid appraisals in initiating loans and purchasing properties at foreclosure were left without in cases involving massive the defrauding parties escaped free and clear,at least as far as civil damages were concerned.gn mortgage fidelity nat.title ins.th d and western fed.savings loan sawyer th d were two similar cases involving claims of conspiracies to induce the lenders to make loans by allegedly engaging in fraud in connection with loan applications and appraisal reports.in both cases,the had obtained the liened property by full credit bid at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale,and in each case,later sold the property at a loss.the appellate courts concluded that,based on the reasoning in cornelison,the defendants could not be liable for damages.gn mortgage fidelity nat.title ins,supra,th at d western fed.savings loan sawyer,supra,th at d.michelson camp th,d.
in alliance,the supreme court disapproved the holdings in gn mortgage and western fed.savings loan,and carved out a limited exception to the full credit bid rule.michelson,supra,th at,d.alliance undertook review solely on the issue of whether a lender acquisition of security property by full credit bid at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale bars the lender from maintaining a fraud action to recover damages from nonborrower third parties who fraudulently induced the lender to make the loans.alliance,supra,cal th at,d.specifically,the court considered whether as a result of its full credit bids,the lender could demonstrate neither justifiable reliance nor actual damages,at,d,both essential elements of fraud.id.at,d.
alliance began by discussing reliance as with any purchaser at a foreclosure sale,by making a successful full credit bid or bid in any amount,the lender is making a generally irrevocable offer to purchase the property for that amount.citation.the lender,perhaps more than a third party purchaser with fewer resources with which to gain insight into the property value,generally bears the burden and risk of making an informed bid.it does not follow,however,that being intentionally and materially misled by its own fiduciaries or agents as to the value of the property prior to even making the loan is within the realm of that risk.citation.most lenders,such as plaintiff in this case,are corporate entities,and rely on their agents to provide them material information.here,the lender did obtain appraisals,and attempted to make informed loan decisions.it alleges,however,that its appraiser in conspiracy with defendants,fraudulently misrepresented the nature of the properties and the existence and qualifications of the buyers,and that it did not discover the fraud until after it acquired title to the properties.the full credit bid rule was not intended to immunize wrongdoers from the consequences of their fraudulent acts.alliance,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
alliance recognized that the lender difficulty resulted from its overvalued bid at the foreclosure sale.had it become aware of the true value of the property and bid only what it was worth,there would have been no barrier to a later suit against the defrauding parties.michelson,supra,th at,d.the alliance court,therefore,held that in order to establish reliance,the lender needed to demonstrate that its full credit bids were a proximate result of defendants fraud,and that in the absence of such fraud it would not,in all reasonable probability,have made the bids.citations.alliance,supra,cal th at,d.t o the extent the lender full credit bids were proximately caused by defendants fraudulent misrepresentations,and this reliance without independent or additional inquiry was either appropriate given the context of the relationship or was not otherwise manifestly unreasonable,the lender bids can not be deemed an admission of the properties value.see bank of america.reidy cal d,not unusual for a mortgagee to make a bid for the property in the amount owing on the debt when it can not recover a deficiency.hence,the full credit bid rule would not apply.alliance,supra,at,d.
in other words,in order to avoid the full credit bid rule,the lender must have been induced to enter into the loan by the false representation,and still be under the mistaken belief that the representation was true at the time it makes the full credit bid.michelson,supra,th at,d.in michelson,appellants alleged the they were induced to enter into the loan agreement by respondent intentional or negligent not the latter.their complaint does not contain an allegation that they were induced to make their bid on the property in in reliance on respondent representations as to the value of the property in and.ibid.
alliance further recognition that full credit bid rule is inapplicable where lender justifiably relied on defendant misrepresentations in selling a loan and thereafter suffered damages from a compelled repurchase of the loan.
in alliance,p rior to learning of the fraud,the lender sold several loan obligations to secondary investors.in the case of three of these properties,regulations of the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc required the lender to repurchase the loans it had earlier sold to the federal national mortgage association f n m a alliance,supra,cal th at,d.thus,with respect to these three properties,the lender alleged it was compelled by fhlmc regulations to repurchase loans it had earlier sold to secondary investors before it learned of the fraud.id.at,d.
the supreme court held to the extent the lender justifiably relied on defendants misrepresentations in selling the loans,its damages resulting from any compelled repurchase were incurred as a direct consequence of the fraud.see guild mortgage heller d.id.at.allegations that federal regulations compelled repurchase of properties resulting in plaintiff damage,repurchase necessitated by fraud,and loan would not have been made in the absence of purported misrepresentations sufficient to establish a clear causal connection between defendants alleged fraudulent conduct and the damages sustained.accordingly,for these claims in particular,we perceive no basis on which such a repurchase,or any full credit bid by the fnma,would even arguably preclude the lender from pursuing a fraud claim against defendants.alliance,supra,cal th at,d.
in guild mortgage heller,supra,d,which the supreme court cited with approval in alliance alliance,supra,cal th at,d,a mortgage company allegedly was fraudulently induced by the buyers to extend them a home loan.guild mortgage,supra,at.the mortgage company sold the note to the fhlmc,which foreclosed,purchased the property at a nonjudicial sale,and which then required the mortgage company to repurchase the property.id.at.the mortgage company lost over in reselling the property on the open market.id.at.guild mortgage held the mortgage company had stated a cause of action for fraud in the inducement of the loan.id.at.
with respect to the consequence of a full credit bid by the secondary purchaser,guild mortgage stated although the respective briefs devote considerable time to the legal and practical effect of a full credit bid on plaintiff cause of action,fn.omitted we need not resolve that issue on this appeal.regardless of whether the fhlmc purchased the property by making a full credit bid,the complaint avers that plaintiff guild mortgage and not the fhlmc was damaged in an amount exceeding when it was required to repurchase and sell the property on the open market.the complaint further alleges that the repurchase was necessitated by defendants fraud and that the loan would not have been made in the absence of the purported misrepresen
