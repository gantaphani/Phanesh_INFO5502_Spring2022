in this case we are called on to determine whether federal law preempts the effort by a district attorney to recover civil penalties under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et based on an employer alleged violation of workplace safety standards.petitioners solus industrial innovations,emerson power transmission,and emerson electric collectively solus contend the trial court erred by overruling their demurrer to two causes of action filed against them by respondent,the orange county district attorney,alleging a right to recover such penalties.solus argues that federal workplace safety law preempts any state law workplace safety enforcement mechanism which has not been specifically incorporated into the state workplace safety plan approved by the secretary of labor the secretary.
the district attorney contends that once a state workplace safety plan has been approved by the secretary,as california was,the state retains significant discretion to determine how it will enforce the safety standards incorporated therein,and thus the state may empower prosecutors to enforce those standards through whatever legal mechanism is available when such a case is referred to them.
the trial court agreed with the district attorney and consequently overruled solus demurrer to the two causes of action based on the ucl.but the court also certified this issue as presenting a controlling issue of law suitable for early appellate review under code of civil procedure section.solus then filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,asking us to review the trial court ruling.after we summarily denied the petition,the supreme court granted review and transferred the case back to us with directions to issue an order to show cause.
we issued the order to show cause and then an initial opinion concluding the trial court ruling was incorrect on the merits.we reasoned that under controlling law,any part of a state plan not expressly approved is preempted,and that california workplace safety plan,as approved by the secretary,does not include any provision for civil enforcement of workplace safety standards by a prosecutor through a cause of action for penalties under the ucl.in the course of our opinion,we noted that the ucl,in its current form,was not even in effect when california plan was approved.
the california supreme court then granted review,and transferred the matter back to this court with directions to reconsider the matter in light of former civil code section former section repealed by stats,ch,which was in effect when california plan was approved providing for the imposition of similar penalties based on acts of unfair competition.having done so,we again conclude that the district attorney reliance on the ucl to address workplace safety violations is preempted.
as is typical when we review the propriety of the trial court ruling on a demurrer,we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.west jpmorgan chase bank,th.
solus makes plastics at an orange county manufacturing facility.in,solus installed an electric water heater intended for residential use at the facility.in march,that water heater exploded,killing two workers instantly in what district attorney refers to as an untimely and horrific death.
after the incident,california division of occupational safety and health opened an investigation and determined the explosion had been caused by a failed safety valve and the lack of any other suitable safety feature on the heater due to manipulation and misuse.based on investigation,it charged solus with five s erious violations of title of the california code of regulations in an administrative proceeding,including violations of section a for failure to provide a proper safety valve on the heater section a for permitting the unsafe operation of the water heater section b for improperly maintaining the water heater section f for failing to use good engineering practices when selecting and using the unfit residential water heater in the extrusion operations and section h for permitting unqualified and untrained personnel to operate and maintain the water heater.also cited solus with one w illful violation of the same regulation,based on its willful failure to maintain the residential water heater in a safe operating condition.
because the incident involved the death of two employees,and there was evidence that a violation of law had occurred,bureau of investigation forwarded the results of its internal investigation to the district attorney as required by labor code section,subdivision g.in march,the district attorney filed criminal charges against two individuals,including solus plant manager and its maintenance supervisor,for felony counts of violating labor code section,subdivision a.see people faulkinbury super.orange county.no party challenges the district attorney standing to bring these or other appropriate criminal prosecutions.
the district attorney also filed the instant civil action against solus.the complaint contains four causes of action,all based on the same worker health and safety standards placed at issue in the administrative proceedings.
the first two causes of action are not at issue in this writ proceeding.the third cause of action alleges that solus failure to comply with workplace safety standards amounts to an unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business practice under business and professions code section,and the district attorney requests imposition of civil penalties as a consequence of that practice,in the amount of up to per day,per employee,for the period from november,through march.
the fourth cause of action alleges solus made numerous false and misleading representations concerning its commitment to workplace safety and its compliance with all applicable workplace safety standards,and as a result of those false and misleading statements,solus was allegedly able to retain employees and customers in violation of business and professions code section.again,the district attorney requests imposition of civil penalties as a consequence of this alleged misconduct,in the amount of up to per day,per employee,for the period from november,through march.
solus demurred to these two causes of action,contending they were preempted under,because a prosecutor pursuit of civil penalties under the ucl is not part of california workplace safety plan approved by the secretary.the trial court disagreed,and overruled the demurrer to the district attorney two causes of action based on violations of the ucl.
the trial court subsequently granted a request to certify the preemption issue as appropriate for early appellate review under code of civil procedure section,finding the federal preemption issue raised in solus demurrer as to the third and fourth causes of action in the complaint presents a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion and that appellate resolution of this issue may materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.
solus filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,which we summarily denied.after our denial,the supreme court granted review and transferred the case back to us with directions to issue an order to show cause.on may,we issued the order to show cause.

standard of review 
we apply a de novo standard of review because this case was resolved on demurrer citation and because federal preemption presents a pure question of law citation.farm raised salmon cases cal th,fn.however,i t is well established that the party who asserts that a state law is preempted bears the burden of so demonstrating.id.at.and further,t he interpretation of the federal law at issue here is further informed by a strong presumption against preemption.ibid.
the preemption 
the basic rules of preemption are not in dispute under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution art.vi,cl,congress has the power to preempt state law concerning matters that lie within the authority of congress.citation.in determining whether federal law preempts state law,a court task is to discern congressional intent.citation.congress express intent in this regard will be found when congress explicitly states that it is preempting state authority.citation.congress implied intent to preempt is found i when it is clear that congress intended,by comprehensive legislation,to occupy the entire field of regulation,leaving no room for the states to supplement federal law citation ii when compliance with both federal and state regulations is an impossibility citation or iii when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citations.farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th at.
on the matter of workplace safety regulation,the federal government intent to preempt is clear the federal occupational safety and health act of et seq osh act,and the standards promulgated thereunder by were designed to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions.citation.to that end,congress authorized the secretary of labor to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to all businesses affecting interstate commerce,b,and thereby brought the federal government into a field that traditionally had been occupied by the states.gade national solid wastes management association,d gade.
however,congress expressly saved two areas from federal t he act does not supersede or in any manner affect any workmen compensation law and the act does not prevent any state agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under state law over any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which no federal standard is in effect.gade,supra,at.
moreover,congress also gave states the option of federal preemption entirely,by allowing any state which desires to assume responsibility for development and enforcement therein of occupational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue to submit a state plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement.b,italics added gade,supra,at.the section removes federal preemption so that the state may exercise its own sovereign powers over occupational safety and health.united air lines,occupational safety health appeals bd.cal d.
but t wo prerequisites to such state regulation are that the state law be at least as effective as the federal standard covering the same subject matter and that the state law be incorporated in a state plan submitted to and approved by the federal secretary of labor the secretary.citation.california lab.federation occupational safety health stds.bd.d,california labor federation.however,if the proposed state plan incorporates standards which are distinct from the federal ones,t he secretary is not required to approve such a plan unless in her judgment the state standards,when applicable to products which are distributed or used in interstate commerce,are required by compelling local conditions and do not unduly burden interstate commerce.id.at.the state plan must designate a s tate agency or agencies as the agency or agencies responsible for administering the plan throughout the s tate c and contain satisfactory assurances that such agency or agencies have or will have the legal authority and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of such standards.c.

the workplace safety plan 
as explained in california labor federation,in,the legislature enacted the california occupational safety and health act.citation.section of states in pertinent part the purpose of this act is to allow the state of california to assume responsibility for development and enforcement of occupational safety and health standards under a state plan pursuant to section united states code section of the federal occupational safety and health act of public law which was enacted december.stats,ch.california lab.federation occupational safety and health stds,supra,d at.
the federal regulation approving california workplace safety plan is detailed,and describes the plan as incorporating an enforcement component that includes prompt notice to employers and employees of alleged violations of standards and abatement requirements,effective remedies against employers,and the right to review alleged violations,abatement periods,and proposed penalties with opportunity for employee participation in the review proceedings c,italics added.the approval regulation also specifies t he state program will be enforced by the division of industrial safety of the department of industrial relations and a dministrative adjudications will be the responsibility of the california occupational safety and health appeals board.a,italics added.the regulation does allow other agencies to be involved in the enforcement effort,but requires that i agreements to provide technical support to the program will be fully functioning within year of plan approval d.it then confirms,pursuant to that requirement,that formal interagency agreements were negotiated and signed between the department of industrial relations and the state department of health june,and between the state department of industrial relations and the state fire marshal august.b.
that plan description is entirely consistent with labor code section,subdivision a,which expressly requires that t he authority of any agency,department,division,bureau or any other political subdivision other than the division of occupational safety and health to assist in the administration or enforcement of any occupational safety or health standard,order,or rule adopted pursuant to this chapter shall be contained in a written agreement with the department of industrial relations or an agency authorized by the department to enter into such agreement,italics added.

preemption of the ucl causes of action in this case 
our assessment of whether the district attorney ucl causes of action are preempted by federal law begins with the observation that the ucl was enacted in stats,ch,which is after the secretary initially approved california workplace safety plan.hence,there is no basis to infer that reliance on the ucl,in its current form,could have been contemplated by the secretary as part of the initial decision approving california plan.and while the district attorney points out that former section,which was in effect from to added by stats,ch,repealed by stats,ch.also provided for imposition of a similar civil penalty based on acts of unfair competition,he makes no claim that the availability of such a penalty,or its potential use in connection with violations of workplace safety laws,was ever brought to the attention of the secretary in connection with california plan.
indeed,after the supreme court transfer of this case back to us,with directions to reconsider our decision in light of former section,we requested that the parties provide us with supplemental briefs addressing that specific issue,as well as whether former section was ever actually applied to penalize unfair competition arising out of violations of workplace safety laws either before or after california workplace safety plan was approved in.
in his brief,the district attorney first concedes t here are insufficient historical records to demonstrate that former section was ever relied upon by prosecutors to penalize unfair competition arising out of violations of the workplace safety laws prior to,when the secretary approved california workplace safety plan.
and while the district attorney does claim that prosecutors relied on former section to penalize unfair competition arising out of violations of the workplace safety laws after the secretary approval of california plan,he supports that assertion solely by referencing a record of nonspecific civil actions taken by prosecutors following referrals from the division of occupational safety and health bureau of investigations which even he acknowledges dates back only to,years after former section was superseded by the current ucl in.thus,that evidence,even if it were otherwise appropriate for us to consider,would not support the district attorney contention.
finally,in response to our query about whether former section was ever brought to the attention of the secretary in connection with california proposed workplace safety plan,the district attorney argues that the secretary is presumed to have known about it.that assertion,however,suffers from several analytical flaws.first,the presumption the district attorney relies upon is that t he legislature is presumed to know existing law.arthur andersen superior court th.but that rule refers to our own state legislature presumed knowledge of existing california law when it enacts a new statute.it does not establish that members of the federal government executive branch are also presumed to know the entirety of california law let alone how california laws of general application might be employed to address workplace safety issues.
second,the district attorney suggests the secretary would have been aware of the relevance of former section to our state workplace safety plan through our supreme court decision in barquis merchants collection cal barquis.but that case does not address the potential use of unfair competition law in connection with regulating workplace safety.instead,the court was concerned with the wholly unrelated issue of whether a collection agency alleged practice of knowingly and willfully filing actions in improper counties would qualify as an unlawful business practice.in the course of deciding that issue,the court merely notes that california unfair competition law was amended in,to add the word unlawful to the types of wrongful business conduct that could be enjoined.id.at.the court then adds that a lthough the legislative history of the amendment is not particularly instructive,nevertheless,as one commentator has noted it is difficult to see any other purpose than to extend the meaning of unfair competition to anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.note,unlawful agricultural working conditions as nuisance or unfair competition hastings.id.at,fn.omitted.it is that commentator a second year law student not the supreme court who suggests in the cited law review article that california unfair competition law might also be employed to address unlawful working conditions.the supreme court itself expresses no opinion on that issue.consequently barquis can not be viewed as a basis for imputing presumptive knowledge to the secretary,back in,that former section could be relied upon as a basis for imposing additional penalties on employers that violate workplace safety laws.
and third,even if we agreed the secretary could fairly be taxed with presumptive knowledge that former section might be relied upon by prosecutors to impose additional penalties on employers that violate california workplace safety laws,we would still conclude that such knowledge is insufficient to support an inference that the secretary had approved the imposition of those penalties as part of california plan.as we have explained,a state seeking to exempt itself from the federal preemption over workplace safety regulation must specifically inform the secretary of its proposed plan,detailing both the standards to be employed and their enforcement.b,italics added gade,supra,at.that requirement can not be fulfilled by simply asserting the secretary is presumed to be familiar with the entirely of the california law and to understand how that law might be employed in connection with regulating workplace safety.if it were,the secretary presumed knowledge would effectively relieve california of any obligation to affirmatively disclose its plan.
rather than claiming that reliance on ucl penalties as an additional remedy for wrongs associated with workplace safety violations was ever specifically included in california approved plan,the district attorney simply relies on the strong presumption against preemption and argues solus failed to establish congress had any specific intention of bar ring the people prosecution of these ucl causes of action.the district attorney asserts that the underlying violations of the workplace safety laws are properly within the jurisdiction of the state of california to remedy and a s such,these violations are the proper subject matter for him to prosecute as authorized by california law under the ucl.we find these contentions unpersuasive.
as we have already explained,congress intention to preempt essentially the entire field of workplace safety regulation other than workers compensation was made clear when it passed the osh act.gade,supra,at.while the osh act does not preempt states from asserting jurisdiction under s tate law over any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which no federal standard is in effect id.at,italics added,the district attorney has made no claim that this case involves any such discrete issue.consequently,we conclude federal preemption has been established.
the district attorney relies on farm raised salmon cases,supra,cal th,to support its assertion that preemption is not established here.but that case is distinguishable.as our supreme court explained,the federal law at issue in farm raised salmon cases preempted only those state laws that establish any requirement for the labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement of federal law.id.at.thus,the court concluded that to the extent california laws established requirements which were identical to those established by federal law,its enforcement of those laws was not preempted.id.at plaintiffs claims for deceptive marketing of food products are predicated on state laws establishing independent state disclosure requirements identical to the disclosure requirements imposed by the fdca,something congress explicitly approved.the same can not be said here.
by contrast to the federal law at issue farm raised salmon cases,the osh act does not allow states to independently establish workplace safety laws,even if those laws mirror federal law requirements.instead,the states authority to establish and enforce any
