appellants chemsol,llc and mc international,llc miami chemical mci appeal the decision of the united states court of international trade cit dismissing their case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.chemsol,llc united states,d.int l trade.because the cit properly held it did not have jurisdiction over this case,this court affirms.
background 
in,chemsol made six entries of citric acid,purportedly from the dominican republic,and in and,mci made thirteen entries of citric acid,purportedly from india collectively,the entries.appellants claimed status for the entries and therefore did not deposit any duties on entry.in,united states immigration and customs enforcement ice and united states customs and border protection customs collectively,the government initiated an investigation to determine whether chinese citric acid was being transshipped through other countries to evade antidumping and countervailing duties applicable to imports of citric acid from china.customs suspected that appellants entries were actually produced in china,but were transshipped through the dominican republic and india to avoid duties.
to complete the transshipment investigation,customs extended the deadline for liquidation of the entries pursuant to b.for chemsol,as of the time it filed this suit,customs had extended liquidation for all of its entries at least twice.as to mci,as of the date of filing,customs had extended liquidation once for all of its entries,a second time for most of its entries,and a third time for one entry.it is undisputed that both chemsol and mci received notice of these extensions.
in response to the extensions,appellants filed suit in the cit on december,seeking relief declaring the extensions unlawful such that the entries have therefore been deemed liquidated by operation of law.chemsol,d at see.though the entries were not yet deemed liquidated because the liquidation period was extended with notice,appellants asserted the cit had jurisdiction under i,the cit residual jurisdiction provision.the government moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction claiming appellants could not rely on i because they were first required to challenge the extensions before customs by means of a protest,after which they could seek judicial review of any protest denial pursuant to,the tariff act review of protests provision.jurisdiction over such a denial,the government argued,would then be proper under a.
the cit agreed,observing that i n the time that has elapsed since the commencement of this action,ice has completed its investigation and,but for appellants suit,customs could complete its administrative process and liquidate appellants remaining entries.chemsol,d at.the cit held the statutory review process for challenging liquidation of appellants entries under and a,provides an adequate remedy for appellants claims,and accordingly granted the government motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at footnote omitted.
appellants filed these timely appeals.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.

ii.legal framework 
jurisdiction 
the cit limited jurisdiction is enumerated in a through i.subsection a vests the cit with exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced to contest the denial of a protest by customs.subsections b through g delineate other specific grants of jurisdiction.subsection i,the residual jurisdiction provision,provides 
in addition to the jurisdiction conferred upon the cit by subsections a h of this section,the cit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the united states,its agencies,or its officers,that arises out of any law of the united states providing for 
revenue from imports or tonnage 
tariffs,duties,fees,or other taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the raising of revenue 
embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety or 
administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to in paragraphs of this subsection and subsections a h of this section.
while the residual jurisdiction provision is a catch all provision,a n overly broad interpretation of this provision would threaten to swallow the specific grants of jurisdiction contained within the other subsections and their corresponding requirements.norman jensen,united states.therefore,this court has repeatedly held that subsection i may not be invoked when jurisdiction under another subsection of is or could have been available,unless the remedy provided under that other subsection would be manifestly inadequate.ford,at quoting miller united states.thus,if a litigant has access to the cit under subsections a through h,it must avail itself of this avenue of approach by complying with all the relevant prerequisites thereto unless the remedy available under another subsection is manifestly inadequate.hartford fire ins.united states,quoting am.air parcel forwarding united states.a litigant asking the court to exercise jurisdiction over his or her claim has the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists.see rocovich united states,citing kvos,associated press.
liquidation 
when importing merchandise into the united states,the importer of record shall deposit with customs at the time of entry the amount of duties and fees estimated to be payable on such merchandise,including applicable antidumping or countervailing duties.a.customs generally must liquidate the entries within year from the date of entry.see id.a.liquidation means the final computation or ascertainment of the duties accruing on an entry,after which the final amount due if any is calculated and billed,completing the import transaction.ford,at the process for bringing customs transactions to final resolution is called liquidation.if customs does not liquidate the entry within one year,the entry is deemed liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity,and amount of duties asserted by the importer of record on its entry documentation.a.in other words,deemed liquidation is liquidation by operation of law.
before the elapse of the liquidation period,however,under b,customs may extend the period in which to liquidate an entry if the information needed for the proper appraisement or classification of the imported or withdrawn merchandise,or for ensuring compliance with applicable law,is not available to customs.however,customs may only extend the liquidation period three times,resulting in a total of four years from the date of entry within which customs must liquidate the entries or they will be deemed liquidated.id.b e,f.
whether by customs action or by operation of law,liquidation is final unless an importer files a timely protest with customs challenging its decision within days after but not before the date of liquidation.c a emphasis added.absent such a protest,the customs decision is final and is no longer subject to administrative or judicial review.hartford fire,at citation omitted.this court has confirmed that liquidation is the final challengeable event and f indings related to liquidation,such as the need for extensions,merge with the liquidation.see volkswagen of,united states,see also united states utex int l,all findings involved in a customs decision merge in the liquidation.it is the liquidation which is final and subject to protest,not the preliminary findings or decisions of customs officers.citations omitted.this is also evident from the statute,which specifies that decisions of customs,including the legality of all orders and findings as to,inter alia,the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry,are final unless a timely protest is filed.a see also id.c a a protest of a decision,order,or finding described in subsection a of this section shall be filed with customs within days after but not before the date of liquidation or reliquidation.emphasis added.
iii.the cit properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction 
relief is available to appellants under a 
the cit held it lacked jurisdiction under i because appellants challenge to customs extensions of the time for liquidation may be brought,after liquidation,by filing a protest and obtaining jurisdiction in this court under section a.chemsol,d at.the cit noted that customs actions in this case were well within the period allowed for extensions customs continues to actively investigate the appropriate liquidation for the entries.id.furthermore,the cit stated,u pon conclusion of that process and liquidation of the entries,the importers will have ample opportunity to raise any issues through the protest and judicial review process that culminates in a.id.
appellants argue the cit erred in failing to find i confers subject matter jurisdiction over this action.in support,appellants first argue the cit failed to follow this court opinion in ford,at,which appellants claim involves a materially identical fact pattern and legal issues.appellants br.capitalization removed.
in ford,this court found jurisdiction under i available for a deemed liquidation claim in which customs inaction was at issue.in doing so,this court noted that i t is undisputed that at the time of filing of ford complaint,customs had not affirmatively liquidated any of the nine entries.it is also undisputed that the general time period imposed by congress for liquidating such entries had long since expired.ford,at.this court then held the case involved a valid invocation of the court residual jurisdiction,as the importer could not have asserted jurisdiction under any of the other enumerated provisions of,and efforts by customs to clear the importer accounts did not undo such jurisdiction.id.at.this court concluded that w here,as here,there has been an allegation that customs unlawfully failed to make any protestable decision,we can not see how an administrative appeal could have been initiated prefiling.id.at emphasis added.
appellants insist the cit erred when it found ford distinguishable because,here,customs extended the liquidation period with proper notice,whereas in ford customs failed to act altogether.appellants contend this is a misreading of the facts in ford because only the first claim of ford complaint alleged that none of its entries was extended,while the second,third,and fourth claims of the complaint alleged,in the alternative,that if customs did issue extensions,such extensions lacked notice,reasoning,or validity.appellants br.on this basis,appellants argue t he fact pattern and legal issues now before the court are all but identical to ford in every material way because i n both cases,the importer asserted that customs purported to extend liquidation for certain entries,and notice thereof was issued,but either no reason or an invalid reason was given for the extensions,thereby rendering them void.id.at emphases added.
appellants reliance on ford is misplaced.in contrast to ford,here deemed liquidation had not yet occurred when appellants filed their complaints,and customs had extended the liquidation period pursuant to its statutory authority in b to determine the country of origin of the entries and the proper duty rate.there is no dispute that customs properly notified appellants of the extensions to the liquidation period.thus,this case presents exactly the scenario in which protest provisions can be invoked because customs engage d in some sort of process,ford,at quoting xerox united states,and,any objections to the validity of the extensions would be merged into the later liquidation.this court has also clarified that all aspects of entry are merged in the liquidation and that absent timely reliquidation or protest the liquidation is final.volkswagen,at quoting utex,at.thus,i f an importer wishes to challenge an aspect of entry,the importer must protest the liquidation.id.as the government points out,t his approach makes sense it recognizes that the decision to extend the period for liquidation may be necessary to determine the ultimate country of origin,classification,or rate assessed and,therefore,should be subsumed in the liquidation for purposes of administrative and judicial review.appellees br.thus,while ford rightfully sought a declaration that its entries were deemed liquidated,because the liquidation period had elapsed without notice of any action by customs,here such a declaration is not appropriate because customs issued timely extensions,thereby preventing deemed liquidation.
in addition,unlike in this case,whether extensions had occurred was an issue very much in dispute in ford.indeed,in determining whether ford had conceded this issue in a statement,this court stated w e read ford statement as only acknowledging that customs had taken some administrative action with the purpose of extending liquidation,and not necessarily as conceding that extension had been effectuated.ford,at.thus,appellants statement that i n both cases,the importer asserted that customs purported to extend liquidation for certain entries,and notice thereof was issued,appellants br.emphasis added,is a mischaracterization of the facts in ford.appellants reliance on the other claims of ford complaint also does not help their argument.this court recognized that ford argued,in the alternative,that if any extension had been effectuated,ford received no notice of such an extension or suspension,and urged that notice was required for any putative extension to be effective.ford,at.here,there is no dispute that appellants received proper notice.appellants insistence that notice was issued in both cases,and that this case is materially identical to ford,is erroneous.
appellants suggestion that these cases are identical also ignores another substantial difference in this case,customs extended the liquidation period for the express purpose of undertaking a fraud investigation because it suspected that appellants entries were fraudulently made.in contrast,in ford it was unclear whether customs had extended the liquidation period and,if so,why extensions were necessary.there is no suggestion that ford stands for the broad proposition that any challenge to an extension of liquidation is immediately reviewable under i.appellants argument would vitiate the extension provision available to customs under b and prevent it from gathering additional information prior to final liquidation.as the cit accurately observed 
customs reason for extending the liquidation period for appellants imports is to allow ice time to conclude its investigation of possible transshipment of goods.to allow appellants to interrupt the administrative process currently underway by providing declarative relief would severely undermine customs and ice ability to conduct meaningful investigations into possible fraudulent activity.
chemsol,d at.
appellants also argue jurisdiction over their claims is proper under i because no other basis of jurisdiction is available and adequate.they say that jurisdiction under subsection a is not available because customs has not made and might never make a protestable decision.appellants br.capitalization removed.that is,appellants contend,because customs may never affirmatively liquidate the entries before they are deemed liquidated in appellants favor,it is uncertain whether appellants will ever need to protest a customs decision.in contrast,appellants continue,subsection i offers an affirmative avenue to the court where an importer,after the liquidation period has uneventfully elapsed,can go straight to court for a judicial declaration that such liquidation has occurred,and thereby forestall an improper subsequent affirmative liquidation by customs.id.at emphasis added.
these arguments ignore established law.congress created an express statutory scheme in a for administrative and judicial review of customs actions,providing for a protest before customs and review of protest denials in the cit.c a protest of a decision,order,or finding shall be filed with customs within days after but not before the date of liquidation or reliquidation.a.thus,the cit may adjudicate disputes stemming from denials of protests once the importer has exhausted its administrative protest options.ford,at
