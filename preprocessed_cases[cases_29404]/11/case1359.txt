eric jackson is the principal shareholder of great basin companies,the parent company of various volvo truck dealerships that operated in the west and midwest,including utah and nebraska.this appeal arises out of the district court dismissal of claims filed by jackson and great basin companies against volvo trucks north america.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm the decisions of the district court.
background 
in,jackson created the first of what became several related automobile dealership companies.as the dealerships grew,he would form new companies,most of which included the words great basin somewhere in the name and listed him as sole or majority shareholder.in,these companies began dealing vehicles purchased from volvo trucks north america,volvo and were initially successful in doing so.according to jackson,by the early,the great basin dealerships handled approximately ten percent of all volvo sales in the united states,and thus,at volvo behest,began purchasing large quantities of vehicles from them at a substantial discount.
as the business continued to expand,opening new dealerships in various states,jackson was expressly named the controlling individual or dealer principal of each of the volvo dealerships and acted as guarantor of certain debts and obligations of the dealerships.aplt.br.at.he alleges that he did so based on volvo promises of high returns on his investments and continued access to the profit sources upon which his dealerships depended.but jackson believes that volvo did not intend to keep these promises.jackson claims that,if he had known about volvo plans to eliminate virtually of its product lines and its engine products,he would not have continued to invest in volvo dealerships.compl.at.
in february,volvo ceo announced that half of its current dealers would not be in business by the end of the following year.volvo executives told the dealers they wanted larger,regional dealers who were willing to invest all they had into new territories,new equipment,larger facilities,and additional employees.id.at.the ceo warned the dealers that those who did not grow rapidly and substantially would simply be eliminated.id.
the great basin dealerships heeded this warning and continued to grow and increase revenues.in,with the encouragement of volvo,jackson purchased a dealership in omaha,nebraska,which became great basin trucks of nebraska,great basin nebraska.jackson was responsible for providing as a deposit on the purchase.according to jackson,he and volvo clearly understood the deal would include certain ford franchises.aplt.br.at.however,after jackson made his deposit,he learned the seller no longer possessed those franchises.nonetheless,based upon further verbal promises of assistance and assurances of success by volvo,jackson went forward with the purchase and gave up his right to rescind the purchase agreement with the seller,thereby foregoing his deposit.
by,the great basin operations controlled volvo dealerships in seven states.their revenues grew from million to almost million per year.however,during this growth period,their total debt also grew from million to over million.in june,all of the great basin entities became wholly owned subsidiaries of a newly created parent company,great basin companies.during the remainder of,jackson and great basin companies held ongoing negotiations with volvo for the sale of the nebraska dealership.great basin companies alleges it would not have continued to hold the nebraska dealership during that period but for the promises of purchase made by volvo.
experiencing substantial losses in and,most of great basin companies dealerships filed for bankruptcy.volvo purchased the primary assets of the bankrupt dealerships from the individual trustees in bankruptcy.the deal included an agreement by the trustees to settle,waive,or release all claims the individual dealerships may have had against volvo.
on january,volvo finance arm,volvo commercial finance,llc volvo finance,filed suit against jackson,great basin companies,and related parties over an alleged breach of a million loan agreement.jackson and great basin companies responded by filing their own claims against volvo and volvo finance based on conduct surrounding the loan agreement and other alleged wrongful acts.
in two separate b rulings and one summary judgment ruling,the district court disposed of a number of these claims.jackson and great basin companies appeal the following dispositions.first,jackson appeals the court rule b dismissal of his cause of action arising under the automobile dealers day in court act.second,jackson and great basin companies appeal the court decision to grant summary judgment for volvo on jackson fraud,promissory estoppel,and negligent misrepresentation claims,as well as great basin companies separate promissory estoppel claim 
after jackson and great basin companies filed a notice of appeal,the district court issued a separate order adopting a stipulation of the parties to dismiss with prejudice all claims by and against volvo finance and all unresolved claims by jackson and great basin companies against volvo.this last order resolved the remaining issues in the case.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
we must first consider whether jackson and great basin companies have appealed a final judgment from the district court that is ripe for our review.as a general matter,a judgment in a consolidated action that does not dispose of all claims is not considered a final appealable decision under.trinity broadcasting eller,cir.volvo argues that,because jackson and great basin filed their notice of appeal while other claims remained pending in the case,and because they failed to cure that defect by obtaining certification under b of the federal rules of civil procedure,we should decline to entertain the appeal.however,where parties appeal orders,the court subsequent issuance of an order explicitly adjudicating all remaining claims may cause a case to ripen for appellate review.lewis goodrich,cir en banc exercising appellate jurisdiction where plaintiffs sought and obtained subsequent court order disposing of outstanding claim.as noted above,this is exactly what happened here.
but to further complicate things,volvo points out that one of jackson and great basin dismissed without prejudice to refiling.thus,even though that claim was not appealed,volvo argues the judgment below is still for purposes of our review.our general rule is that a party can not obtain appellate jurisdiction where the district court has dismissed at least one claim without prejudice because the case has not been fully disposed of in the lower court.see heimann snead,cir applying cold metal process united engineering foundry.cook rocky mtn.bank note,cir.that rule does not apply in every circumstance,however.we have previously held,although a dismissal without prejudice is usually not a final decision,where the dismissal finally disposes of the case so that it is not subject to further proceedings in federal court,the dismissal is final and appealable.amazon,dirt camp,cir holding district court decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction and dismiss state claims without prejudice for refiling in state court effectively disposed of entire action.
the critical determination here is whether jackson and great basin have been effectively excluded from federal court under the present circumstances.id.
under utah law,civil conspiracy requires,as one of its essential elements,an underlying tort.see alta indus.hurst,utah.although the district court dismissed jackson and great basin civil conspiracy claim without prejudice,it dismissed their underlying tort claims with prejudice.thus,practically speaking,jackson and great basin companies are barred from further litigation on the conspiracy claim because they can not litigate the predicate torts.they thereby fall within the amazon exception.
accordingly,the case is ripe for appellate consideration.
b.the automobile dealers day in court act 
jackson filed suit against volvo under the automobile dealers day in court act,et.addca.that statute authorizes any automobile dealer to file federal claims against manufacturers arising from franchise relationships.the question here is whether jackson qualifies as a dealer and is therefore authorized to sue under the statute.
three provisions of the addca guide our analysis.the first establishes a cause of action 
an automobile dealer may bring suit against any automobile manufacturer by reason of the failure of said automobile manufacturer to act in good faith in performing or complying with any of the terms or provisions of the franchise,or in terminating,canceling,or not renewing the franchise with said dealer 
standing is thus limited to an automobile dealer,which is defined as 
any person,partnership,corporation or association,or other form of business enterprise operating under the terms of a franchise and engaged in the sale or distribution of passenger cars,trucks,or station wagons.
c emphasis added.a franchise is,in turn,defined as 
the written agreement or contract between any automobile manufacturer engaged in commerce and any automobile dealer which purports to fix the legal rights and liabilities of the parties to such agreement or contract.
based on the plain language of the statute,an automobile dealer must be a party to a franchise agreement with the manufacturer,in this case volvo.jackson concedes that he was not.nonetheless,jackson asks us to carve out an exception to the plain language of the statute because his personal economic interests are inextricably woven into great basin companies corporate interests.he urges us to follow two cases from the fifth and seventh circuits that have interpreted the addca to confer standing on in certain circumstances.we decline to do so.
first,jackson points us to kavanaugh ford motor,cir.in that case,ford motor company entered a franchise agreement with a dealership corporation in which it owned percent of the voting stock.kavanaugh was a signatory to the franchise agreement and was given full managerial responsibility over the dealership.after the franchise began losing money and the dealership stock became worthless,kavanaugh sued under the addca.the seventh circuit decided that,because ford motor company owned all of the voting stock in the dealership corporation,it would be absurd to assume it would agree to initiate an addca claim against itself.thus,the only way for the dealership to avail itself of the protections of the act would be to pierce the corporate veil and allow kavanaugh to protect the dealership interests.
the facts of the kavanaugh case are not before us today,and thus we need not decide whether to adopt its reasoning.the seventh circuit chose to extend the protections of the addca to an individual who was a signatory to the franchise agreement and was therefore arguably operating under the terms of a franchise.see id.at quoting c.by contrast,jackson admits he did not personally sign the franchise agreement.aplt.br.at.in addition,the seventh circuit analysis was driven in large part by its recognition that kavanaugh was the only person or entity who could have pursued an action against the manufacturer under the addca.kavanaugh,at it is inconceivable that ford,owning all the voting stock of the dealership corporation and being in complete control of it,would ever seek the protection afforded by the statute.here,volvo did not control the operations of the great basin corporations and thus could not have completely precluded them from making the decision to sue.indeed,most of the corporations which jackson controlled chose to use that right as a bargaining tool during the liquidation process compare vincel white motor,cir finding no justification for allowing the shareholders to maintain an action in their own name where the corporation explicitly relinquished its claims in bankruptcy proceedings.these critical differences render the reasoning of kavanaugh inapplicable to this case.
the second case on which jackson heavily relies is york,chrysler credit,cir.in york,the fifth circuit purported to adopt the reasoning of kavanaugh.see id.at.however,the analysis was quite different.in that case,the yorks operated dealership corporations pursuant to an agreement with the manufacturer,chrysler.at the outset,the court recognized that the yorks were not signing parties to the franchise agreement.id.moreover,the yorks,rather than chrysler,maintained control of the stock of the dealership corporation,so there was no reason to suspect the manufacturer could prohibit the corporation from filing suit as it did in kavanaugh.nonetheless,the fifth circuit allowed the yorks to pursue individual claims against chrysler under the addca on the grounds that they were inextricably woven into the franchise relationship.id.the court noted that the individuals would not come within the scope of the act merely because they were sole stockholders,officers,and directors of the corporate franchise holder.id.however,the unique position held by these individuals was demonstrated by the fact that chrysler was explicitly given the power to terminate the franchise agreement if either of the yorks died or failed to maintain active management of the corporation or were convicted of certain crimes.id.at.thus,because the court deemed the yorks essential to operation of the dealership by chrysler,they were granted standing under the addca.id.at.
jackson argues that we should adopt the reasoning of york and apply it to his case because he was the principal or sole shareholder of each of the great basin subsidiaries and was heavily involved in the negotiations for volvo dealership agreements.therefore,he alleges,he too was inextricably woven into the business arrangements and essential to the operation of the various dealerships.
this is a question of first impression for our circuit as a preliminary matter,we note that most other circuits have expressly refused to carve out exceptions to the addca.see bishay am.isuzu motors,cir construing analogous statute and rejecting york vincel white motor,cir distinguishing york and kavanaugh tucker chrysler credit,cir unpublished rejecting york olson motor general motor,cir distinguishing york sherman british leyland motors,cir rejecting york pearson ford motor,cir distinguishing york.but see rea ford motor,cir applying york.
we agree with the majority position.the text of the statute plainly cuts against jackson.where a statute is unambiguous on its face,the court need not inquire further.connecticut bank germain,d.moreover,where parties choose the corporate form and receive all the benefits that flow from that structure,we should be hesitant to ignore the consequences.jackson has not alleged an alter ego theory,nor has he argued that we should pierce the corporate veil of the great basin entities to expose the shareholders to personal liability.he has not made this argument for good reason to do so would risk exposing his own assets to creditors of the bankrupt corporations.in short,we see no reason to depart from the plain language of the addca and therefore decline to extend its application to those who do not qualify as dealers under the act.
accordingly,we dismiss jackson addca claim for lack of statutory standing.
state law claims 
last,jackson and great basin companies appeal the district court dismissal of four state law claims.these include three claims brought by jackson fraud,promissory estoppel,and negligent misrepresentation and a separate claim brought by great basin companies promissory estoppel.the district court granted summary judgment against jackson and great basin companies on the basis that they failed to show an actual injury and therefore lacked standing for purposes of federal court jurisdiction.we agree that summary judgment was appropriate but for slightly different reasons than those articulated below.
constitutional standing 
in granting summary judgment,the district court considered the state law claims in terms of constitutional standing.as the court correctly pointed out,a party pursuing an action in federal court must meet the requirements of article iii standing injury in fact that is traceable to the defendant and redressable by the co
