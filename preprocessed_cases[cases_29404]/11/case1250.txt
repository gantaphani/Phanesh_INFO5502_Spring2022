outdoor media group appeals the district court dismissal of its complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.outdoor media asserts that the city of beaumont billboard ordinance violates the first and fourteenth amendments.beaumont repealed the challenged ordinance and replaced it with a new ordinance that specifically bans new billboard construction.the district court then dismissed outdoor media claims for injunctive and declarative relief as moot,and dismissed its damages claim on the merits.the district court had jurisdiction under.this court has jurisdiction over the appeal under.we reverse in part and remand for consideration of whether the old ordinance created an unconstitutional preference for commercial over noncommercial speech or impermissibly distinguished among categories of noncommercial speech,and whether this alleged infirmity gives rise to outdoor media damages claim.
background 
on may,outdoor media filed a conditional use permit application with the planning commission of the city of beaumont to erect four billboards at the junction of interstate and state route.on july,the city director of planning recommended that the planning commission deny the application,because the signs would result in excessive,undue and adverse visual intrusion in the character of the subject interstate and state highway commercial corridors,by adding unrelated advertising to a future new commercial facility.it also found the proposed billboards would have a detrimental effect on the general public,health,safety and welfare by adversely affecting existing views of open space and visual relief and future views of new commercial development.the planning commission accepted this recommendation and rejected outdoor media permit application.outdoor media appealed to the city council,which affirmed the denial.
outdoor media filed this suit on december,alleging that the city deprived it of its first and fourteenth amendment rights.specifically,outdoor media alleges that the ordinance violates the first amendment because it regulates signs on the basis of content,regulates commercial speech without a substantial government interest,allows the city standardless discretion in the permitting process,and is overbroad the city violated outdoor media procedural due process rights because its denial was unreasonable,arbitrary,and capricious and the ordinance violates the equal protection clause by regulating on the basis of arbitrary and unreasonable classifications.outdoor media sought damages for deprivation of its constitutional rights,a declaration that the sign ordinance is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to outdoor media,and injunctive relief prohibiting the city from interfering with outdoor media efforts to erect signs within the city.
on february,the city council repealed the challenged sign ordinance and replaced it with a new ordinance that specifically bans new billboards.the city sought judicial notice of the old and new sign ordinances,and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.outdoor media opposed the motion to dismiss and sought judicial notice of the director of planning recommendation to reject the company permits.on june,the district court granted both motions for judicial notice and the motion to dismiss.outdoor media timely appealed.

iii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
before we examine the merits of outdoor media appeal,we must address beaumont claim,raised for the first time at oral argument,that we lack jurisdiction to consider this case because outdoor media has failed to exhaust its state law remedies.generally,the federal courts deem waived any arguments that are not raised and presented in the parties opening briefs.see,holland america line wartsila north america,cir.by failing to present the issue properly,beaumont has deprived its opponent of a fair opportunity to respond comprehensively to its claim,and has deprived this court of the benefit of a robust debate informed by zealous advocacy.however,the waiver rule does not apply when the issue goes to the district court jurisdiction.see conforte united states,cir.therefore,we address beaumont belated argument.
beaumont jurisdictional argument flows from two premises a plaintiff must exhaust its state law remedies before pursuing a federal claim,and a writ of administrative mandamus is the exclusive state law remedy for an allegedly improperly denied conditional use permit.we need not address the second premise because the first is fatally flawed.the supreme court has explained that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to an action under.patsy bd.of regents,d see also knight kenai peninsula borough sch,cir congress imposed only a limited exhaustion requirement on actions brought under,as this case was.the statute requires exhaustion only when brought by prisoners.thus,mandating exhaustion in this case would not be consistent with congressional intent.beaumont reliance upon our fifth amendment regulatory takings cases is misplaced.we require exhaustion of administrative remedies in the takings context as a matter of ripeness because the takings clause only prohibits the taking of property without just compensation,a takings claim is not ripe until the claimant has pursued and been denied just compensation under the applicable state compensatory procedures.here,the alleged deprivation of outdoor media constitutional rights was completed when beaumont denied its permit applications.because exhaustion is not required to pursue a section complaint,we find that outdoor media failure to seek a writ of administrative mandamus did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction over this case.
mootness of claims for declaratory and injunctive relief 
outdoor media asserts that the district court erred in finding that the repeal of the ordinance mooted its requests for a declaration that the ordinance is unconstitutional and for an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.a claim is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.the basic question is whether there exists a present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted.vill.of gambell babbitt,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.generally,a case should not be considered moot if the defendant voluntarily ceases the allegedly improper behavior in response to a suit,but is free to return to it at any time.native vill.of noatak blatchford,cir.a statutory change,however,is usually enough to render a case moot,even if the legislature possesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is dismissed.id 
here,the district court correctly determined that the city repeal of the sign ordinance moots outdoor media claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.because there is no longer any risk that outdoor media will be subject to the challenged ordinance,there exists no live issue upon which the court could issue prospective relief.noatak,at.outdoor media attempts to distinguish noatak on the ground that beaumont repealed the statute only after outdoor media filed suit,suggesting that the repeal is strategic and that the city will the statute upon resolution of the case.the company relies upon city of mesquite aladdin castle,d,but as the district court recognized,outdoor media broad reading of that case does not square with this circuit precedent.noatak limited mesquite to the rare situation where it is virtually certain that the repealed law would be reenacted.noatak,at emphasis added see also cammermeyer perry,cir the fact that the lawsuit may have prompted the city action does not alone show the city intent to later the challenged ordinance.smith university of washington law school,cir defendant has given no indication of intention to reinstate policy invalidated while case was pending and we will not assume that it will.we also will not assume bad faith the new ordinance,forbidding all billboards,accomplishes the city stated goals of limiting visual clutter and preserving commercial viability of future developments,meaning the city has no motive to a constitutionally suspect ordinance to accomplish the same objective.
outdoor media also claims that its claim is not moot because the new ordinance remains constitutionally infirm.in northeastern florida chapter of the associated general contractors of america jacksonville,d,the supreme court explained that amendments to a challenged statute did not moot a case because the new ordinance disadvantaged plaintiffs in the same fundamental way as the challenged statute.id.at.we find northeastern florida to be inapposite because the new ordinance cures the constitutional deficiencies that outdoor media alleged in connection with the original sign ordinance.the crux of outdoor media complaint is that the old ordinance grants standardless discretion to planning commissioners,regulates more commercial speech than necessary to advance a substantial governmental interest and impermissibly burdens noncommercial speech greater than commercial speech and favors some messages over others.the new ordinance completely bans all new commercial signs.because the planning commission need only determine whether the proposed sign is an commercial sign,the new ordinance does not grant that body unbridled discretion.see outdoor systems,city of mesa,cir.the new ordinance justifies its ban on commercial signs by citing the aesthetic harm imposed by billboards.the supreme court and our prior case law have endorsed this rationale as a substantial government interest,and found that a complete ban on new billboards is no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest under prior case law.see metromedia,at.ackerley commc ns krochalis,cir.finally,the new ordinance contains a message substitution clause that permits the substitution of noncommercial content for existing copy on any otherwise permissible sign.this clause cures any potentially impermissible burdens on noncommercial speech caused by the sign ban.see outdoor,at because the new ordinance is not sufficiently similar to the repealed ordinance that it is permissible to say that the challenged conduct continues,northeastern florida,at,outdoor media claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot 
as the district court correctly noted,the repeal of the ordinance under which outdoor media permits were denied does not moot its claim for damages.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d see also bernhardt county of los angeles,cir.a plaintiff seeks damages for a past violation of its rights this violation is not mooted by a promise not to repeat the alleged conduct in the future.the district court found that outdoor media was not entitled to damages because it had no vested rights upon which the city infringed.on appeal,outdoor media argues that vested rights are not required to claim damages and that it had a vested right based upon the city bad faith denial of its permit application.
the district court ruling was correct as to outdoor media procedural due process claim.the requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the fourteenth amendment protection of liberty and property.board of regents roth,d.the parties agree that property interests giving rise to a due process claim,such as vested rights in a land development permit,are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from state law.id.at.see also lakeview dev.city of south lake tahoe,cir.california has recognized a protected property interest in billboard construction only o nce a permit has been issued.traverso people ex rel.dep t of,cal th,d,see also west coast advertising city and county of san francisco,d.outdoor media argues that because the city allegedly wrongfully denied it an opportunity to rely upon an issued permit,its rights should be considered vested,relying upon the district court opinion in horizon outdoor llc city of industry,d.this case is unpersuasive,as it relies entirely upon eleventh circuit cases interpreting florida law.because this case is at odds with california state court precedent,we decline to follow it here.therefore we find that the district court correctly determined that outdoor media lacked a vested property right in its unapproved billboard permit application,and therefore its procedural due process claim was properly dismissed.
the district court erred,however,in dismissing outdoor media first amendment and equal protection claims on this ground.the establishment of a vested property right is irrelevant to such a challenge.see rutan republican party of,d rejecting argument that employee first amendment rights were not infringed by politically motivated promotion decisions because employee had no legal entitlement to promotion.rutan reaffirmed that 
even though a person has no right to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons,there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.it may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected,his interest in freedom of speech.for if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations,his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited.this would allow the government to produce a result which it could not command directly.such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we therefore hold that the district court erred in dismissing outdoor media first amendment and equal protection claims solely due to lack of a vested property right,and examine whether any of these theories state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
first amendment unbridled discretion 
the prior restraint doctrine requires that a licensing regime avoid placing unbridled discretion in the hands of government officials.gk.travel city of lake oswego,cir.this requirement seeks to alleviate the threat of,discriminatory enforcement that arises where the licensing official enjoys unduly broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a permit.id.internal quotation marks omitted.to avoid impermissible discretion,an ordinance must contain adequate standards to guide the official decision and render it subject to judicial review.thomas chicago park,d.
under the old ordinance,a permit was required for any sign that was not expressly exempted from the permit scheme.former city of beaumont municipal code hereafter old ordinance a the director of planning was required to rule upon any permit application within fifteen days,and was specifically instructed that his review was to ensure that any sign proposal is in conformance with this chapter and is consistent with its intent and purpose.id.d.the city delineated intent and purpose includes encouraging a desirable urban character which has a minimum of overhead clutter,enhancing the economic value of the community and each area thereof through the regulation of the size,number,location,design and illumination of signs,and encouraging signs which are compatible with and adjacent land uses.id.
notably,the old ordinance explicitly prohibited all signs,except temporary subdivision directional signs as provided for in this chapter.id.b.signs were defined as a ny sign which advertises or informs in any manner businesses,services,goods,persons or events at some location other than that upon which the sign is located.id.m.regulations governing the service zone,where outdoor media sought to erect its signs,were even more specific the planning commission could grant permits for signs only if the signs are located upon or within five hundred feet of the property upo
