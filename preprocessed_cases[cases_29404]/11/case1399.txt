this diversity case involves a commercial real estate lease and a proposal by the assignee of that lease to sublease the real estate to a third party.a significant issue in this case arises out of a consent clause in the assignment,which gives the assignor sole discretion to withhold consent to the assignee proposed sublease.we certify this issue to the alabama supreme court because it is dispositive of part of the case and alabama law is unclear.
background 
the facts of this case are relatively simple and generally not in dispute.in april,shoney,entered into a ground lease as tenant of certain property located in montgomery,alabama,at an initial annual rent of,powers,ex.a at.shoney later constructed a building on the property.in february,shoney assigned its rights under the ground lease to mac east,llc,which is in the commercial real estate business,pl.ex.the assignment agreement.mac east assumed shoney obligations under the ground lease,the rent for which by then had increased to,powers,ex.a at.paragraph of the assignment agreement contains the following provision 
assignee mac east shall not enter into any assignment or sublease of any portion of the property or the improvements thereon without the prior written consent of assignor shoney which assignor shoney may withhold in its sole discretion.
pl.ex,at paragraph.
in april,mac east made a proposal to sublease the property to city café diners city café,at a minimum annual rent of per year for the first five years,pl.ex.the proposal designated mac east as the landlord,and city café diners,or entity to be satisfactory to landlord as the tenant.the proposal was subject to the provisions of the original ground lease and assignment and assumption of lease,and may require the approval of third parties under those agreements.id.at.jimmy tselios,who signed the proposal on behalf of city café,agreed to personally guarantee the proposed sublease for five years.
in may,mac east informed shoney in writing that it had found an operator interested in subleasing the property.mac east included in this letter financial statements of the guarantor,tselios,and of two similar operations doing business as city café diner,pl.ex,at.mac east acknowledged that the assignment agreement required it to obtain shoney consent before it could sublease the property.later that month,mac east submitted to shoney a proposed sublease between mac east and an entity called pam enterprises,pl.ex.under the proposal,pam enterprises had days to open and begin operating a a city café diner.at the expiration of this period,around november,rent would become due at a minimum annual rate of for the first five years,ex.
in july,shoney notified mac east that it was unwilling to consent to the sublease unless mac east paid shoney and negotiated its release from the ground lease,or paid shoney,in which case shoney would remain liable on the ground lease,surles,at ex.mac east refused the terms of shoney consent and never executed a sublease with city café.mac east did not sublease the property until june.
in september,mac east filed a complaint in alabama state court for breach of the assignment agreement and for tortious interference with business relations shoney removed the case to federal court alleging diversity of citizenship jurisdiction mac east filed a partial motion for summary judgment and shoney filed a motion for summary judgment.on january,the district court granted mac east motion and denied shoney motion.the court first held that shoney breached the assignment agreement by unreasonably refusing to consent to mac east proposed sublease.the court said that although the assignment agreement gave shoney the sole discretion to consent to the proposed sublease,it did not permit shoney to arbitrarily and capriciously refuse consent,in part,because the assignment agreement does not explicitly express such a standard of discretion.at.instead,the court found that under alabama law,shoney refusal to grant consent was subject to a commercial reasonableness standard.it then ruled that t he undisputed evidence before this court establishes as a matter of law that shoney demand for additional payment,which was an additional term not included in paragraph,was unreasonable and mac east is therefore entitled to summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.id.at.
the court also granted summary judgment to mac east on its tortious interference claim.the court began by noting that although mac east never entered into a binding contract with city café,alabama law permitted a tortious interference claim when the plaintiff merely has a business relation with a third party.the court said that,at a minimum,shoney request of additional payments in exchange for consent constituted coercion,meaning that shoney intentionally interfered with the business relation.the court then turned to the question of whether shoney was a stranger to the contract between mac east and city café because a party to a contract can not,as a matter of law,be liable for tortious interference with the contract.id.at quoting bama budweiser,so d.the court concluded that by requiring additional sums of money,an action not authorized by the contract,shoney effectively became a or stranger to the business relation between mac east and city café.id.at.consequently,it granted summary judgment to mac east on this claim,and denied summary judgment to shoney.
the court held a separate damages hearing in which mac east called three witnesses and offered numerous exhibits.shoney did not call any witnesses,but did mac east witnesses.after the hearing,the court entered a final judgment awarding mac east,including interest from june.the court also apparently awarded attorney fees,although the judgment did not specify how much of the award was attributable to attorney fees.the court did not enter written findings of fact regarding mac east damages.
shoney appeals,challenging the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment,the court grant of mac east partial motion for summary judgment,and the damages award in favor of mac east.
ii.issues on appeal 
we address in this opinion the following arguments raised by shoney on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to mac east on the tortious interference claim,and in denying shoney motion for summary judgment on that claim and that the district court erred in reading a commercial reasonableness standard into shoney sole discretion to withhold consent to a proposed sublease or assignment 
in addition to the above arguments,shoney argues that even if sole discretion includes a commercial reasonableness standard,whether its withholding of consent was commercially reasonable is a question of fact for a jury.given our decision to certify a question to the alabama supreme court,we find it premature to consider this argument.we also find it unnecessary to address shoney argument that the district court erred in awarding attorney fees to mac east because the alabama supreme court answer to the certified question may moot the issue of attorney fees.
iii.discussion 
a.the tortious interference claim 
in order to establish a claim of tortious interference with contractual or business relations under alabama law,the plaintiff must prove the existence of a contract or business relation,the defendant knowledge of the contract or business relation,intentional interference with the contract or business relation,and damage to the plaintiff as a result of the interference.universal underwriters ins.stokes chevrolet,cir.however,a tortious interference claim can be maintained only when the defendant is independent of or a stranger to the relation or contract with which he allegedly interfered.tom foods,carn,so d.a defendant is not a stranger to a contract or business relationship when
