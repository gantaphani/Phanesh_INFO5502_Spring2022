factual and procedural background 
in december,ridgewater purchased a warehouse on a property that is immediately adjacent to six facultative sludge lagoons fsl that are owned and operated by the district.the warehouse was approximately six years old when the district built the first fsl in.the last of the fsl was built in.the fsl are used to treat sludge that emanates from the district wastewater treatment plant.a constant level of water is maintained over the sludge as an odor control measure,while anaerobic bacteria break down the sludge until it is inert and suitable for disposal.the six fsl have a total area of acres,and the depth of the water in each of the fsl is maintained at approximately feet.
inspections of the warehouse prior to ridgewater purchase revealed certain water table and water intrusion conditions that ridgewater believed caused damage to the property that would require repair.as a result of the inspections,the price of the warehouse was reduced from million to million,and a modification to the purchase agreement states that ridgewater acquired the property and all rights of the previous owner as is.ridgewater went through with the purchase,and escrow closed in february.
shortly after close of escrow,ridgewater filed a claim with the district seeking compensation for damage to the warehouse allegedly caused by water seeping from the district fsl.when the claim was denied,ridgewater sued the district for inverse condemnation and nuisance.specifically,the complaint alleges that late in,there was standing water in the loading ramp adjacent to the warehouse,cracks and possible uplifting of a portion of the warehouse slab foundation,concrete erosion,cracking and bulging in and outside the warehouse,water seepage into the truck ramp sump located near the loading ramp,and soil erosion in the parking area adjacent to the warehouse.
the district moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication.the district argued that ridgewater did not have standing to pursue the inverse condemnation claim because any injury to the property occurred before ridgewater purchased it.thus,ridgewater was not harmed by any possible taking.alternatively,the district argued the inverse condemnation claim was barred by the statute of limitations,that there was no taking by the district or its activities were not the proximate cause of any taking.the district sought summary adjudication of the nuisance claim on the grounds that it was barred by statutory design immunity.
the trial court granted the motion.it determined that ridgewater did not have standing to pursue the cause of action for inverse condemnation because when ridgewater purchased the property it was aware of all the conditions that were alleged to interfere with its use and enjoyment.ridgewater could not demonstrate there was any injury that occurred during its ownership of the property.the court also concluded that the nuisance claim was barred by design immunity.a judgment of dismissal was entered and ridgewater timely appealed.

here,ridgewater claims that operation of the district fsl causes continuous and repeated damage to its property because water must be periodically added to keep the fsl at a constant depth in order to control odors.according to ridgewater opening brief,a taking has occurred every time that the district has added water to the fsl s while ridgewater owned the neighboring property.thus,ridgewater seeks compensation for damage that has occurred since it purchased the property.
the district successfully argued in the superior court that ridgewater lacked standing to pursue the inverse condemnation claim because it suffered no harm.while we differ with the district on ridgewater lack of standing,we agree that there are no damages that support a cause of action for inverse condemnation.
the standing doctrine derives from the statutory requirement that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest code civ.a person who invokes the judicial process lacks standing if he,or those whom he properly represents,does not have a real interest in the ultimate adjudication because he has neither suffered nor is about to suffer any injury of sufficient magnitude reasonably to assure that all of the relevant facts and issues will be adequately preserved.schmier supreme court th.the standing inquiry focuses on the plaintiff,not on the issues to be determined,and the reported decisions generally recognize standing where a plaintiff has a personal interest in the litigation outcome.torres city of yorba linda calapp th.
