this petition for review presents the question of whether six restrictions on expressive activity promulgated and enforced by two california shopping malls infringe on the free speech rights guaranteed by the california state constitution and therefore interfere with protected union activity in violation of the national labor relations act nlra when applied to union picketing and handbilling actions.we hold that the six rules impermissibly infringe free speech rights and unlawfully interfere with protected union activity.
macerich management company and macerich property management company collectively macerich operate as the managing agents for arden fair mall and capitola mall the malls,respectively.the malls are enclosed,shopping centers located in sacramento,california,and santa monica,california.macerich promulgated a list of rules for public use of common areas that regulate expressive activity in each mall.among these rules are the six at issue here 
rule identification ban a ban on activities that identify by name the mall owner,manager,or tenants 
rule commercial purpose rule a ban on signage and written materials that interfere with the commercial purpose of the mall 
rule signage ban a ban on the carrying or wearing of signs 
rule application requirement an application process that requires the of written materials 
rule designated areas rule the exclusion of exterior areas,including mall sidewalks,from designated areas where expressive activities may occur and 
rule peak traffic rule the prohibition of expressive activities during peak traffic days.
according to macerich,the general purpose of these rules is to safeguard the commercial activity of the malls,provide shoppers with a pleasant shopping experience,and protect shoppers safety.
on december,representatives of united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america local local distributed handbills at the interior and exterior entrances of the sears store at arden fair mall,to protest the use of a nonunion contractor to build a sears store in roseville,california.local did not file an application with the mall beforehand,nor did it submit the handbills for,because a union representative had been told by an arden fair employee that an application was unnecessary.mall security guards informed the union representatives that they were trespassing and would be arrested if they remained on the premises.when the union representatives refused to leave,mall officials called the police and one representative was arrested.later,a local representative filled out an application,which was denied as untimely,incomplete,and ambiguous.on december and,local representatives went to arden fair mall wearing shirts that said do not patronize arden fair to carpenters.
on march,united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america local representatives distributed handbills and picketed at capitola mall to protest the use of a nonunion contractor to build a new store in the mall,and to publicize an area standards dispute.the picketers left after the police arrived and warned them that they could be subject to citizen arrest.two weeks later,local representatives returned to capitola mall and again picketed the construction site.when they refused to leave,they were placed under citizen arrest.on may,local representatives again picketed at capitola mall,this time protesting the use of another nonunion contractor.four union representatives were arrested.in no instance did local complete an application beforehand or written materials to the mall.
locals and the unions each filed unfair labor practices charges against macerich,alleging that macerich had violated section a of the nlra,a,by unlawfully restricting the unions expressive activities,unlawfully threatening union picketers with arrest,and having union picketers unlawfully arrested.the charges were consolidated by the nlrb general counsel into a complaint alleging that macerich had violated section a by maintaining six rules that unlawfully interfere with expressive activity,and by ejecting union representatives from mall property for engaging in protected activity.
a hearing was conducted before administrative law judge jay pollack,who concluded that macerich had engaged in unfair labor practices by promulgating,maintaining,and enforcing each of the challenged rules,and by ejecting union representatives from mall property for engaging in protected activity.macerich filed exceptions to alj pollack decision,and the board general counsel filed.
in,the nlrb issued a decision affirming alj pollack decision in part.specifically,the board upheld alj pollack findings that the identification ban and the commercial purpose rule rules and were unlawful restrictions under california law.the board also upheld alj pollack finding that the application requirement rule was unlawful when applied to ensure compliance with rules and.the board further found,contrary to alj pollack decision,that the signage ban,the designated areas rule,and the peak traffic rule rules,and were reasonable time,place,or manner restrictions under california law.the unions filed a petition for review case,arguing that rules,and are unlawful macerich filed a petition for review case,arguing that rules,and are permissible and the nlrb filed a petition for enforcement of its decision case.the unions then filed a motion to intervene in case.by orders of december,and january,we consolidated the petitions for review with the board application for enforcement,and granted the unions motion to intervene.we now grant the unions petition,grant in part and deny in part the board petition,and deny macerich petition.
we review the board decision to determine whether the board findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole,and whether the board correctly applied the law.healthcare employees union nlrb,cir.
section of the nlra guarantees employees the right to form labor unions,bargain collectively,and engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid.nlra.
section a of the nlra makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of their section rights.nlra a,a.while the nlra by its terms confers rights only on employees,the united states supreme court has determined that it also restricts an employer right to exclude nonemployee union organizers from the employer property.lechmere,nlrb,d.
under lechmere and subsequent cases,the rights of nonemployee union representatives to access an employer private property are based in state law.thunder basin coal reich,d.where state common law grants an employer the right to exclude nonemployee union organizers from its property,the nlra guarantees access only if the union can show that employees are otherwise inaccessible to union organizers,and that the employees section rights outweigh the employer property rights.lechmere,at.where state law grants nonemployee union organizers the right to access the employer property,a violation of these state rights will also be a violation of the nlra.glendale,nlrb,cir.thus,the question of whether macerich engaged in unfair labor practices by excluding the unions representatives turns on whether california state law grants union representatives the right to access private mall property.
in analyzing questions of state law,we are bound by the decisions of the state highest court.glendale,at.the california supreme court has determined that article i,section of the california constitution protects expressive petitioning and in shopping centers.fashion valley mall,llc nlrb,cal th,d,citing robins pruneyard shopping center,cal d.the california supreme court has repeatedly held that private property can constitute a public forum for free speech if it is open to the public in a manner similar to that of public streets and sidewalks,and that a shopping center to which the public is invited provides an essential and invaluable forum for exercising free speech rights.id.at,quoting pruneyard,at.for this reason,shopping centers in california are required to respect individual free speech rights on their premises to the same extent that government entities are bound to observe state and federal free speech rights.glendale,at.the california supreme court has recognized that this protection of expressive activities on private property is broader and greater than that offered by the first amendment to the united states constitution.fashion valley,d,at citing gerawan farming,lyons,cal th,d,cal.
the free speech protection enshrined in the california constitution is not absolute.shopping malls may impose reasonable restrictions on the time,place,and manner of expressive activities.id.at citing diamond bland,cal d.the level of scrutiny with which we review a restriction on free speech activity depends on whether the restriction is a regulation of the time,place,or manner of speech,or a restriction.id.at.a restriction is subjected to intermediate scrutiny to determine whether it is narrowly tailored,serves a significant government interest,and leaves open ample alternative avenues of communication.id.a restriction is analyzed under strict scrutiny to determine whether the regulation is necessary to serve a compelling interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that end.id.at.applying these tests,we conclude that rules identification ban and commercial purpose rule are impermissible restrictions,and rule application requirement is impermissibly when applied to enforce rules and.we conclude that rules signage ban,designated areas rule,and peak traffic rule are,but fail the intermediate scrutiny test for reasonable time,place,or manner restrictions.
we begin with the unions challenge to rule,the identification ban.the board held that the rule banning activities identifying by name the mall owner,manager,or tenants was identical to the rule we held to be unlawful in glendale in glendale,we began by determining whether the rule was or.at.rules are considered when the rules are not related to the subject or topic of the speech.id.citing ward rock against racism,d rules are generally considered when the regulating party must examine the speech to determine if it is acceptable.id.citing desert outdoor adver.city of moreno valley,cir.in glendale,we determined that a rule prohibiting literature that included the name of a mall owner,manager,or tenant was because the mall would have to review the literature to determine if it included an owner,manager,or tenant name before approving the literature for distribution.id.at the same analysis applies here the identification ban is because macerich would have to review the content of speech and literature to determine whether the speech violated the ban by naming a mall tenant,owner,or manager.
because the identification ban is,we next examine it to determine whether it survives strict scrutiny.id.regulations receive strict scrutiny because restrictions are especially likely to be improper attempts to value some forms of speech over others,or are particularly susceptible to being used to distort public debate.id.at quoting city of ladue gilleo,d,concurring restrictions are presumptively unconstitutional a restriction will pass constitutional muster only if it employs the least restrictive means to further a compelling interest.id.at citing city of paul,d and frisby schultz,d.the burden is on the regulating authority to prove that the restriction is justified without reference to the content of the speech.id.citing rock against racism,at.courts have consistently struck down restrictions based in hostility or favoritism towards particular messages.id.at.
in glendale,the mall argued that its ban on the naming of an owner,manager,or tenant served its interest in ensuring that normal business operations were not disrupted.id.we held that this stated interest was belied by the fact that the mall made an exception for speech promoting primary boycotts of mall tenants,speech that was likely to be the most disruptive of normal business operations.id.at.we also held that the rule was untenable because it was motivated by hostility towards messages that might adversely affect business.id.at.we stated,i n restricting such critical speech about their tenants,owners,or managers,the rule contravenes the purpose of california free speech protections the preservation of discussion of issues even when they are contrary to a regulating party belief or interest the california constitution does not permit censorship of contrary ideas.id.at.
macerich asserts a similar interest here.susan valentine,senior vice president of marketing for macerich,testified that macerich adopted the identification ban to protect the good name of the mall and its tenants.this stated justification exposes macerich hostility towards messages critical of the mall or its tenants.because free speech protections were designed to protect critical speech,we can not find the suppression of critical speech to be a compelling interest.we find that t he mall purpose to maximize the profits of its merchants is not compelling compared to the union right to free expression.fashion valley,d,at.macerich has provided no justification for the identification rule that does not reference the content of the speech.we therefore find that rule the identification ban does not survive strict scrutiny.
the same analysis applies to rule,the commercial purpose rule.we begin by analyzing whether the rule is or.rule prohibits signage and written materials that interfere with the commercial purpose of the mall.as with the identification rule,this rule requires that the regulating authority examine the content of the written material to determine whether it complies with the rule.like the identification rule,the commercial purpose rule is.
next,we address whether rule survives strict scrutiny.valentine and carmen lytle,arden fair general manager,explained that the commercial purpose rule was intended to eliminate written materials that would financially damage the mall or its tenants.the board concluded that the purpose of the rule was to place restrictions on the content of the message so as to limit any negative publicity and not hurt sales.rule is entirely motivated by hostility towards messages critical of the mall or its tenants.macerich offers no justification for the rule.therefore,the commercial purpose rule can not survive a strict scrutiny analysis.
our conclusion is supported by the california supreme court recent decision in fashion valley.in fashion valley,the california supreme court analyzed a mall rule that prohibited speech u rging,or encouraging in any manner,customers not to purchase the merchandise or services offered by any one or more of the stores or merchants in the shopping center.d,at.the court determined that the rule was because it distinguished favored speech from disfavored speech based on the ideas expressed speech urging a boycott was prohibited,but other speech was not.id.at.
fashion valley distinguished the boycott rule from rules prohibiting solicitation of funds,which have been held to be.the court explained that solicitation bans are concerned with the manner of speech,and are directed at the conduct and intrusiveness that solicitation for immediate donation or exchange of funds inherently promotes.id.at.fashion valley expressly rejected the mall argument that the ban on speech advocating a boycott could be similarly justified as a restriction on the manner of speech.id.at,rejecting the mall argument that the boycott ban was a reasonable regulation designed to assure that free expression activities do not interfere with normal business operations.unlike solicitation,the court noted,peacefully urging a boycott does not by its nature cause congestion or promote fraud or duress.id.at.
as the california supreme court noted,shopping centers are free to prohibit conduct calculated to disrupt normal business operations or that would result in obstruction of or undue interference with normal business operations.id.quoting diamond,at emphasis ours.however,speech that does no more than attempt to peacefully persuade customers not to patronize a business can not be banned on the ground that it interferes with normal business operations.id.at.fashion valley explained that the distinction between urging customers to boycott a business and physically impeding access to that business is crucial.id.the california supreme court also noted that citizens have a strengthened interest,not a diminished interest,in speech that presents a grievance against a particular business in a privately owned shopping center,including speech that advocates a boycott.id.at.
the commercial purpose rule at issue here,which was put in place to limit speakers abilities to persuade customers not to patronize certain businesses,is an attempt to restrict the speakers ability to persuade.the rule does not prohibit conduct that would interfere with normal business operations,but instead infringes upon the strong free speech interest in peacefully presenting a grievance to an offending business.because limiting critical speech is an impermissible regulatory goal,rule can not survive a strict scrutiny analysis.
the nlrb correctly held that rule application requirement,when used to enforce the unlawful rules identification ban and commercial purpose rule is likewise unlawful.the board reasoned that because the application process is used to screen written material for compliance with the rule banning the identification of a mall owner,manager or tenant,and with the rule banning signage that interferes with the commercial purpose of the malls,the rule is.we agree,and reiterate that the examination of the content of a speaker message is the hallmark of a rule.the application requirement becomes unlawful when used as a tool to ferret out objectionable content.
our conclusion is consistent with that of the california court of appeal in,in which the court struck down as constitutionally defective an application process used to screen for expressive activity that would adversely affect the shopping center environment,atmosphere,or image.d at.
macerich argues that even if rules and are unlawful,the board order is overbroad because it invalidated the application process entirely,even when used to further legitimate goals like proper scheduling of events.this argument misstates the board order.the order enjoins macerich from m aintaining and enforcing a rule that requires the presubmission of written materials for the purpose of enforcing the unlawful identification and commercial purpose rules emphasis ours.we construe this statement to mean that the application process may remain in use insofar as it is used to promote legitimate time,place,and manner restrictions on expressive activities.so construed,there is nothing overbroad about the holding.
we turn to the unions challenge to rule,the ban on carrying or wearing signs.the nlrb concluded that rule was a reasonable restriction on the time,place,or manner of speech.to be enforceable,restrictions on time,place,or manner must be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,be narrowly tailored to serve a significant interest,and leave open ample alternative channels for the communication of the information.berger city of seattle,cir citing clark cmty.for creative,d failure to satisfy any single prong of this test invalidates a regulation.kuba,at quoting grossman city of portland,cir.
the unions concede that rule is,but argue that it is not narrowly tailored to promote a significant mall interest and does not leave open ample alternatives for communication.to prove that a regulation is narrowly tailored to serve a significant interest,the regulating authority must identify the interests served by the restriction and provide evidence that the proposed communicative activity endangers those interests.id.at.speculation as to what might happen if the proposed activity was allowed is insufficient.id.at finding lack of evidence to support ban on demonstrating where city failed to provide evidence beyond a first hand account that there is simply no space in the fire lanes or the concrete apron in which demonstrators would be safe.studies,anecdotes pertaining to different locales,history,consensus,and simple common sense may serve as evidence that the proposed activity will endanger significant interests.travel city of lake oswego,cir.in the case of safety restrictions,for example,the regulating body need not wait until someone is injured before promulgating regulations.edwards city of coeur,cir.
macerich argues that rule signage ban is justified by convenience,safety,and aesthetic concerns.valentine testified that the signage ban is necessary to prevent people from having to walk out of their way to avoid expressive activities,keep signage looking professional,and protect individuals from injuries caused by signs or the sticks they are attached to.we generally consider safety and convenience to be valid regulatory objectives.berger,at.in at least some circumstances,we have recognized aesthetics to be a significant interest.see foti city of menlo park,noting that while cities do have a substantial interest in protecting the aesthetic appearance of their communities by avoiding visual clutter,these interests may not be compelling.common sense supports the idea that picketers signs may inconvenience retailers and customers by blocking sight lines in shopping centers,although the record does not include evidence to reinforce this conclusion.similarly,common sense suggests that rigid signs with sharp corners,especially if attached to sharp or heavy sticks,could pose a threat to safety.
while there may be sufficient common sense support for macerich assertion that the proposed communicative activity endangers significant interests,the signage ban is not narrowly tailored to serve those interests.for a regulation to be narrowly tailored,the stated interest must be served less effectively absent the regulation,and the regulation may not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the regulating authority legitimate interests.kuba,at.the regulation need not advance the regulating authority interests in the least restrictive or least intrusive way,at,but the existence of numerous obvious and alternatives is relevant to the regulation fit,edwards,at quoting city of cincinnati discovery network,d.
the complete ban on wearing or carrying signs eliminates any safety or aesthetic concern associated with signs or sign poles.for that reason,it may be said that macerich interests would be served less effectively absent the ban however,rule burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to further macerich legitimate interests.rule does just ban speech that is communicated in dangerous or intrusive ways it bans virtually all speech communicated visually through images and text moreover,numerous obvious and less burdensome alternatives exist.the same safety considerations could be served by eliminating signs with particularly dangerous characteristics.macerich could,for example,insist that signs be made from soft materials,have rounded corners,or be attached to cardboard poles.aesthetic and convenience concerns could be promoted by restricting the size of signs or allowing demonstrators to wear signs in the form of lettering on.because the complete ban on carrying or wearing signs is substantially overbroad,it can not satisfy the requirement that the restriction be narrowly tailored.
even if we held the signage ban to be narrowly tailored to serve a significant interest,it would fail intermediate scrutiny because it fails to leave open ample alternatives for communication see kuba,at.a regulation that effectively prevents a speaker from reaching his intended audience fails to leave open ample alternatives.edwards,at.where there is no other effective and economical way for an individual to communicate his or her message,alternative methods of communication are insufficient.id.we will not invalidate a regulation merely because it restricts the speaker preferred method of communication.see also savage trammell crow,d.the adequacy of alternative channels is not measured by the fondest hopes of those who wish to disseminate ideas.however,a regulation that forecloses an entire medium of public expression across the landscape of a particular community or setting fails to leave open ample alternatives,at.as we noted in foti,free speech protections extend to the right to choose a particular means or avenue of speech in lieu of other avenues.at.
we are particularly wary of any regulation that completely forecloses a venerable means of communication that is both unique and important.gilleo,at.picketing is one such venerable medium and has unique advantages over other forms of communication,including immediate recognition by.foti,at.in edwards,we invalidated an ordinance banning the attachment of wooden or plastic supports to signs carried during parades and assemblies because the classic image of a back to the early days of labor of an individual holding aloft a standard.at.
moreover,when picketing is the chosen means of communication,the location of the protest is particularly important.as the california supreme court reiterated in fashion valley when the activity to be protected is the right to picket an employer,the location of the employer business is often the only effective locus alternative locations do not call attention to the problem which is the subject of the picketing and may fail to apply the desired economic pressure.d,at citing diamond,at.
here,the nlrb found that the signage ban left open ample alternatives for communication because the unions were still able to advertise their dispute in the media and picket and handbill on public property.the board now argues that the mall regulations allow the unions to attach two signs to a table,thus granting them the advantage of immediate recognition by.we conclude that these alternatives are legally inadequate.while attaching two signs to a table might allow the unions to communicate with,such a communication method fails to convey the same message of protest associated with an individual holding aloft a signbearing standard.picketing and handbilling on public property,while preserving the symbolism of the sign,would fail to reach the unions intended audience patrons of the malls or of particular stores within the malls.physically removing the protest from the offending employer location would seriously diminish the symbolic and economic impact of the message.advertising the dispute in the media would similarly fail to target the desired audience,and is significantly more expensive.the signage ban left the unions with a narrow range of ineffective options.because the signage ban is not narrowly tailored and does not leave open ample alternatives for communication,the board incorrectly applied the law in determining that rule was a reasonable time,place,or manner restriction.
the board also found that rule,excluding exterior sidewalks from the designated areas where expressive conduct may occur,was a lawful time,place,or manner restriction because the unions concede that this rule is,we begin by examining whether it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant interest 
according to valentine,limiting expressive activities to certain designated areas is necessary to preserve traffic flow and ensure compliance with fire codes.macerich excluded sidewalks from the designated areas for expressive activities because of a concern that mall patrons would have to step into the street to avoid expressive activity on sidewalks,thereby jeopardizing their safety.the unions acknowledge that these safety and convenience interests are significant,but argue that the exclusion of sidewalks from the designated areas for expressive activity is not narrowly tailored to advance these interests.
specifically,the unions argue that the mall sidewalks are no different narrower in most downtown areas,on which expressive activities are permitted.this reasoning finds support in grace,in which the united states supreme court stated,the building perimeter sidewalks are indistinguishable from other public sidewalks in the city that are normally open to the conduct that is at issue here at.the california supreme court has acknowledged that p ersons can be excluded entirely from areas where their presence would threaten personal danger or block the flow of passenger or carrier traffic,such as doorways and loading areas.in re hoffman,cal d,cal.however,rule restricts significantly more than activity in doorways and loading areas.
the unions argue that numerous obvious and less restrictive alternatives could achieve the malls goals.for instance,they suggest that fire code compliance could be ensured by regulations prohibiting expressive activities in entrances and other locations that must be kept clear.berger,at upholding rule restricting expressive activity to sixteen designated locations because the rule furthered significant city interests,by keeping street performances from posing threats to the flow and convenience of patrons in heavily congested areas and entrances to buildings.we agree,and add that regulations prohibiting the restriction of traffic flow on sidewalks would sufficiently address the other safety and convenience concerns 
rule also fails to leave open ample alternatives for communication.we have previously recognized that effective communication depends on the speaker ability to address the intended audience.in united states baugh,for example,we held that a statute requiring a permit to demonstrate on national park property was unlawful when applied so as to refuse a group permission to demonstrate in front of a park visitors center,cir.we noted that the demonstrators were ordered to a first amendment area to yards away from the visitors center where their target audience was located,and that this was an insufficient alternative for communication because the demonstrators were left with no alternative that allowed them to reach their intended audience.id.
here,the malls cover large areas and have numerous entrances.by banning expressive activity on sidewalks and confining expressive activity to designated areas which may be hundreds of yards from any given store or its patrons,macerich has effectively cut off access to the unions intended audience s.the fact that the unions may still advertise their dispute in the media,and picket and handbill on public property,again fails to cure the constitutional infirmity.because rule is not narrowly tailored and does not leave open ample alternatives for communication,it is not a lawful time,place,or manner restriction.
finally,we turn to rule,the prohibition on expressive activities during peak traffic periods.as applied by both malls,rule prohibits expressive activity throughout almost the entire holiday shopping period the time from thanksgiving through the end of december.during this period,mall traffic doubles,and the malls tenants do of their yearly business.based on this evidence of increased mall traffic,the board found the peak traffic rule to be justified by interests in public safety,preserving traffic flow,and controlling congestion.
a complete ban on expressive activities is narrowly tailored only where each activity within the proscription scope is an appropriately targeted evil.frisby,at.macerich has failed to explain how banning every expressive activity during peak times advances a significant interest.instead,macerich attempted to justify the entire ban as a common sense measure to decrease crowding during peak times.numerous less restrictive alternatives would promote the same interest,including a limit on the number of individuals engaged in expressive activities at any one time although a regulation need not be the least restrictive method of advancing a compelling interest,at,the complete ban at issue here is certainly overbroad.
the complete ban on expressive activities,more than any of the other mall rules,fails to leave open ample alternatives for communication.again,macerich suggests the alternatives of media advertising,demonstrations on public property,and expressive activity in the malls during the days of the year when such activity is not entirely prohibited.as discussed above,the options of media advertising and picketing on public property are neither effective nor economical.limiting expressive activity to times eliminates the opportunity to comment upon or and actions during the time that they make of their sales,and forecloses any chance of effectively reaching a large percentage of the target audience.for these reasons,the peak traffic rule is not a reasonable time,place,or manner restriction.
rules identification ban and commercial purpose rule are impermissible restrictions on expressive activity.rule application requirement is likewise unlawful when used to enforce rules and.rules signage ban,designated areas rule,and peak traffic rule are,but can not be justified as reasonable restrictions on the time,place,or manner of expressive activities.because the promulgation and enforcement of each of these rules impermissibly infringes on the free speech rights preserved by the california constitution,we hold that the malls had no right to exclude union representatives from their premises under state law.the enforcement of the contested mall rules against union representatives,and the exclusion of the union representatives from mall property,was therefore a violation of section a.we grant the unions petition,grant in part and deny in part the board petition,and deny macerich petition.
petitions granted in part denied in part 
i agree that macerich efforts to impose restrictions rules,and on speech do not survive strict scrutiny.i respectfully dissent from the majority holding that macerich admittedly time,place,and manner restrictions rules,and are unlawful under the national labor relations act nlra because the california courts have approved the challenged restrictions.the federal courts may not ignore state case law balancing the freedom of expression under the state constitution against state property laws particularly where there is no federal right to engage in the particular expressive activity on private property.
in labor relations,t he ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests.the function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility,which the congress committed primarily to the national labor relations board,subject to limited judicial review.nlrb truck drivers local union,d emphasis added.we accord considerable deference to the national labor relations board nlrb or board interpretation of the nlra as long as it is rational and consistent with the statute.nlrb calkins,cir.we uphold decisions of the nlrb on appeal if the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and if the agency correctly applied the law.retlaw broadcasting nlrb,cir.it is that the nlrb is bound by state law when determining the right of nonemployee union representatives to access an employer private property.see thunder basin coal reich,d lechmere,nlrb,d.therefore,it follows that if california courts hold that a time,place,or manner restriction is permissible under california law,then the nlrb should be entitled to rely on those cases when attempting to determine if a mall has violated nlra section a.
california courts properly apply intermediate scrutiny to content neutral restrictions on free speech on private property.
a time,place,and manner restriction must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and leave open ample alternative channels for the communication of the information.ward rock against racism,d.a statute is narrowly tailored if it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the evil it seeks to remedy.frisby schultz,d.whether a regulation leaves open ample alternative channels for communication of the information requires analyzing if the message could not be communicated in other ways and the barriers to conveying the intended message.clark cmty for creative,d.a n incidental burden on speech is no greater than is essential,and therefore is permissible under united states,d,so long as the neutral regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.united states albertini,d.the validity of such regulations does not turn on a judge agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests.id.
there is no federal right to engage in first amendment activity that is unrelated to the business of a privately owned shopping center.hudgens nlrb,d lloyd tanner,d.california has chosen to provide additional protection for expressive activity in private shopping malls under article i,section of the california constitution.fashion valley mall,llc nlrb,cal th,d.california courts have concluded,however,that shopping malls may impose reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions upon speech.robins pruneyard shopping,cal d,see also fashion valley mall,d,at reaffirming that s hopping malls may enact and enforce reasonable regulations of the time,place,and manner of such free expression to assure that these activities do not interfere with the normal business operations of the mall.california law allows regulation of speech by municipalities and private actors if the regulations are narrowly tailored to protect a proper municipal or private interest.see in re hoffman,cal d,discussing balancing use of property for municipal or private purposes and the first amendment.because california courts apply the exact same scrutiny to time,place,and manner restrictions on first amendment activity as federal courts,the nlrb is entitled to rely upon a california court determination that restrictions similar to those imposed by macerich are proper methods of protecting private property rights under state law.
b.the majority decision fails to give proper deference to the mall time,place,and manner regulation of the wearing and carrying of signs.
macerich has not imposed a complete ban on the use of signs,but rather has a rule that p articipants may not carry or wear any signs,posters or placards.macerich allows posters,placards,displays and signs that are smaller than inches by inches and are affixed to a table so as not to endanger any person or property,block the view of any tenant store or display,or directly compete with center activities or the business displays or logos of center tenants.
california courts have recognized that private property owners have different interests than municipalities for the purposes of balancing those interests against first amendment rights.in re hoffman,at.private property owners have an interest in avoiding interference with the commercial purposes of property id.at.this includes an interest in controlling litter and traffic,savage trammell crow,d,and consideration of whether the number size of signs,posters or placards will interfere with directly compete with business displays or logos.assocs.citizens for representative gov t,d,disapproved on other grounds by fashion valley mall,d,at.under california law,the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.savage.at quoting albertini,at.
in this case,restricting the union members from wearing signs or carrying pickets promotes macerich substantial interest in making sure that protesters do not block access to stores or the for store displays or impede foot traffic.that interest would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.id.as already noted,california courts have stated that commercial property owners may consider whether the number size of signs,posters or placards will interfere with directly compete with business displays or logos.at.
the majority concludes that the ban on wearing or carrying signs does not leave open ample alternatives for communication,speculating about the adequacy of various alternatives including macerich allowance of two signs attached to a table.the supreme court,however,requires us to give deference to reasonable determinations that substantial interests are best served by the restriction at issue.see ward,at.the court of appeals erred in failing to defer to the city reasonable determination that its interest in controlling volume would be best served by requiring bandshell performers to utilize the city sound technician.in fact,the court has stated that the less analysis has never been part of the inquiry into the validity of a time,place,and manner regulation.ward,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.the court went on to conclude that it is error to sift through all the available or imagined alternative means of regulating activity in order to determine whether the city solution was the least intrusive means of achieving the desired end.id.
the proper analysis is whether macerich rules foreclose an entire medium of public expression across the landscape of a particular community or setting.menotti city of seattle,cir quotations omitted.in the ample alternatives context,the supreme court has made clear that the first amendment requires only that the government refrain from denying a reasonable opportunity for communication.id.at citing city of renton playtime theatres,d.foreclosing one narrow form of expression while allowing myriad and diverse alternatives for reaching the intended audience does not violate the first amendment.one world one family now city cty.of honolulu,cir.
the majority assumes that picketing includes the right to wear or carry signs.the board,however,has noted that picketing does not require the holding of a sign.laborers int l union of,nlrb,citing united mine workers of,district,nlrb.i can not find any authority that defines picketing to necessarily include the carrying or wearing of signs.see frisby,at.noting ordinance stated that pickets need not be carrying a sign.macerich rule forbidding the wearing or carrying of signs did not ban picketing.indeed,i conclude that macerich rule foreclosed only one method of picketing and did not categorically deny the unions of their ability to express their dissatisfaction with the use of labor.
macerich rules left open ample alternative means for the unions to communicate their message to the mall patrons.the union could have used a table with two signs staffed by members,and macerich rules allowed union members to carry clipboards and leaflets with additional information for mall patrons.the majority mentions that local representatives went to arden fair mall wearing shirts that said do not patronize arden fair to carpenters,but fails to note that there is no evidence that arden fair mall ejected the union representatives for wearing those shirts.union members were free to wear or carry signs on the public sidewalks surrounding the malls parking lots.the union had myriad and diverse alternatives for communicating their messages to mall patrons.
as the majority acknowledges,under california law,the adequacy of alternative channels is not measured by the fondest hopes of those who wish to disseminate ideas.savage.at citing clark,at.although no california case has expressly approved of a rule banning the wearing or carrying of signs,an intermediate court has noted that commercial establishments are free to establish restrictions on the size and number of signs,placards,and posters.at.thus,the california cases indicate that the california supreme court would uphold a commercial property owner right to ban the wearing or carrying signs,placards,or posters as narrowly tailored and leaving ample alternative channels for communication and deny the petition.see calkins,at discussing how to interpret state law.
c.the designated areas rule and the peak days restriction have been expressly approved by california courts.
in in re hoffman,at,the california supreme court stated 
reasonable and objective limitations can be placed on the number of persons who can be present for first amendment activities at the same time,and the persons present can be required so to place themselves as to limit disruption.in areas normally subject to congestion,such as ticket windows and turnstiles,first amendment activities can be prohibited.persons can be excluded entirely from areas where their presence would threaten personal danger or block the flow of passenger or carrier traffic,such as doorways and loading areas.
in union of needletrades,indus.textile employees superior court,th,d,unite,a california court of appeal held that a shopping center is constitutionally empowered to enact a rule limiting expressive activities to a particular area.the union wanted to distribute leaflets outside of guess,stores located in six different malls instead of in the designated areas provided by the shopping centers.id.at.the state appellate court rejected the union most effective point of persuasion argument,concluding that the california supreme court decision in pruneyard,at,approving of time,place,and manner restrictions to assure that these activities do not interfere with normal business operations allowed the restriction of nonemployee union protesters to designated areas of the shopping center unite,d at.the state court concluded that a center can impose reasonable and objective limitations on the number of persons who can be present and those persons can be required to be in an area so as to limit disruption.id.at.as a result,the state appellate court held that several rules,including rules restricting petitioning activity to two designated areas in the malls,were valid time,place,and manner restrictions under california law.id.at.
this case is no different,and if the restriction of petitioning activity to two designated areas is acceptable under california law,the nlrb must follow california law lechmere,at.california courts have balanced the expressive rights of unions under the california constitution against property owners rights under state property law.this is a question of state law that we are not free to reject.west v.at t.t he highest court of the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.when it has spoken,its pronouncement is to be accepted by federal courts as defining state law see also calkins,at noting that if california provides additional protection,it does so by modifying state property law.
the majority reliance on the unavailability of the sidewalks and entrances immediately outside the stores to conclude that macerich restrictions are not narrowly tailored is also not supported by california law.see lushbaugh home depot,th,d,noting designated areas may be located away from motorized traffic,foot traffic,and entrances furthermore,california courts have concluded that the additional protection of speech in shopping malls under state law does not include a right to conduct activity at the most effective point of persuasion.unite.at collecting cases.the board properly relied on unite in its decision therefore,the board decision is rational and consistent with california law calkins,at.
similarly,california courts have upheld peak days restrictions in.at approving of ban on heavy traffic days if the dates are set forth in writing unite,th,d at approving of holiday blackout periods ranging from specific days to the period between the weekend before thanksgiving through january of the next year and costco,gallant,th,d,affirming restrictions on expressive activity on busiest days.indeed,macerich rule restricting expressive activity on peak business days,accompanied by the list of unavailable dates,is more lenient than the restriction approved by the state court in costco cos,by four days.in unite,the state appellate court approved restrictions on expressive activity spanning between the weekend before thanksgiving through january,a period of days.accordingly,the supreme court opinion in lechmere,at,as well as our own precedents,mandate that we accept state law and uphold the board determination that macerich peak days limitations are a valid time,place,and manner regulations.
the majority attempts to distinguish the california cases by stating that they do not discuss whether the rules are narrowly tailored.both unite and contain numerous citations to in re hoffman,savage,and other california cases specifically applying intermediate scrutiny to time,place,and manner restrictions.in fact,unite specifically refers to other portions of the days limitations under a content neutral analysis as being narrowly drawn and then approves the blackout periods as e qually appropriate under california law.unite,d
