appellant sp star enterprises,star holds a certificate of occupancy from the city of los angeles the city permitting star to operate an adult club featuring nude entertainment in a,converted facility zoned on ducommon street north of little tokyo.star also holds a franchise to operate a penthouse branded adult cabaret.this case involves star application for a conditional use permit for the sale and consumption of alcohol at the club.
the city zoning administrator granted star application for one year.the los angeles hompa hongwanji buddhist temple the temple and the fukui mortuary appealed the approval to the city central area planning commission apc.the appeal was supported by the los angeles police department,two city council members,the central city east association and numerous private citizens who argued the proposed use is not compatible with the religious and community uses in the area or the redevelopment of the area north of little tokyo.
star responded its upscale business would improve tourism in the area as penthouse cabarets had in other cities and would have no adverse impact on the neighborhood.further,star already was licensed to offer fully nude dancing and issuance of the conditional use permit would trigger alcoholic beverage control abc regulations which limit adult entertainment to topless dancing on stages at least six feet from the nearest patron.
the apc conducted a public hearing at which it upheld the appeal,resulting in the denial of the conditional use permit.star then sought a writ of mandate.the trial court denied star writ petition,indicating it would uphold the apc ruling whether it applied a substantial evidence or a de novo standard of review.this appeal followed.
the thrust of star attack on the apc ruling and the trial court denial of its writ petition is that star is entitled to preferential treatment because it engages in a disfavored form of protected expression.thus,the standards under which the apc operated must be strictly scrutinized to avoid giving the apc unbridled discretion to regulate speech.star also contends the apc findings were a pretext for discriminating against disfavored speech and were not supported by substantial evidence.
we conclude the case does not involve free speech but the right to sell alcohol,which is not a protected activity and does not involve a fundamental vested right.yu alcoholic bev.appeals bd.th,d.thus,the standards under which the apc upheld the appeal need not reflect the precision of regulation required when a municipality regulates protected activity.burton municipal court cal d.rather,because the standards applied by the apc are not vague or arbitrary and the apc decision finds substantial support in the record,we affirm the trial court order denying star writ petition.
facts and procedural background 
star is granted a conditional use permit the temple and fukui mortuary appeal.
star initially obtained a building certificate from the city to convert a facility into a gentleman club with seating for patrons,parking spaces,and hours of operation from to daily.the city thereafter granted star a certificate of occupancy permitting it to offer nude entertainment.
star then sought a conditional use permit for the sale and consumption of a full line of alcoholic beverages with live entertainment consisting of clothed and topless dancing.the application discloses the club will have no kitchen and happy hour from to daily.
the zoning administrator za conducted a public hearing and thereafter granted star application for a conditional use permit for one year.the approval letter stated the site is a corner parcel with feet of frontage on the north side of ducommon street and approximately feet along vignes street.the property is improved with a warehouse building with rooftop and interior parking accessed via commercial street.surrounding properties are characterized by buildings occupied by perishable food cold storage,food processing operations and a city maintenance yard.
the temple and the fukui mortuary appealed the approval to the apc,which conducted a public hearing on the matter.
the public hearing before the apc.
a.the zoning administrator explanation of the approval.
zoning administrator albert landini approved star application because abc guidelines for this census tract permit one license for the sale of alcohol and one license and,at the current time,there are no licenses.the area had a low crime rate and,although it had been claimed there were two artists lofts nearby,no residential properties had been identified and residential use in the area clearly was in the minority.landini noted star voluntarily had agreed to conditions on the signage of the building,the site has a large amount of parking and construction of the club has been completed.landini noted the permit had a life of one year and star had accepted this condition based on its substantial belief in the nature of its business.
position of the proponents of the appeal.
gerald fukui,the fifth generation operator of the fukui mortuary on east temple street,testified the mortuary has been serving the community since.they have a chapel which accommodates people and is used for funerals and memorial services involving all faiths and religions.the mortuary conducts more than services per year and many services continue into the night as is the custom.the mortuary is approximately three blocks from the site of the proposed permit.the sale of alcoholic beverages in such proximity to the mortuary would be disruptive,dangerous and contrary to the environment of grieving family and friends.fukui indicated there already was a problem with little pedro,a bar directly across the street from the temple at first and vignes streets.loud,boisterous patrons of little pedro park and urinate in the mortuary parking lot and act disrespectfully when passing the entrance to the chapel.fukui noted the mortuary will be between the new cabaret and little pedro.
on behalf of the temple,eric kurimura testified the permit will create an unsafe environment for families congregating at the temple.kurimura feared disruption of numerous religious services and youth programs.also,the increased sale of alcohol in the area would be adverse to the changing nature of the community.the temple operates a day care center from to five days a week.the temple also has funeral services,memorial services and weddings,most of which take place in the evening.the permit did not require star to sell food and the temple was concerned that intoxicated people leaving the cabaret would engage in boisterous conduct.
a member of the temple noted the cabaret would be open when the children who attended the nishi center took monthly field trips and were dropped off on vignes street between ducommon and temple streets.these field trips would occur during the hours of operation of the cabaret.another member of the temple expressed fear of cars racing on vignes street on friday night when the temple had approximately children involved in their scout program.
brandy chappell,planning deputy for council member jan perry of the ninth council district,expressed concern that issuance of the permit would result in an increase in drunk driving in the neighboring residential communities.chappell noted problems had occurred at the grand avenue club and the stock exchange club and concluded the conditional use permit was not in the best interests of little tokyo or the arts district.chappell noted the little tokyo community had opposed a conditional use permit for the neptune project which was at third and alameda streets and was not a cabaret.the opposition was based solely on alcohol use.
jessica wethington mclean,the planning director for council member jose huizar of council district,testified the area is undergoing revitalization.the area had a tremendous amount of crime five to seven years earlier but it was cleaned up,because we have a vision for this area.mclean noted a new business improvement district bid was scheduled to open in january and the city wanted to mix residential and light industrial uses in the area.the fukui mortuary is feet beyond the foot notification limit and the temple provides religious services to the community,which was burgeoning.mclean indicated an alcohol permit was not compatible with the council vision for the area or the plan.
estella lopez,executive director of the central city east association which represents the interests of property owners,supported the appeal on behalf of the residents of the arts district,property owners and business owners who wished to eliminate nuisance uses.the arts district was in transition with more residential use anticipated and the proposed use was wrong for this community at this time.
the owner of heet sound products,feet from the proposed use,opposed the application based on increased noise and drunkenness in the evenings and on the weekend.
los angeles police lieutenant tom brosh indicated that based on years of experience,when alcohol is combined with this type of establishment and late hours,it generally leads to disaster.and i can guarantee that i going to be out there on some saturday night at in the morning handling a murder,because it just going to happen.that just the way it is.brosh predicted the crime rate would increase dramatically just when the area was undergoing a renaissance.brosh noted a new multistory residential structure was being built at temple and alameda streets,businesses were trying to revitalize the area and there were artist lofts in the area.brosh also noted the county jail was a few blocks away and people are released from the jail at all times of the day and night.brosh predicted an increase in panhandling and crime.brosh indicated that even if the cabaret provided security inside the club,problems arise when patrons leave.
los angeles police lieutenant raymond garvin testified the club was seven blocks from the skid row area and the contemplated use would attract the element the police are trying to abate under the safer cities initiative.
opposition to the appeal.
counsel for star indicated star has invested more than million in the property and star licensing agreement with penthouse required star to run an upscale club.also,although the conditional use permit did not require the sale of food,star licensing agreement with penthouse required star to offer food.counsel noted that,without a liquor license,the club could offer fully nude dancing.however,with a liquor license,abc regulations limited the club entertainment to topless and the performers were required to be on stages six feet from the nearest patron.counsel noted the building is basically a concrete box which will emit no noise and all parking is on the interior and the roof of the structure.counsel asserted there would be no need for customers to park on the street or walk in the neighborhood and the business would have security at all times it was open.also,the funeral home is feet from the site and the temple is more than feet from the site.thus,both appellants were outside the foot statutory notice range.
remarks of the commissioners.
commissioner chanchanit martorell indicated the commission had to consider that the community is experiencing a total turnaround,a revitalization,a r enaissance.martorell stated the community wants to be hospitable to families and noted lieutenant brosh had testified,based on his years of experience,that disaster follows if you combined alcohol,testosterone and late hours.also the cabaret was in close proximity to the county jail and skid row where there is a great deal of drug and alcohol abuse.martorell indicated the apc obligation was to see that this community is given a an opportunity to turn around.martorell concluded,it just not a compatible use w e want to move forward,not backward.
commissioner franklin acevedo indicated difficulty reconciling operation of a cabaret with the community spaces located nearby.acevedo suggested children at the day care center might be in danger of injury from a drunk driving incident after lunch.
commission president young kim indicated star had a right to operate this type of facility at the location.however,kim did not think the number of alcohol licenses in this census tract was relevant in that other census tracts have an of alcohol permits.
e.the apc ruling.
the apc upheld the appeal by a vote of three to one.the apc found the use was not desirable to the public convenience or welfare,was materially detrimental to the character of development of the community and was not in harmony with the objectives of the general plan.
the apc adopted proposed findings of fact as required by the los angeles municipal code lamc the apc found as follows the proposed location will not be desirable to the public convenience or welfare in that it is not in accordance with the greater development pattern of the surrounding community.it is not respectful of what is referred to as sacred space associated with both the nearby buddhist temple,and with the mortuary.and it provides a potentially dangerous mixture of the sale of alcoholic beverages and an otherwise permitted use of land that,in the opinion of the los angeles police department,can result in increased crime rates.
the use will be materially detrimental to the character of development in the immediate neighborhood,because this area is one that is emerging as a unique residential community in the establishment of various artists and resident lofts 
the apc also noted that,because of the proximity to downtown,this area will be increasingly important as a residential resource and the proposed use of the land would be detrimental to that use.
the apc further found the proposed location will not be in harmony with the various elements and objectives of the general plan.although the property is zoned for heavy industrial use,it is also located in an increasingly important area that has been recognized by elected officials as one in which there is a significant change in land use,away from manufacturing to housing and artist activities and the proposed future establishment of a bid.the apc found approval of the requested use will adversely affect the economic welfare of the community because there has been a wholesale outcry from various public and quasi governmental organizations representing business and cultural activities that claim such use in this neighborhood will be detrimental to their goals and objectives of providing a better business environment for the art s district as well as for the little tokyo area.
while the crime statistics are low for this area,and the associated alcohol beverage sales are also nonexistent in the subject census tract,it can be found that the proposed use will result in undue concentration of premises for the sale or dispensing of alcoholic beverages when the larger surrounding community,including the downtown area,is taken into consideration.in this larger area,it has been demonstrated by verbal testimony from the council office and the police department that there are troublesome issues involving the mixture of alcohol and a nightclub,or other cabaret like activities.
in finding the proposed use would detrimentally affect the surrounding community,the apc considered the increasing number of residences in the area.although these residences are outside the immediate notification radius,they are nonetheless in close enough proximity that they should be considered as potentially being troubled by the proposed use.
further,in reaching a finding of detrimental impact,the apc has considered testimony from the police department regarding the effect of the sale of alcoholic beverages in such establishment,and the resulting criminal activity that is potentially likely to appear.the apc also considered the impact sales of alcoholic beverage might have on school children walking to and from school activities,and using a shuttle bus that stops in close proximity to the subject site.
star institutes proceedings under code of civil procedure section.
star sought review of the apc ruling in the trial court through administrative mandamus pursuant to code of civil procedure section.after conducting a hearing,the trial court denied star mandamus petition.the trial court found substantial evidence supported the apc ruling.in so finding,the trial court indicated it would reach the same decision regardless of the standard of review applied.this appeal followed.
contentions 
star contends the apc and the trial court denied star an economic benefit because star engaged in a disfavored form of protected expression.star further contends the standards under which the apc operated gave it unbridled discretion to regulate speech,the apc rationale for denying the permit was a pretext for discriminating against disfavored speech,denial of the permit on the grounds of future redevelopment endowed the apc with unconstitutional discretion to regulate speech and the apc findings were not supported by substantial evidence.
discussion 
standard of review.
the exclusive remedy for judicial review of administrative action affecting land use is a proceeding under code of civil procedure section.saad city of berkeley th,d code civ,subd.a.a trial court review of an administrative decision is subject to two possible standards depending on the nature of the right involved.mann department of motor vehicles th,d.
if the administrative decision involved or substantially affected a fundamental vested right,the superior court exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo in which the court must examine the administrative record for errors of law and exercise its independent judgment upon the evidence.bixby pierno cal d,code civ,subd.c.
where no fundamental vested right is involved,the trial court review is limited to examining the administrative record to determine whether the agency decision and its findings are supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.bixby pierno,supra,cal d at.
regardless of the nature of the right involved or the standard of judicial review applied in the trial court,an appellate court reviewing a trial court ruling on administrative mandamus applies a substantial evidence standard.fukuda city of angels cal th,d,bixby pierno,supra,cal d at.if a fundamental vested right was involved and the trial court therefore exercised independent judgment,it is the trial court judgment that is the subject of appellate court review.citations.on the other hand,if the superior court properly applied substantial evidence review because no fundamental vested right was involved,then the appellate court function is identical to that of the trial court.it reviews the administrative record to determine whether the agency findings were supported by substantial evidence,resolving all conflicts in the evidence and drawing all inferences in support of them.citations.jkh enterprises,department of industrial relations th,d,fn.omitted.
under the substantial evidence test,the agency findings are presumed to be supported by the administrative record and the appellant challenging them has the burden to show they are not.jkh enterprises,department of industrial relations,supra,th at,d mann department of motor vehicles,supra,th at,d saad city of berkeley,supra,th at,d.when more than one inference can be reasonably deduced from the facts,the appellate court can not substitute its deductions for those of the superior court.pasadena unified sch.dist.commission on professional competence cal d.
star application for a conditional use permit for the sale and consumption of alcohol does not involve a fundamental vested right.
star asserts topless dancing is a recognized form of protected activity.thomas,county of los angeles d.star argues that because the apc decision impacts stars ability to engage in protected activity,the trial court was required to conduct an independent review of the record.rubin city of burbank th,d zeitlin arnebergh cal d.
determination whether a right is fundamental is made on a basis.bixby pierno,supra,cal d at.a s a general rule,when a case involves or affects purely economic interests,courts are far less likely to find a right to be of the fundamental vested character.citations.jkh enterprises,department of industrial relations,supra,th at,d.thus,a dministrative decisions which result in restricting a property owner return on his property,increasing the cost of doing business,or reducing profits are considered impacts on economic interests,rather than on fundamental vested rights,city of los angeles th,d id.at,d.
it is clear that an initial application for a conditional use permit to sell alcohol for consumption does not involve a fundamental vested right or star right of free speech.on the contrary,it is generally accepted that the liquor business is fraught with danger to the community,and may therefore be either entirely prohibited,or permitted under such conditions as are prescribed by the regulatory agency,which has broad power in this respect.citations.yu alcoholic bev.appeals,supra,th at,d.
the cases cited by star,rubin and zeitlin,involve sectarian prayer in city council meetings and whether a book was obscene,respectively.both of these issues are grounded in constitutional rights.however,the impact of the apc decision on star business was purely economic.star already has a certificate to operate as an adult club offering nude entertainment.thus,the matter in issue in this case is not the right to engage in protected activity,but the right to sell alcohol for consumption.as a result,the trial court properly applied the substantial evidence test,rather than the independent judgment standard.we therefore review the apc decision and its findings to determine whether they are supported in light of the administrative record.
vague standards.
star arguments.
star contends the apc decision was based on vague standards that gave it unbridled discretion to discriminate based on the content or viewpoint of speech by suppressing disfavored speech or disliked speakers.lakewood plain dealer publishing,d.star claims the apc ruling plainly imposes a financial disincentive only on speech of a particular content.simon schuster,members of state crime victims bd,d.star asserts that because the apc gave star the option of engaging in protected speech without an alcohol permit or refraining from that speech,the apc was required to base its ruling on narrow,objective and definite standards jersey bar.liquor control d.
star argues that,i n considering the constitutionality of ordinances in the category of that involved here precision of regulation must be the touchstone citation and the standards set forth therein must be susceptible of objective measurement.burton municipal court,supra,cal d at.star notes the apc found the proposed location would not be desirable to the public convenience or welfare,the location is not proper in relation to adjacent uses or the development of the community,the use will be materially detrimental to the character of the development in the immediate neighborhood,and the use will not be in harmony with the various elements and objectives of the general plan.
star contends terms such as proper,materially detrimental,in harmony and immediate neighborhood are unconstitutionally vague and fail to give the applicant a standard it can understand and meet.smith county of los angeles th,d.thus,the standards applied by the apc constitute unconstitutional administrative censorship in an extreme form.largent texas.star concludes the denial of the permit was an unconstitutional burden on speech and,in the absence of precise standards,the apc decision was arbitrary as a matter of law.
