sango international,sango appeals the decision of the united states court of international trade upholding the determination of the department of commerce commerce that sango imported gas meter swivels and gas meter nuts are within the scope of an antidumping order covering malleable iron pipe fittings,other than grooved fittings,from the people republic of china.see sango int l united states cit decision,d.int l trade.because we conclude that commerce decision is not supported by substantial evidence,we reverse the decision of the court of international trade and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the antidumping laws protect united states industries against the domestic sale of foreign manufactured goods at prices below the fair market value of those goods in the foreign country.aimcor united states,see also allegheny ludlum united states,under the statutory scheme established by the tariff act of american industries may petition for relief from imports that are sold in the united states at less than fair value dumped,or which benefit from subsidies provided by foreign governments.if a sale of imported goods results in actual or threatened injury to the corresponding domestic industry,a duty may be imposed on the imported merchandise.micron,united states.the duty is equal to the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price for the merchandise.rhp bearings united states,quoting.
an antidumping investigation is initiated when a domestic industry petitions commerce to investigate allegations of dumping by foreign manufacturers.duferco steel,united states.in due course,commerce makes a preliminary determination as to whether the imported merchandise is being sold,or is likely to be sold,at less than fair value.b a.while commerce is making its preliminary determination,the international trade commission commission makes a preliminary determination as to whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the united states is materially injured or is threatened with material injury by reason of imports of the subject merchandise or that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible.id.a.if the investigation is not terminated at the preliminary stage,commerce makes its final determination as to sales,or the likelihood of sales,in the united states.id.a.at the same time,the commission finalizes its determination as to the existence or threat of material injury.id.b.if both the inquiry by commerce and the injury inquiry by the commission are answered in the affirmative,commerce issues the appropriate antidumping order.duferco steel,at see c.
on october,commerce received an antidumping petition from anvil international,anvil and ward manufacturing,ward,domestic manufacturers of pipe fittings,asking commerce to investigate the importation of malleable iron pipe fittings,other than grooved fittings,from the people republic of china.pipe fittings are formed connector pieces that are used in the construction of piping systems.
in the section of the petition describing the scope of the investigation,anvil and ward stated that the goods at issue were currently classified under item numbers,and of the harmonized tariff schedule htsus petition for the imposition of antidumping duties malleable iron pipe fittings from china,at,antidumping petition.they further stated,however,that t he product description of the subject merchandise,and not htsus classifications,should be dispositive of whether merchandise is covered by this petition.id.turning to the uses of the goods at issue,ward and anvil stated that the principle uses of malleable iron pipe fittings are in gas lines,piping systems of oil refineries,and gas and water systems of buildings.id.at.finally,the petition provided information concerning the specifications and characteristics of the pipe fittings 
malleable iron fittings are produced to the american society for testing and materials astm standard a the fittings are threaded to the american national standards ansi specifications.they are available in many configurations,the most common being degree elbows,tees,couplings,crosses,and unions.they are produced in both black ungalvanized and galvanized form normally,the ungalvanized fittings are produced to astm specifications and threaded to specifications,and the galvanized fittings are made to astm specifications and threaded to specifications.malleable pipe fittings are normally threaded and attached to pipe by screwing the grooved fittings which are excluded from the scope of this investigation and like product are a completely different form of fitting,in which split couplings are attached to a circumferential groove close to the end of each piece to be joined.a gasket inside the coupling seals against the pipe and the coupling.
one of the fittings covered by the petition,an elbow fitting,is depicted below.
an elbow fitting allows two pieces of pipe to be connected,and permits the resulting connection to turn ninety degrees.pipe is threaded into each opening in the elbow.tees and crosses are similar to elbows but have three and four openings threaded for pipe connections,respectively.the threads on both the pipe and the fittings conform to ansi,which specifies national pipe thread npt.cit decision,d at antidumping petition,at.
in its notice of initiation of the antidumping investigation,commerce set forth the scope of the products included in the investigation 
t he products covered are shipments of certain malleable iron pipe fittings,cast,other than grooved fittings,from the people republic of china.the merchandise is classified under item numbers,and of the harmonized tariff schedule.htsus subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes.the written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.
notice of initiation of antidumping duty investigation certain malleable iron pipe fittings from the people republic of china.on december,following the investigation by commerce and the commission that resulted from the anvil and ward petition,commerce issued an antidumping order titled certain malleable iron pipe fittings,cast,other than grooved,from the people republic of china order.cit decision,d at citing.the order covered the following products 
certain malleable iron pipe fittings,cast,other than grooved fittings,from the people republic of china.the merchandise is classified under item numbers,and of the harmonized tariff schedule htsus.excluded from the scope of this order are metal compression couplings,which are imported under htsus number.a metal compression coupling consists of a coupling body,two gaskets,and two compression nuts.these products range in diameter from inch to inches and are carried only in galvanized finish.although htsus subheadings are provided for convenience and customs and border protection cbp purposes,the department written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.
sango is a united states manufacturer that insulates gas meter swivels and nuts.id.at.gas meter swivels are used to connect a gas meter to a piping system.a swivel has the standard npt threaded connection on one side and a shaped flange with a notch on the other side.the shaped flange mates with a gas meter through the use of a gas meter nut.because of the flange connection,the gas meter swivels can only connect to pipe on one side and a gas meter on the other side.typical gas meter swivels are shown below.
as indicated,a gas meter nut is used to connect a gas meter swivel to a gas meter.below is a typical gas meter nut.
gas meter swivels and nuts are manufactured to ansi standard,which covers diaphragm type gas displacement meters.
during the period following the issuance of the order,sango caused to be imported into the united states from the people republic of china gas meter swivels and nuts.upon entry,customs classified the swivels and nuts under htsus.on december,and february,customs rejected sango claim that the goods should be classified under htsus,as parts and accessories to gas meters.in reaching its conclusion,customs explained that the swivels and nuts work together to connect a pipe elbow to a gas meter by screwing.customs determined that the meter swivels and nuts were thus parts of general use that should be classified under htsus heading.this determination resulted in the swivels and nuts being covered by the order,since the order states that the merchandise subject to it is classified under item numbers,and of the harmonized tariff schedule.id.at.
there is no statutory provision governing the interpretation of the scope of antidumping orders.however,pursuant to c,an importer may request a scope ruling as to whether a particular product is covered by an antidumping order upon receipt of a request for a scope ruling,commerce conducts an inquiry into whether the product is covered by the antidumping order at issue.this inquiry is governed by regulation 
i n considering whether a particular product is included within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation,the secretary of commerce will take into account the following 
the descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition,the initial investigation,and the determinations of the secretary including prior scope determinations and the international trade commission.
when the above criteria are not dispositive,the secretary of commerce will further consider 
i the physical characteristics of the product 
ii the expectations of the ultimate purchasers 
iii the ultimate use of the product 
iv the channels of trade in which the product is sold and 
v the manner in which the product is advertised and displayed.
if commerce can determine,based solely upon the application for a scope ruling and the descriptions of the merchandise referred to in paragraph k of section,whether a product is included within the scope of an order,the secretary will issue a final ruling.d.if commerce can not so determine,commerce will initiate a scope inquiry.id.e.
on july,sango requested a scope ruling that would exclude gas meter swivels and nuts from the coverage of the order.anvil and ward submitted comments to commerce arguing that the swivels and nuts should be covered by the order because they are malleable iron pipe fittings which are cast and that are not grooved fittings and are not compression fittings.cit decision,d at.
on september,commerce decided that a formal scope inquiry was required because it was unable to determine conclusively that meter swivels and meter nuts are pipe fittings and are treated as such within the industry.id.quoting e internal quotation marks omitted.thereafter,in accordance with k,commerce analyzed the order,the antidumping petition,the initial investigation,and its determinations and the determinations of the commission to determine whether the gas meter swivels and nuts were within the scope of the order.id.at see k.commerce found these sources dispositive and on january,issued a ruling in which it determined that the swivels and nuts were within the scope of the order,stating as follows 
first,these products are manufactured from malleable iron using a casting process in the prc.second,these products are indisputably fittings they are pipe fittings because they are parts of a piping system,they direct the flow of the gas through a piping system,and can be,although are not always,connected to other pipe fittings or pipes.finally,they are neither grooved fittings nor compression couplings,both of which are specifically excluded.
cit decision,d at citing united states department of commerce,final scope ruling on whether meter swivels and meter nuts are excluded from the scope of the antidumping duty order on malleable iron pipe fittings from the people republic of china,at,scope ruling.
pursuant to a,sango timely filed suit in the court of international trade to challenge commerce scope ruling,and ward and anvil intervened.id.in due course,sango moved for judgment on the administrative record,arguing that gas meter swivels and nuts are unambiguously outside the scope of the order and,in the alternative,that commerce scope ruling was invalid because it failed to consider the criteria set forth in k id.at.
addressing sango motion,the court of international trade examined the antidumping petition,the factual findings and legal conclusions adduced from the administrative investigations,and the preliminary order.id.at quoting duferco steel,at.the court explained that the language of the order receives the greatest weight.id.the court also reviewed the commission publications and administrative documents concerning the antidumping investigation,on the ground that those items served to flesh out the meaning of the order text.id.at.the court noted that the commission had explained that 
p ipe fittings generally are used for connecting the bores of two or more pipes or tubes,connecting a pipe to some other apparatus,changing the direction of fluid flow,or closing the pipe.the material from which mcipf malleable cast iron pipe fittings are made,cast iron,is a general term for alloys composed primarily of iron,carbon greater than two percent and silicon.
id.quoting united states international trade commission,malleable iron pipe fitting from china determination and views of the commission,investigation preliminary,at alterations in original.
the court of international trade concluded that the products are cast,made of malleable iron,manufactured in the prc,and do not fall within the express exceptions within the order.id.at.on this basis,the court determined that it must uphold commerce scope ruling as supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.id.this appeal by sango followed.we have jurisdiction over a final decision of the court of international trade pursuant to a.
discussion 
we reapply the standard of review employed by the court of international trade.wheatland tube united states.that means that we must uphold a scope ruling unless we find it to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record or otherwise not in accordance with law.b b.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached.consol.edison labor relations.the substantial evidence inquiry takes into account both the evidence that supports and detracts from the conclusion reached.see nippon steel united states.
sango argues that gas meter swivels and nuts are distinct articles of commerce outside the scope of the order.sango states that the only part of a gas meter swivel that meets ansi standard npt is the one end that connects to a pipe fitting.sango explains that the other end of a gas meter swivel is flanged and specially designed to join with the gas meter,and this flanged end can not join to any pipe or any other section of a gas piping system.at the same time,sango points out that pipe fittings,which are covered by the order,are manufactured to meet ansi standard,while gas meter swivels and nuts are manufactured to a different ansi standard,which covers diaphragm type gas displacement meters.sango points out that the threading of a gas meter nuts is straight as opposed to the npt tapered threading,specified by ansi standard,which precludes a gas meter nut from being threaded together with any pipe or pipe fitting.
sango argues that the essential characteristic of pipe fittings is that they join together two lengths of,or cap,a pipe.it further argues that the swivels do not connect to pipe,and that at most they connect to pipe fittings,which are not pipe.sango urges that the gas meter nut is even less susceptible to characterization as a pipe fitting.it is never used for connecting the bores of two or more pipes together.
sango asserts that these facts show commerce determination was not supported by substantial evidence.sango states that,in its scope ruling,commerce basically relied upon three considerations the gas meter swivels and nuts are manufactured from malleable iron using a casting process in china they are indisputably fittings and the products are neither grooved fittings nor compression couplings,which are expressly excluded from the scope of the order.pointing to the evidence just noted,however,sango argues that t here is no proof of record that gas meter sw
