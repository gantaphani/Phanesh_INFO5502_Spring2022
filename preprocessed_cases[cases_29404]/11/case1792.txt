introduction 
appellant hypertouch,filed an action alleging that valueclick,various valueclick subsidiaries and primaryads,respondents violated business professions code section,subdivision a which prohibits entities from advertising in a commercial electronic message that contains various types of deceptive content.respondents moved for summary judgment,arguing that appellant claims were preempted by the controlling the assault of pornography and marketing act of act,et.alternatively,respondents argued that appellant had failed to establish a triable issue of fact as to whether respondents had violated section,and any claim predicated on an received more than one year prior to the filing of the complaint was barred by the statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.
the trial court granted summary judgment,ruling that the act preempted appellant section claims.although the act expressly exempts from preemption state laws prohibiting falsity or deception in commercial,the court concluded this exemption was only intended to apply to state statutes that require a plaintiff to establish each element of common law fraud.the court entered judgment dismissing the case in its entirety and awarded respondents approximately in costs.
on appeal,appellant argues that the court erred in ruling that the act preempts claims arising under section.in addition,appellant argues that it introduced sufficient evidence to establish a triable issue of fact as to whether respondents violated section section claims are governed by the statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section,rather than the period described in section,subdivision a and the trial court abused its discretion in awarding respondents in costs.
we reverse the trial court grant of summary judgment,concluding that the act does not preempt appellant claims and that respondents have failed to satisfy their initial burden to produce evidence showing the nonexistence of any triable issue of fact with respect to whether they violated section.
factual and procedural background 
description of the partiesa.appellant hypertouch.
hypertouch,provides electronic mail service to approximately customers located inside and outside of california,including internet companies,corporations,charitable organizations and various people related to the president of hypertouch,joseph wagner.since its inception,hypertouch customers have received massive quantities of unsolicited commercial,commonly referred to as spam.some hypertouch users have complained about their spam load and the difficulties that it causes them.hypertouch alleges that it has been forced to spend a considerable amount of money on hardware and software as a direct result of the yearly increasing onslaught of spam.
respondent valueclick,and its subsidiaries 
valueclick and its subsidiaries collectively valueclick provide online marketing services to advertisers who promote retail products.valueclick contracts with these advertisers to place promotional offers on websites that are owned and operated by various valueclick entities.consumers,in turn,can visit valueclick websites and earn rewards in exchange for participating in the advertised promotional offers.
valueclick contracts with thousands of independent affiliates to drive traffic to their websites through placements and other forms of advertising.valueclick provides affiliates with the creative material associated with any given promotion.the affiliates,in turn,send out commercial advertisements that include a link redirecting the consumer to a promotion on valueclick websites.in many cases,the affiliates hire to conduct the.normally,each advertisement contains a tracking code indicating the affiliate or responsible for driving the consumer to valueclick website.if a consumer clicks through an advertisement and participates in a promotional offer,the affiliate or who sent the initial is then compensated for generating a customer lead.
as a result of its business model,valueclick has no knowledge of,or control over,the delivery methods or header information used by affiliates or their.
respondent primaryads.
respondent primaryads,is an online marketing service that owns and operates a private website containing creative content associated with numerous promotional offers.primaryads contracts with a network of independent affiliates who download advertisement materials from primaryads website and utilize the advertisements in commercial.
when an affiliate places downloaded creative material in an consumers may click on a link in the,which directs them to the primaryads website and then immediately redirects them to the advertiser website which contains the promotional offer primaryads,in turn,tracks which affiliate is responsible for driving traffic to the advertiser offer page.if the consumer participates in the promotional offer,a tracking link notifies primaryads,and the affiliate receives a commission.primaryads is compensated by the advertiser each time a consumer participates in an offer.
before providing access to its private website and allowing affiliates to its advertising materials,primaryads requires each affiliate to sign a contract prohibiting it from issuing spam or violating any laws.like valueclick,primaryads alleges that it has no control over the delivery methods used by affiliates.
ii.hypertouch complaint and the trial court proceedings 
on april,hypertouch filed a complaint against valueclick,numerous valueclick subsidiaries and primaryads collectively respondents alleging that,between april,and the date the action was filed,respondents had advertised in over received by hypertouch customers that contained deceptive header information in violation of section.the complaint also included a separate cause of action alleging respondents had violated section.
during discovery,hypertouch produced thousands of that allegedly contained links to respondents promotional offers.according to hypertouch,each also contained one of three categories of deceptive header information that violated section.first,hypertouch alleged that numerous contained falsified header information because the from or to fields did not accurately reflect the identity of the sender or recipient of the.second,hypertouch alleged that the subject lines of many contained statements likely to mislead recipients into believing that they could obtain a free gift when,in fact,the gift could only be obtained by paying a fee or participating in additional promotional offers.finally,hypertouch alleged that some of the contained a domain name without the permission of the third party.
approximately months after the case was filed,valueclick filed a motion for summary judgment,which primaryads joined.valueclick argued that hypertouch section claims were preempted by the controlling the assault of pornography and marketing act of act,et,which contains a preemption clause barring any state statute that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages except any statute that prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of an,subd.b.valueclick argued that the exemption for state statutes prohibiting falsity or deception was only intended to permit state law claims based on all of the elements of common law fraud,including knowledge of falsity,intent to deceive,reliance and damages proximately caused by the misrepresentation.respondents further argued that because hypertouch had no evidence respondents actually knew about the alleged or that any hypertouch customer relied on or was harmed by the deceptive content in the,its claims were necessarily preempted.alternatively,valueclick argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because the allegedly deceptive content in the did not violate the substantive prohibitions described in section.
primaryads also filed a motion for summary judgment,which was accompanied by a motion for summary adjudication,raising two additional arguments.first,primaryads contended that section required the plaintiff to establish that the defendant actually sent or had knowledge of the unlawful,which hypertouch had failed to do.second,primaryads argued that,pursuant to code of civil procedure,section,it was entitled to summary adjudication on any claim predicated on an received more than one year prior to the filing of the action.
in its opposition,hypertouch conceded that it could not establish all of the elements associated with common law fraud,but argued that section only required evidence that respondents had advertised in containing any category of content prohibited by the statute.hypertouch also argued that section was not preempted by the act because it prohibited falsity and deception,and therefore fell within the narrow exception recognized in the federal statute preemption clause.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of valueclick and primaryads on all of hypertouch claims.the court first concluded that,under section,respondents could only be held liable for that they actually sent to hypertouch customers.it further concluded that hypertouch had only established that respondents sent of the at issue and,as a result,those were the only at issue in the suit.
the court next considered whether the act preempted hypertouch section claims and concluded that it did.the court agreed with respondents interpretation of the act,ruling that it barred any state laws regulating falsity or deception in commercial unless such claims are for common law fraud or deceit.the court further stated that plaintiff has not adduced evidence that any elements of fraud exist in this case e ven if the court ignores all the other elements of fraud,plaintiff complaint is preempted by federal law since plaintiff complaint omits intent to deceive or intent to cause deception.
the court entered judgment in favor of respondents and subsequently awarded respondents approximately in costs.hypertouch filed a timely appeal of the trial court judgment.
discussion 
this appeal raises three issues.first,we must determine whether the act preempts claims arising under section.because we conclude that section is not preempted,we must next determine whether hypertouch has established a triable issue of fact as to whether respondents violated section.third,we must determine whether primaryads is entitled to summary adjudication on any claim predicated on an that hypertouch received more than one year prior to the filing of the complaint.
standard of review 
the standard for deciding a summary judgment motion is,as is the standard of review on appeal.richard levine,higashi th.a defendant moving for summary judgment has the burden of producing evidence showing that one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.citation.the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to produce specific facts showing a triable issue as to the cause of action or the defense.citations.despite the shifting burdens of production,the defendant,as the moving party,always bears the ultimate burden of persuasion as to whether summary judgment is warranted.citations.garcia w w community development,th,garcia.
on appeal,we review de novo an order granting summary judgment.citation.the trial court must grant a summary judgment motion when the evidence shows that there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citations.in making this determination,courts view the evidence,including all reasonable inferences supported by that evidence,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.citations.garcia,supra,th at.
ii.hypertouch section claims are not preempted by the act 
a determination whether hypertouch claims are preempted by federal law requires an analysis of both section and the act.see generally gordon virtumundo cir,virtumundo interpreting breadth of washington state statute before determining whether preemption applied.
overview of section and the act 
california business and professions code section overview of senate bill and section 
in,the california legislature passed senate bill,which imposed broad restrictions on advertising in unsolicited commercial advertisements sent from or to a computer within california.see,et according to the legislature findings and declarations,the bill was adopted to address the skyrocket ing costs and annoyance s associated with spam,which the statute defines as unsolicited commercial advertisements,subds.a e.the legislature concluded that,to effectively regulate the abuses associated with spam,it was necessary to target not only the entities that send unsolicited commercial advertisements,but also the advertisers whose products and services are promoted in those 
many spammers have become so adept at masking their tracks that they are rarely found there is a need to regulate the advertisers who use spam,as well as the actual spammers,because the actual spammers can be difficult to track down the true beneficiaries of spam are the advertisers who benefit from the marketing derived from the advertisements.
subds.i,j and k.
although includes a provision that prohibits the transmission of any unsolicited commercial advertisement s,see,the statute also prohibits certain deceptive practices in commercial,which are enumerated in section,subdivision a 
a it is unlawful for any person or entity to advertise in a commercial advertisement either sent from california or sent to a california electronic mail address under any of the following circumstances 
the advertisement contains or is accompanied by a domain name without the permission of the third party.
the advertisement contains or is accompanied by falsified,misrepresented,or forged header information 
the advertisement has a subject line that a person knows would be likely to mislead a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message.
section,subdivision b,in turn,contains an enforcement provision that permits the attorney general,an electronic mail service provider or a recipient of an unsolicited commercial advertisement to bring an action against a person or entity that violates any provision of this section,subds.b a i iii.
section,subdivision b also lists the remedies available under the statute,which include either or both of the following actual damages.ii.liquidated damages of one thousand dollars for each unsolicited commercial advertisement transmitted in violation of this section,up to one million dollars per incident,subds.b b.the statute further provides,however,that if the court finds the defendant established and implemented,with due care,practices and procedures reasonably designed to effectively prevent unsolicited commercial advertisements that are in violation of this section,the court shall reduce the liquidated damages to a maximum of one hundred dollars for each unsolicited commercial advertisement,or a maximum of one hundred thousand dollars per incident,subd.b.
section does not include many elements associated with traditional common law fraud 
like several other california consumer protection statutes targeting deceptive advertising practices,section dispenses with many of the elements associated with common law fraud,which normally requires the plaintiff to prove a a misrepresentation b knowledge of falsity or scienter c intent to defraud,to induce reliance d justifiable reliance and e resulting damage.lazar superior court cal th,see morgan v.at t wireless services,th,a claim based upon the fraudulent business practice prong of the section is distinct from common law fraud.a common law fraudulent deception must be actually false,known to be false by the perpetrator and reasonably relied upon by a victim who incurs damages.none of these elements are required to state a claim for relief under section.section differs from common law fraud in at least three ways.
section prohibits advertising in a deceptive commercial,rather than sending or initiating a deceptive 
first,unlike traditional common law fraud,section does not require the plaintiff to show that the defendant actually made a false or deceptive statement.perlas gmac mortgage,llc th,fraud claim requires plaintiff to establish defendant represented to the plaintiff that an important fact was true and that the representation was false.instead,section makes it unlawful for a person or entity to advertise in a commercial advertisement that contains any of the deceptive statements described in subdivisions a.thus,by its plain terms,the statute is not limited to entities that actually send or initiate a deceptive commercial,but applies more broadly to any entity that advertises in those.
other portions of the statute confirm that the legislature did not intend the statute to apply solely to those entities that actually send or initiate a deceptive.for example,the legislative findings in section state that t here is a need to regulate the advertisers who use spam because the actual spammers can be difficult to track down and have become adept at masking their tracks,subds.i,j.the legislature further concluded that regulating advertisers,rather than merely the senders of spam,was necessary because they are the true beneficiaries who benefit from the marketing derived from the spam advertisement,subd.k.
similar statements appear throughout the legislative history.see generally in re microsoft cases th,even when a statute is unambiguous,it is nevertheless common for a court to review legislative history in order to confirm its statutory analysis.for example,the assembly committee on the judiciary analysis of includes a statement summarizing the purpose of the statute t his bill will get at the real solution to unsolicited by allowing people to sue the advertisers of unsolicited.sb seeks to get to the heart of the matter by penalizing the actual advertiser of the spam we need to go after the companies that are profiting by these and allow recipients to hold the advertisers financially responsible.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.similarly,in a memo prepared for the senate business and professions committee,the author of explained that t he real problem lies with the actual businesses whose products are advertised through these.those companies are just as responsible if not more for these and need to be held accountable.they are profiting at the expense of the consumer.senate bus,background information sheet for sb,reg.sess.april,see also armijo miles th,fn.background information requests are a proper source for ascertaining legislative intent.
in sum,both the text and legislative history of make clear that section was intended to apply to entities that advertise in deceptive commercial,not only the spammers who send them.
ii.section does not contain a scienter element 
the second way in which section differs from traditional common law is that it does not include any scienter or intent requirement.specifically,the statute does not contain qualifying language such as knowingly or intentionally,which indicates the legislature did not intend guilty knowledge or intent to be elements of a violation.margarito state athletic com.th,in re marley cal d,see also khan medical board th,northern wind daley cir,as a general matter,scienter is not required to impose civil penalties for regulatory violations when the regulation is silent as to state of mind.thus,like other california statutes prohibiting false or misleading business practices,the statute makes an entity strictly liable for advertising in a commercial that violates the substantive provisions described in section,subdivision a regardless of whether the entity knew that such had been sent or had any intent to deceive the recipient.see generally paduano american honda motor,th,explaining that section imposes strict liability people ex rel.van de kamp cappuccio d.
although the legislature chose to impose liability without regard to knowledge or intent,the statute remedy provisions include a mechanism that allows a defendant to significantly reduce its liability if it can show that it adopted practices and procedures reasonably designed to effectively prevent unsolicited commercial advertisement that are in violation of section,subd.b.if the defendant makes such a showing,the trial court is required to reduce liquidated damages to a maximum of per or per incident.thus,rather than facing mandatory liquidated damages of per or per incident see,subd.b b ii,an entity that violates the statute despite its good faith effort to prevent deceptive commercial might only be subject to nominal liquidated damages.see the tjx companies,inc superior court th,tjx companies statute imposing maximum penalty of provided trial court discretion to impose range of penalties that could span between a penny to the maximum amounts authorized by the statute.
iii.section does not require reliance or damages 
finally,section differs from common law fraud in that it does not require the plaintiff to prove that it relied on the deceptive commercial message or that it incurred damages as a result of the deceptive message.see asis internet servs.consumerbargaingiveaways,d,consumerbargaingiveaways section a does not purport to require reliance or actual damages.
overview of the act 
summary of the act substantive provisions 
shortly after california adopted,congress enacted the act,which,like,was passed in response to mounting concerns associated with the rapid growth of spam.virtumundo,supra,at.the act does not ban spam outright,but rather provides a code of conduct to regulate commercial messaging practices.stated in general terms,the act prohibits such practices as transmitting messages with deceptive subject headings or header information that is materially false or materially misleading.citation.the act also imposes requirements regarding content,format,and labeling.for instance,unsolicited messages must include the sender physical postal address,indicate they are advertisements or solicitations,and notify recipients of their ability to decline further mailings.citation.id.at.
the act enforcement provision empowers the federal trade commission,state attorneys general,and other state and federal agencies to pursue legal actions to enforce the act congress also provided a limited private right of action,which states a provider of internet access service adversely affected by a violation of the prohibited acts may bring a civil action in any district court to enjoin further violation by a defendant or to recover either actual or statutory damages,whichever is greater.virtumundo,supra,at.thus,unlike section,the act only provides a private cause of action to internet service providers that have been adversely affected by prohibited commercial and does not extend a cause of action to the recipients of such.
the substantive provisions of the act prohibit any person from initiat ing the transmission of any commercial containing header information that is materially false or materially misleading or a subject heading that is likely to mislead a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message,subds.a.the act requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant acted with knowledge and intent in some instances,but not others.for example,government entities seeking injunctive relief are not required to prove the defendant state of mind,subds.e,f.internet service providers and state government agents seeking damages,however,must generally prove that the defendant acted with actual knowledge or consciously avoided knowledge of the statutory violations,subds.f,g.
b.the act preemption provision 
the act includes a provision that expressly preempts state statutes that regulate the use of commercial except to the extent that any such statute prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial,subd.b.the preemption clause reflects one of the primary goals of the act to regulate commercial electronic mail on a nationwide basis,subd.b.as stated in the congressional findings accompanying the act,the federal statute was intended to to implement one national standard citation regarding the content of commercial because the patchwork of state laws had proven ineffective.virtumundo,supra,at.
the legislative history also makes clear,however,that the act preemption provision was largely intended to target state statutes imposing content requirements on commercial,while leaving states free to regulate the use of deceptive practices in commercial in whatever manner they chose.for example,the senate report that accompanied the legislation states 
the act supersede s state and local statutes that expressly regulate the use of to send commercial messages except for statutes that target fraud or deception in such.thus,a state law requiring some or all commercial to carry specific types of labels,or to follow a certain format or contain specified content,would be preempted.by contrast,a state law prohibiting fraudulent or deceptive headers,subject lines,or content in commercial would not be preempted i n contrast to telephone numbers,addresses do not reveal the state where the holder is located.as a result,a sender of has no easy way to determine with which state law to comply.statutes that prohibit fraud and deception in do not raise the same concern,because they target behavior that a legitimate business trying to comply with relevant laws would not be engaging in anyway.
b.the act does not preempt claims arising under section 
the trial court concluded that the act savings clause,which permits states to regulate falsity or deception in a commercial,only applies to state statutes that require the plaintiff to establish every element of common law fraud.for the reasons that follow,we disagree with the trial court interpretation of the act and hold that the federal statute does not preempt state laws claims arising under section.
general principles governing preemption 
under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution art.vi,cl,congress has the power to preempt state law concerning matters that lie within the authority of congress.citation.in determining whether federal law preempts state law,a court task is to discern congressional intent.farm raised salmon cases cal th,farm raised salmon.congress may indicate intent through a statute express language or through its structure and purpose.citation.if a federal law contains an express clause,it does not immediately end the inquiry because the question of the substance and scope of congress displacement of state law still remains.altria group,good,altria.
although the analysis of the scope of preemption begins with the text,interpretation of that language does not occur in a contextual vacuum.citation.rather,this inquiry is guided by two principles about the nature of preemption.first,there is a presumption against supplanting the historic police powers of the states by federal legislation unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.citation.virtumundo,supra,at.this presumption against preemption applies with particular force in the context of consumer protection laws that regulate the prevention of deceptive sales practices.farm raised salmon,supra,cal th at.as a result,we must give the express preemption clause a narrow interpretation,virtumundo,supra,at,and if the text is susceptible of more than one plausible reading,accept the reading that disfavors.citation.altria,supra.at.
second,the preemption analysis is guided by the comment that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.citations.as a result,any understanding of the scope of a statute must rest primarily on a fair understanding of congressional purpose,and calls for courts to consider not only the language of the statute itself but also the statutory framework surrounding it and the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole.citation.virtumundo,supra,at see also altria,supra.at.
it is with these principles in mind that we consider whether it was the clear and manifest purpose of congress citation to preclude states from regulating deceptive commercial messages in a manner that does not require proof of each and every element of common law fraud.farm raised salmon,supra,cal th at.
the language of the act does not support the trial court interpretation 
the preemption clause at issue states 
this act supersedes any statute,regulation,or rule of a state or political subdivision of a state that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages,except to the extent that any such statute,regulation,or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.
the savings clause does not reference either fraud or the common law,but rather permits any state law that prohibits falsity and deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message.asis internet services.suscriberbase cal.april,case sc dist.lexis,subscriberbase.as a result,the text of the statute betrays no intention by congress to limit state regulation to the simple codification of common law fraud in its purest form.id.at pp.congress is certainly familiar with the word fraud and choose not to use it the words falsity or deception suggest broader application.consumerbargaingiveaways,supra,d at.
other sections of the act indicate that the phrase falsity and deception was not intended to apply only to common law fraud.first,the provision that immediately follows section,subdivision b preemption clause states that,in addition to permitting state laws prohibiting falsity or deception in commercial,the act does not preempt state laws that are not specific to electronic mail,including tort law or other state laws to the extent that those laws relate to acts of fraud or computer crime,subds.b a and b.interpreting the phrase falsity or deception to mean fraud,when the very next section of the statute actually uses the word fraud,would contravene the principle that when different words are used in contemporaneously enacted,adjoining subdivisions of a statute,the inference is compelling that a difference in meaning was intended.citation.kleffman vonage holdings cal th,kleffman.
second,other provisions of the act use the word deceptive in association with section of the federal trade commission act,which is much broader than common law fraud.for example,section,subdivision a prohibits the use of deceptive subject headings,which is defined as a subject heading that would be likely to mislead a recipient consistent with the criteria used in enforcement of section of the ftc act.similarly,section,subdivision a clarifies that the act does not affect the federal trade commission authority to bring enforcement actions under the ftc act for materially false or deceptive representations.unlike common law fraud,to establish liability for deceptive statements under the ftc act n either proof of consumer reliance nor consumer injury is necessary to establish a violation.freecom communications,cir.i ntent to deceive is also not required.world travel vacation brokers,cir.the fact that other provisions of the act direct that the word deceptive should be understood not as referencing fraud but rather deception as utilized in the ftc act,consumerbargaingiveaways,supra,d at,is a strong indication that the word deception in the preemption clause was not intended to refer to common law fraud.see people crowson cal d,i t is generally presumed,in the absence of anything in the statute to the contrary,that a repeated phrase or word in a statute is used in the same sense throughout.citations.citation.overruled on other grounds by people guerro cal d.
reading the phrase falsity or deception as encompassing something broader than common law fraud also finds support in the legislative history.the senate report accompanying the legislation stated that the act would supersede state and local statutes that expressly regulate the use of to send commercial messages except for statutes that target fraud or deception in such a state law prohibiting fraudulent or deceptive headers,subject lines,or content in commercial would not be preempted,sess,wl,emphasis added.the report further explains that although the purpose of the act was to impose a single national standard on commercial content,the savings clause in the preemption provision reflected the legislature belief that statutes that prohibit fraud and deception in do not raise the same concern,because they target behavior that a legitimate business trying to comply with relevant laws would not be engaging in anyway.ibid.emphasis added.thus,in three separate instances,the report refers disjunctively to state law claims predicated on fraud or deception.the legislature use of the term deception would be redundant if not misleading if congress meant to limit state regulation solely to common law fraud.subscriberbase,supra,dist.lexis at.
finally,a review of the state laws in effect at the time congress enacted the act provides further support that the federal statute did not intend to save only those claims that were predicated on common law fraud.see hoang,cal.march,no.mmc dist.lexis.before the act was passed,section was one of several state statutes in existence that imposed liability for the use of deceptive commercial regardless of whether the recipient actually relied on,or was damaged by,those misrepresentations.see id.at pp.citing minnesota and washington state statutes see also.stat,c a b,subdivision a.generally,when interpreting a statute,courts presume that congress is aware of the legal context in which it is legislating.abrego dow chem.cir,see also albernaz united states,congress is predominantly a lawyer body,citation,and it is appropriate for us to assume that our elected representatives know the law.citation.we therefore must assume that,at the time the act was passed,congress was aware that many states imposed liability for deceptive commercial without requiring reliance or other elements of common law fraud.despite this knowledge,congress chose not to use the word fraud in the savings provision,thereby suggesting that it intended the phrase falsity or deception to have a broader application.
permitting state law claims that lack elements of common law fraud does not undermine the act national standard 
respondents argue that,regardless of the actual language of the preemption clause,permitting claims for misleading or deceptive statements in a commercial without requiring a plaintiff to establish scienter,reliance and proximate damages would frustrate the act central purpose,which was to impose a national standard for the content of commercial.see generally,virtumundo,supra,at we are compelled to adopt a reading of the preemption clause that conforms with the statute structure as a whole and the stated legislative purpose.
we agree that the act was intended to establish uniform standards for the content of commercial.the substantive provisions of the act make clear that this uniform standard includes prohibitions on the use of materially false or materially misleading header information,as well as deceptive subject lines that are likely to mislead the recipient of a commercial.virtumundo,supra,at the act prohibits only deceptive subject line headings or materially false or materially misleading header information.citation.significantly,congress intended this standard to regulate commercial messaging practices on a nationwide basis.citation.see also,subds.a.the justification for the act preemptive effect,in turn,is to prevent state and local lawmakers from manipulat ing that standard by broadening the scope of content that might subject a defendant to liability.virtumundo,supra,at.
the fact that california imposes liability for containing deceptive header information without requiring the traditional elements of fraud does not alter the uniform standard governing commercial content established under the act.the elements of reliance and damages,for example,have nothing to do with the content of an.whether those elements are present in any case depends not on the substance of the or subject lines at issue,but rather upon the naiveté,vulnerability,or circumstance of the recipient.subscriberase,supra,dist.lexis at.similarly,imposing strict liability for advertising in commercial that contain materially deceptive content does not alter the type of content that might subject a defendant to liability.instead,it broadens the class of persons who may be held responsible for such content.
rather than broadening the scope of prohibited content in commercial,california decision to dispense with the elements of common law fraud was intended to create a more effective mechanism for eradicating the use of deceptive commercial.section seeks to accomplish this goal in two ways.first,the statute permits a recipient of a deceptive commercial to bring suit regardless of whether they were actually mislead or harmed by the deceptive message.this ensures that the use of deceptive will not go unpunished merely because it failed to mislead its targets.second,imposing strict liability on the advertisers who benefit from and are the ultimate cause of deceptive,forces those entities to take a more active role in supervising the complex web of affiliates who are promoting their products while the act establishes a national standard for the content of commercial,that standard is simply not altered or frustrated by allowing variation in laws governing who may bring suit or who those suits may be brought against.asis internet services.member source media,llc cal.april,no.emc dist.lexis,member source media.as one federal court recently explained,the authorized california to prohibit falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message,b,and it indicated no intent to limit the mechanisms that california may authorize to enforce such prohibitions.subscriberase,supra,dist.lexis at.
finally,although respondents contend that section frustrates the act by dispensing with the elements of reliance,proximate damages,or scienter,it overlooks the fact that,in many cases,the federal statute does not impose such requirements.for example,section,subdivision g permits a provider of internet access service ias adversely affected by commercial to bring an action for damages.the act does not require that the ias demonstrate that it,or any of its customers,relied on or was harmed by the deceptive content in the in addition,the act permits states to bring actions to enjoin the use of materially false or materially misleading header information without proving actual knowledge,subd.a.similarly,the federal trade commission and the states attorney generals may bring suit to enjoin the use of a subject heading that would be likely to mislead a recipient without proving state of mind,subd.a,subds.e,f.thus,even under the act,defendants may be subject to suit for deceptive subject lines and header information without regard to their knowledge or mental state,and regardless of whether anyone was actually deceived.
our holding is consistent with virtumundo gordon and omega world travel,mummagraphics 
respondents also argue that two federal circuit court decisions,virtumundo gordon,supra,and omega world travel,mummagraphics cir omega,have expressly held that the act preempts strict liability claims pertaining to false or deceptive commercial content.in respondents view,these cases stand for the proposition that the act preempts claims that do not impose a knowledge or intent requirement.
summary of omega and virtumundo 
in omega,supra,the fourth circuit considered whether the act preempted state claims for immaterial errors contained within the header of a commercial id.at.the court began its analysis by considering whether the term falsity,as used in the act savings clause,was intended to permit state law claims for any error or misstatement in a commercial.the court reasoned that because the term falsity had been paired with deception,it necessarily implied an element of tortiousness or wrongfulness,as in deceitfulness,untrustworthiness,faithlessness,id.at,which went beyond mere error.
the court then reviewed the structure and purpose of the act as a whole,and concluded that congress could not have intended,by way of the language,to allow states to enact laws that prohibit mere error or insignificant inaccuracies.virtumundo,supra,at discussing and analyzing omega,supra,at.specifically,the court noted that the act provided a private cause of action for header information that is materially false or materially misleading,suggesting that that congress only intended to target containing something more than an isolated error.omega,supra,at,emphasis in the original.in the court view,state laws providing a cause of action for bare error,id.at,in a commercial would necessarily frustrate this national standard.id.at.
in virtumundo,supra,the ninth circuit considered whether the act preempted a state law claim alleging that defendant sent commercial from domain names that obscure d the identity of the sender.id.at.the defendant,virtumundo,had sent the plaintiff commercial from several different domain names,including,and.id.at.plaintiff conceded that the domain names were properly registered to virtumundo,but argued that they fail ed to clearly identify virtumundo as the sender and therefore misrepresent or obscure the identity of the sender in violation of washington law.id.at.
like the omega court,the ninth circuit began its analysis by interpreting the meaning of the phrase falsity or deception as used in the act provision.after reviewing the text and history of the statute,the court agreed with omega conclusion that the phrase was not intended to permit states to to create liability for immaterial inaccuracies or omissions.virtumundo,supra,at.the court explained that the act specifically prohibited deceptive subject line heading or materially false or materially misleading header information and intended this standard to regulate commercial messaging practices on a nationwide basis.citation.id.at.in the court view,i t would be logically incongruous to conclude that congress endeavored to erect a uniform standard but simultaneously left states and local lawmakers free to manipulate that standard by imposing liability for inaccuracies that did not raise to the level of deception.id.at.
the court further concluded that,under its interpretation of the act,plaintiff claims for obscured domain names were necessarily preempted,explaining that t here is nothing inherently deceptive in virtumundo use of fanciful domain names.virtumundo,supra,at.as a result,plaintiff claims relate d to,at most,statements or omissions,id.at,and targeted activity that is not unfair or deceptive.id.at,fn.
b.our holding is consistent with virtumundo and omega 
neither virtumundo nor omega decided the issue presented here whether a state law that targets commercial containing deceptive content is preempted by the act because it does not require the plaintiff to establish all elements of a traditional fraud claim.see subscriberbase,supra,dist.lexis at pp.virtumundo and omega did not resolve whether the act spared section plaintiffs from pleading all of the elements of common law fraud consumerbargaingiveaways,supra,d at omega merely held that state laws were preempted insofar as they permitted claims for immaterial errors it did not hold that all elements of fraud were required or that any particular element other than materiality was required to survive preemption.instead,those cases held that the act forbids state statutes that reach practices in commercial,such as mere errors or immaterial misstatements.subscriberbase,supra,dist.lexis at.in other words,omega and virtumundo concluded that state statutes that broaden the scope of prohibited commercial content beyond the uniform standard established by the act are preempted.as explained above,california decision to remove the elements of common law fraud does not affect the type of statement that might subject a defendant to liability and,as a result,virtumundo and omega analysis are of limited relevance.
respondents disagree,arguing that omega specifically held that the act preempts state law claims imposing strict liability for deceptive content.omega,however,held that the federal statute preempts state law claims imposing strict liability for insignificant inaccuracies or errors.omega,supra,at.it did not hold that congress preempted state law claims that impose strict liability for commercial that contain materially deceptive content 
in sum,we conclude that the act savings clause applies to any state law that prohibits material falsity or material deception in a commercial regardless of whether such laws require plaintiff to prove and plead each and every element of common law fraud.we find nothing in the act suggesting that it was congress clear and manifest intention that the phrase falsity and deception should apply as narrowly as respondents suggest.virtumundo,supra,at altria,supra.at.
iii.respondents have not demonstrated an entitlement to summary adjudication concerning hypertouch section claim 
because the act does not preempt claims arising under section,we must review respondents alternative argument that summary judgment is appropriate because hypertouch failed to establish a triable issue of fact as to whether respondents violated section.respondents argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on hypertouch section claim for two reasons.first,they argue that hypertouch failed to establish that respondents sent or had any knowledge of the offending emails.second,respondents argue that the allegedly deceptive content of the did not violate the substantive prohibitions described in section.
a summary judgment may be granted only where it is shown that the entire action has no merit.code civ,subd.a.therefore,if there is a triable issue of fact regarding any portion of hypertouch section claim,summary judgment must be denied.
hypertouch is not required to demonstrate that respondents sent or had knowledge of the offending 
respondents first argue that summary judgment is appropriate because hypertouch has failed to identify any evidence establishing that respondents sent the at issue,or knew that an affiliate was sending advertisements containing content prohibited under section 
as discussed above,the plain text of section indicates that its application is not limited to entities that send the offending nor does it require plaintiff to establish that defendant had knowledge of such.rather,the statute imposes liability on any person or entity that advertise s in an containing any of the forms of deceptive content described in section,subdivisions a.the legislative findings make clear that the statute was specifically intended to apply to the advertisers who use spam,as well as the actual spammers because the actual spammers can be difficult to track down and the true beneficiaries of spam are the advertisers,subds.j,k.
therefore,for purposes of section,the relevant question is not whether hypertouch can demonstrate that respondents sent or had knowledge of the,but rather whether they advertised in those in this case,the evidence raises a triable issue of fact as to whether respondents advertised in some or all of the received by hypertouch.
the record demonstrates that the respondents market and advertise promotional offers.to increase participation in these offers,respondents contract with affiliates that send commercial containing links to the offers.if a consumer opens the,and ultimately chooses to participate in the promotional offer,respondents pay the affiliate a fee for generating a consumer lead.hypertouch evidence showed that at least some portion of the it received contained a link redirecting the consumer to respondents promotional materials.moreover,respondents admitted that thousands of these were sent by their affiliates.we believe this evidence is sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether respondents advertised in the at issue 
respondents have failed to carry their burden with respect to whether the content of the violated section 
respondents next contend that they are entitled to summary judgment because hypertouch has failed to establish a triable issue of fact as to whether the at issue in this suit contained content that violates the substantive prohibitions described in section,subdivision a.
hypertouch has asserted three different categories of section violations.first,it alleges that respondents violated section,subdivision a by advertising in that contained a third party domain name without the permission of the third party.second,it alleges that respondents violated section,subdivision a by advertising in that included fictitious names in the from and to fields.third,it alleges that respondents violated section,subdivision a by advertising in that contained false and misleading subject lines for the reasons that follow,we conclude that respondents have failed to satisfy their initial burden to produce evidence showing the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact as to whether they violated subdivision a see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,aguilar moving party has initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.
summary of alleged violations of section,subdivision a 
hypertouch has alleged that numerous at issue in this suit violate section,subdivision a,which prohibits the use of a subject line that a person knows would be likely to mislead a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances,about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message.hypertouch identified numerous that contain subject lines purportedly offering the recipient free products or merchandise.representative subject lines include get a free golf retreat to of destinations let us know your opinion and win a free gift card do you think hillary will win participate now for a visa gift card which would you choose win a free gift card for letting us know.hypertouch contends that,in fact,in order to procure such items the recipient was required to spend money or sign up for another offer of products or services promoted on respondents websites.
in support of these allegations,hypertouch president provided deposition testimony that,after receiving some of these,he clicked on a link that took him to a promotion page demonstrating that in order to receive the advertised free item you have to purchase from one these offers i do not recall ever seeing an offer for an incentive award that did not require a purchase or other obligation.
respondents have failed to satisfy their initial burden to produce evidence showing the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact 
respondents allege that they are entitled to summary judgment on hypertouch subdivision a claims for three reasons,all of which lack merit.
a.the language of subdivision a encompasses claims alleging the subject line is likely to mislead consumers about the terms and conditions of an offer 
first,respondents argue that to violate subdivision a an subject line must suggest that the contents of the will concern one topic,great to see you,suggesting a personal message,when in fact,the contents or subject matter of the message relate to an entirely different topic,an advertisement.respondents further contend that,in this case,the subject lines and corresponding advertisements in the at issue here concern precisely the same subject matter both promote incentive rewards for participating in the offers contain on promotional websites.in other words,respondents argue that subdivision a has no application where the subject line creates the false impression that the recipient may receive a free gift when,in fact,the contents of the reveal that is untrue.
we reject the respondents narrow reading of the statute.the plain text of the statute states it is unlawful to advertise in a commercial that has a subject line that would be likely to mislead a recipient about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message,subd.a.if a subject line creates the impression that the content of the will allow the recipient to obtain a free gift by doing one act such as opening the or participating in a single survey,and the content of the reveal that the gift can only be obtained by undertaking more onerous tasks such as paying money for the gift or agreeing to partake in other offers,the subject line is misleading about the contents of the.we find no merit in the respondents narrow interpretation of the statutory language.
respondents have failed to carry their initial burden to show that the terms of the offer were consistent with representations in the subject line 
respondents also argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because hypertouch has identified no evidence that individuals were required to pay anything to receive any promotional item offered.thus,respondents contend that hypertouch has failed to establish that consumers were actually required to pay money to obtain the free gift advertised in the subject line of the.this argument fails,however,because respondents have failed to carry their initial burden of production,as required under summary judgment procedures.
it is that,as the party moving for summary judgment,respondents had the initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.aguilar,supra,cal th at.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.id.at.to satisfy its initial burden,a defendant must present evidence and not simply point out that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.id.at.the defendant may satisfy this requirement in one of two ways first,it may present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff cause of action.id.at.in the alternative,defendant may present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing.ibid.
in this case,respondents have pointed to no evidence in the record,such as a declaration or deposition testimony,demonstrating that the offers at issue did not require participants to provide money to obtain the free gift referenced in the subject line.instead,its brief cites to two pieces of evidence that,in its estimation,demonstrate hypertouch does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,evidence that individuals were required to pay anything to receive any promotional item offered.the first piece of evidence is an admission by hypertouch that n either plaintiff or any of its end users ever attempted to participate in these offers.this admission,however,only demonstrates that hypertouch never actually tried to fulfill whatever requirements were necessary to obtain a free gift.it does not demonstrate that the terms of those offers did not require the participant to pay a fee to obtain the advertised gift.
the second piece of evidence respondents cite is deposition testimony in which hypertouch president stated that he could not recall whether consumers could obtain the incentive reward identified in the subject line if they participated in the corresponding offer.again,this evidence does not establish that the terms of the offer permitted the consumer to obtain a free gift without paying a fee.rather,the statement only indicates that hypertouch was unaware whether a consumer could obtain the advertised gift if it actually fulfilled whatever terms were required.
because respondents have identified no evidence negating hypertouch allegation that individuals were actually required to pay money to obtain the free gifts referenced in the subject line of the,it has not carried its initial burden.
respondents have failed to carry their initial burden to show that the subject lines were not likely to mislead 
finally,respondents argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on hypertouch subdivision a claim because the subject lines at issue are not likely to mislead the recipient.
the likely to mislead language in section,subdivision a is virtually identical to the standard that is used in applying other consumer protection laws that target false or deceptive advertisements,including section and.kleffman,supra,cal th at the language in section,subdivision a is virtually identical to the language that,only months before section passage,a california appellate court announced for applying section and.it is that whether a statement is likely to deceive a reasonable consumer is generally a question of fact.linear technology applied materials,th,consumer advocates echostar satellite th.t he primary evidence in such cases is the advertising itself.brockey moore th.therefore,to establish summary judgment,respondents must establish that no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that any of the subject lines were likely to mislead a recipient,acting reasonably under the circumstances.
the numerous subject lines at issue in this suit contain a wide variety of different statements.some simply state that the recipient of the can get a free gift get a gift card free get a free golf retreat to of destinations,others suggest that the recipient can obtain something free for doing a particular task let us know your opinion and win a free gift card do you think hillary will win participate now for a visa gift card,while still others contain a variety of phrases that might indicate to the recipient that there are terms and conditions that must be fulfilled to obtain the gift let us buy you a designer department store gift card.participate now participate to receive a holiday iphone see offer for details.
respondents have made no effort to explain why a reasonable trier of fact could not conclude that many of the subject lines at issue here,such as those offering a free gift card with no qualifying language,would be likely to mislead a reasonable person.instead,it targets isolated in the record,such as one with the subject line gap promotion,and argues that those particular are,as a matter of law,not deceptive.regardless of whether respondent is correct that the isolated it cites are not likely to mislead the recipient,that alone does not entitle it to summary judgment on hypertouch subdivision a claim,which includes many other subject lines that respondents do not address.
iv.respondents are not entitled to summary adjudication based on the statute of limitations 
finally,primaryads argues that,pursuant to civil code of procedure section,subdivision a,which prescribes a limitations period for a n action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture,it is entitled to summary adjudication on any claim that is predicated on an received more than one year prior to the filing of this action.hypertouch disagrees,arguing that claims arising under section are governed by code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,which prescribes a limitations period for an action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.
section,subdivision b b provides that a person or entity bringing an action for claims arising under the section may recover either or both of the following 
i actual damages 
ii liquidated damages of one thousand dollars for each unsolicited commercial advertisement transmitted in violation of this section,up to one million dollars per incident 
hypertouch complaint,in turn,seeks recovery under both provisions.
in mts,d,the court analyzed whether code of civil procedure section section applied in the context of a statutory scheme that,like section,contains independent provisions for recovery of actual damages and statutory damages.the plaintiff in.asserted violations of the unfair practices act,et,which provides for the award of actual damages in one section,and treble damages in another section.both forms of recovery are required if a violation of the the act is established,supra,d at.in other words,the act does not require a plaintiff to make any additional showing to obtain treble damages such damages attach upon establishing a statutory violation.
the appellant argued that,under the statutory scheme,a statute of limitation applied the period in section to the claim for treble damages,and the period in civil code of procedure section to the recovery of actual damages,supra,d at.the court agreed,concluding that different statute of limitations may apply where plaintiff seeks actual and treble damages based upon separate statutes contained within the same act.id.at.the court further concluded that,for the purposes of the unfair practices act,a different statute of limitations did apply to recovery of actual damages versus recovery of treble damages 
appellants claim compensatory damages pursuant to section,and request trebling of those damages in accordance with section.since these claims are patently severable,and the actual damages are not in the nature of a penalty or forfeiture,we conclude that appellants are entitled to recover all actual damages which accrued within three years of the filing of the complaint,and that all of such damages which accrued within one year prior to the filing of the complaint may be trebled under section.
in menefee ostawari d menefee,the court approved analytical framework,explaining that c ertain statutory schemes contain separate,independent statutory provisions for recovery of actual damages and treble damages.citation.in such case,a claim for actual damages under one statute will be governed by a different statute of limitations than section,subdivision,which will govern the claim for treble damages.id.at see also ashland oil union oil,ashland oil applying california law and reaching same conclusion.
based on the holdings in and menefee,we must independently assess the appropriate statute of limitations applicable to section,subdivision b b i,which permits the plaintiff to recover actual damages,and subdivision b b ii,which permits the plaintiff to recover liquidated damages in the amount of per or per incident.section shares essentially the same structure as the statutory provisions at issue in first,a plaintiff that elects to seek both actual and liquidated damages is entitled to both forms of recovery if it establishes a statutory violation,supra,d at unfair practices act requires award of actual and treble damages if a violation of the the act is established.second,claims seeking actual versus liquidated damages are patently severable,id.at,as evidenced by the fact that the plaintiff may elect to seek either or both forms of recovery,subd.b b.
under framework,we conclude that hypertouch claim for actual damages under subdivision b b i,which is clearly not in the nature of a penalty or forfeiture,is controlled by the limitations period described in section,subdivision a.thus,hypertouch may pursue actual damages for any it received three years prior to the filing of its complaint.
we next construe the proper statute of limitations applicable to hypertouch claims for liquidated damages under subdivision b b ii.the settled rule in california is that statutes which provide for damages that are in addition to actual losses incurred,menefee,supra,d at,or not based upon actual injury,montalti catanzariti d,are generally considered penal in nature citations,and thus governed by the period of limitations stated in section,subdivision.citation.menefee,supra,d at.however,section does not apply if the award of a penalty is discretionary,rather than mandatory.see generally jensen bmw of north america,th,jensen code of civil procedure section,subdivision,applies only where the penalty is mandatory the key question is whether the penalty is mandatory or discretionary menefee,supra,d at.applying those principles here,we conclude that hypertouch claim for liquidated damages under section,subdivision b b ii is subject to section limitations period.
the liquidated damages described in section have several features indicating that they are penal in nature.first,section provides that liquidated damages are to be awarded in addition to actual losses.menefee,supra,d at statutes which provide for recovery of damages additional to actual losses incurred are considered penal in nature,supra,d at.the fact that the legislature allowed a plaintiff to recover either or both of actual damages and statutory damages indicates that the two kinds of damages are different and thus logically serve different purposes compensatory in the case of the former and penal in the case of the latter.phillips netblue,cal,case no.sc dist.lexis,netblue see also hypertouch,cir.july,case.lexis,finding liquidated damages provision to be penalty because they may be awarded in addition to actual damages.
second,nothing in the text of the statute indicates that the amount of the liquidated damages per or per in any way based on the actual injury suffered by the entity seeking redress.netblue,supra,dist.lexis.at pp.calculation of statutory damages under section,subdivision b b i is completely independent of any determination regarding actual damages,supra.lexis at an award of liquidated damages under b b ii has no relation to the amount of damages.indeed,the legislative history specifically states that the liquidated damages provision was intended to allow a plaintiff to recover more than its actual damages in addition to actual damages likely to be small in many such suits the bill permits the plaintiff to seek liquidated damages citation.netblue,supra,dist.lexis at citing ca,june.because the liquidated damages described in subdivision b b ii are awarded in addition to plaintiff actual damages,and their amount has no apparent connection to the injury suffered by the plaintiff,they are in the nature of a penalty.
hypertouch,however,contends that the award of liquidated damages is discretionary under the statute and therefore can not constitute a penalty within the meaning of section.see jensen,supra,th at code of civil procedure section,subdivision,applies only where the penalty is mandatory.it offers two arguments in support of its position.first,hypertouch contends that liquidated damages are not mandatory because section,subdivision b requires the trial court to reduce liquidated damages to a maximum of per or per incident if it finds the defendant established and implemented practices and procedures reasonably designed to effectively prevent advertisements that are in violation of the statute.in hypertouch view,this safety valve provision effectively renders the imposition of penalties discretionary.
in tjx companies,supra,th,the appellate court considered and rejected a similar argument.the specific issue presented in tjx companies was whether claims arising under a statute that required the court to impose a civil penalty not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars for the first violation and one thousand dollars for each subsequent violation was a penalty within the meaning of section.see id.at.plaintiff argued that because the court could choose any penalty amount up the statutory maximums,the penalty was discretionary.
the appellate court disagreed,explaining that the statute did not provide the trial court discretion to decide whether or not to impose penalties.instead,the statute only provided the court discretion in determining the amount of the penalty assessment.tjx companies,supra,th at.the court further noted that although the amount of the penalty could p resumably span between a penny or even the proverbial peppercorn we all encountered in law school to the maximum amounts authorized by the statute,the imposition of some penalty was still mandatory.id.at.
in this case,the language of section,subdivision b can not be meaningfully differentiated from the statute at issue in tjx companies.the subdivision requires the court to reduce the liquidated damages to a maximum of per or per incident.therefore,although the trial court is required to reduce liquidated damages,even to a nominal amount,nothing in the subdivision suggests that the court is permitted to dispense with penalties altogether.
additionally,hypertouch argues that liquidated damages are discretionary,rather than mandatory,because the plaintiff has the option to choose whether to allege a claim for liquidated damages.this exact argument has been raised by hypertouch in other proceedings and rejected hypertouch argument misses the point if,as here,the plaintiff does allege such claim and,further,is able to establish a violation of a,an award of liquidated damages is mandatory.hypertouch azoogle.com,cal.march,case no.mmc u.dist.lexis,fn.affirmed by,supra.lexis,we agree with the district court that hypertouch claims for liquidated damages under section b b ii were subject to section a statute of limitations.
hypertouch argument also fails to consider why our courts have held that discretionary,as opposed to mandatory,penalties are not subject to a limitations period if the limitations period applied to discretionary penalties,a plaintiff would be placed in the untenable position of being unable to determine the applicable statute of limitations until after trial,when the court determined whether to allow up to such damages.jensen,supra,th at see also holland nelson d.those concerns are not present where the plaintiff is permitted to choose at the outset whether to pursue penalties that are ultimately mandatory if a violation is shown.
in sum,hypertouch may seek actual damages for any it received within three years prior to the filing of the complaint and liquidated damages for any received within one year prior to the filing of the complaint.although section limits the type of recovery that hypertouch may seek for received more than one year prior to the filing of this action,it does not bar hypertouch claims on those altogether.as a result,primaryads is not entitled to summary adjudication 
disposition 
we reverse the trial court grant of summary judgment,vacate its award of costs and remand for further proceedings consistent with this ruling.
all further statutory references are to the business and professions code,unless otherwise indicated.
the record is unclear whether primaryads actually owns and operates any websites that contain promotional offers or simply contracts with advertisers to drive consumers through the use of affiliates to promotional web pages owned by the advertisers.
the same standards apply to motions for summary adjudication.see haney aramark uniform services,th.
the term spam originated as the trademark name for a canned meat product manufactured by hormel foods corporation.citation.the connotation has its roots in a popular sketch by the british comedy troupe monty python flying circus,in which the word spam is repeated to the point of absurdity.citations.a waitress recites menu items,which,to the restaurant patrons dismay,involve increasingly repetitive mention of spam,only to be periodically interrupted by a group of vikings chanting a chorus about spam until normal dialogue is impossible.citation.thus,in the context of the internet,spam has come to symbolize unwanted,and perhaps annoying,repetitious behavior that drowns out ordinary discourse.virtumundo,supra,at,fn.
we recognize that section,subdivision c imposes criminal penalties for violating the statute substantive prohibitions.the california supreme court has held that if a criminal statute imposes substantial penalties,there is a presumption against criminal liability without mental fault or negligence,rebuttable only by compelling evidence of legislative intent to dispense with mens rea entirely.in re jorge cal th,citing penal code.regardless of whether subdivision c imposes a mens rea requirement for criminal violations of section an issue we need not resolve here,that does not alter the fact that,for purposes of civil liability,the statute does not require such a showing.see generally people forest olson,d,rejecting defendant argument that civil provisions of section should be read narrowly because statute also includes criminal provision.moreover,the legislature added subdivision c two years after the original version of the law,which only provided for civil liability,was passed.as a result,subdivision c does not demonstrate that the legislature intended the civil provisions to include a scienter element.
in addition,for violations of section,subdivision a,the plaintiff need not prove actual falsity,but only that the offending statement was likely to mislead the recipient.see,subd.a.
the ninth circuit has interpreted the term adversely affected as limiting standing to bona fide internet service providers who have experienced harm from spam that is both real and of the type uniquely experienced by isps,and not simply the ordinary inconveniences experienced by consumers and end users.virtumundo,supra,at.illustrative harms include the cost of investing in new equipment to increase capacity and customer service personnel to deal with increased subscriber complaints and maintaining filtering systems and other technology on their networks to reduc
