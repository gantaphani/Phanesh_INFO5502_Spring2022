samuel aaron,aaron appeals from the decision of the united states court of international trade granting the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.samuel aaron,united states,d.int l trade.because the trial court lacked jurisdiction,we affirm.
background 
aaron is an importer of thai jewelry.until,certain imports from thailand and other developing countries had been eligible for a free rate of duty under the generalized system of preferences gsp program.on june,however,the gsp expired.between august,and october,aaron filed entries at the port of new york aaron entries.upon entry,aaron paid estimated duties to the united states bureau of customs and border protection customs.on october,congress reinstated the gsp and granted retroactive refunds for certain items that had been imported during the time in which the gsp had lapsed.however,aaron imports were not eligible for the retroactive gsp refunds provided for by the statute.
customs liquidated aaron entries on two separate dates,november,and december.customs liquidated the entries and refunded,with interest,the estimated duties that aaron had paid.on january,customs sent a memorandum to the port director instructing reliquidation of all funds that had been erroneously issued for certain thai imports.customs subsequently determined that aaron entries would need to be reliquidated.based upon the dates of liquidation,the periods during which customs could legally reliquidate aaron entries ended on february,and march,respectively 
on february,customs placed a document in a notebook or binder in room at the customhouse used by customs at the port of new york for making its bulletin notices of liquidation or reliquidation available to the public the bulletin notice.the bulletin notice was entitled bulletin notice of liquidation and contained six columns of information entry type,entry number,entry date,importer,importer number,and remarks.the remarks column for all of the entries on the bulletin notice stated.that document is referred to as the bulletin notice by the parties because it was not generated by customs automated commercial system acs.the vast majority of bulletin notices at the port of new york consist of computer printouts generated by acs on a weekly basis.those notices,like the bulletin notice,are kept in room,but in binders separate from any notices.
during the week of april,customs ran a computer script that created an acs entry for aaron entries listed on the bulletin notice.on april,acs generated a bill for the increased duties due on aaron entries.on the same date that the bill was generated,customs placed an bulletin notice in a binder in room the acs bulletin notice.the acs bulletin notice was entitled bulletin notice of entries liquidated.it contained six columns of information type,filer,entry number,action,date of entry with importer name,and document filing location.the acs bulletin notice contained all but one of aaron entries that appeared in the bulletin notice.a reliquidation date of april,appeared on the acs bulletin notice.customs failed to or otherwise note on the acs bulletin notice that reliquidation had been made on another date,as it ordinarily would if reliquidation had occurred on a date other than the date shown on the notice of reliquidation.
aaron filed a protest on july,to dispute the increased duties.on august,customs denied that protest as untimely.aaron then filed a complaint in the court of international trade.
the court of international trade granted the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.the court explained that the linchpin issue was whether there had been a valid reliquidation of aaron entries on february.the court first determined that a final computation of duties,as required by,had occurred on february.next,the court found that the bulletin notice was legally sufficient.although the court found that the posting of the bulletin notice of reliquidation had been administratively sloppy,it also found that such sloppiness did not invalidate the notice.samuel aaron,d at.based on the fact that a reliquidation had occurred and valid notice had been posted,the court concluded that reliquidation of aaron entries occurred on february.aaron protest,filed on july,more than ninety days after the date of reliquidation,was therefore untimely,and the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.
aaron timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
this court reviews a dismissal by the court of international trade for lack of jurisdiction de novo.int l light metals united states.
on appeal,aaron argues that the court of international trade had jurisdiction to hear his protest because it was filed within ninety days of april,which aaron argues was the date on which reliquidation actually occurred.according to aaron,customs failed to compute or ascertain the duties due upon reliquidation on february,as required by,and therefore no reliquidation occurred on february.aaron further argues that the posting of the bulletin notice was legally insufficient under because it was not posted in a conspicuous place.furthermore,aaron argues that the bulletin notice was not legally valid because an electronic bulletin notice on customs form required by a and not provided until april.
the government responds that the court of international trade correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction because aaron failed to file a protest within ninety days of the february reliquidation.the government contends that customs completed the final computation of duties owed by aaron on or before february,thereby legally completing the reliquidation.the government also contends that the bulletin notice was posted in a conspicuous place at the customhouse.the government further argues that liquidation bulletin notices need not be posted electronically,nor must they contain the phrase customs form.
we agree with the government that the court of international trade correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear aaron appeal.as that court noted,the date of reliquidation is the linchpin issue of this case.customs has ninety days from the date of liquidation or the notice of liquidation in which to effect a reliquidation of merchandise already liquidated.when the imports in this case were liquidated,an importer had ninety days from the notice of reliquidation in which to file a protest,after which time the reliquidation was final and conclusive.a,c a.if reliquidation occurred on february,as the government argues,customs reliquidated the entries within the statutory window granted for voluntary reliquidations,and aaron protest was untimely.if,as aaron urges this court to find,the reliquidation did not occur until april,then aaron protest was timely filed,and the court of international trade had jurisdiction to hear his complaint.
thus,we must determine whether customs effected a legally valid reliquidation on february,and whether the bulletin notice was legally sufficient.
reliquidation on february,
liquidation is the final computation or ascertainment of the duties accruing on an entry.aaron claims that customs failed to compute or ascertain the duties owed by february.in support of that contention,aaron points to an entry that was included in the bulletin notice but was not included in the subsequent acs bulletin notice.the omission of that entry,aaron argues,demonstrates that the final computation of duties owed did not occur on february.aaron also claims that a small discrepancy between the duty amount refunded for one of aaron entries at the original liquidation and the amount billed for that entry on reliquidation demonstrates that the final duty amount was not computed by customs until april.
aaron arguments,however,are unpersuasive.the bulletin notice contained an entry dated after the october,reinstatement of the gsp that entry,therefore,was properly liquidated and never should have been reliquidated.the subsequent acs bulletin notice correctly omitted that entry as did aaron bill.aaron urges us to infer that the removal of the entry on the acs bulletin notice indicates that the final computation occurred some time between the issuanc
