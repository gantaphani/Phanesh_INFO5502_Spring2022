this case centers on a jurisdictional issue,namely,whether a dispute between plaintiff mazda motor of america,mazda,and one of its dealerships,real party in interest david phillips,phillips,should be resolved by the california new motor vehicle board the board or the courts.we agree with the trial court that this dispute is not within the limited jurisdictional scope of the board and therefore affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
mazda is a licensed motor vehicle distributor in california,and phillips is a licensed mazda dealer.
phillips entered into an agreement to sell its mazda dealership to a third party.the franchise agreement required mazda prior written consent,which shall not be unreasonably withheld,to transfer ownership of the phillips dealership.this contract provision parallels the statutory provisions of vehicle code section,subdivisions d and e.further undesignated statutory references are to the vehicle code.
under both the franchise agreement and statutory provisions,subd.d a,phillips was required to give mazda written notice of a transfer of the dealership.the statutory scheme makes it unlawful for a distributor to fail to notify the franchisee of approval or disapproval of the transfer within days after receiving notice and application for approval of the transfer,subd.d b.if the franchisee does not receive notice of disapproval within that time,the transfer is deemed approved.ibid.
phillips submitted an application to mazda for approval of the transfer.mazda disapproved the application,explaining why the transferee was not an acceptable dealer candidate to mazda.
controversy ensued.phillips contended that mazda disapproval notice was beyond the period,and therefore the transfer had to be deemed accepted.mazda countered that the application was incomplete until additional materials it requested had been received,which occurred less than days before it sent the disapproval notice.
phillips filed a petition with the board pursuant to section,subdivision c.this statute is central to the issues in this appeal,and we therefore set out its provisions in full.the statute states that the board shall c onsider any matter concerning the activities or practices of any person applying for or holding a license as a new motor vehicle dealer,manufacturer,manufacturer branch,distributor,distributor branch,or representative pursuant to chapter commencing with section of division of the vehicle code submitted by any person.a member of the board who is a new motor vehicle dealer may not participate in,hear,comment,advise other members on,or decide any matter considered by the board pursuant to this subdivision that involves a dispute between a franchisee and franchisor.after that consideration,the board may do any one,or any combination of,the following 
direct the department of motor vehicles dmv to conduct investigation of matters that the board deems reasonable,and make a written report on the results of the investigation to the board within the time specified by the board.
undertake to mediate,arbitrate,or otherwise resolve any honest difference of opinion or viewpoint existing between any member of the public and any new motor vehicle dealer,manufacturer,manufacturer branch,distributor branch,or representative.
order the dmv to exercise any and all authority or power that the department may have with respect to the issuance,renewal,refusal to renew,suspension,or revocation of the license of any new motor vehicle dealer,manufacturer,manufacturer branch,distributor,distributor branch,or representative as that license is required under chapter commencing with section of division.
in its petition to the board,phillips alleged that c ertain controversies and differences of opinion have arisen between petitioner and respondent,primarily relating to a change in ownership of the shares of petitioner corporate stock.citing various statutory provisions,phillips asserted four claims mazda disapproval of the transfer was given more than days after receipt of the information,and therefore the transfer must be deemed approved as a matter of law consent to the transfer was unreasonably withheld because of the delay in notifying the parties of the need for additional information consent to the transfer was unreasonably withheld because it was based on a plan to terminate the franchise if its present principal sought to transfer his interest and cease to be the active dealer and mazda refusal to consent to the transfer was unreasonable under all of the circumstances.
in its prayer for relief,phillips asked the board to hold a hearing to adjudicate matters involving the unlawful activities of respondent,and to determine that a the sale ha d been deemed approved by mazda by operation of law and that mazda refusal to recognize said automatic approval violates section b mazda refusal to consent to the transfer was unreasonable as a matter of law due to mazda delay and thus violates section c mazda refusal to consent also was unreasonable as a matter of law because it constitutes implementation of an illegal plan to phase out the dealership if transferred and thus violate d sections and and d mazda refusal further was unreasonable under all the facts and circumstances,and thus violate d section.
the petition also sought attorney fees and costs.
mazda filed a motion with the board to strike the petition on the grounds that attorney fees and costs can be awarded only by a court.see court may award damages,attorney fees,and injunctive relief.mazda also contended the board should exercise its discretion not to hear the petition,arguing that the superior court had jurisdiction to determine phillips claims and was a better forum for this dispute.in a supplemental brief,mazda contended the board did not have jurisdiction under section,subdivision c to resolve disputes between licensees,and cited this court decision in hardin oldsmobile new motor vehicle bd.th,d hardin.
phillips amended its petition to eliminate its request for attorney fees and costs.in opposition to the motion to strike,phillips contended,in part,that the board and the courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the type of claims asserted in the petition,and therefore the board was an appropriate forum.
the administrative law judge denied the motion to strike.the judge held,among other things,that hardin does not limit the board authority to hear petitioner claims with allegations based on sections and.petitioner claims are precisely the types of claims which this board has particular knowledge and expertise to hear.
mazda filed a petition for writ of mandate and prohibition in superior court,seeking to compel the board to set aside its order denying the motion to strike and to grant the motion.after a hearing,the court,relying on hardin,determined that t here is no statutory authority permitting the board to exercise jurisdiction over the matter at issue here a petition filed by a dealer against a asking the board to rule that the latter improperly refused its consent to a transfer of ownership.the court granted the petition,issuing a writ of mandate ordering the board to dismiss the petition and writ of prohibition requiring the board to decline jurisdiction to hear and to decide the claims raised in the petition.
the board and phillips appeal from the ensuing judgment.
discussion 
the trial court decision to grant phillips petition turned on its conclusion that there was no statutory basis for the board jurisdiction over a transfer dispute between a distributor and dealer.we review de novo a decision based on the interpretation of the scope of a statute.burden snowden cal th,d,beverly anderson th,d.
the board,phillips,and amicus curiae california motor car dealers association contend that section,subdivision c confers jurisdiction on the board to consider phillips claims,which assert violations of sections and that arise from a dispute between mazda,a distributor,and phillips,a dealer,over mazda refusal to consent to the transfer of a dealership.we disagree.
in determining legislative intent and a statute purposes,we look first to the statutory language,giving significance to ev
