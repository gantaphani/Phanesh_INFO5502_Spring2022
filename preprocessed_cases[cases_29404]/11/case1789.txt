martin hill and the alternative medicinal collective of covina defendants appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction prohibiting them from dispensing marijuana anywhere in the unincorporated area of los angeles county county without first obtaining the necessary licenses and permits required by county ordinances.defendants contend that the order granting the injunction should be reversed because the county ordinances regulating medical marijuana dispensaries mmd are preempted by state law,inconsistent with state law and unconstitutionally discriminate against mmd.we find no merit to any of these contentions and affirm the injunction.

facts and proceedings 
the county brought a nuisance action against defendants seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on the ground that defendants were operating an mmd in an unincorporated area of the county without having obtained a business license,a conditional use permit and a zoning variance to allow it to operate within a foot radius of a public library.
at the hearings on the county applications for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,defendants did not deny that they were operating an mmd next to a library without having applied for a license,conditional use permit or zoning variance.instead,they argued that these requirements were preempted by state law,inconsistent with state law and unconstitutional.
