this restitution action has its origin in mortgage refinancing loans acquired by chase manhattan mortgage corporation chase from the abbey financial corporation abbey.during the early,chase regularly purchased mortgage loans on the secondary mortgage market from independent mortgage companies such as abbey.at the time of the events in this case,chase had a contractual right to review abbey loans and buy those chase wanted.
in settling some of its loans,abbey employed as a closing agent the law firm of greenwald,greenwald powers the greenwald firm,the in this case.as a closing agent,the greenwald firm performed routine duties,such as title examinations and preparing paperwork for a closing.importantly,the greenwald firm received funds from abbey,placed them in escrow,and eventually disbursed those funds to various parties,including the holder of the previous mortgage on the property destined to be security for the refinanced loan.
on march,abbey closed a loan agreement with robert and mary stapleton the stapleton loan on march,abbey made a similar loan commitment to paul and kathleen sachse the sachse loan.because both loans were mortgage refinance loans,federal regulations designed to protect the borrower provided that the proceeds of the loans not be disbursed until at least three days after their respective closings.c pursuant to.shortly after the closings,the greenwald firm forwarded the borrowers promissory notes,the closing statements,and other documents to abbey.abbey,in turn,forwarded the promissory notes and closing statements to chase,which received the documents on march.on march,chase wired funds to abbey to purchase the stapleton and sachse loans.
on march and march,after the rescission periods had expired,the greenwald firm received two uncertified checks from abbey intended to satisfy the prior mortgages on the loans.the greenwald firm promptly deposited the checks totaling more than in an escrow account and recorded the mortgage deeds.then,without waiting for abbey checks to clear,the firm on march and respectively,issued checks on its escrow account one certified and one not to pay off the stapletons and sachses previous mortgages would otherwise have had priority over chase.the checks were sent by federal express.
on march,the greenwald firm received correspondence from abbey indicating that some of abbey previously issued checks might bounce.the greenwald firm then sought to stop payment on its own checks that relied on abbey funds,including those for the stapleton and sachse loans.although the greenwald firm was able to stop most payments,both the stapleton and sachse checks cleared before it could do so.the result was that the greenwald firm paid off the prior mortgages with its own money and chase,having already purchased the notes from abbey on march,held the loans with enhanced security.on april,abbey filed for bankruptcy.
in march,the greenwald firm filed suit against chase in massachusetts state court.although the complaint set forth a number of claims,the only claim that remains at issue on this appeal is one for unjust enrichment.chase removed the case to federal court and obtained summary judgment in its favor on all counts.on this appeal,the greenwald firm says that summary judgment for unjust enrichment should have been granted in its favor or,in the alternative,that factual issues precluded summary judgment for either side.
the district court gave two reasons for resolving the unjust enrichment claim in favor of chase first,the court said that while chase did hold the loans,chase paid for them and,consequently,a lthough defendant may be seen to have benefitted from plaintiffs mistake,it was not enriched thereby and certainly not unjustly enriched.the court also said that the unjust enrichment claim was defective for lack of any contractual or implied relationship that would lead to a duty to indemnify plaintiffs.we treat the first of these grounds as central the second appears to involve issues not up on appeal 
the underlying issue is an interesting and difficult one.taking the facts in the light most favorable to the greenwald firm,the party,banco popular de puerto rico,cir,the chronology of key events that frame the unjust enrichment issue goes as follows 
march chase receives notes and other loan documents.
march and the greenwald firm,having received uncertified checks from abbey,sends escrow account checks to prior mortgagees.
march chase wires funds to abbey to pay for the loan.
march the greenwald firm tries to stop its checks to prior mortgagees but they have already cleared.
in a nutshell,the greenwald firm paid off prior mortgages that burdened the properties that chase counted on as security for the stapleton and sachse refinance loans.without the greenwald firm payments to the prior mortgagees,chase would have been left with either worthless notes or at least notes with a lesser security interest.because abbey own checks to the greenwald firm bounced,the greenwald firm escrow account payments to the prior mortgagees did cause the greenwald firm an uncompensated loss and substantially benefitted chase 
if chase had paid abbey for the notes after the prior mortgagees had been paid,chase would have paid value for notes which had full value we will assume only because the greenwald firm had already paid off the prior mortgages.as a purchaser for value,chase equitable position would have been very strong,quite apart from its ability to invoke legal protections available to purchasers.it may have been this way of viewing the situation that led the district court to say that chase had not been enriched at all,let alone unjustly so.
the greenwald firm responds that chase had fully paid abbey for the sachse and stapleton notes before the firm involuntarily funded the mortgage payoffs of the prior loans.in other words,the greenwald firm says that chase had already paid its funds to an insolvent recipient abbey and held worthless or at least less valuable paper until the greenwald firm paid off the first mortgages.so viewed,the case looks more like one in which chase was enriched whether or not unjustly is a different matter.
chase claims that chase paid abbey for one of the loans after the greenwald firm had paid off the prior mortgage on that loan and that,as to the other loan,the record is unclear.the greenwald firm sent out its own checks to the prior mortgagees on march and chase wired its funds to abbey on march but the greenwald firm could probably have stopped payment on one of the checks the other was certified after chase wired the funds,and the checks probably did not clear until after chase had paid abbey.thus,we assume for the purpose of summary judgment that chase paid abbey for the loans or at least one of them before the greenwald firm paid off the mortgage.
with qualifications,this puts chase in the position or nearly so of one who receives a third party payment on a valid a debt on which the lender would otherwise not be able to collect from the insolvent debtor.the only difference is that the payments that benefitted chase were made to a third party the prior mortgagees rather than directly to chase.if the person who had paid off the loan had acted on a mistake of fact,he might seek restitution from the lender.would he win 
massachusetts courts commonly invoke the restatement of restitution,although they have not followed it slavishly the restatement has two different sections that hone in on this problem.one,section,deals with a bona fide purchaser for value and the other,section,concerns a creditor or lienor who benefits when the debt or lien is discharged by a third party who acts under a mistake as to his interests or duties.with qualifications not relevant here see note,below,both sections conclude that the beneficiary the acquirer in one case and the in the other need not make restitution the pertinent sections are reprinted in full in an appendix to this opinion.
section,dealing with discharges for value,is more clearly on point because its illustrations make it evident that the discharge of the antecedent debt is value.this is suggested by text and borne out by illustrations.th
