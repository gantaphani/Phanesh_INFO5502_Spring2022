factual and procedural history 
the district court opinion recites the facts in detail.oak harbor freight lines,sears roebuck,d.because the facts are uncontested,we rely on the district court findings.
oak harbor,a washington corporation and licensed motor carrier under the federal motor carrier safety act,provides intrastate and interstate freight transportation.sears is a new york corporation that,among other things,sells tools and appliances at wholesale and retail.nlc,an illinois corporation,is a licensed and registered property broker that arranges transportation by motor carrier under the authority of the federal motor carrier safety act.id.
nlc provided both brokerage and services for sears.as a part of its brokerage services,nlc arranged for oak harbor to move sears freight.see c brokerage or brokerage service is the arranging of transportation or the physical movement of a motor vehicle or of property.it can be performed on behalf of a motor carrier,consignor,or consignee.as a part of its services,nlc reviewed and audited oak harbor freight bills and collected funds from sears to pay those freight bills.see id.d service is all other service performed by a broker on behalf of a motor carrier,consignor,or consignee.
oak harbor hauled sears freight for a number of years without the use of an intermediary.in,sears hired nlc to perform brokerage services.at first,nlc was hired only to perform brokerage services for inbound or return shipments,which involved identifying carriers to move freight from sears vendors to sears warehouses.by early,sears expanded the scope of nlc responsibilities to include broker services for outbound shipments.the outbound brokerage services required nlc to identify carriers to move sears freight from sears warehouses to various freight transportation and delivery companies.
on january,oak harbor and nlc signed a national logistics corporation carrier contract carrier contract to govern their relationship.the carrier contract provided,in pertinent part 
this agreement between national logistics corporation broker shipper,operating under icc broker no.and oak harbor freight lines,carrier,mc engaged in the business of conducting the transportation of regulated commodities in interstate commerce over public highways,provides that national logistics corporation will offer a series of shipments to the carrier,which the carrier agrees to transport and carrier agree rates governing shipments will be established to meet the schedules verbally agreed upon and verbal agreement will be reduced to writing by carrier submitting its invoice to.shipper agrees to pay carrier within a predetermined time from date of receipt regardless whether or not has been paid for movement.this agreement shall be effective on the date it is signed and will remain in full force and effect from signing date for twelve months.agreement shall be automatically extended for successive twelve month terms or until canceled by either party by giving written notice to the other party at least thirty days prior to the date of termination.
emphasis added.in accordance with the terms of the carrier contract,oak harbor and nlc negotiated the rates governing the shipments on a roughly annual basis.other than with respect to rates,they never updated or replaced the carrier contract.
bills of lading were used for all of sears freight carried by oak harbor for return shipments,oak harbor generated the bills of lading return bills of lading or oak bills of lading using its standard,uniform straight bill of lading form.oak harbor designed its bills of lading to comply with industry standards.the return bills of lading designated sears as the consignee and were marked collect.in the bill to section of the return bills of lading,third party billing was written.
sears generated the bills of lading for outbound shipments outbound bills of lading or bills of lading.as with the oak bills of lading,sears designed its outbound bills of lading to comply with industry standards.on the bottom of the outbound bills of lading the following text appeared this document is tendered as an individual bill of lading.all terms and conditions of the straight bill of lading and applicable tariff and classifications in effect as of the date hereon apply.the outbound bills of lading read freight terms prepaid and instructed the carrier to send freight bills to nlc.these bills of lading did not identify the shipper or consignor,but they did contain entries under the categories ship from,consign to,and carrier.the ship from category identified a sears warehouse.the consign to category identified the destination of the shipment.the carrier category identified oak harbor.
in accordance with the terms of the bills of lading,billing and payment between the parties generally followed this pattern oak harbor sent nlc a billing invoice at least three days after oak harbor delivered the freight,and oak harbor expected to be paid by nlc within days of the date shown on the invoice after auditing the invoices,nlc billed sears weekly for the freight charges that had accumulated since the last billing date sears paid nlc about five days after receiving the bill from nlc and nlc paid oak harbor,with the funds received from sears,about days after nlc received oak harbor billing invoice.
in,oak harbor learned that sears would no longer use nlc as its broker as of january.in fact,sears terminated nlc services earlier,on november.by the end of november,oak harbor was owed more than for shipments of sears freight.on december,nlc sent oak harbor a letter recommending that oak harbor seek payment directly from sears.in response to inquiries by oak harbor concerning payment,sears denied liability and informed oak harbor that nlc was responsible for the freight charges.by the time oak harbor sought collection from sears,sears had paid to nlc for freight charges invoiced by oak harbor 
in early,oak harbor sued both nlc and sears in washington state court for monies due.sears timely removed the proceeding to federal district court pursuant to,and.
following for summary judgment,the district court held nlc and sears jointly and severally liable to oak harbor for in freight charges that were incurred in connection with the shipments arranged by nlc.oak harbor,d at.the district court also held that sears was entitled to recover in indemnity against nlc any portion of the that sears directly pays oak harbor.id.
in reaching its holdings,the district court explained that nlc was liable to oak harbor under the carrier contract.id.at.the district court did not premise sears liability,however,on the carrier contract.rather,the district court interpreted the bills of lading generated by sears and oak harbor as imposing liability on sears,which the carrier contract did not limit.id.at.in an issue of first impression within the ninth circuit,the district court followed the fourth,fifth,and eleventh circuits and adopted a rule that equitable estoppel does not bar sears liability for the already paid to nlc for freight shipments.id.at.
after the district court entered judgment,oak harbor moved for an award of prejudgment and interest.the district court held sears liable for prejudgment interest at the rate set by washington state law and for postjudgment interest at the rate set by federal law.
sears timely appealed.

discussion 
a.the district court correctly held sears liable for the charges incurred by oak harbor in shipping sears freight.
as we have noted,a bill of lading is the basic transportation contract between the and the carrier,the terms and conditions of which bind the shipper and all connecting carriers.pac.transp.commercial metals,d.in the absence of a statement to the contrary,when a bill of lading is intended to conform to the industry standard,by default the consignor remains primarily liable.id.at.in transportation brokerage darden restaurants,we explained the default terms and conditions of a standard bill of lading 
the bill of lading provides that the owner or consignee shall pay the freight and all other lawful charges upon the transported property and that the consignor remains liable to the carrier for all lawful charges.the bill of lading,however,also contains nonrecourse and prepaid provisions that,if marked by the parties,release the consignor and consignee from liability for the freight charges.if the nonrecourse clause is signed by the consignor and no provision is made for the payment of freight,delivery of the shipment to the consignee relieves the consignor of liability.similarly,when the prepaid provision on the bill of lading has been marked and the consignee has already paid its bill to the consignor,the consignee is not liable to the carrier for payment of the freight charges.

those default liability provisions can be modified by contract so as to make the liability allocation presumptions on the bill of lading unnecessary.id.at.for example,if parties enter into a contract before preparing a bill of lading,and there is an irreconcilable repugnancy between the prior written contract and the bills of lading,that conflict would have to be resolved in favor of the former.toyo kisen kaisha grace,cir.it is only where the parties fail to agree or where discriminatory practices are present that the bill of lading default terms bind the parties,at.in transportation,we held that a carrier had modified the default provisions of certain bills of lading and had waived liability when its employees signed a document,separate from the bills of lading,stating that the carrier would not seek payment from the shipper consignor.id.at.
here,the bills of lading used by the parties to ship sears the bills of lading for the outbound shipments and the oak bills of lading for the return designed to comply with industry standards.accordingly,they adopted the default terms of the uniform straight bill of lading under those default terms,the is liable for freight charges unless the bill of lading is marked nonrecourse.id.at.sears was the on the outbound bills of lading.its bills of lading did not include a nonrecourse clause.as a consequence,in the absence of a separate agreement,sears is liable for the freight charges on the outbound bills of lading.
similarly,under the default terms,a consignee is liable for freight charges unless the bill of lading is marked prepaid.id.sears was the consignee on the return bills of lading.because the bills of lading were marked collect not prepaid in the absence of a separate agreement,sears is liable for the freight charges on the return shipment bills of lading.in sum,in the absence of a separate agreement,sears is liable for oak harbor freight charges because of the default liability provisions that are part of the bills of lading.
although sears agrees with these general principles,it nevertheless contends that,for three reasons,it should not be required to pay the freight charges.first,sears argues that the carrier contract waives the default liability provisions of the bills of lading.second,sears argues that,if not a waiver,the carrier contract was the sole lawful contract governing the shipments,thereby rendering the bills of lading mere receipts.third,even if the carrier contract does not modify the default liability provision,sears argues that oak harbor is equitably estopped from collecting the freight charges from sears.we address each argument in turn.
the parties to a freight shipment generally are free to assign liability for the payment of freight charges through a contract separate from the bill of lading.louisville nashville cent.iron coal.such a contract may provide that the shipper agrees absolutely to pay the charges,or merely that he shall pay if the consignee does not pay,or that only the consignee shall be liable for the freight charges,or that both the shipper and the consignee may be made liable.id.it is only where the parties fail to agree or where discriminatory practices are present that the bill of lading default terms bind the parties,at emphases added.
sears contends that the carrier contract between oak harbor and nlc waived oak harbor recourse against sears under the default liability provisions of the bills of lading.although it is well established that a contract between the parties to a bill of shipper,the carrier,and the allocate liability for payment of freight charges,there is no support for the proposition that a contract with a broker,who is not a party to the bill of lading,can do the same.see louisville,at.looking to the promises,if any,made by the shipper to determine liability for payment of freight charges pac,at.the bill of lading is the basic transportation contract between the and the carrier,at the bill of lading provides that the owner or consignee shall pay the freight and that the consignor remains liable to the carrier.
sears cites no authority to support its proposition that a contract between a carrier and a broker can modify the default liability provisions of a bill of lading.in each of the two cases on which sears primarily relies,toyo kisen,and roll form products,all state trucking in re roll form products,cir,the contracts at issue were entered into between a carrier and the direct parties to the bill of shipper,consignor,or consignee.neither case involved a contract with a broker.
only oak harbor and nlc executed the carrier contract.sears was neither named in,nor a signatory to,that agreement.the carrier contract never mentions or refers to sears by name or description.the carrier contract makes no express or implied statements that sears will not pay oak harbor for the shipments,nor does the contract make any express or implied statements that oak harbor will not seek payment from sears.the carrier contract merely provides that nlc will be liable for freight charges regardless whether or not nlc is paid this agreement by nlc to be liable for the freight charges does not imply that sears is not liable.to hold as sears wishes would permit a shipper to insulate itself from liability for the payment of freight charges by the simple act of using a broker.we hold that the carrier contract did not alter sears liability for the freight charges under the bills of lading 
carrier lawful contract 
in the alternative,sears argues that the carrier contract was the sole lawful contract for the freight shipments and that the bills of lading were merely receipts.sears first notes that,in,when oak harbor and nlc executed the carrier contract,federal law required that oak harbor enter into a written agreement to charge rates.repealed june.oak harbor concedes that it intended the carrier contract to comply with that regulation.as a result,sears reasons,oak harbor and nlc intended that the carrier contract be the sole legal contract for shipments,thereby foreclosing the possibility that the bills of lading had any effect other than as receipts.
the former regulation that sears cites did not presume to control all aspects of a carriage agreement.rather,the regulation provided only that such agreements shall be in writing,shall provide for transportation for a particular shipper or shippers,shall be bilateral and impose specific obligations upon both carrier and shipper or shippers,and shall cover a series of shipments during a stated period of time.id.critically,the regulation did not require that the agreement be the exclusive contract for the carriage of goods.consequently,the regulation does not displace the default liability provisions for bills of lading,which we have discussed above.
sears also argues that the bills of lading could not function as contracts,because the carrier contract contains the price term for the shipments.in support,sears cites toyo kisen,in which we explained that,when there is irreconcilable repugnancy between the prior written contract and the bills of lading,that conflict would have to be resolved in favor of the former.toyo kisen kaisha,at.we found an irreconcilable repugnancy in toyo kisen because the oral and written agreements at issue provided that payment for disputed freight charges would occur only after delivery of the goods to hawaii,while the bill of lading provided that payment for the freight charges would occur whether or not the goods were delivered.id.at.
there is no such irreconcilable repugnancy between the carrier contract and the bills of lading in this case.they operate concurrently and in harmony to provide the key terms for sears freight shipments.the bills of lading contain no price terms,while the carrier contract determines the price for the shipments.the carrier contract does not address sears liability for payment of freight charges,while the default provisions in the bills of lading make sears liable.the bills of lading identify the shipper,consignor,and consignee describe where the goods are to be picked up and where they are to be delivered and contain the payment liability terms of prepaid or collect to the bills of lading,none of which the carrier contract provides.
in summary,the regulations under which oak harbor and nlc entered into the carrier contract did not require that the carrier contract constitute the sole agreement for the shipment of freight.in addition,the terms of the carrier contract and the terms of the bills of lading work in harmony to supply different aspects of the parties relationship we can give effect to both the carrier contract and the bills of lading as concurrent contracts for the carriage of sears freight.accordingly,we hold that the carrier contract did not constitute the sole legal agreement for the carriage of sears freight.
equitable estoppel 
sears further argues that it paid nlc for the majority of the freight charges at issue and that,as an innocent party,it should not be required to pay twice.in other words,sears contends that equitable estoppel should bar oak harbor collection of the freight charges from it.whether the shipper or the carrier bears the risk if a freight forwarder,broker,or consolidator fails to forward a freight payment,or if a consignee fails to forward a freight payment,is a question of first impression for this circuit.
in support of its position,sears relies primarily on the sixth circuit decision in olson distributing systems,glasurit america,cir.in that case,a motor carrier sought payment from a shipper for freight bills that the carrier had submitted to a freight forwarder.id.at.the shipper paid the freight forwarder,but the freight forwarder absconded with the money and never paid the carrier.id.although the bills of lading were marked prepaid,and the shipper did not sign the nonrecourse clause on the bills of lading,the sixth circuit held that the risk of loss should rest with the carrier.id.at.
the sixth circuit pointed to four critical facts in reaching its holding.first,the carrier provided the shipper with freight bills stating that the freight charges were to be paid to the freight forwarder,not the carrier.id.at.in other words,the carrier own bills indicated that the carrier should not expect payment from the shipper.id.second,the carrier did not diligently bill the freight forwarder for shipments,waiting until two to three months after the last delivery before sending any freight bills to the freight forwarder.id.at.third,the carrier violated credit regulations established by the interstate commerce commission which,had the carrier followed,would have allowed the carrier to identify that the freight forwarder was absconding with the money.id.at.finally,had the carrier notified the shipper sooner,the carrier could have limited its losses.id.the court concluded here,the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires that the loss fall on the carrier because its actions had the effect of lulling the shipper into believing that it was expecting and receiving payment from the freight forwarder.id.at.
we agree with the district court that olson is an outlier,the extreme facts of which bear little resemblance to what happened here oak harbor,d at.three of our sister fourth,fifth,and eleventh reached a conclusion at odds with olson on facts much closer to those before us.those courts have held that a shipper should bear the risk when it chooses to pay for freight charges through a broker rather than directly to the carrier.hawkspere shipping intamex,cir strachan shipping dresser,cir shipping of saudi arabia omni lines,cir.as noted by the district court,oak harbor,d at,the policy reasons for this result are persuasive.the fifth circuit wrote 
w e think that our result comports with economic reality.a freight forwarder provides a service.he sells his expertise and experience in booking and preparing cargo for shipment.he depends upon the fees paid by both shipper and carrier.he has few assets,and he books amounts of cargo far exceeding his net worth.carriers must expect payment will come from the shipper,although it may pass through the forwarder hands.while the carrier may extend credit to the forwarder,there is no economically rational motive for the carrier to release the shipper.the more parties that are liable,the greater the assurance for the carrier that he will be paid.
strachan,at.furthermore,as those courts have explained,the shipper,and not the carrier,is in the best position to avoid liability for double payment by dealing with a reputable freight forwarder,by contracting with the carrier to eliminate the shipper liability,or by simply paying the carrier directly.see shipping,at recommending using reputable freight forwarders or contracting to eliminate liability hawkspere,at recommending paying the carrier directly.
sears contends that southern pacific transportation supports its position.in southern pacific transportation,the court stated that double payment cases constitute their own category and stand against the placement of duplication of liability upon an innocent party.at.sears reliance is misplaced.in southern pacific transportation,the court refused to grant an estoppel defense to a because,among other reasons,a the shipper consignor was paid for the goods but the carrier was not paid for its services and b the,having failed to mark the bill of lading as nonrecourse,remained primarily liable for the freight charges.at.the court acknowledged that some cases applied equitable estoppel to bar recovery of freight charges by a carrier.id.at.but the court noted that those cases applied estoppel only in limited circumstances each and all of them involved a carrier misrepresentation,such as a false assertion of prepayment on the bill of lading,upon which a consignee detrimentally relied only to find itself later sued by the carrier for the same freight charges.id.carriers involved in misrepresentation constitute their own category and stand against the placement of duplication of liability upon an innocent party.id.
with respect to the outbound shipments as to which sears was,we agree with the district court that the hawkspere,strachan,and national shipping line of authority best applies to the facts of this case.sears generated the bills of lading and failed to protect itself with a nonrecourse
