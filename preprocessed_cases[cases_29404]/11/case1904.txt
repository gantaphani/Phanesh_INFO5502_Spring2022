introduction 
plaintiff and respondent the santa anita companies,santa anita brought an action against defendants and appellants westfield corporation,westfield america,santa anita fashion park lp and santa anita fashion park llc collectively westfield to reform grant deeds concerning,and to quiet title to,a acre parcel of real property in arcadia,california the property at issue,valued at about million,had been part of a acre parcel of real property owned by meditrust.in separate transactions in december,meditrust sold part of the acre parcel to santa anita and another part to westfield.meditrust and santa anita intended that the acre parcel be conveyed to santa anita as part of its purchase.instead,the acre parcel mistakenly was conveyed to westfield as part of its purchase.
after a court trial,the trial court found that meditrust and santa anita intended to include the acre parcel in santa anita purchase,the failure to include the parcel resulted from a mutual mistake of fact,meditrust and westfield had not intended to include the acre parcel in westfield purchase,westfield did not pay for or know that it had acquired the parcel,santa anita did not discover the mistake until june,and santa anita may action was not barred by the statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section,subdivision d westfield does not contest the trial court finding that the acre parcel was conveyed to it by mistake and appeals solely on the ground that the trial court erred in finding that santa anita action was not.
in affirming the judgment,we hold that there was substantial evidence supporting the trial court decision that the applicable period of limitations for santa anita action did not begin to run until santa anita discovered the mistaken conveyance in june and that santa anita did not fail to exercise reasonable diligence prior to that discovery.the erroneous description in the transfer documents is not necessarily a circumstance that would put a reasonable person on notice of the mistake to ascertain when the cause of action accrues for purposes of determining if that cause of action is barred by the applicable period of limitations.the three year statute of limitations applicable to causes of action for,subdivision d did not bar santa anita action.
background 
in november,meditrust,a healthcare real estate investment trust,acquired the fee interest in acres in arcadia,california.that property consisted of the santa anita racetrack for horse racing racetrack property an adjacent shopping mall,the santa anita fashion park mall property and a medical office building.included in this acquisition was a acre parcel that was the entrance to gate of the racetrack property gate parcel.meditrust had certain tax benefits through its ownership of this tract.less than a year later,around september,meditrust learned of changes in federal tax laws that would result in adverse tax consequences to it unless it sold the racetrack and mall properties by december.meditrust undertook to sell the properties.
santa anita purchase of the racetrack property 
on about october,frank stronach,chairman of the board of santa anita parent company,decided that santa anita would purchase the racetrack property.on october,a letter of intent was signed,and,thereafter,santa anita began its due diligence.the law firm of myers represented santa anita in the transaction.
in connection with the sale,meditrust retained ekn engineering ekn to survey the racetrack property.ekn employee patrick mercado,who had worked on prior surveys of the racetrack property,performed the survey.in his work on an earlier survey of the racetrack property in,mercado informed first american title company first american that a title report it supplied to him erroneously excluded the gate parcel from the legal description of the racetrack property and included it as part of the mall property.at the time of the earlier survey,mercado had asked first american to correct its error.in mercado experience,first american should have made the requested corrections in subsequent title reports,and he assumed,incorrectly,that first american made this requested correction.
during ekn preparation of its draft survey in connection with the sale of the racetrack property,first american provided ekn with a legal description that included its uncorrected error from.ekn did not discover first american error,and mercado erroneously certified that the depiction of the racetrack property on the survey accurately reflected the legal description on the survey.
meanwhile,frank de marco,general counsel for the los angeles turf club,a meditrust subsidiary,received a legal description of the mall property from first american that included the legal description of the gate parcel the cover sheet for the fax stated,legal description for mall.de marco believed the legal description referred only to the mall property,and he wrote fashion park legal at the bottom of the description and sent it to.
in the course of santa anita due diligence,stronach with other santa anita executives toured the racetrack property,including the gate parcel.the meditrust employees who guided the tour stated that the gate parcel was part of the racetrack property.also viewed the racetrack property and examined a november draft survey and a december final survey from ekn,at least two appraisals of the racetrack property by fisher realty services,and the meditrust commercial development plans for the southern part of the racetrack property,all of which showed the gate parcel as part of the racetrack property.
compared the legal description on the face of the ekn survey with the legal description on the face of the preliminary title report to make certain that they matched,which they did.reviewed the boundaries of the survey depiction of the property to ascertain that those boundaries accurately delineated what santa anita believed it was acquiring.the depiction on that survey included the gate parcel even though the legal description on the face of the survey did not.also obtained a title insurance policy from first american that included a clta california land title association endorsement insuring that santa anita would have title to all of the real property represented in the ekn survey,including the gate parcel.
on november,meditrust and santa anita entered into an agreement for the purchase of the racetrack property purchase agreement.under schedule a of the purchase agreement,santa anita purchased all of the assets used by meditrust in its horse racing operations except excluded assets.the assets santa anita acquired included the real property described on appendix a legal description of real property being acquired,which consisted of a full page metes and bounds description.
under schedule b of the purchase agreement,certain real property was excluded from the sale.the excluded real property consisted of meditrust interest in the real property and related improvements and adjacent parking lot constituting the regional shopping mall as described on appendix b hereto.appendix b legal description of regional mall real property not being acquired was a copy of the legal description first american faxed to de marco that purported to be the legal description solely of the mall property but,instead,erroneously included the legal description of the gate parcel parcel b.an attorney testified at trial that he believed that he read each of the legal descriptions in appendix b.the sale of the racetrack property closed on december.
an expert witness for westfield testified that by failing to trace the legal description on the first page of ekn november survey against the boundaries of the racetrack property shown on the survey,did not fulfill its legal duty to santa anita.santa anita expert testified that major law firms in los angeles do not trace legal descriptions on surveys against the delineations on those surveys.the expert testified that performed its work competently and in accordance with the applicable standard of care.the trial court found that myer conduct was consistent with the standard of care exercised by major law firms in the los angeles area,and did not constitute neglect of a legal duty within the meaning of civil code section.
the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that both meditrust and santa anita intended that the gate parcel be included as part of the racetrack property conveyed to santa anita.the conduct of the parties and the contractual provisions of the racetrack agreement ex,excluding the two real property legal descriptions,are inconsistent with any intention to exclude the gate parcel from the sale of the racetrack property to santa anita.santa anita intention to acquire the gate parcel is further supported by the fact that it paid the real property taxes on the gate parcel through.the failure to include the gate parcel in the sale of the racetrack property was the result of a mutual mistake of fact.
ii.westfield purchase of the mall property 
in october,westfield purchased the leasehold interest in the mall property.recorded leases of the mall property showed that the gate parcel was excluded from the mall property.westfield commissioned a survey of the mall property that showed that the gate parcel was not a part of the mall property.that survey had the words not a part within the borders of the gate parcel.
effective december,westfield entered into a purchase and sale agreement with meditrust to purchase the mall property.on december,pursuant to that agreement,westfield acquired the mall property and the gate parcel.the trial court found that meditrust and westfield intended that their transaction convey to westfield only the fee underlying the mall property.the only real estate that meditrust board of directors authorized it to sell to westfield was the real estate under the mall.westfield board of directors authorized it to purchase meditrust fee interest in the land on which the mall was located.the legal description that meditrust and westfield used for the mall property was taken directly from the mistaken files of first american.
the trial court found that westfield neither negotiated for the gate parcel nor paid anything for it,westfield knew before it acquired the mall property that the gate parcel was not part of the mall property,westfield actions after its acquisition of the mall property showed that it had not intended to acquire the gate parcel,and westfield did not know it had acquired the gate parcel for several years after the purchase.this latter finding was based on the evidence that in march,three months after the sale,westfield submitted a proposed joint venture plan to santa anita that highlighted boundaries,showing that westfield believed that santa anita owned the gate parcel in december,a year after the sale,westfield asked santa anita permission to use the gate parcel for overflow parking from through,westfield submitted redevelopment proposals for the mall property to the city of arcadia that either reflected that the gate parcel was not a part of the mall property or showed that westfield did not intend to use the gate parcel for any purpose,including parking and westfield did not pay taxes on the gate parcel for several years following its acquisition of the mall property.
iii.discovery of the mistaken conveyance and proceedings 
in,santa anita entered into negotiations with wells fargo bank wells fargo for a loan.santa anita offered the racetrack property,including the gate parcel,as security for the loan.gibson,dunn crutcher llp gibson dunn represented wells fargo on the transaction.a gibson dunn paralegal reviewed the november ekn survey that santa anita had reviewed prior to its purchase of the racetrack property and other documents and determined that the property santa anita purchased did not include the gate parcel.
on june,wells fargo notified de marco that santa anita did not have title to the gate parcel.de marco testified that this was santa anita first knowledge about the mistake in its deed.in september,de marco informed william baker,meditrust chief executive officer,of the mistake in the deed,and baker responded emphatically that the land belongs to santa anita.
on may,santa anita filed a complaint alleging causes of action for reformation of grant deeds and quiet title.santa anita claimed ownership of the gate parcel,asserting that there was a mistake in its agreement with meditrust and in meditrust agreement with westfield in that meditrust conveyed the gate parcel to westfield instead of to santa anita.
prior to trial,westfield moved in limine to exclude all evidence on the ground that the action was barred by section,subdivision d the applicable statute of limitations.the trial court denied the motion.following trial,in its statement of decision,the trial court concluded that the statute of limitations did not bar the action and issued a judgment granting reformation of the deeds.following westfield motion to set aside and vacate the judgment,the trial court acknowledged that it had relied upon an incorrect period of limitations in its earlier decision but maintained its conclusion on the basis that the correct period of limitations did not bar the action.westfield filed a timely notice of appeal.westfield appeals only as to the statute of limitations issue.
discussion 
standard of review 
resolution of a statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact.jolly eli lilly cal d,jolly institoris city of los angeles d.the trial court finding on the accrual of a cause of action for statute of limitations is upheld on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.institoris city of los angeles,supra,d at.enfield hunt d.when,however,a statute of limitations is applied to undisputed facts,review is de novo.martino workers comp.appeals bd.th,d goodstein superior court th,d.
westfield argues that the trial court decided its statute of limitations defense based on undisputed facts,and that therefore our review is de novo.relying on engebrecht shelton d,engebrecht and western title guar.sacramento san joaquin drainage dist.d.western title guar,santa anita contends that substantial evidence review is appropriate because the determination of whether the statute of limitations bars its claims depends on whether it exercised diligence in discovering the mistake.
although what occurred may not be in dispute,the conflicting expert evidence on the issue of diligence makes the resolution of the statute of limitations issue one of fact.engebrecht,supra,d at.thus,we review the trial court finding on the accrual of santa anita causes of action for substantial evidence.
ii.the limitations period did not begin to run until santa anita discovered the mistake on june,
