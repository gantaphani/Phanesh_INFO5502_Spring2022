attenuators,llc appeals from the final determination of the international trade commission itc that intel corporation and other intervenors intel did not violate because intel products were not covered by asserted patents.because the itc correctly construed the relevant claim terms,we affirm.
background 
the asserted patents,patent patent,patent,and patent are familially related.the technology disclosed in the asserted patents relates to structures for reducing electromagnetic interference in electrical circuits.the patented inventions use shielding electrodes to reduce the undesirable buildup of charge,known as parasitic capacitance,between electrodes used for conduction.patent abstract,ll,ll,ll.in particular,the patents disclose alternating arrangements of shielded and shielding electrodes.patent,see intervenor br.annotated by intel and reproduced below appellant br.annotated by and reproduced below.
although it is not asserted,the parties treat claim of the patent as illustrative 
an arrangement for energy conditioning,comprising 
a first electrode including a first shielding electrode portion,a third electrode including a third shielding electrode portion,and a fifth electrode including a fifth shielding electrode portion,wherein said first electrode,said third electrode and said fifth electrode are conductively coupled to one another 
a second electrode including a second shielded electrode portion a fourth electrode including a fourth shielded electrode portion wherein said second electrode and said fourth electrode are conductively isolated from each other 
wherein said second shielded electrode portion and said fourth shielded electrode portion are in a first superposed alignment with each other and wherein said second shielded electrode portion is physically shielded from said fourth shielded electrode portion by said third shielding electrode portion.
patent claim emphases added.at the itc,the parties treated the patent claim term third electrode,patent claim term center electrode see,patent claim,patent claim term first ground plane,see,patent claim,and several other claim terms collectively as electrode terms or center ground plane terms.see e ach of the asserted claims contains a term from a group that characterizes as the electrode terms,and respondents characterize as central ground plane terms.
filed a complaint in the itc accusing intel of unlawful importation of certain microprocessor products.the parties disputed whether the electrode terms were limited to the sandwich configuration an arrangement of three electrodes in which a center conductor is flanked by paired differential,or oppositely charged,conductors.see patent ll.describing electrostatic suppression or minimization of parasitics originating from the sandwiched differential conductors patent ll.describing sandwiching pairs of electrically opposing complementary pathways see also patent ll.the various attachment schemes described herein will normally allow a voltage reference to develop with respect to each pair or plurality of paired differential conductors located on opposite sides of the shared central and common conductive pathway,and be equal yet opposite for each unit of a separated paired energy pathway or structure,between the centrally positioned interposing,common conductive shield pathway used.while intel argued that the claims should be limited to the sandwich configuration,contended that the electrode terms require no construction and should be given their plain and ordinary meanings.see.
the itc resolved the dispute in favor of intel.it adopted the administrative law judge construction of the electrode terms as requiring a common conductive pathway electrode positioned between paired electromagnetically opposite conductors.see.this construction was based on specification disavowal for example,the statement in the patent that the sandwich configuration is an essential element among all embodiments or connotations of the invention,patent ll,and a statement incorporated by reference into the patent that this configuration is a feature universal to all the embodiments,patent patent because conceded noninfringement on the basis of this construction,the itc found no violation.appeals.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
we review de novo the itc legal determinations,including those relating to claim interpretation.gemstar tv guide int l,int l trade comm n,citation omitted.
argues that the itc erred in its construction of the electrode terms.contends that the itc improperly read several functional and structural limitations into the meaning of the term electrode.it contends that the plain meaning of electrode denotes a single conductor rather than three conductors,let alone a sandwich structure having paired electromagnetically opposite conductors flanking the central conductor.argues that claim of the patent recites the physical role of each of the electrodes separate and apart from any electrical characteristics created when the arrangement is connected in a circuit.appellant br.
also argues that the specifications of the asserted patents contradict the constructions.contends that,for example,the patent discloses that the electrodes on either side of a center conductor may be electrically null,electrically complementary,or electrically opposite,which,it argues,suggests that the claims should not be limited to electrically opposite conductors.patent ll.further contends that the itc improperly relied on the alleged disclaimers in some of the priority patents because the asserted patents are only related to those patents as.
finally,argues that the statements relied upon by the itc do not constitute disavowal of claim scope.argues that the patent reference to the common conductive pathway electrode as the essential element among all embodiments does not limit the claims because it says nothing about the electromagnetic state of the conductors surrounding it when the circuit is energized.it contends that a priority patent description of the sandwich configuration as universal to all the embodiments is also not a disclaimer because the passage that the itc relied upon otherwise uses permissive rather than mandatory language.patent col ll.
we conclude that the itc correctly construed the electrode terms.the patents statements that the presence of a common conductive pathway electrode positioned between paired electromagnetically opposite conductors is universal to all the embodiments and is an essential element among all embodiments or connotations of the invention constitute clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim scope.see ge lighting solutions,llc agilight,wl,at.the standard for finding disavowal,while exacting,was met in this case.id.at.
specifically,we have held that labeling an embodiment or an element as essential may rise to the level of disavowal.id.at.here,not only does the specification state that the center common conductive pathway electrode flanked by two differential conductors is essential,but it also spells out that it was an essential element among all embodiments or connotations of the invention.patent ll.emphasis added see id.id,ll.id.ll.
the patent statement that the sandwich configuration is a feature universal to all the embodiments reinforces this conclusion.patent col.like the essential element label,this phrase demonstrates a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.teleflex,ficosa am.the relevant passage does include the permissive language that the material having predetermined electrical properties may be one of a number in any of the embodiments.patent ll.but the specification further explains that n o matter which material is used,the combination of common ground conductive plates and electrode conductive plates creates a plurality of capacitors to form a differential coupling capacitor between and two decoupling capacitors from a pair of electrical conductors.id.ll.emphasis added.thus,although the passage states that the material may vary,it also explains that the general sandwich configuration remains the same because it is a feature universal to the inv
