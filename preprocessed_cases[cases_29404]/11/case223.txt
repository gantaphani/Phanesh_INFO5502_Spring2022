background 
on august,defendant francis branin,an investment portfolio manager and the largest shareholder of the firm of brundage,story and rose,llc brundage,sold the assets of the firm along with its client accounts and related good will to bessemer.bessemer iv,at.although branin originally stayed on at bessemer as a client account manager,he soon became dissatisfied with his diminished responsibilities.he left bessemer to join stein roe investment counsel llc stein roe,an investment management firm in competition with bessemer.id.at.
in negotiations with stein roe,branin touted his ability to bring his bessemer clients,most or all of whom originally moved with him as part of the sale of brundage to bessemer,to stein roe.he indicated his hope that within twelve months of joining the firm,he would be able to transfer to stein roe to million of the approximately million in annual revenue that he was then generating for bessemer.id.at.he informed stein roe that it was possible,however,that few or none of his bessemer clients would move their business.id.prior to his resignation from bessemer,branin refrained from contacting any of his bessemer clients to inform them of his impending move or to discuss anything relating to it.id.
once branin joined stein roe,that company began crafting and implementing a strategy to entice branin former bessemer clients to move their business to stein roe.id.part of this strategy involved maintaining branin current schedule of fees so that clients would not have their fees increased if they followed branin to stein roe.id.additionally,branin former assistant at bessemer,who was otherwise of no interest to stein roe as a prospective employee,was hired by the firm to help branin transition as much of his client base to stein roe as possible.id.at brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.by the following summer,around thirty of branin former clients,representing million in assets,had transferred their accounts from bessemer to stein roe,accounting for all but around million of the assets branin had managed at stein roe.id.at.
branin did not initiate contacts with his clients in an effort to assist stein roe in its strategy to obtain the bessemer clients.id.he did,however,respond to their inquiries if they asked why he left bessemer.id.if they requested information about his new firm,he sent them stein roe promotional material.id.the district court found that branin standard answer to clients who asked why he left bessemer was that a firm like stein roe was far more appropriate for me,that the method of dealing with clients,that the approach whereby portfolio managers managed the client portfolios and interacted directly with the clients was more appropriate for my training and experience of years in the business.id.quoting bessemer trust,branin bessemer i,d,in turn quoting joint statement of undisputed facts,ex.a to pre trial order dated august,ellipses in bessemer i.branin did not say or suggest that stein roe approach would be better or more appropriate for any particular client,nor is there record evidence that branin explicitly disparaged bessemer.id.
the evidence introduced at trial established that branin had individual meetings,either alone or with other stein roe employees participating,with,among others,representatives of the palmer family,a former client with a large account at brundage and then at bessemer.id.at.branin had managed the palmer account for fifteen to twenty years at brundage,developing a close personal friendship with carleton palmer,iii,who represented the family in its dealings with bessemer.id.at.branin did not notify palmer and the palmer family of his move to stein roe.id.but palmer did call branin and ask him questions about the move.id.branin responses were,according to palmer testimony,very spare.id.
palmer followed up on his inquiries with a letter requesting specific information as to how the palmer account might be handled at stein roe.id.palmer and other members of the palmer family then scheduled meetings on august,with stein roe and bessemer to discuss the palmer account.id.
branin helped stein roe prepare for these meetings by telling other stein roe employees about carleton palmer and the palmers investment philosophy.id.according to the trial testimony of carleton palmer,during the subsequent meeting between palmer and stein roe,branin pretty much sat over in the corner and kept quiet,and played almost no role,other than to introduce carleton palmer to the firm and occasionally amplify a point if he knew it was something the palmers would be interested in.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the palmers thereafter invited branin to ohio to make a specific proposal on behalf of stein roe.id.branin accepted.id.during the subsequent visit,branin informed the palmer family that they would pay the same fees at stein roe that they were then paying at bessemer,and that the president of stein roe would be the number two on the family account.id.
the next day,september,the palmer family moved their account to stein roe.id.
district court proceedings 
on november,following the departure of the palmer family and several of branin other former bessemer clients from the firm,bessemer filed the complaint in this action in new york supreme court,new york county.id.at.bessemer asserted claims for breach of contract and breach of branin duty of loyalty to bessemer based on branin allegedly improper solicitation of clients and impairment of the good will which branin had sold to bessemer in connection with the sale of brundage.id.branin removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york based on diversity of citizenship,and filed various counterclaims.id.
the district court denied the parties for summary judgment on bessemer claims,and the case proceeded to a bench trial as to liability.id.the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order on april,concluding that branin had violated new york law by impairing bessemer good will in the palmer account,but that bessemer had not proven a violation of law by a preponderance of the evidence with respect to any other transferred account.bessemer i,d at.the district court then conducted a separate bench trial on damages,and concluded that branin was liable to bessemer in the amount of plus prejudgment interest of,for a total of.bessemer iii,d at 
proceedings in this court 
branin appealed the finding of liability and damages.with respect to the district court finding of liability as to the palmer account,we determined that new york law regarding the liability of a seller of good will for soliciting former clients the mohawk doctrine,named after mohawk maintenance kessler,was unclear as applied to the facts of this case.bessemer iv,at.we therefore certified the following question to the new york court of appeals 
what degree of participation in a new employer solicitation of a former employer client by a voluntary seller of that client good will constitutes improper solicitation we are particularly interested in how the following two sets of circumstances influence this analysis the active development and participation by the seller,in response to inquiries from a former client whose good will the seller has voluntarily sold to a third party,in a plan whereby others a
