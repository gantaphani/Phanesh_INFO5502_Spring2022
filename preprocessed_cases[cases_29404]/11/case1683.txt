the common law theory of continuous accrual posits that a cause of action challenging a recurring wrong may accrue not once but each time a new wrong is committed.we consider whether the theory can apply to actions under the unfair competition law bus,et hereafter ucl and,if so,whether it applies here to save plaintiff jamshid aryeh suit from a limitations bar.we conclude the text and legislative history of the ucl leave ucl claims as subject to the common law rules of accrual as any other cause of action,and continuous accrual principles prevent aryeh complaint from being dismissed at the demurrer stage on statute of limitations grounds.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeal judgment.
factual and procedural 
aryeh runs a copy business under the name abc copy print.defendant canon business solutions,canon sells,leases,services,and repairs copiers and other office products.in november and february,aryeh entered agreements with canon to lease copiers for a term of months.the leases required aryeh to pay monthly rent for each copier,subject to a maximum copy allowance.copies in excess of the monthly allowance required payment of an additional per copy charge.
canon serviced the leased copiers periodically.shortly after entering the two leases,aryeh noticed discrepancies between meter readings taken by canon employees and the actual number of copies made on each copier.when canon would not respond to aryeh complaints,aryeh began compiling independent copy records.aryeh concluded that during service visits,canon employees were running test copies according to the operative complaint,a total of at least copies over the course of service visits between february and november.these copies resulted in aryeh exceeding his monthly allowances and owing excess copy charges and late fees to canon.
aryeh sued in january,alleging a single claim for violation of the ucl.the original complaint alleged canon knew or should have known it was charging for excess copies and that the practice of charging for test copies was both unfair and fraudulent.the complaint also included class allegations.aryeh originally sought restitution and injunctive relief,but later amended his complaint to seek only restitution.
canon demurred,arguing that the claim was barred by,inter alia,the statute of limitations.see bus.after twice sustaining demurrers with leave to amend,the trial court finally sustained a demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action with prejudice.its order recited several grounds,but the court made clear the primary basis for dismissal was the statute of limitations.the trial court read state law as establishing that the clock on a ucl claim starts running when the first violation occurs.consequently,because the second amended complaint established a first violation in,the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.
a divided court of appeal affirmed.the majority agreed with the trial court that neither delayed discovery nor the continuing violation doctrine could be applied to extend the statute of limitations for ucl claims accordingly,aryeh claim was untimely.the dissent would have reversed under the theory of continuous accrual,reasoning that even if some parts of aryeh claim were stale,not all parts of it were barred.
we granted review to resolve lingering uncertainty over the timing of accrual and the applicability of accrual principles under the ucl.
discussion 
this appeal follows the sustaining of a demurrer.the application of the statute of limitations on undisputed facts is a purely legal question see jolly eli lilly cal d,accordingly,we review the lower courts rulings de novo.we must take the allegations of the operative complaint as true and consider whether the facts alleged establish aryeh claim is barred as a matter of law.see fox ethicon endo surgery,cal th,d.
accrual and equitable exceptions to the usual running of the statute of limitations 
an affirmative defense,the statute of limitations exists to promote the diligent assertion of claims,ensure defendants the opportunity to collect evidence while still fresh,and provide repose and protection from dilatory suits once excess time has passed.see,shively bozanich cal th,d,norgart upjohn cal th,d,jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.the duration of the limitations period marks the legislatively selected point at which,for a given claim,these considerations surmount the otherwise compelling interest in adjudicating on their merits valid claims.see johnson railway express agency,d pooshs philip morris usa,cal th,d,norgart,at,d.
the limitations period,the period in which a plaintiff must bring suit or be barred,runs from the moment a claim accrues.see code civ,an action must be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title,after the cause of action shall have accrued pooshs philip morris usa,supra,cal th at,d,fox ethicon endo surgery,supra,cal th at,d,norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.traditionally at common law,a cause of action accrues when it is complete with all of its elements those elements being wrongdoing,harm,and causation.pooshs,at,d,quoting norgart,at,d.this is the last element accrual rule ordinarily,the statute of limitations runs from the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action.neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,accord,howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th,d,buttram owens corning fiberglas cal th,fn,d.
to align the actual application of the limitations defense more closely with the policy goals animating it,the courts and the legislature have over time developed a handful of equitable exceptions to and modifications of the usual rules governing limitations periods.these doctrines may alter the rules governing either the initial accrual of a claim,the subsequent running of the limitations period,or both.the most important of these doctrines,the discovery rule,where applicable,postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d,accord,fox ethicon endo surgery,supra,cal th at,d.equitable tolling,in turn,may suspend or extend the statute of limitations when a plaintiff has reasonably and in good faith chosen to pursue one among several remedies and the statute of limitations notice function has been served.mcdonald antelope valley community college dist.cal th,d.the doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolls the statute of limitations where a defendant,through deceptive conduct,has caused a claim to grow stale.regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.the continuing violation doctrine aggregates a series of wrongs or injuries for purposes of the statute of limitations,treating the limitations period as accruing for all of them upon commission or sufferance of the last of them.richards hill,cal th,d,see also national railroad passenger corporation morgan,d.finally,under the theory of continuous accrual,a series of wrongs or injuries may be viewed as each triggering its own limitations period,such that a suit for relief may be partially as to older events but timely as to those within the applicable limitations period.howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.common law accrual and the ucl 
we consider the application of common law rules to the ucl in deciding when a ucl claim accrues.
we begin with the language of the ucl statute of limitations.any action to enforce any cause of action pursuant to the ucl shall be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued.neither section nor any other part of the ucl offers a definition of what it means for a ucl claim to accrue this is not a limitations statute in which the legislature has assumed the task of articulating the specific ways in which established common law principles may or may not apply.quarry doe i cal th,d,discussing code civ,which legislatively supplants common law principles jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison,supra,cal th at,d,discussing code civ,which legislatively supplants common law principles.
this silence triggers a presumption in favor of permitting settled common law accrual rules to apply.as a general rule,u nless expressly provided,statutes should not be interpreted to alter the common law,and should be construed to avoid conflict with common law rules.citation.a statute will be construed in light of common law decisions,unless its language clearly and unequivocally discloses an intention to depart from,alter,or abrogate the rule concerning the particular subject matter citations.citation.california of health facilities department of health services cal th,d.we thus may assume the legislature intended the body of law that has built up around accrual,including the traditional last element rule and its equitable exceptions,to apply fully here.
the legislative history,moreover,indicates the legislature intended the ucl limitations period to be subject to the usual judicial rules governing accrual,rather than to special legislatively declared accrual rules.section was passed in as part of an act that consolidated and recodified existing state unfair competition laws without substantive change in the business and professions code.stats,ch,assem.off.of research,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.the adoption of an express statute of limitations was not intended to modify but to clarify the presumed applicable limitations period.assem.com.on judiciary,bill digest of assem.bill reg.sess.on the question of accrual,legislative committee reports are conspicuously silent,and the enrolled bill report expressly confirms the understanding that the subject is to be governed not by statute but by judicial construction questions concerning the point at which the statute of limitations begins will be left to judicial decision.governor off.of legal affairs,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.june.it thus appears the legislature,by passing a limitations statute and delegating to the judiciary the task of defining the point of accrual in particular cases,left courts free to determine whether the circumstances in each case call for application of either the general last element rule of accrual or any of its equitable exceptions.
in this case,the trial court concluded because this is a ucl section claim there is no continuing practices doctrine that applies here.affirming,the court of appeal majority held that a ucl claim necessarily accrues when the defendant conduct occurs,not when the plaintiff learns about the conduct.it went on to conclude that in addition to delayed discovery,the continuing violation doctrine also is categorically inapplicable to ucl claims.
in treating the ucl as exceptional for accrual purposes,the trial court and the court of appeal joined one side of a split in the courts of appeal over whether the ucl should,like any other statute,be interpreted as subject to all the usual rules of accrual,or whether the statute categorically forecloses modified accrual based on delayed discovery,principles,and their ilk.compare,salenga mitsubishi motors credit of america,th,d with broberg v.the guardian life ins.of america th,d see grisham philip morris,cal th,fn,d,acknowledging the split.the roots of that split trace back to a single federal trial court decision,stutz motor car of america reebok.each subsequent case espousing the view that the ucl categorically forecloses a common law modification of the last element accrual rule has relied on stutz or its progeny without further reasoning.see suh yang,snapp associates ins.services,robertson th,d salenga,at,d.as we shall explain,stutz misstated california law.
in support of its conclusion that the ucl categorically foreclosed application of the accrual exception there at issue the discovery rule,stutz reasoned that the federal sherman act et and clayton antitrust act et do not permit delayed accrual based on ignorance of a claim,judicial interpretations of the sherman and clayton acts apply fully to this state antitrust act,the cartwright act et,and implicitly interpretations of the cartwright act are equally applicable to the unrelated ucl.stutz motor car of america reebok,supra.at.the second and third premises,construing state law,are each wrong.interpretations of federal antitrust law are at most instructive,not conclusive,when construing the cartwright act,given that the cartwright act was modeled not on federal antitrust statutes but instead on statutes enacted by california sister states around the turn of the century.state of california ex rel.van de kamp texaco,cal d,j udicial interpretation of the sherman act,while often helpful,is not directly probative of the cartwright drafters intent see also clayworth pfizer,cal th,d.as well,the stutz court either assumed without explanation that decisions governing an antitrust claim under the cartwright act would apply equally to an unfair competition claim under the ucl or mistook one for the other.no justification for such a leap is evident though the cartwright act and the ucl each address aspects of unfair business competition,they have markedly different origins and scopes.compare texaco,at,discussing cartwright act origins and pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d,discussing cartwright act scope with bank of the west superior court cal th,d,discussing ucl origins and scope.despite these errors,stutz has been accepted without critical analysis by numerous subsequent federal and state courts.
the contrary view is reflected in more recent cases like broberg v.the guardian life ins.of america,supra,th,d.see also massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d miller washington mut.bank fa d,neurontin marketing sales practices litigation d,clark prudential ins.of america d.broberg involved a statute of limitations challenge to a claim of deceptive practices under the ucl.the court reasoned that the underlying nature of the claim,not its form,should control.see jefferson french cal d,t the nature of the right sued upon,not the form of action or the relief demanded,determines the applicability of the statute of limitations.consequently,that the cause of action was pleaded under the ucl should not preclude application of an equitable exception to the usual accrual rule just like common law claims challenging fraudulent conduct,a ucl deceptive practices claim should accrue only when a reasonable person would have discovered the factual basis for a claim.broberg,at,d.broberg is consistent with both our precedent and the absence of anything in the text or legislative history of the ucl establishing a legislative desire either to categorically limit or categorically guarantee the application of common law accrual exceptions under the ucl.
broberg also highlights an aspect of the statutory scheme salient for limitations purposes the ucl is a chameleon.the ucl affords relief from unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent acts moreover,under the unlawful prong,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.cel tech communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.depending upon which prong is invoked,a ucl claim may most closely resemble,in terms of the right asserted,an action for misrepresentation,kwikset superior court cal th,d,misappropriation,glue fold,slautterback th,d,price fixing,clayworth pfizer,supra,cal th,d,interference with prospective economic advantage korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,or any of countless other common law and statutory claims.given the widely varying nature of the right invoked,it makes sense to acknowledge that a ucl claim in some circumstances might support the potential application of one or another exception,broberg v.the guardian life ins.of america,supra,th at,d,and in others might not,m f fishing,sea pac ins.managers,th,d concluding that while in theory delayed discovery might preserve an unfair competition claim,the nature of the particular ucl claim asserted precluded its application 
accordingly,we conclude the ucl is governed by common law accrual rules to the same extent as any other statute.that a cause of action is labeled a ucl claim is not dispositive instead,the nature of the right sued upon jefferson french,supra,cal
