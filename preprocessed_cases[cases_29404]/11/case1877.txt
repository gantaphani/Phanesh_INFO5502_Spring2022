defendant forceman obtained and delivered certain certificates,required by the chinese government,that the goods had been inspected china certification and inspection corporation or ccic certificates.the goods,however,never existed.the certificates obtained by forceman and provided to green wood,as well as packing lists,invoices,and bills of lading provided to green wood by richshine to evidence shipment of the goods,were false.green wood sued richshine,forceman and others for,inter alia,fraud,conspiracy to commit fraud,and negligence.the trial court instructed the jury that defendants could be liable for a conspiracy to commit fraud.the trial court also instructed the jury that compensatory damages claimed by green wood included amounts expended for the goods,additional harm arising from false representations,and lost profits.the jury returned special verdicts against forceman,among others,finding it liable for fraud and negligence.the jury awarded green wood compensatory damages against all defendants,jointly and severally,in the sum of amount green wood had requested the figure requested consisted of green wood payments to richshine,green wood lost profits on the resale transaction of,and a claim against green wood by,or an obligation of green wood to,its chinese buyer for of the goods in the amount of.we hold in the unpublished portion of this opinion that substantial evidence supports the judgment of liability for fraud and negligence against forceman.forceman challenges various components of the damages awarded against it.
procedural background 
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence.
liability for all damages because of conspiracy 
forceman contends that the trial court erroneously permitted green wood to recover damages for payments made to richshine before forceman obtained the fraudulent ccic certificates.we have concluded,however,that there was substantial evidence that forceman conspired with the other defendants in richshine scheme to defraud green wood.t he major significance of the conspiracy lies in the fact that it renders each participant in the wrongful act responsible as a joint tortfeasor for all damages ensuing from the wrong,irrespective of whether or not he was a direct actor and regardless of the degree of his activity.citations.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,italics added.the timing of green wood payments to richshine and forceman conduct in procuring fraudulent ccic certificates are thus irrelevant to forceman liability for all damage suffered by green wood as a result of the fraudulent scheme.
damages not affected by source of funds 
green wood is entitled,inter alia,to compensation for the amounts it paid to richshine,subd.the fact that the buyer is a middleman,who purchases for resale or with the intent of making a reshipment to his or her customer,does not alter the rule as to the measure of damages for breach.lawrence anderson on the uniform commercial code ed.
forceman argues that green wood was not entitled to recover for payments to richshine that were funded or transmitted by green wood chinese buyer.the evidence was undisputed that the purchase order was a contract between green wood and richshine,pursuant to which green wood was obligated to pay richshine for the goods.green wood buyer was not a party to that contract.green wood had entered a separate resale contract with its chinese buyer.in essence,green wood buyer prepaid amounts in connection with its contract to purchase the goods from green wood,and green wood used those funds to pay richshine.the funds sent to richshine were thus,in effect,payments by green wood.the fact that green wood funded its payments to richshine by instructing its buyer to transmit the funds directly to richshine thus saving substantial currency conversion costs is irrelevant to green wood right to recover for payments it was fraudulently induced to make for goods that never existed.see allied canners packers,victor packing d.purchaser of raisins for resale to japan was a buyer,not a broker,even though its japanese resale buyer sent letter of credit to allow purchaser to pay seller see also goldman bernstein so d,that some of the money was wired to defendant for plaintiff from a third person account is irrelevant as to the issue of plaintiff damages.forceman cites no authority to the contrary.
recovery of lost profits 
forceman asserts that the award to green wood of for lost profits was erroneous.forceman did not object to the lost profits instruction or offer an alternative instruction on compensatory damages in the trial court.however,when a trial court gives a jury instruction which is prejudicially erroneous as given,which is an incorrect statement of law,the party harmed by that instruction need not have objected to the instruction or proposed a correct instruction of his own in order to preserve the right to complain of the erroneous instruction on appeal.suman bmw of north america,th,d see also code civ.proc.huffman interstate brands th,d.we therefore consider whether green wood was entitled to recover lost profits.
the fraud in this case related to the purchase order.the purchase order was a contract for the sale of goods subject to division of the california uniform commercial code.see cal,accordingly,the damages available to green wood from the fraud are governed by california uniform commercial code,section,which provides for recovery on a basis.that section provides remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under this division for nonfraudulent breach.neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale nor rejection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other remedy.california uniform commercial code section represents an exception to the general rule in california,embodied in civil code section,that a plaintiff defrauded in the purchase or sale of property may recover only loss.see stout turney cal d,continental airlines,mcdonnell douglas d.see also witkin,su
