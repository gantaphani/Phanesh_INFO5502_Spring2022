factual and procedural background 
allegations of the complaint 
the operative complaint is the second amended complaint although the complaint is concerned with a failure to approve classic purchase of the hbc crown distributorship in,classic allegations date back to classic attempt to purchase the hbc crown distributorship in.in august,classic and hbc had reached an agreement for classic to purchase hbc crown distributorship.at that time,crown denied approval,stating as reasons classic own performance as a crown distributor.classic alleges that,at this time,crown secretly preferred another buyer for hbc crown distributorship,and therefore began orchestrating the sale from hbc to its preferred distributor.
by,classic performance had improved by any objective measure and it again sought to purchase hbc crown distributorship.it is not entirely clear whether hbc agreed to sell its crown distributorship to classic,on specific terms,conditioned on crown approval or whether hbc agreed to enter into a contract to sell its crown distributorship to classic,under the same terms as the agreement,conditioned on crown approval.classic alleged both of these circumstances in the alternative 
in any event,rowley,who was responsible for crown southern california division,met with classic representatives in june,in order to discuss classic possible acquisition of hbc crown distributorship.rowley,on behalf of crown,denied approval.according to the allegations of the complaint,crown denied approval based on pretextual factors,and simply refused to consent because classic was not crown preferred distributor 
ultimately,hbc sold its distributorship to anheuser busch sales pomona ab pomona in december.classic alleged that this sale was orchestrated by crown.classic does not allege,and concedes that it had no evidence,that the sale from hbc to ab pomona was for less than the fair market value of hbc crown distributorship.
classic alleged causes of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.as the torts of interference with prospective economic advantage require the act of interference to have been independently wrongful,classic specifically identified two statutes which it contends crown violated,business and professions code sections and in connection with its cause of action for intentional interference,classic sought punitive damages.
motion for summary judgment 
crown sought summary judgment on several bases,including that classic could not prove that its alleged interference constituted an independently wrongful act.crown argued that classic could not allege a wrongful act based on business and professions code section,as that statute was meant to protect disappointed sellers,not disappointed buyers.crown also argued that classic could not allege a wrongful act based on business and professions code section because crown did not perform any unauthorized act 
classic opposition 
in opposition to crown summary judgment motion,classic disputed most of crown purportedly undisputed facts,and attempted to establish the existence of a secret plan to prevent classic from acquiring hbc crown distributorship dating back to even though classic complaint relates only to crown denial of approval in.
as to the legal issues,classic argued that even though it could not independently bring a cause of action against crown for violating business and professions code section,it could rely on the statutory violation as an independently wrongful act to establish a basis for its causes of action for interference with prospective economic advantage.as to business and professions code section,classic relied on a february attorney general ag advisory to ca beer manufacturers and importers which identified certain provisions in distributorship agreements which the ag believed to constitute unlawful exercises of control by manufacturers over independently licensed wholesalers.those provisions included,manufacturers having the right to control or approve a wholesaler acquisitions or divestitures of businesses or product lines,or a change in control of a wholesaler or a wholesaler business,in either case including,but not limited to,a manufacturer right of first refusal to purchase or right to appoint a designee purchaser.additionally,for the first time,classic also argued that crown interference was independently wrongful as the culmination of an act of fraudulent concealment,specifically,crown concealment of the real reasons why classic had not been approved to purchase hbc crown distributorship in 
hearing and ruling 
the trial court,after a hearing,denied the motion for summary judgment.the court concluded that classic could pursue its argument that the interference with its proposed agreement with crown was independently wrongful under business and professions code section even though that statute gives a remedy only to a disappointed seller.the trial court relied on authority holding that the fact that the plaintiff is an indirect victim of the wrongful act does not preclude a cause of action for interference with the plaintiff prospective economic advantage.the court also concluded that triable issues of fact existed as to whether,among other things,there was actually an agreement between classic and hbc in,and crown unreasonably denied approval.
writ petitions 
both crown and rowley filed petitions for writ of mandate.we consolidated the petitions and issued an order to show cause.
contentions of the parties 
crown argues that it was entitled to summary judgment on the ground that classic can not establish that crown alleged interference with the alleged agreement between hbc and classic was independently wrongful on any of the grounds relied upon by classic application of business and professions code section application of business and professions code section and crown alleged fraudulent concealment.classic disagrees.

in this case,we are concerned largely with legal issues.as such,we assume the disputed factual issues are resolved in favor of classic.
interference with prospective economic advantage 
the elements of a claim of interference with economic advantage and prospective economic advantage are an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff the defendant knowledge of the relationship intentional or negligent acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship actual disruption of the relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.citations.citation.citation.winchester mystery house,llc global asylum,th.

the question has arisen as to whether,in order to be actionable as interference with prospective economic advantage,the interfering act must be independently wrongful as to the plaintiff.it need not be.there is no sound reason for requiring that a defendant wrongful actions must be directed towards the plaintiff seeking to recover for this tort.the interfering party is liable to the party even when the independently tortious means the interfering party uses are independently tortious only as to a third party.korea supply lockheed martin,supra,cal th at.
with this background in the law,we now turn to the three bases on which classic argues that crown refusal to approve it as a buyer of hbc crown distributorship constituted an independently wrongful act sufficient to support its claim for interference with prospective economic advantage business and professions code section business and professions code section and fraudulent concealment.
business and professions code section 
as discussed above see footnote,ante,business and professions code section provides,any beer manufacturer who unreasonably withholds consent or unreasonably denies approval of a sale,transfer,or assignment of any ownership interest in a beer wholesaler business with respect to that manufacturer brand or brands,shall be liable in damages to the beer wholesaler.it then limits the disappointed seller damages to compensatory damages,but provides that if a successor purchaser acquires the distributorship,the manufacturer is liable only for the difference in the amount paid by the successor purchaser and the fair market value of the disappointed seller distributorship.
as this provision provides only for damages to the disappointed seller,rather than the disappointed buyer,crown argues that it can not provide a legal basis for crown denial of approval to constitute an independently wrongful act as to classic.we disagree.as discussed above,an act may be wrongful as to a third party only and still support a cause of action by a plaintiff for interference with prospective economic advantage.
however,we conclude that the statute does not provide a basis for crown denial of approval,even if unreasonable,to constitute an independently wrongful act.this statute,which provides a limited and conditional remedy for the disappointed seller does not render the unreasonable denial of approval wrongful.vehicle code section,which provides that i t is unlawful for a vehicle manufacturer to perform any act identified in its subdivisions,one of which provides,there shall not be a transfer or assignment of the dealer franchise without the consent of the manufacturer which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld here,far from rendering the unreasonable denial of approval unlawful,business and professions code section can be read to permit a beer manufacturer to unreasonably deny approval for a transfer as long as the manufacturer compensates the disappointed seller for the compensatory damages lost 
that business and professions code section is so limited can be seen when we consider the facts of the instant case.classic alleges that the denial of approval was independently wrongful because it violated this statute prohibition against a beer manufacturer unreasonably withholding its consent or unreasonably denying approval of a sale,transfer,or assignment of any ownership interest in a licensed beer wholesaler business with respect to that manufacturer brand or brands.but business and professions code section contains no such prohibition.as long as the seller receives adequate compensation,either from a successor purchaser or the manufacturer itself,there is no violation of the statute.indeed,classic does not claim or assert that it could prove that hbc did not receive adequate compensation.
solid policy reasons exist for a legislative choice that a beer manufacturer may decline to approve a transfer of a beer distributorship for an unreasonable reason,as long as it makes the disappointed seller whole.the sale of beer is a highly regulated industry.all manufacturers,importers,and wholesalers shall file with the state a schedule of their prices.bus.no beer wholesaler may sell beer in the state unless it has first entered into a written agreement with the manufacturer,which sets forth the territorial limits in which the wholesaler may distribute the beer,and the agreement must be on file with the state.bus,subd.b.in other words,when a beer distributor sells its right to distribute to another distributor,the new distributor can not sell the beer in california without first entering into a contract with the manufacturer.if the manufacturer is not permitted to withhold its consent for any reason,it would be forced,by its distributor choice of buyer,to enter into a new contract with the new distributor,even if it does not wish to do business with the new distributor.this is problematic.barring law to the contrary,a manufacturer has the right to select with whom to do business and on what terms.chavez whirlpool th,see also drum san fernando valley bar th.in drafting business and professions code section to provide only a limited remedy to disappointed sellers,the legislature was protecting the beer manufacturers right to select the distributors with whom they choose to do business 
in short,we conclude that business and professions code section does not render the unreasonable denial of approval of a sale of a beer distributorship unlawful it simply sets forth the price the manufacturer must pay its disappointed seller in the event of such a denial as a result,this statutory provision can not be read to convert an unreasonable denial of approval by crown into an independently wrongful act.thus,classic can not rely on this statute as a legal basis for its causes of action for i
