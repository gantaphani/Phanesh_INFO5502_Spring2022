plaintiffs harvey barnett,and infant swimming research,collectively,isr filed a complaint against three former employees,alleging claims of misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment,as well as claims of unfair competition and deceptive trade practices under the colorado consumer protection act ccpa.isr further alleged federal claims of trademark infringement and misleading trade practices in violation of the lanham act,and.finding that isr failed to produce sufficient evidence with respect to any of its claims,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
in,harvey barnett,the founder and president of isr,began to develop the infant swimming research program isr program,which plaintiffs describe as a scientific,behavioral approach to pediatric drowning prevention.appellants br.at.isr program utilizes a method known as swim,float,swim,and contains nearly prompts and procedures for teaching infants as young as old how to survive in the water.id.in addition,the isr program maintains safety protocols to keep children safe during instruction and provides a buds record sheet allowing parents to monitor children bodily functions,diet,and sleep in order to evaluate physical responses to the isr program.
in a course,isr trains and certifies instructors.instructors teach survival skills to infants in private lessons,ten minutes a day,five days a week for three to four weeks.instructors receive a videotape entitled prompts and procedures,which illustrates how to use behavioral conditioning in teaching infants and covers other issues.isr program also includes the isr master instructor system,in which individuals become certified as master instructors to train other potential isr instructors.
barnett has written various books detailing some of the techniques and methods used in isr program,including precision strokes for little folks,published in.more than ten years later,he wrote,but never published,a manual entitled the science of infant swimming,which is used to help instructors understand the psychology of infants and young children,their anatomy,and the physics involved as their small bodies move through the water.appellants br.at.in,isr began publishing the parent resource book,now in its ninth edition,an educational book distributed to parents regarding the dangers of infant drowning and the theory and processes used by isr.
judy heumann,ann shidler,and alison geerdes,defendants in the instant case,are former isr instructors who left the company in early.isr trained heumann as an instructor and master instructor in and,respectively.shidler was trained as an instructor in,and as a master instructor in,and geerdes was trained as an isr instructor and worked for less than a year before leaving isr.she is not a master instructor.defendants paid fees ranging from to for the instruction.
while employed by isr,heumann,shidler,and geerdes each signed a and confidentiality agreement and a license agreement containing a further confidentiality of information provision as well as a covenant not to compete.appellants app.at.notwithstanding these agreements,on leaving isr in,the three former employees started infant aquatic survival ias,a new company devoted to teaching infant and child swimming in colorado.it is this conduct that is the subject of this litigation.defendants program is allegedly similar to the isr program in that it utilizes the same swim,float,swim method,implements some of the same safety protocols,uses a daily health data sheet similar to the buds sheet,uses a comparable registration form,and distributes a comparable parent resource book to parents of children enrolled in the ias program.it is uncontested that defendant shidler husband sought to reserve the names harvey barnett,and infant swimming research,with the colorado secretary of state.on more than one occasion,defendants falsely advertised that their program,ias,had been in business since.
isr filed in district court a complaint against the defendants,alleging claims of misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment,as well as unfair competition and deceptive trade practices under the ccpa,along with federal claims of trademark infringement and misleading trade practices under the lanham act.isr then sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from teaching the isr program to other instructors.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied isr request for a preliminary injunction as to heumann and shidler subsequently,the defendants moved for summary judgment,which was granted.in its ruling,the district court concluded that the isr program was not a trade secret as a matter of law and dismissed isr claim.the district court further concluded that both the covenant not to compete and the confidentiality provision in the license agreement were not enforceable,and dismissed isr claim.as to isr remaining infringement and misleading trade practices under the lanham act,and violations of the court concluded that,because isr failed to advance sufficient evidence on each element,those claims must be dismissed as well.isr appeals the grant of summary judgment to defendants 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.perry woodward,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in our review,we examine the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.although the movant must show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,he or she need not negate the nonmovant claim.id.once the movant carries this burden,the nonmoving party must bring forward specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial as to those dispositive matters for which he or she carries the burden of proof.id.quotation omitted.an issue of material fact is genuine if the nonmovant presents facts that would allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmovant.id.
in evaluating the district court decision regarding isr claim,we look to colorado law.colorado has adopted the uniform trade secrets act,which defines a trade secret as any scientific or technical information,design,process,procedure,formula,or improvement which is secret and of value.in order t o be a trade secret the owner thereof must have taken measures to prevent the secret from becoming available to persons other than those selected by the owner to have access thereto for limited purposes.id.status is a question of fact.supply stewart,see also rivendell forest,cir holding that in this context doubts as to existence of triable issue of fact must be resolved in favor of the existence of triable issues.
factors considered in determining whether a trade secret exists include 
the extent to which the information is known outside the business the extent to which it is known to those inside the business,by the employees the precautions taken by the holder of the trade secret to guard the secrecy of the information the savings effected and the value to the holder in having the information as against competitors the amount of effort or money expended in obtaining and developing the information and the amount of time and expense it would take for others to acquire and duplicate the information.
supply,at.in rivendell,we held,consistent with colorado law,that information can be a trade secret notwithstanding the fact that some of its components are.at.a trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics and components each of which,by itself,is in the public domain,but the unified process,design and operation of which,in unique combination,affords a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret.id.quotation omitted.
in arriving at its conclusion that the isr program is not a trade secret as a matter of law,the district court determined that v ariations of the swim,float,swim method are known both inside and outside the children aquatic business,isr did not take precautions to guard the secrecy of its information until at least,after hundreds of instructors had been trained and thousands of students taught,p arents and bystanders were allowed to watch and videotape lessons,and a variation on isr methods could be created through a perusal of commercially available child psychology,child health,and swimming instruction books.barnett shidler,slip op.at.ultimately,the court found that isr allowed its program to become part of the public domain before seeking protection and the prompts and procedures,based on principles of behavioral conditioning,was already in use to teach children swim,float,swim throughout the nation and thus as a matter of law isr has no protectable trade secret.id.at.
our review leads us to conclude that the district court improperly looked at components of the isr program in isolation,rather than as a whole,in determining that isr does not possess a trade secret.this runs afoul of the analytical approach set forth in rivendell.at concluding that the district court improperly examined the separate elements of an alleged trade secret rather than the combination of elements.isr position is that the isr program,as a whole,is a trade secret see appellants br.at the unified process,design and operation of the isr program,in unique combination,affords a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret.in failing to follow our holding in a trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics,each of which,considered separately,is in the public domain,but,taken together,may yield a competitive advantage that results in a protectable trade district court applied an inappropriate standard.we do not suggest that had the district court merely stated that it was also considering its findings in the aggregate,that would have been sufficient.rivendell requirement of analysis in the aggregate is more than a formality.it is a substantive component of analysis integral to a court ultimate conclusion regarding the existence of material facts for trial.on our review of the record,we conclude that a rivendell analysis sets in relief numerous genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.
in support of the first and second factors used by colorado courts to determine the existence of a trade extent to which the information is known outside the business and to those inside the submitted four affidavits attesting to the uniqueness of the isr program.first,tom werts,an aquatic safety consultant with over thirty years of experience,including a position as the national director of water safety for the american red cross,stated in his affidavit the isr program and the techniques used by its instructors are unique.they are not taught by other aquatic organizations.the isr program is a behavioral approach to pediatric drowning prevention.appellants app.at.second,in his affidavit,barnett stated that the isr program is not simply teaching children to swim.the isr program is a unique and specially designed behavioral approach to pediatric drowning prevention.id.at.third,lisa grether,a current isr instructor,averred that the isr program uses trade secrets and is unique.finally,david carr,who,in his role as an advisory board member for the state of florida,had the opportunity to evaluate various programs for certification in florida,submitted an affidavit in which he claimed that barnett program was the only program which offered a behavioral approach to pediatric drowning prevention and that the isr program is unique unto itself and not capable of being copied simply by watching from poolside.id.at.
in further support of the first and second factors,isr points to testimony from two current isr instructors,carol gnam and cindy asay,who relayed repeated admissions by shidler and heumann regarding the uniqueness of the isr program.isr also elicited testimony from david dubois,one of defendants experts,stating that he knows of no other aquatic program whose specific goal is to certify instructors,in a time frame,to teach infants and toddlers aquatic survival skills 
in support of the third precautions taken by the holder of the trade secret to guard the secrecy of the presented barnett affidavit,franchise agreements,and license agreements.in his affidavit,barnett averred that isr has protected the confidentiality of all of the isr research and materials since the by franchise agreements with confidentiality restrictions and later by the restrictions of the license agreements.id.at.as for the franchise agreements,they contained a confidentiality of information provision providing that f ranchisee shall not at any time or in any way divulge,disclose,or communicate to any person or organization in any manner whatsoever any information concerning any matters affecting or relating to the business of franchisor.appellees.at.moreover,license agreements,prior to,contained a confidentiality of information provision stating 
licensee shall not at any time or in any way divulge,disclose or communicate to any person or organization in any manner whatsoever any information concerning any matters affecting or relating to the business of licensor licensee further agrees not to write for publication any article concerning infant swimming research teaching and data techniques and theory,infant swimming or infant and young child aquatic activities and drowning accidents and not to train or endeavor to train instructors or assistants in the same or similar methods or techniques without specific written consent from licensor upon termination of this agreement,licensee will surrender all documents pertaining to licensor business,technique,advertising and trade secrets.
appellants app.at.beginning in,the confidentiality of information section provided that licensee acknowledges that the materials contain trade secrets of licensor and as such provide a competitive advantage.id.at.
based on our review of the evidence,we conclude that isr has raised genuine issues of material fact as to the contested factors isr submitted evidence that its program is unique in that it instructs individuals,in a period,how to teach skills to infants as young as old.isr further submitted evidence showing that,through franchise agreements and license agreements,it has taken precautions to guard the secrecy of its program factual issues remain in regard to whether the nuanced isr program is distinguishable from standard programs and whether isr took reasonable precautions to guard the secrecy of its alleged program.indulging all inferences in favor of isr,we hold that summary judgment is not appropriate on the question of whether the isr program,viewed comprehensively,is a trade secret.
we turn to the district court dismissal of the contract claims each defendant signed a nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement,which required them to hold isr confidential information in secrecy and use it solely for the purposes contemplated in the parties license agreements.as discussed above,the license agreements contain a covenant not to compete and a confidentiality provision.
covenant not to compete 
the covenant not to compete provides that 
licensee shall not,during the terms of this agreement and for two years immediately following the termination of this agreement,regardless of who initiates the termination,engage directly or indirectly in the teaching of infants or young children to swim or engage in the business or training other individuals for the purpose of teaching infants or young children to swim,other than pursuant to the terms of this agreement this covenant not to compete shall be effective within a five hundred mile radius from the present site of the business address of licensee.this covenant applies to or employment on behalf of any other person,firm,corporation,partnership or other business organization.
appellants app.at.under colorado law,covenants not to compete are void,save under limited circumstances.one exception protects a ny contract for the pro
