the first amendment to the constitution of the united states,one of the provisions of the bill of rights,states congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press,amend.
article i of the constitution of the state of california,entitled the declaration of rights,states in subdivision a of section every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.
in glickman wileman brothers elliott,d hereafter sometimes glickman,a case of first impression,the united states supreme court,by a bare majority,concluded that a marketing order issued by the secretary of agriculture of the united states did not implicate any right to freedom of speech under the first amendment by compelling funding of generic is,advertising for a commodity as such,without reference to brand.
in this cause,itself a case of first impression,we consider whether a marketing order issued by the secretary of food and agriculture of the state of california implicates any right to freedom of speech under either the first amendment or article i by compelling funding of generic advertising.
as we shall explain,we conclude that the marketing order in question does not implicate any right to freedom of speech under the first amendment,but does indeed implicate such a right under article 
the background to this,statutory,and as follows.
in the course of the great depression,congress enacted the agricultural marketing agreement act of or the amaa.see generally act of june,ch,stat.et,as amended,codified at et.
the amaa declared,as one of congress policies,the establishing and maintaining of orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in order to raise and support prices for their producers.
to effectuate this policy,the amaa authorized the secretary of agriculture of the united states to enter into marketing agreements,which are arrangements with the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities concerning marketing matters,and provided that the making of any such agreement should not be held violative of any federal antitrust law.
to the same end,the amaa also authorized the secretary of agriculture to issue marketing orders,which are regulations governing marketing matters for the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities.it provided for participation in the administration of such orders by the regulated producers and handlers themselves.it substantially restricted the terms of such orders generally to the limitation on total quantity marketed,the allotment of amounts for purchase,the allotment of amounts for marketing,the determination of the existence and extent of any surplus,the establishment of reserve pools,and,impliedly,the institution of grading and standards and the conduct of research.it also mandated that the regulated producers and handlers had to contribute funds to cover related expenses.it authorized the secretary to terminate as well as issue such orders.it generally provided that no such order could become effective unless approved or favored,as specified therein,by the regulated producers.similarly,it generally provided that no such order could remain effective unless favored,as specified therein,by the regulated producers.it authorized the secretary to conduct referenda,expressly with regard to the coming into effect of such an order and impliedly with regard to its remaining in effect.in light of features of this sort,the mechanism of regulation that such an order sets up is,essentially,one of by the regulated producers and handlers,pt,reprinted in cong.
since,congress has amended the amaa on several occasions.as a general matter,the amaa has retained the core of the provisions described above,but has expanded beyond their periphery.notably,although it continues to restrict the terms of marketing orders for agricultural commodities that it authorizes the secretary of agriculture to impose,it now permits more than it did originally.specifically,it today allows,among other terms,the undertaking of research and development projects,encompassing,for plums and other specified commodities any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising,the expense of which is to be paid from funds collected pursuant to the marketing order in question.i.it first allowed a term of this sort,albeit not extending to advertising,in.it first allowed one extending to advertising for a single specified commodity in.it then did the same for specified commodities,including plums,in.it did likewise for the remaining specified commodities,one or more at a time,in,and.from all that appears,and plainly with respect to plums see,reprinted in cong.admin.news,it has allowed terms extending to advertising in order to satisfy requests made by,among others,the regulated producers themselves.
marketing order see generally,entitled the california tree fruit agreement,was issued by the secretary of agriculture pursuant to the amaa in various years in its various subparts,deriving ultimately from marketing order,issued in.it presently applies to pears and peaches,and formerly applied to plums as well.it provides for the establishment of a control committee,whose members are drawn,largely if not exclusively,from the regulated producers and handlers themselves.it provides too for a commodity committee for each of the fruits,which is effectively filled with or controlled by the regulated producers themselves.in addition,and among other things,it provides for the control committee administration of its terms.it also provides for each commodity committee undertaking of research and development projects,encompassing any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising,the expenses of which shall be paid from funds collected pursuant to assessments imposed on the regulated handlers by the secretary,on the committee recommendation.presently,for pears and peaches former formerly,for plums as well see presently,for pears and peaches former formerly,for plums as well.it has so provided for pears and peaches since.it had done the same for plums since.it sets out specific regulations regarding both fruit containers and packs.
marketing order was terminated by the secretary of agriculture in as to plums because the results of a referendum conducted that year demonstrated a lack of producer support.may.
also in the course of the great depression,indeed within days after congress enacted the agricultural marketing agreement act of or the amaa,the legislature enacted the california marketing act of or the cma.see generally stats,ch,et,as amended,codified at food,et.
like the amaa,the cma declared,as one of the legislature policies,the establishing and maintaining of orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in order to raise and support prices for their producers.
also like the amaa,the cma authorized the director of agriculture of the state of is now styled the secretary of food and agriculture food,to enter into marketing agreements,arrangements with the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities concerning marketing matters,which would be binding,expressly,only on those signatory thereto,and would be exempt,impliedly,from all state antitrust laws.
again like the amaa,the cma authorized the director of agriculture to issue marketing orders,regulations governing marketing matters for the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities,which did the following provided for participation in the administration of such orders by the regulated producers and handlers themselves substantially restricted the terms of such orders generally to,among others,the determination of the existence and extent of any surplus,the limitation on total quantity marketed,the allotment of amounts for purchase,the allotment of amounts for marketing,the regulation of periods for marketing,the establishment of reserve pools,the institution of grading and standards,and,impliedly,the conduct of research and mandated that the regulated producers and handlers had to contribute funds to cover related expenses.it contained provisions relating to the termination of such orders,their coming into effect,and their remaining in effect,and,impliedly,the conduct of referenda.in light of features of this sort,the mechanism of regulation that such an order sets up is,essentially,by the regulated producers and handlers themselves.see voss superior court th,d.
but,unlike the amaa,the cma authorized the director of agriculture to impose,among the terms of such a marketing order,the establishment of plans for advertising and sales promotion to create new or larger markets for agricultural commodities,specifically,plans that are directed toward increasing the sale of such commodity without reference to a particular brand.stats,ch.it mandated that the regulated producers and handlers subject to a marketing order with such a term had to contribute funds to cover related expenses.
since,the legislature has amended the cma on several occasions.as a general matter,the cma has retained the core of the provisions described above,but has expanded beyond their periphery.such expansion,however,is not worthy of note here.
in,after the federal california tree fruit agreement was terminated as to plums,there was no federal or state marketing agreement or order in place.the secretary of food and agriculture then entered into a marketing agreement pursuant to the cma with about percent of the producers apparently and handlers of the fruit,evidently at their instigation,entitled the california plum marketing agreement.
in,the california plum marketing agreement went into effect.it established a plum advisory board,comprising and handlers,and authorized it to conduct research concerning plums and to engage in advertising,sales promotion,and market development.it was binding on its signatories only.it purportedly had several weaknesses,including an inability to require full participation,obtain adequate funding,and prevent free riders,and also an absence of provisions for quality standards and inspections.
in,a group of plum producers and handlers,which called itself the stone fruit coalition,approached the secretary of food and agriculture,and requested him to issue a marketing order pursuant to the cma,specifically a marketing order that the group itself proposed.voss superior court,supra,th at,d.
in,the secretary of food and agriculture issued a marketing order pursuant to the cma,entitled the california plum marketing program,which conformed to the one that the stone fruit coalition proposed.see voss superior court,supra,th at,d.
the california plum marketing program provides for the establishment of a california plum marketing board,which is virtually filled with,and totally controlled by,producers of the fruit.in addition,and among other things,it provides for the board administration of its terms.it also provides for the board undertaking of activities extending to research advertising,specifically generic advertising,along with sales promotion and market development and the institution and implementation of quality standards and inspections.it provides as well for the board assessment of funds from producers for expenses related to the foregoing activities,at a rate that may not exceed per box,including for research,for generic advertising along with sales promotion and market development,and for quality standards and inspections.
on october,gerawan farming,filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the superior court of tulare county against,among others,the california secretary of food and agriculture in his official capacity,originally henry voss,then ann veneman,now william lyons.it challenged the california plum marketing program,which was issued by the secretary pursuant to the cma,under provisions including the free speech clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution and the free speech clause of subdivision a of section of article i of the california constitution.it alleged facts reflecting the historical,statutory,and administrative background,as set out above,relating to the amaa and marketing order and to the cma and the california plum marketing program.it also alleged facts,liberally construed,to the following effect it produces and handles plums plums constitute a lawful product it has developed,and uses,a brand for marketing purposes it engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising its message is not false or misleading nonetheless,the california plum marketing program compels it to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will,and does so to some appreciable extent the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising the generic advertising,otherwise undescribed,reflect s viewpoints,political and ideological as well as commercial,to which it does not subscribe,and indeed with which it vehemently disagrees.
subsequently,in glickman,a majority of the united states supreme court,in an opinion by justice stevens,concluded that marketing order,which was issued by the united states secretary of agriculture pursuant to the amaa,did not implicate the right of parties including gerawan to freedom of speech under the first amendment by compelling funding of generic advertising.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.they indicated that,had such a right been implicated,the appropriate standard for use in determining whether it had been violated would have been the test of abood detroit board of education,d hereafter sometimes abood and its progeny,including keller state bar of california,d hereafter sometimes keller,which had not been used by the court involv es the compelled funding of speech generally glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at,fn.and not the test of central hudson gas public serv.comm,d hereafter sometimes central hudson,which had been used by the court involve s a restriction on commercial speech glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at,fn.in the principal dissenting opinion,justice souter concluded that the marketing order in question did indeed implicate a first amendment right to freedom of speech,was subject to examination under the central hudson test,and did not survive muster thereunder.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter.in a separate dissenting opinion,justice thomas generally joined in justice souter,but rejected the central hudson test,root and branch.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of thomas.
the secretary of food and agriculture moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that gerawan complaint did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action by order,the superior court granted the motion,but with leave to amend.
gerawan proceeded to file an amended complaint.it challenged the california plum marketing program under provisions including article i free speech clause.it again alleged facts reflecting the historical,statutory,and administrative background,as set out above.expanding somewhat the facts that it alleged previously,it also alleged facts,liberally construed,to the following effect it produces and handles plums plums constitute a lawful product it has developed,and uses,a brand for marketing purposes it engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising its message is not false or misleading nonetheless,the california plum marketing program compels it to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will,and does so in excess of per year the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising it disagrees with,and indeed abhors,the generic advertising,otherwise undescribed,both on political and ideological grounds,as socialistic and collectivist,and also on commercial grounds,as grouping all plums as though they are the same and as embarrassingly silly,idiotic totally ineffective.
the secretary of food and agriculture moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that gerawan amended complaint,like its original one,did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.by order,the superior court granted the motion,this time without leave to amend.it stated that gerawan cite d no authority for its argument that the california constitution extends protections against compelled speech greater than those provided in the united states constitution which the united states supreme court in glickman has held were not violated by marketing order,which it said was not substantively distinguishable from the california plum marketing program.it rendered judgment in the secretary favor,and caused entry thereof.
after gerawan filed a notice of appeal in the superior court,an appeal was docketed in the court of appeal for the fifth appellate district.
by a judgment announced in a unanimous opinion certified for publication,the court of appeal affirmed the judgment of the superior court.it apparently subjected to independent review the superior court order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings submitted by the secretary of food and agriculture.it proceeded to sustain the order.it acknowledged that it found persuasive some of the reasoning in justice souter dissent in glickman.it nevertheless concluded that the california plum marketing program does not implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under the first amendment free speech clause,as construed by the glickman majority.it determined that article i free speech clause is not materially different from the first amendment.it attempted to render article i free speech clause similar to the first amendment by construing article i free speech clause as it believed other courts had construed the first amendment.it construed article i free speech clause thus under a principle of deference,which it said operates when a state constitutional provision is similar in its language to a federal constitutional one.quoting raven deukmejian cal d.on this basis,it concluded that the california plum marketing program does not implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under article i free speech clause.
gerawan filed a petition for review.we granted its application.
the issue that we address on review is whether the california plum marketing program,issued by the california secretary of food and agriculture pursuant to the cma,implicates gerawan right to freedom of speech under either the first amendment to the united states constitution or article i of the california constitution by compelling funding of generic advertising 
in the bill of rights,the first amendment to the united states constitution has stated since its ratification in congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press,amend.
under the first amendment free speech clause,speech includes written expression as well as spoken.barnes glen theatre,d conc.opn.of scalia,see,dallas stanglin,d.
in terms,the first amendment free speech clause prohibits the legislative branch of the government of the united states from making any law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press,amend.in effect,it also bars the executive and judicial branches from taking any action with similar consequence.new york times united states,d conc.opn.of black,see hudgens nlrb,d stating that i t is,of course,a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee against abridgment by government,including the federal government,and not merely its legislative branch.
initially,the first amendment free speech clause constrained only the united states and its government.see barron baltimore pet.today,through the fourteenth amendment due process clause,it also constrains the several states and their governments,mcintyre ohio elections comm,fn,d city of ladue gilleo,fn,d near minnesota.gitlow people of state of new york.see hudgens nlrb,supra,at.stating that i t is,of course,a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee against abridgment by government,including state government,and not merely its legislative branch.
the first amendment free speech clause specifies a right to freedom of speech,bill johnson restaurants,nlrb,d accord,spallone united states,d.it does so not explicitly but by implication,containing,as it does,only the phrase freedom of speech and not the word right,amend.it does not so much grant a right to freedom of speech,as it safeguards some such right against encroachment palko connecticut,overruled on another point,benton maryland,d.
the first amendment right to freedom of speech does not restrict itself depend ing upon the identity or legal character of the speaker,whether corporation,association,union,or individual.first national bank of boston bellotti,d accord,pacific gas public util.comm,d plur.opn.of powell,consolidated edison public serv.comm,d see.pharmacy bd.consumer council,d.what matters,rather,is the speech itself.see consolidated edison public serv.comm n,supra,at.first national bank of boston bellotti,supra,at.that is because the right protection is afforded not only to one who speaks but also to those who listen.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.see pacific gas public util.comm n,supra,at.plur.opn.of powell.when the interests served by the speech at issue extend beyond those of the speaker to those of the listeners,the speaker,whoever or whatever it may be,may be deemed to possess the right in question.see pacific gas public util.comm n,supra,at.plur.opn.of powell.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.consolidated edison public serv.comm n,supra,at.first national bank of boston bellotti,supra,at.
in its nature,however,the first amendment right to freedom of speech is not absolute,board of comm rs,wabaunsee cty.umbehr,d chaplinsky new hampshire.thus,it is not the case that where it exists it must prevail konigsberg state bar,d.
moreover,in its range,the first amendment right to freedom of speech is not unbounded.see,hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,d hudgens nlrb,supra,at.that is to say,it does not run against the world,but only against governmental actors as opposed to private parties,hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston supra,at.hudgens nlrb,supra,at.

fewer than years ago,the united states supreme court introduced a dichotomy in the jurisprudence of the first amendment free speech clause between commercial speech,on the one side,and noncommercial speech,including that which is political or ideological in character,on the other.
commercial speech,at its core,is speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction pittsburgh press pittsburgh human rel.comm,d,and,more broadly,is speech that goes beyond proposing such a transaction but yet relate s solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience central hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.cincinnati discovery network,d.

the first amendment right to freedom of speech protects political speech.schad mount ephraim,supra,at.it likewise protects ideological speech.ibid.
the first amendment right to freedom of speech also protects commercial speech.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.but it protects it,as it were,only somewhat.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.in comparison with noncommercial speech florida bar went for it,d zauderer office of disciplinary counsel,d central hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at,including that which is political or,evidently,ideological in character see dun bradstreet,greenmoss builders,fn,d plur.opn.of powell.
when the united states supreme court introduced its commercial speech dichotomy in first amendment jurisprudence fewer than years ago,it held that the first amendment right to freedom of speech did not protect commercial speech at all.valentine chrestensen.when it revisited the issue somewhat more than years later,it held that the right in question did,in fact,protect such speech.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at,albeit,as stated,only somewhat.the right affords such protection as it does to truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services.liquormart,rhode island,d plur.opn.of stevens.it affords none whatsoever to other sorts of messages about other sorts of products or services.see central hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.
the first amendment right to freedom of speech is implicated,of course,in the act of speaking.the relationship is tight and direct.the right in question comprises both a right to speak freely and also a right to refrain from doing so at all.wooley maynard,d accord,riley national federation of blind,d harper row nation enterprises,d board of education barnette.for speech results from what a speaker chooses to say and what he chooses not to say.see hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston supra,at.riley national federation of blind,supra,at.pacific gas public util.comm n,supra,at.plur.opn.of powell.hence,the right in question is put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from saying what he otherwise would say and also by compelling him to say what he otherwise would not say.
the first amendment right to freedom of speech may also be implicated in the use of money.the relationship is looser and less direct.see,board of regents of the university of wisconsin system southworth,d nixon shrink missouri government pac,d buckley valeo,d per curiam see also secretary of state of munson,fn,d.but it is real all the same.that is because money,even if it is not itself speech nixon shrink missouri government pac,supra,at.at conc.opn.of stevens,accord,id.at.at conc.opn.of breyer,nevertheless enables speech id.at.at conc.opn.of breyer.just as speech results from what a speaker chooses to say and what he chooses not to say,so too it results from what speech a speaker chooses to fund and what speech he chooses not to fund.the right in question comprises both a right to fund speech meaningfully see,citizens against rent control berkeley,d first national bank of boston bellotti,supra,at.and also a right to refrain from doing so altogether see,lehnert ferris faculty,d keller state bar of california,supra,at.see also machinists street,d statutory construction under the shadow of,inter alia,the first amendment right to freedom of speech abood detroit board of education,supra,at.considering the first amendment right to association.for,in words written by thomas jefferson specifically about religious speech,but with general applicability,to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors,is sinful and tyrannical jefferson,a bill for establishing religious freedom june,reprinted in the founders constitution kurland lerner edits.hence,it is put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from funding speech that he otherwise would fund and also by compelling him to fund speech that he otherwise would not fund.
comprising the declaration of rights,article i of the california constitution states in subdivision a of section every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.
article i free speech clause took its present language and designation in.cal,art.i,subd.a,as amended june.from there,it traces itself back to,with the same language,but with a different designation as section,art.i,added.then to,when the present california constitution was framed,with a different designation as section,but with almost the same language every citizen may freely speak,write,and publish his sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of that right and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press,art.i,former as adopted may.and then to,when the original california constitution was framed,with the same language and designation.cal.const.of,art.i.

although the designation of article i free speech clause has changed appreciably over the years,from section to section to subdivision a of section,its language has not.see los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.
it is beyond peradventure that article i free speech clause enjoys existence and force independent of the first amendment.in section,article i states,in these very terms,that r ights guaranteed by the california constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the united states constitution.this statement extends to all such rights,including article i right to freedom of speech.for the california constitution is now,and has always been,a document of independent force and effect particularly in the area of individual liberties.people hannon cal d,fn,speaking specifically of the present california constitution accord,people brisendine cal d.
article i free speech clause is at least as broad as the first amendment,and its right to freedom of speech is at least as great.see,los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,griset fair political practices comm.cal th,fn,d,blatty new york times cal d,spiritual psychic science church city of azusa cal d,san jose municipal court cal d,people glaze cal d,fn,robins pruneyard shopping center,supra,cal d at,wilson superior court cal d,dailey superior court,supra,cal.at.
hence,as to the points noted in our discussion of the first amendment free speech clause and its right to freedom of speech,article i free speech clause and its right to freedom of speech,mutatis mutandis,are at least in accord.
thus,under article i free speech clause,as under the first amendment,speech includes written expression as well as spoken.indeed,under article i free speech clause,it does so in terms.cal,art.i,subd.a.
also,article i right to freedom of speech,like the first amendment,does not restrict itself depending upon the identity or legal character of the speaker.see jacoby state bar cal d,fn,semble people american automobile ins.d,semble.what matters is the speech itself.see jacoby state bar,supra,cal d at,fn.that is because the right protection is afforded not only to one who speaks but also to those who listen.ibid.when the interests served by the speech at issue extend beyond those of the speaker to those of the listeners,the speaker,we think,whoever or whatever it may be,may be deemed to possess the right in question.
article i right to freedom of speech,like the first amendment,is implicated in speaking itself.because speech results from what a speaker chooses to say and what he chooses not to say,the right in question comprises both a right to speak freely and also a right to refrain from doing so at all,and is therefore put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from saying what he otherwise would say and also by compelling him to say what he otherwise would not say.
similarly,article i right to freedom of speech,like the first amendment,may also be implicated in the use of money.because speech results,through money enabling,from what speech a speaker chooses to fund and what speech he chooses not to fund,the right in question comprises both a right to fund speech meaningfully and also a right to refrain from doing so altogether,and is therefore put at risk both by prohibiting a speaker from funding speech that he otherwise would fund and also by compelling him to fund speech that he otherwise would not fund.
as a general rule,however,article i free speech clause and its right to freedom of speech are not only as broad and as great as the first amendment,they are even broader and greater.dailey superior court,supra,cal.at,accord,los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,see,griset fair political practices,supra,cal th at,fn,d,blatty new york times,supra,cal d at,spiritual psychic science church city of azusa,supra,cal d at,san jose municipal court,supra,cal d at,people glaze,supra,cal d at,fn,robins pruneyard shopping center,supra,cal d at,wilson superior court,supra,cal d at.
it is,of course,true that this general rule does not preclude the possibility of exception.see los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.
but,at least in the following particulars,it is indeed the general rule,and not any exception,that applies.
first,article i free speech clause,unlike the first amendment,specifies a right to freedom of speech explicitly and not merely by implication.friesen,should california constitutional guarantees of individual rights apply against private actors hastings const,note,rediscovering the california declaration of rights hastings,see crosby,new frontiers individual rights under the california constitution hastings const.article i and the first amendment are not dissimilar in providing,in the first amendment words,that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press,amend,and,in article i,that a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press cal,art.i,subd.a.but,otherwise,article i and the first amendment are altogether different,because only article i,and not the first amendment,affirmatively declares as a right that e very person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects cal,art.i,subd.a.crosby,new frontiers individual rights under the california constitution,supra,hastings const.at friesen,should california constitutional guarantees of individual rights apply against private actors,supra,hastings const.at,see fritz,more than shreds and patches california first bill of rights hastings const,note,rediscovering the california declaration of rights,supra,hastings at.hence,article i itself grants a right to freedom of speech,and does not merely safeguard some such right against encroachment.
second,article i right to freedom of speech,unlike the first amendment,is unbounded in range.it runs against the world,including private parties as well as governmental actors.see robins pruneyard shopping center,supra,cal d at,fritz,more than shreds and patches california first bill of rights,supra,hastings const.at semble friesen,should california constitutional guarantees of individual rights apply against private actors,supra,hastings const.at,semble but see feminist women health center blythe th,d stating in dictum that f ree speech provisions of the state and federal constitutions protect citizens from restrictions imposed by governmental action,and that f ree speech concerns may be raised as a shield against injunctive relief only because the effectuation of such relief entails government action.an argument has been made that it is the essential nature of constitutions that they are meant to restrain only governmental actors and not private parties too.friesen,should california constitutional guarantees of individual rights apply against private actors,supra,hastings const.at,italics in original referring to,but not embracing,such an argument see id.at,fn,fn,fn.similar.but this argument overlooks the peculiar character of constitutions dating to the century,which are not so narrow.see fritz,the american constitutional tradition revisited preliminary observations on state in the nineteenth century west rutgers.among such constitutions,ours must be numbered.see cal.const.of,art.xi,expressly granting wives a right to separate property over against their husbands cal,art.xx,former as adopted may,impliedly granting husbands and wives a right to separate property the one against the other.
third,article i right to freedom of speech,unlike the first amendment,is unlimited in scope.dailey superior court,supra,cal.at,see aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,d,lead opn.of george,semble distinguishing dailey on another point.whereas the first amendment does not embrace all subjects,article i does indeed do so,in ipsissimis verbis every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects cal,art.i,subd.a,italics added.these words are qualified only by those that follow pines tomson d.per arabian,which make anyone who abuse s this right responsible for his misconduct cal,art.i,subd.a.

it is not otherwise with respect to article i right to freedom of speech and commercial speech.which is to say,as we shall explain,the right in question protects such so in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services,the kind with which we are here concerned

that article i right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services,is expressed in the broad context of the free speech clause in the world at large.
let us focus initially on the circumstances surrounding article i free speech clause at its drafting for the original california constitution of.
protection for commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services,must have practically been assumed at that time.
one fact is relevant by its absence the united states supreme court had not yet introduced its commercial speech dichotomy in first amendment jurisprudence,and would not do so for almost a century.
more to the point,from the very moment of independence through,american legislatures had kept commercial speech free from regulation by statute,except as to products and services that were unlawful in the jurisdiction in question,such as lotteries in new jersey and pennsylvania,horse racing in connecticut and pennsylvania,and unlicensed innkeeping in rhode island.troy,advertising not low value speech,supra,yale on reg.at.and in the same period,american courts had similarly kept commercial speech free from regulation by common law,except as to messages that were false or misleading in their particulars,and then only to the extent that they were not immunized by the doctrine of caveat emptor.id.at see id.at.facts of this sort should cause no surprise.since colonial times,commercial speech,operating through advertising,had played a major role in the life of the press,primarily as a source of revenue but also as a kind of editorial content,inasmuch as it was thought to have independent value in educating and informing the reading public.troy,advertising not low value speech,supra,yale on reg.at see liquormart,rhode island,supra,at.plur.opn.of stevens.and,of course,since colonial times,the press had itself played a major role in the life of the polity.troy,advertising not low value speech,supra,yale on reg.at see franklin,apology for printers june,reprinted in papers of benjamin franklin labaree et edits.
in california itself in,the prevailing political,legal,and social culture was that of jacksonian democracy.see fritz,more than shreds and patches california first bill of rights,supra,hastings const.at,scheiber,race,radicalism,and reform historical perspective on the california constitution hastings.jacksonian democracy was animated by ideals of equality and open opportunity.scheiber,race,radicalism,and reform historical perspective on the california constitution,supra,hastings const.at,fn.those ideals worked themselves out in a liberal,economic individualism.johnson,founding the far west.what such individualism presupposed,and produced,was wide and unrestrained speech about economic matters generally,including,obviously,commercial affairs.remember the.a fter the discovery of gold in,california attracted a rush of humanity.fritz,rethinking the american constitutional tradition national dimensions in the formation of state constitutions rutgers.these they were largely essentially individualistic,greedy,and acquisitive.ibid.it was such who framed the original california constitution,including article i free speech clause.fritz,rethinking the american constitutional tradition national dimensions in the formation of state constitutions,supra,rutgers at.
when we turn our eye to article i free speech clause at its drafting for the present california constitution of,we find no reason to reject protection for commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services.the language in was identical to that in.the united states supreme court had not yet introduced its commercial speech dichotomy in first amendment jurisprudence,and would not do so for more than years.in addition,the political,legal,and social culture of jacksonian democracy had not passed,with its equality and open opportunity,economic individualism,and wide and unrestrained commercial speech.american legislatures continued to keep commercial speech free from regulation by statute,except as to products and services that were unlawful in the jurisdiction in question.troy,advertising not low value speech,supra,yale on reg.at.this was evidently true of the california legislature,which kept commercial speech unregulated except for products and services that it made unlawful,such as lotteries see,criminalizing lotteries,criminalizing the advertising thereof,abortions see,former criminalizing abortions,former,subd.criminalizing the advertising thereof,and obscene or indecent books and other items see,former,subd.criminalizing obscene or indecent books and other items,former,subd.criminalizing the advertising thereof.american courts continued to keep commercial speech free from regulation by common law,except as to messages that were false or misleading in their particulars,and then only to the extent that they were not immunized by the doctrine of caveat emptor.see troy,advertising not low value speech,supra,yale on reg.at.this was apparently true of california courts,for there is no indication in reported decisions to the contrary.
proceeding from to,when article i free speech clause was first amended,we again find no reason to reject protection for commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services.although the numerical designation was different,the language was virtually identical.by,the united states supreme court had introduced its commercial speech dichotomy in first amendment jurisprudence,and indeed had held that the first amendment right to freedom of speech did not protect commercial speech at all.but there is no basis on which to conclude that the amendment of article i free speech clause incorporated what had transpired in the intervening years,including the united states supreme court first amendment commercial speech dichotomy with its then nonprotection for commercial speech.
advancing finally from to,when article i free speech clause was last amended,we yet again find no reason to reject protection for commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services.although the numerical designation was different,the language was absolutely identical.by,the united states supreme court,while retaining its commercial speech dichotomy in first amendment jurisprudence,had made a to hold that the first amendment right to freedom of speech did,in fact,protect commercial speech,albeit only somewhat.there is no basis on which to conclude that the amendment of article i free speech clause incorporated what had transpired in the intervening years,including the united states supreme court first amendment commercial speech dichotomy with its then,and current,somewhat protection for commercial speech 
the first question that we address is,does the california plum marketing program,issued by the california secretary of food and agriculture pursuant to the cma,implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under the free speech clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution by compelling funding of generic advertising 
the answer that we give is,no.
at the threshold,we note what hardly needs noting.although a corporation,gerawan may at least be deemed to possess a first amendment right to freedom of speech,whether or not it does so strictly speaking.that is because the interests served by its commercial speech about its plums extend beyond itself.such interests include those of its audience of consumer s,who may or may not choose to buy its fruit.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.see rubin coors brewing,d.such interests also include those of society in general.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.see rubin coors brewing,supra,at.the information so communicated is indispensable to the proper allocation of resources in a free enterprise system like ours.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.accord,rubin coors brewing,supra,at,because it literally informs the numerous private decisions that drive the system rubin coors brewing,supra,at,italics added accord.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.
as stated,the first amendment right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech,albeit only somewhat in comparison with noncommercial speech,including that which is political or ideological in character.it is implicated in speaking itself.it may also be implicated in the use of money.
the first amendment right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say,even about a lawful product or service,in order to render his message truthful and not misleading.see.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.consumer protection is the,the sole one.see,rubin coors brewing,supra,at.conc.opn.of stevens.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.when the commercial speaker message is already truthful and nonmisleading,however,compulsion of speech is not supported by the consumer protection rationale,but must be supported,if at all,by some rationale applicable to all speech,noncommercial as well as commercial.see,rubin coors brewing,supra,at.conc.opn.of stevens.
similarly,the first amendment right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not,even about a lawful product or service,in order to render his message truthful and not misleading.see.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.again,consumer protection is.see,rubin coors brewing,supra,at.conc.opn.of stevens.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.when the commercial speaker message is already truthful and nonmisleading,however,compulsion of funding is not supported by the consumer protection rationale,but must be supported,if at all,by some rationale applicable to all speech,noncommercial as well as commercial.rubin coors brewing,supra,at.conc.opn.of stevens,dealing with compulsion of speech.
it would therefore appear that,without more,the first amendment right to freedom of speech would not allow compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say,when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.
it would similarly appear that,without more,the first amendment right to freedom of speech would not allow compelling one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not,when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.
appearances,however,deceive.
in glickman,a majority sustained marketing order,issued by the united states secretary of agriculture pursuant to the amaa,against a challenge by gerawan,among others,that it violated their first amendment right to freedom of speech by compelling funding of generic advertising.
at the outset,the glickman majority stress ed the importance of the context established by the amaa.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.they also emphasized that marketing order was a detailed regulatory scheme that had displaced many aspects of independent business activity that characterize other portions of the economy in which competition is fully protected by the antitrust laws.ibid.it compelled gerawan and the rest to fund the generic advertising at issue as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently was already constrained.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.
the glickman majority stated that the central message of the generic advertising under marketing order was that california summer fruits are wholesome,delicious,and attractive to discerning shoppers.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.such generic advertising was evidently intended not to prevent or correct any otherwise false or misleading message in the interest of consumer protection,but solely to develop markets and promote sales in the interest of producer welfare.see id.at.
the glickman majority went on to conclude that marketing order did not even implicate,still less violate,the first amendment right of gerawan and the rest to freedom of speech by compelling funding of generic advertising.see glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at,fn.they considered the marketing order in question as merely a species of economic regulation,no more and no less,without any effect on the right at issue.id.at.they presume d that gerawan and the rest agree d with the central message of the speech that was generated by the generic advertising.id.at.they did not measure the marketing order against the right,but rather purported to distinguish the former out of the latter scope.id.at.
specifically,the glickman majority said that marketing order did not impose any restraint on any person freedom of speech glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.the fact that the order imposed assessments for generic advertising,which might indirectly lead to a reduction in one individual advertising budget,does not itself amount to a restriction on speech.id.at.
the glickman majority then said that marketing order did not compel any person to engage in any speech glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.it did not require anyone to speak himself or even to be publicly identified or associated with another message.id.at.
the glickman majority said,finally and crucially,that marketing order did not compel any person to fund any political or ideological speech glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.the generic advertising amounted only to commercial speech,encouraging consumers to buy the fruit indicated id.at.it could not be said to engender any crisis of conscience in political or ideological matters id.at.or to conflict with anyone freedom of belief in such areas id.at.any objection against the generic advertising as political or ideological in character,for instance,as promot ing socialistic programs id.at,fn,was trivial id.at.indeed,decisions such as abood and its progeny,including keller,stand for the proposition that a person who has lawfully been compelled to associate with others may be compelled to fund even political or ideological speech,without suffering a violation of his first amendment right to freedom of speech,if the political or ideological speech in question is germane to the purposes that justified the compelled association in the first place.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.the test of abood and keller would clearly be satisfied in this case because the generic advertising is unquestionably germane to the purposes of the marketing order glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.
speaking through the principal dissenting opinion,justice souter would have struck down marketing order as violative of the first amendment right of gerawan and the rest to freedom of speech.
justice souter concluded that marketing order did indeed implicate the first amendment right of gerawan and the rest to freedom of speech with respect to commercial speech.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter.
justice souter found doubtful the glickman majority assumption that gerawan and the rest did not disagree with the generic advertising.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter.he then found any such lack of disagreement immaterial what mattered was what speech a speaker chooses to fund or not to fund,not why he chooses to do so or not.id.at.dis.opn.of souter.
as for the glickman majority crucial assertion that marketing order did not compel any person to fund any political or ideological speech glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at,justice souter observed that the first amendment right to freedom of speech does not bar compelling a speaker to fund speech that he otherwise would not fund only when such speech would be political or ideological in when,in other words,it would engender in him a crisis of conscience glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.or conflict with his freedom of belief in such areas id.at.prior decisions such as abood and its progeny including keller happened to arise in the context of political or ideological mere fortuity but did not bar their application to commercial speech.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter.the fact that,under such decisions,a person who has lawfully been compelled to associate with others may be compelled to fund even political or ideological speech without suffering a violation of the right in question does not mean that he can be so compelled without experiencing any implication of the right at all.id.at.dis.opn.of souter.
justice souter then concluded that marketing order was subject to examination under the central hudson test,which considers whether a regulation restricting commercial speech serves a governmental interest that is substantial,directly advances such interest,and is not more extensive than necessary central hudson gas public serv.comm n,supra,at.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter.
justice souter finally concluded that marketing order did not survive muster under any of the three prongs of the central hudson test the marketing order did not serve a governmental interest that was substantial,as reflected in the fact that the amaa authorization of provisions therein for advertising,whether generic or otherwise,had been relatively late and spotty did not directly advance any such interest and was not narrowly tailored in the service thereof.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter,see id.at.dis.opn.of souter.
speaking through his own dissenting opinion,justice thomas would also have struck down marketing order as violative of the first amendment right of gerawan and the rest to freedom of speech.unlike justice souter,he rejected the central hudson test in and of itself as too lenient.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of thomas.
in sum,the glickman majority analysis results from,and results in,the proposition that the first amendment right to freedom of speech does not protect commercial speech against compelled funding.to quote justice souter,who was not challenged on the point,the glickman majority simply found no first amendment right to be free of coerced subsidization of commercial speech whatsoever.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter.
the soundness of the glickman majority analysis is open to serious question.
in its own terms,the glickman majority analysis lacks persuasiveness.its legal component is driven not so much by principled reasoning as by ad hoc distinguishing.its factual component is hardly better.for example,the majority express presum ption that gerawan and the rest agree d with the central message of the speech that was generated by the generic advertising glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at,to the effect that california summer fruits are wholesome,delicious,and attractive to discerning shoppers id.at,and their implied conclusion that such a central message id.at.is unexceptionable,appear to betray a certain lack of sophistication.to be sure,history has witnessed benefits accruing to producers of agricultural commodities from generic advertising.but it has also witnessed burdens imposed on them as a result.by way of illustration,when some producers,like gerawan,develop and use brands in marketing their goods,and others do not,the former may find themselves disadvantaged by generic advertising in their competition against the latter.generic advertising may portray goods as indistinctive in spite of brand,and may thereby minimize consumer desire to distinguish inter se.comment,the effect of glickman wileman brothers elliott,on nongeneric commodities a narrow focus on a broad rule san joaquin.even when no producers develop or use brands in marketing their goods,some may find themselves disadvantaged by generic advertising in their competition against others.generic advertising can be manipulated to serve the interests of some producers rather than others,as by allowing some to develop a kind of brand by means of funds assessed from all and then use it for their own exclusive benefit.thus,in any given case,a producer who objects to generic advertising may not be attempting to ride free on the funds of familiar may merely be making an effort to prevent others from hijacking his own funds as they drive to their own destination.
in addition,with virtual unanimity,commentators have subjected the glickman majority analysis to extensive criticism.see smolla nimmer,freedom of speech,to fried,perfect freedom,perfect justice,fn.cásarez,do tell me what to say compelled commercial speech and the first amendment,comment,glickman wileman brothers elliott,do put words in m y mouth new,comment,the effect of glickman wileman brothers elliott,on nongeneric commodities a narrow focus on a broad rule,supra,san joaquin.at recent speech and freer speech glickman wileman brothers elliott,d.pub.pol y,case note,constitutional advertising free speech or not even glickman wileman brothers elliott,d land,note,glickman wileman brothers elliot t,has the supreme court lost its way stetson,the supreme court,cases,but see kamenshine,reflections on coerced expression land,note,the demise of a workable commercial speech doctrine dangers of extending first amendment protection to commercial disclosure requirements.
for example,according to professor rodney smolla,a noted scholar of the first amendment,t he glickman decision was an unfortunate blip justice souter surely had the better of the argument.one can only hope that glickman will someday prove to be an errant aberration,and be overruled the court in glickman appeared unable to get past conceptualizing the case before it as essentially one of agricultural and economic policy,and for that reason failed to apply conscientiously the first amendment principles that ought to have resulted in marketing order being struck down.smolla nimmer,freedom of speech,supra,to.
for his part,charles fried,who was formerly solicitor general of the united states and is presently an associate justice of the supreme judicial court of the commonwealth of massachusetts,has stated that the court in glickman did not see what justice souter pointed out in dissent,that the convergent analogies of prior cases almost compelled a decision against the aspect of marketing order that the court upheld.fried,perfect freedom,perfect justice,supra.at,fn.
in the view of professor nicole cásarez,glickman constitutes a serious departure from traditional commercial speech and compelled speech analysis.the majority contextual approach resulted in a opinion based on a faulty premise that compelled commercial speech does not raise a first amendment issue this premise overlooks three settled first amendment principles first,that compelled speech is just as constitutionally suspect as restricted speech second,that paying for speech is constitutionally equivalent to speaking and third,that commercial speech falls within the scope of the first amendment.cásarez,do tell me what to say compelled commercial speech and the first amendment,supra.at.
all that we have said above,however,must be qualified by this although the soundness of the glickman majority analysis is open to serious question,its authority is not.we shall therefore apply it here as we must.
in its amended complaint,gerawan alleges facts,liberally construed,to the effect that it produces and handles plums plums constitute a lawful product it has developed,and uses,a brand for marketing purposes it engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising its message is not false or misleading it is nevertheless compelled by the california plum marketing program to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will and the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising.
under the glickman majority analysis,gerawan factual allegations are not sufficient even to implicate its first amendment right to freedom of speech against the california plum marketing program for compelling funding of generic advertising.
gerawan does not allege facts that would establish that the california plum marketing program imposes any restraint on its freedom of speech.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.that the compulsion of funding of generic advertising for plums as a commodity may,as it alleges,reduce the amount of money available for its own advertising of its own branded plums is not enough.the glickman majority stated plainly that any such reduction does not amount to a restriction on speech.id.at.gerawan no longer resists.
neither does gerawan allege facts that would establish that the california plum marketing program compel s it to engage in any speech.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.under the facts alleged,the california plum marketing program does not require gerawan to speak itself.id.at.gerawan does not assert that it does.under the same facts,the california plum marketing program does not require gerawan to be publicly identified or associated with the california plum marketing board message.ibid.here,gerawan does indeed assert that it does.it assumes that m ost consumers assume that the board speaks on its behalf.assumption upon assumption,however,does not amount to the allegation of a fact.
lastly,gerawan does not allege facts that would establish that the california plum marketing program compel s it to fund any political or ideological speech.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.it alleges that it disagrees with,and indeed abhors,the generic advertising,otherwise undescribed,on both political and ideological grounds,as socialistic and collectivist,and also on commercial grounds,as grouping all plums as though they are the same and as embarrassingly silly,idiotic totally ineffective.it objects to the generic advertising,but does not even allege facts as to its specific content.any aspects that group all plums as though they are the same,or that are embarrassingly silly,idiotic totally ineffective,are commercial in character.any aspects,however,that are socialistic and collectivist are indeed political or ideological.but they are not enough.the glickman majority stated plainly that any objection against generic advertising as promot ing socialistic or collectivist programs glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at,fn.has to be dismissed as trivial id.at.
against our conclusion,gerawan argues that the glickman majority analysis is,in fact,inapplicable.to no avail.
gerawan initially attempts to distinguish the cma,under which the california plum marketing program was issued,from the amaa,under which marketing order was issued.
although plainly not identical,the cma and the amaa,so far as the glickman majority analysis is concerned,are not materially different.since,the amaa underlying policies have included the establishing and maintaining of orderly marketing conditions for agricultural commodities in order to raise and support prices for their producers.the same is true of the cma underlying policies.since,the amaa has authorized marketing orders as regulations governing marketing matters for the producers and handlers of agricultural commodities.the same is true of the cma.the amaa authorization of provisions in marketing orders for advertising,whether generic or otherwise,has been relatively late and spotty.the same is not true,however,of the cma,whose authorization of provisions in marketing orders for generic advertising has been broad and ab initio.this fact marks a not one that is material or,apparently,even favorable to gerawan position 
gerawan then attempts to distinguish the california plum marketing program itself from marketing order.
gerawan quotes the glickman majority statement marketing order was a detailed regulatory scheme that had displaced many aspects of independent business activity that characterize other portions of the economy in which competition is fully protected by the antitrust laws,and accordingly compelled gerawan and the rest to fund the generic advertising at issue as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently was already constrained.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.gerawan then maintains that the california plum marketing program is not such a detailed regulatory scheme.ibid.
although plainly not identical,the california plum marketing program and marketing order,so far as the glickman majority analysis is concerned,are not materially different.marketing order,among other things,provided for the undertaking,by the plum commodity committee,of research and development projects,including advertising,and set out specific regulations regarding both fruit containers and packs and also fruit grades and sizes.the california plum marketing program provides for the undertaking,by the california plum marketing board,of research advertising,specifically generic advertising,along with sales promotion and market development and the institution and implementation of quality standards and inspections.it appears that a federal marketing order under the amaa might have regulated more broadly and deeply than a state marketing order under the cma.but marketing order did not in fact regulate so much more broadly and deeply than the california plum marketing program.
at bottom,gerawan would have us characterize marketing order as a regulation of economic activity with an incidental effect on speech and the california plum marketing program as a regulation of speech with an incidental effect on economic activity.we can not do so.contrary to gerawan assertion,the fact that the california plum marketing program earmarks percent of the funds assessed from producers for generic advertising along with sales promotion and market development,with only percent for quality standards and inspections and only percent for research,does not cause it to stand alone as a regulation of speech.
the second question that we address is,does the california plum marketing program,issued by the california secretary of food and agriculture pursuant to the cma,implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under the free speech clause of article i of the california constitution by compelling funding of generic advertising 
the answer that we give is,yes.
at the threshold,we note under article i free speech clause what we noted under the first amendment.although a corporation,gerawan may at least be deemed to possess an article i right to freedom of speech,whether or not it does so strictly speaking.people american automobile ins,supra,d at,semble.the interests served by its commercial speech about its plums,as we have explained,extend beyond itself to those of its audience of consumers and further to those of society in general.see jacoby state bar,supra,cal d at,fn.
as stated,article i right to freedom of speech protects commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services.it is implicated in speaking itself.it may also be implicated in the use of money.
we shall assume that,with the justification of consumer protection,article i right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say,even about a lawful product or service,in order to render his message truthful and not misleading.
we shall also assume that,with the justification of consumer protection,article i right to freedom of speech allows compelling one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not,even about a lawful product or service,in order to render his message truthful and not misleading.
even with such an assumption,article i right to freedom of speech,without more,would not allow compelling one who engages in commercial speech to say through advertising what he otherwise would not say,when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.
similarly,even with such an assumption,article i right to freedom of speech,without more,would not allow compelling one who engages in commercial speech to fund speech in the form of advertising that he would otherwise not,when his message is about a lawful product or service and is not otherwise false or misleading.
in its amended complaint,by way of restatement,gerawan alleges facts,liberally construed,to the effect that it produces and handles plums plums constitute a lawful product it has developed,and uses,a brand for marketing purposes it engages in commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising its message is not false or misleading it is nevertheless compelled by the california plum marketing program to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a commodity against its will and the compulsion of funding reduces the amount of money available for its own advertising.
under the law as set forth above,gerawan factual allegations are sufficient at least to implicate its article i right to freedom of speech against the california plum marketing program for compelling funding of generic advertising.gerawan commercial speech about its own branded plums through advertising concerns a lawful product,and is not itself false or misleading.yet,the california plum marketing program compels it to fund,against its will,commercial speech in the form of generic advertising about plums as a advertising that is intended not to prevent or correct any otherwise false or misleading message in the interest of consumer protection,but solely to develop markets and promote sales in the interest of producer welfare.
against our conclusion,the secretary of food and agriculture argues,in reliance on people teresinski cal d,hereafter sometimes teresinski,that there are no reasons to justify rejecting the glickman majority construction of the first amendment free speech clause as our construction of article i people teresinski,supra,cal d at.
in teresinski,the presence of all four of the following facts counseled against rejection of a decision of the united states supreme court there considered first,nothing in the language or history of the california constitutional provision in question suggest ed that the issue before us should be resolved differently than under the analogous federal constitutional provision.people teresinski,supra,cal d at.second,the decision in question did not overrule past precedent or limit previously established rights under the united states constitution.people teresinski,supra,cal d at.third,the decision was unanimous,and ha d not inspired extensive criticism.id.at.fourth,the decision,if followed by the courts of this state,would not overturn established california doctrine affording greater rights in the particular area.id.at.
here,by contrast,the absence of at least two of these four facts counsels in favor of rejection of the glickman majority analysis.
as for the fourth fact,counting from last to first,we acknowledge that the glickman majority analysis,if followed by the courts of this state,would not overturn established california doctrine affording greater rights in the area of commercial speech under article i free speech clause.people teresinski,supra,cal d at.such a result,however,is attributable solely to the fact that the precise issue here is one of first impression.
as for the third fact,however,we must observe that the glickman majority analysis was far from unanimous people teresinski,supra,cal d at,it garnered the support of only five of the court nine members,and provoked two of them to write dissenting opinions.we must also observe that the glickman majority analysis has in fact inspired extensive criticism people teresinski,supra,cal d at,the various treatises,articles,comments,notes,and case notes cited above stand as proof.
as for the second fact,we concede that,strictly speaking,the glickman majority analysis did not overrule past precedent or limit previously established rights under the first amendment free speech clause.people teresinski,supra,cal d at.such a result,however,is attributable solely to the fact that the precise issue there was one of first impression.all the same,the glickman majority analysis did indeed do violence to the law that it took into its hands.professor smolla the court in glickman failed to apply conscientiously the first amendment principles that ought to have resulted in marketing order being struck down.smolla nimmer,freedom of speech,supra,to.former solicitor general and now justice fried t he court in glickman did not see what justice souter pointed out in dissent,that the convergent analogies of prior cases almost compelled a decision against the aspect of marketing order that the court upheld.fried,perfect freedom,perfect justice,supra.at,fn.professor cásarez o verlook ing settled first amendment principles,glickman constitutes a serious departure from traditional commercial speech and compelled speech analysis.cásarez,do tell me what to say compelled commercial speech and the first amendment,supra.at.
as for the first fact,we can not agree that nothing in the language or history of article i free speech clause suggests that the issue before us should be resolved differently than under the first amendment as construed by the glickman majority.people teresinski,supra,cal d at.indeed,as we have shown,practically everything in such language and history mandates a different resolution.
focusing on language more than history,the secretary of food and agriculture claims that,for present purposes,article i free speech clause is not materially different from the first amendment.
the secretary point has been anticipated by our analysis above,which sets out the specific language of article i free speech clause in its precise setting and also its broad context in the world at large,and must yield to its force.
the secretary nevertheless attempts to make article i free speech clause similar to the first amendment,thus the first sentence of article i free speech clause every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right,art.i,subd.a is not implicated in this case because it assertedly grants only a right to freedom of speech,most narrowly defined,and then only against prior restraint.the second sentence of article i free speech clause a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press cal,art.i,subd.a is indeed implicated,and it is equivalent to the first amendment free speech clause.
the secretary attempt to make article i free speech clause similar to the first amendment collapses onto itself.
on its face,the secretary attempt is essentially an application of brute force.it simply removes what is unique to article i free speech clause the first amendment,and keeps what is common.it is different in degree,but not in kind,from making over section of article i of the california constitution,which states that a standing army may not be maintained in peacetime,into clause of section of article i of the united states constitution,which implies that such an army may indeed be maintained,through the simple expedient of deleting the adverbial particle not.
furthermore,in its substance,the secretary attempt proves unpersuasive.it appears to be rooted in the assertion,referred to above,that article i s free speech clause grants only a right to freedom of speech,most narrowly defined,and then only against prior restraint.
we must,however,reject any suggestion by the secretary that article i free speech clause can not be implicated in the use of money,but is implicated solely in speaking itself.as stated,even if money is not itself speech,it nevertheless enables speech.
we must also reject any suggestion by the secretary that article i free speech clause does not grant a right to refrain from speaking at all as well as a right to speak freely.again,speech results from what a speaker chooses not to say in addition to what he chooses to say.the secretary appears to argue,syllogistically,as follows a right that can not be abuse d does not exist cal,art.i,subd.a the right to refrain from speaking can not be abused therefore,the right to refrain from speaking does not exist.the conclusion does not follow because the minor premise,at least,is unsound.so far as commercial speech is concerned,and on the assumption that article i right to freedom of speech does not protect commercial speech in the form of false or misleading messages about even lawful products or services the right not to speak can surely be abused,and is in fact abused,whenever the speaker fails to speak and thereby renders his message false or misleading.griset fair political practices,supra,cal th at,fn,d,implying,in dictum,that failure on the part of a political candidate to identity himself in a mass mailing may amount to abuse of the right not to speak.
we must similarly reject any suggestion by the secretary that article i free speech clause does not grant a right to refrain from funding speech altogether as well as a right to fund speech meaningfully.again,speech results,through money enabling,from what speech a speaker chooses not to fund in addition to what speech he chooses to fund.the secretary apparently makes the same syllogistic argument as described above,with the same result.
in addition,we must reject any suggestion by the secretary that article i free speech clause grants a right to freedom of speech only against prior restraint.true,it does indeed grant a right against prior restraint but without any limitation thereto.certainly,that article i free speech clause grants a right to freedom of speech against prior restraint does not preclude a right against what we may call subsequent punishment.indeed,it effectively grants a right against subsequent punishment by effectively conferring immunity,save only for abuse cal,art.i,subd.a.moreover,a right against prior restraint could prove empty without a right against subsequent punishment,inasmuch as subsequent punishment might cause the speaker to impose a prior restraint,as it were,on himself,totally apart from even the threat of imposition of any prior restraint,properly so called,by another.likewise,that article i free speech clause grants a right to freedom of speech against prior restraint does not preclude a right against what we may call prior compulsion.one does not speak freely when one is restrained from speaking.but neither does one speak freely when one is compelled to speak.perhaps restraint has figured historically as a more familiar evil.but compulsion does not present itself analytically as a less pernicious one.
for all of these reasons,we must,and do,reject the glickman majority construction of the first amendment free speech clause as our construction of article i.as stated,the glickman majority analysis results from,and results in,the proposition that the first amendment right to freedom of speech does not protect commercial speech against compelled funding.any such proposition is simply untenable with respect to article i.the glickman majority found no right whatsoever under the first amendment to be free of coerced subsidization of commercial speech.glickman wileman brothers elliott,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter.we can not so find under article 
with that said,we must in fairness own to the force of a sentiment that appears to inform the glickman majority analysis.de minimis non curat lex is a maxim of ancient origin,old even in the infancy of the nation.ware hylton dall.opn.of iredell.it seems applicable to the first amendment free speech clause.see ellis railway clerks,d lehnert ferris faculty,supra,at.conc.dis.opn.of scalia,characterizing ellis as recognizing a de minimis exception see generally konigsberg state bar,supra,at.in our view,it seems applicable as well to article i.under its operation,we might conclude that,in a given case,compelling funding of commercial speech,including generic advertising,does not implicate any right to freedom of speech under article i if the funding compelled the commercial speech resulting therefrom are de minimis.in this case,the facts alleged are to the effect that the california plum marketing program is devoted largely to commercial speech in the form of generic advertising and to compelling funding therefor,earmarking percent of such funding to the underlying activity it compels gerawan itself to fund commercial speech in the form of generic advertising in excess of per year and it then engages in such speech in such form in excess of such amount from gerawan money alone.under facts like those alleged know not what facts may one day be can not conclude that compelling funding of commercial speech,including generic advertising,does not implicate any right to freedom of speech under article 
we turn now to the decision of the court of appeal,which affirmed the judgment of the superior court on its order granting,without leave to amend,the motion for judgment on the pleadings submitted by the california secretary of food and agriculture on the ground that gerawan amended complaint did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
at the threshold,we believe that the court of appeal was right to subject the superior court order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings,as it apparently did,to independent review.such a ruling is so scrutinized.smiley citibank,supra,cal th at,d,common law motion see schabarum.california legislature th,d statutory motion.it resolves a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law,whether or not the factual allegations that the plaintiff makes are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.smiley citibank,supra,cal th at,d,common law motion.the resolution of a question of this sort calls for examination de novo.id.at,d,same.
on the merits,however,we believe that the court of appeal was wrong to sustain the superior court order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
a trial court determination of a motion for judgment on the pleadings accepts as true the factual allegations that the plaintiff makes.smiley citibank,supra,cal th at,d,common law motion see rail employees burlington northern santa fe ry.th,d statutory motion.in addition,it gives them a liberal construction.see american airlines,county of san mateo cal th,d,without specification to common law or statutory motion rail employees burlington northern santa fe ry,supra,th at,d statutory motion.
an appellate court consideration of the ensuing determination by the trial court involves the same acceptance and liberal construction of the factual allegations in question.american airlines,county of san mateo,supra,cal th at,d,without specification to common law or statutory motion rail employees burlington northern santa fe ry,supra,th at,d statutory motion.
the court of appeal sustained the superior court order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings because it concluded that the california plum marketing program does not implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under either the first amendment free speech clause or article i.
we agree with the court of appeal in its conclusion that the california plum marketing program does not implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under the first amendment free speech clause,as construed by the glickman majority,by compelling funding of generic advertising.as we have explained,the california plum marketing program,and the cma pursuant to which it was issued,are not materially different for present purposes from marketing order,or from the amaa pursuant to which it was issued.marketing order was sustained by the glickman majority.the california plum marketing program must be sustained by us.
but we do not agree with the court of appeal in its conclusion that the california plum marketing program does not implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under article i by compelling funding of generic advertising.as we have also explained,article i free speech clause is indeed materially different for present purposes from the first amendment.the court of appeal attempted to render article i free speech clause similar to the first amendment by construing article i s free speech clause as it believed other courts had construed the first amendment.it construed article i free speech clause thus under a principle of deference,which it said operates when a state constitutional provision is similar in its language to a federal constitutional provision.quoting raven deukmejian,supra,cal d at.the principle referred to,however,is only general and not inexorable the deference indicated merely counsels voluntar y respectful consideration and does not mandate blind obedience,italics omitted.in any event,the language of article i free speech clause is simply not similar to the first amendment.rather,as shown,it differs from it substantially.los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d,accord,dailey superior court,supra,cal.at.
with our conclusion that the california plum marketing program does indeed implicate gerawan right to freedom of speech under article i,we bring the task before us to an end.the court of appeal conclusion to the contrary was necessary to its judgment.the former can not stand.the latter must therefore fall.
our conclusion,however,brings no conclusion to this cause.that the california plum marketing program implicates gerawan right to freedom of speech under article i does not mean that it violates such right.but it does indeed raise the question.that question,in turn,raises others,including what test is appropriate for use in determining a violation.and that question,in its turn,raises still others as well,including what protection,precisely,does article i afford commercial speech,at what level,of what kind,and,perhaps most difficult,subject to what test spiritual psychic science church city of azusa,supra,cal d at.to address such questions belongs,in the first instance,to the court of appeal on remand.it did not reach beyond the issue whether the california plum marketing program implicates gerawan right to freedom of speech under article i when the cause was before it originally.it will have the opportunity,and the obligation,to do so when the cause returns following our judgment 
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that we must vacate the judgment of the court of appeal,and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
i respectfully dissent.
the generic advertising component of the california plum marketing program challenged in this case is for all relevant purposes identical to the component that has been a part of numerous similar marketing programs that have existed throughout the nation for more than years,compelling all business enterprises in a particular industry to pay their fair share of the cost of generic,nonpolitical,and nonideological advertising of their agricultural products.as the majority recognizes,the challenged program also is for all relevant purposes identical to the generic advertising program that the united states supreme court,only three years ago,upheld in glickman wileman elliott,d glickman against a challenge under the first amendment of the federal constitution.although i agree with the majority that the protection afforded by article i,section,subdivision a of the california constitution hereafter article i,section a or the free speech provision is independent of and in some contexts greater than that provided by the federal constitution under the first amendment,i believe the majority has failed to demonstrate that the state constitutional provision imposes greater restraint on the state authority than its federal counterpart in the context presented by this case.
as i shall explain,other jurisdictions whose state constitutions contain free speech provisions similar to california have interpreted their constitutional provisions as not restricting the respective state authority to regulate commercial speech any more than does the federal constitution.in my view,there is no basis,either in the language or the history of california constitutional provision,that would justify interpreting article i,section a so as to afford an agricultural producer a greater right under the state constitution than under the federal constitution to obtain free rider status with respect to such generic advertising,to permit a producer to obtain the benefits from the generic advertising created under the marketing order without paying its fair share of the cost of such advertising.
moreover,even if i were to agree with the majority that we should reject the reasoning of glickman,supra,d,and hold that the marketing program here at issue implicates,ante,d at,at the state constitutional right of free speech under article i,section a,i would not remand this matter to the court of appeal to require that court first to determine,and then to apply,the correct standard of review for evaluating the validity of the marketing order impingement upon plaintiff state constitutional right to free speech.instead,i would hold that any impingement is subject to review pursuant to the test set out in abood detroit bd.of ed,d abood and keller state bar of california,d keller,and further that,under that standard,the challenged plum marketing program does not violate article i,section a.
in glickman,supra,d,the united states supreme court,in an opinion authored by justice stevens and joined by justices,kennedy,ginsburg and breyer,held that the first amendment is not implicated by a federal marketing order issued pursuant to the agricultural marketing agreement act of act of june,ch,stat.et as amended,codified at et that required an agricultural business to contribute to the costs of generic advertising of tree fruits.in reaching its decision,the court in glickman emphasized the context of the compulsory advertising program,noting that the industry was thoroughly regulated and collectivized in numerous respects.the court observed the tree fruits are marketed pursuant to detailed marketing orders that have displaced many aspects of independent business activity that characterize other portions of the economy in which competition is fully protected by the antitrust laws.the business entities that are compelled to fund the generic advertising at issue in this litigation do so as a part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently is already constrained by the regulatory scheme.it is in this context that we consider whether we should review the assessments used to fund collective advertising,together with other collective activities,under the standard appropriate for review of economic regulation or under a heightened standard appropriate for the review of first amendment issues.glickman,supra,at.
the court in glickman,supra,d,proceeded to explain that t hree characteristics of the regulatory scheme at issue distinguish it from laws that we have found to abridge the freedom of speech protected by the first amendment,at.
first,the court observed that fruit producers and handlers are not prevented from promulgating their own advertisements,and hence communicating their own message,to any audience.glickman,supra.the court rejected the argument that the assessments for generic advertising impinge on first amendment rights because they reduce the amount of money that producers have available to conduct their own advertising,at.the court explained this is equally true,however,of assessments to cover employee benefits,inspection fees,or any other activity that is authorized by a marketing order.the first amendment has never been construed to require heightened scrutiny of any financial burden that has the incidental effect of constraining the size of a firm advertising budget.the fact that an economic regulation may indirectly lead to a reduction in a handler individual advertising budget does not itself amount to a restriction on speech.ibid.
second,the court in glickman noted that no fruit producer or handler is compelled to engage in any actual or symbolic speech.glickman,supra.the court rejected the contrary argument our compelled speech case law is clearly inapplicable to the regulatory scheme at issue here.the use of assessments to pay for advertising does not require respondents to repeat an objectionable message out of their own mouths,citation,require them to use their own property to convey an antagonistic ideological message,citations,force them to respond to a hostile message when they would prefer to remain silent,citation,or require them to be publicly identified or associated with another message,citation.respondents are not required themselves to speak,but are merely required to make contributions for advertising.with trivial exceptions on which the court below did not rely,none of the generic advertising conveys any message with which respondents disagree.furthermore,the advertising is attributed not to them,but to the california tree fruit agreement or california summer fruits,at,fn.omitted.
finally,the court in glickman observed that the regulatory scheme differed from laws that have been found to implicate free speech rights,because in the case before it the generic commercial advertising did not force any producer or handler to endorse or finance political or ideological views with which he or she disagrees.glickman,supra.the court acknowledged,however,that a lthough this regulatory scheme may not compel speech as recognized by our case law,it does compel financial contributions that are used to fund advertising j ust as the first amendment prohibits compelled speech,it least without sufficient justification by the an individual to render financial support for others speech.citation.however,abood,supra,and the cases that follow it,did not announce a broad first amendment right not to be compelled to provide financial support for any organization that conducts expressive activities.rather,abood merely recognized a first amendment interest in not being compelled to contribute to an organization whose expressive activities conflict with one freedom of belief,at.glickman,supra,at.
the court in glickman continued r equiring respondents to pay the assessments can not be said to engender any crisis of conscience.none of the advertising in this record promotes any particular message other than encouraging consumers to buy california tree fruit moreover,rather than suggesting that mandatory funding of expressive activities always constitutes compelled speech in violation of the first amendment,our cases provide affirmative support for the proposition that assessments to fund a lawful collective program may sometimes be used to pay for speech over the objection of some members of the group.glickman,supra.the high court stressed that abood held that a union could not expend a dissenting individual dues for ideological activities not germane to the purpose for which compelled association was justified collective bargaining,at.the opinion in glickman also noted that in keller,supra,d a case involving bar association activities,the court had found that the compelled association and integrated bar were justified by the state interest in regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services and had concluded that t he state bar may therefore constitutionally fund activities germane to those goals out of the mandatory dues of all members.it may not,however,in such manner fund activities of an ideological nature which fall outside of those areas of activity.glickman,supra,at,quoting keller,supra,at.the court in glickman found the keller test clearly satisfied in the case before it,because the generic advertising of california tree fruit is unquestionably germane to the purposes of the marketing orders and,in any event,the assessments are not used to fund ideological activities.glickman,supra,at,fn.omitted.
summarizing its review of the three distinguishing characteristics discussed above,the court concluded in glickman n one of our first amendment jurisprudence provides any support for the suggestion that the promotional regulations should be scrutinized under a different standard from that applicable to the other anticompetitive features of the marketing orders.glickman,supra.based upon the highly regulated and collectivized context of the compulsory advertising program,and negative findings on the three factors mentioned above,the court in glickman found the marketing program to be a species of economic regulation,at.outside the reach of the first amendment,and subject to mere rational basis review.
despite the majority criticisms of glickman,ante,d at,at,it has failed to demonstrate that the high court was wrong in finding that,in this heavily regulated setting,the first amendment is not implicated by the compelled funding of generic advertising through a marketing order,and that such an order in this setting is merely a species of economic regulation.glickman,supra.
before and soon after adoption of the federal agricultural marketing agreement act of at issue in glickman,supra,numerous states enacted similar of which are in effect today in codified and superseding or amended,among other things,for assessments on many kinds of agricultural commodities,to fund generic advertising for those commodities,chs.idaho,ch,ch,me.laws,ch,ch.california california marketing act of,added by statutes,chapter,section,page et,codified at food and agricultural code,section et.cma or act is substantially similar to the other state and federal acts.the ensuing california plum marketing program here under review is likewise substantially similar to other marketing programs that have existed for decades throughout the nation.
the california act,like the federal legislation and that of many other states,creates a highly regulated environment that restricts the freedom of producers and handlers to act independently,for example by setting quality and ripeness standards for the marketing of products.in addition,and pertinent to our present inquiry,the california like the federal legislation and that of many other permits issuance of marketing orders for advertising campaigns regarding agricultural commodities grown in california,funded by compelled contributions.food.like producers and handlers under the federal program at issue in glickman,and like those operating under other programs that have existed for decades throughout the nation,producers and handlers of california plums have been compelled,through a resulting marketing order,to fund generic advertising as a part of a broader collective enterprise.glickman,supra.
as the majority acknowledges,the state legislation and the marketing program here at issue are not materially different from the program approved in glickman,ante,d at,at.the majority provides a partial description of this regulatory context,ante,at,at,but i believe that it is helpful to emphasize the regulatory scheme in greater detail,and hence quote below extensively from the court of appeal majority decision in this case 
the point of these the state and federal marketing programs is not simply to regulate the market the point is to preserve the agricultural industry.the laws reflect a political judgment that agriculture unlike bicycle manufacturing or clothing production,for be allowed to disappear from the american economy because of untrammeled market forces 
in this context,it is worth repeating at length the legislative findings that form the basis of the exercise of the police power of the state in the act it is hereby declared that the marketing of commodities in this state in excess of reasonable and normal market demands therefor disorderly marketing of such commodities improper preparation for market and lack of uniform grading and classification of commodities unfair methods of competition in marketing of commodities and the inability of individual producers to maintain present markets or to develop new or larger markets for commodities,result in an unreasonable and unnecessary economic waste of the agricultural wealth of this state.food.the foregoing described the result of unrestrained competition in the marketing of perishable commodities the legislature then stated that t hese conditions vitally concern the health,peace,safety and general welfare of the people of this state.food.
t he california marketing order here at issue insure s maturity,grade and accurate size labeling,in addition to providing mandatory funding of generic advertising i t is apparent from the foregoing legislative findings that maturity,grade and labeling standards directly displace the ability to compete using the traditional methods of different preparation for market and individualized grading and classification of agricultural commodities.
it is rational to control prices as a way to ensure both demand for the product and a supply of the product citation it is rational to control supply to ensure a demand sufficient to return a fair price citation and it is rational to stimulate demand so that the amount produced by suppliers brings a fair price.in each case,the fundamental assumption of unrestrained supply and demand together set the price in a free replaced with an assumption that regulatory modification of the supply necessary in the public interest.
this is the sense in which the glickman majority characterized the generic advertising campaign as not violating free speech protections,but merely as one of a number of available tools imbedded in a comprehensive regulatory program that impose s restraints on competition that arguably disadvantage particular producers for the benefit of the entire market.glickman,supra,at,fn.omitted.t he point of the glickman majority is that the advertising tool merely seeks to accomplish the same goals as equally or more invasive tools,such as price,quantity,quality and labeling restrictions no greater weight should be given to the fact that the advertising tool involves an activity that,in other contexts,is commercial speech protected by the first amendment.fns.omitted,italics added.
it is clear that the present case presents itself in essentially the same heavily regulated context that the majority in glickman found to be highly pertinent to its inquiry under the free speech clause of the first amendment.
the secretary of food and agriculture of the state of california argues that although our state constitution has independent force and we are not bound by the united states supreme court interpretation of corresponding provisions of the federal constitution,nevertheless,pursuant to people teresinski cal d,teresinski,we should give glickman respectful consideration and follow it under our own charter unless persuasive reasons are presented for taking a different course.teresinski,supra,cal d at.the majority implicitly concedes that pursuant to teresinski,unless there are cogent reasons not to follow glickman conclusion,we should adopt the high court approach in construing our own free speech clause,and hold that article i,section a is not implicated by the generic advertising component of the comprehensive commercial marketing program.
the majority discusses the factors that we identified in teresinski,supra,cal d,as relevant to whether we should construe a state constitutional provision consistently with federal construction of a corresponding provision of the federal charter,and concludes that,on balance,we should not follow the federal approach here,ante,d at,at.i am not persuaded.i shall address the four factors in order.
does the language or history of article i,section a suggest that the issue before us should be resolved differently from the way it was resolved under the first amendment in glickman teresinski,supra,cal d.the majority concludes that this factor weighs in favor of rejecting glickman and finding that the marketing program challenged here implicates article i,section a of our state charter.
if we were to consider article i,section a words in isolation,without regard to the provision history,and without considering the highly regulated context of the program here at issue,i might agree with the majority that the program presently challenged implicates article i,section a.but it is not appropriate to consider the text of the state constitutional provision in must consider it along with its history and context.in this regard,i emphasize the following 
the majority asserts that a s a general rule,article i,section a right to freedom of speech is broader and greater than that provided under the first amendment,and that only in exceptional circumstances does the state provision fail to afford greater or broader free speech rights,ante,d at,at.because the proper application of the state free speech clause necessarily must be determined on a basis,i am not convinced that it is helpful to attempt to quantify the question in terms of a general rule.nevertheless,on the basis of past decisions,it is incorrect to suggest that in all but exceptional circumstances the state constitution provides greater or broader protection for speech than does the first amendment.instead,at least in the numerous areas that have been litigated,california decisions applying the state free speech clause have more often than not concluded that the state provision affords no greater protection than that afforded by the first amendment.
for example,recently in los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles cal th,d,los angeles alliance,although emphasizing that our free speech clause is written in terms broader than the first amendment,we held that our provision offers no greater protection of solicitation speech,and that our state standard for determining the validity of laws is the same as the federal test.at,d.
similarly,for the past,we have interpreted article i,section a,or its substantively identical predecessors in numerous other contexts,as affording comparable but no greater protection for speech than that provided under the first amendment.see,brown kelly broadcasting cal d,and cases cited applying first amendment standards in defamation action under article i,section a,and holding that the state provision does not impose greater obstacles to recovery than what is required by the first amendment leoni state bar cal d,fn,upholding under both first amendment and article i,section a,with no different analysis for the state law claim,discipline imposed for certain unsolicited and misleading attorney advertising metromedia,city of san diego cal d,upholding under both first amendment and article i,section a,with no different analysis for the state law claim,a city ban on advertising billboards,revd.sub nom.metromedia,san diego,d loska superior court d.upholding under both first amendment and article i,section a,with no different analysis for the state law claim,ordinance prohibiting scalping by commercial ticket sellers on public property in re mares d,upholding under both first amendment and predecessor to article i,section a,with no different analysis for the state law claim,ordinance prohibiting sidewalk solicitation of magazine subscriptions pittsford city of los angeles d,upholding under both first amendment and predecessor to article i,section a,with no different analysis for the state law claim,ordinance prohibiting sidewalk distribution of commercial handbills see also wirta costa transit dist.cal d,noting that a long line of decisions has established the rule that commercial messages do not come within the orbit of the first amendment,and failing to suggest any different rule under the state constitution.
to be sure,we have held that article i,section a protects speech activity that the first amendment does not.robins pruneyard shopping center cal d,recognizing a right of free speech in privately owned large shopping center.but in light of the numerous cases cited above,upholding various regulations under both the first amendment and our state free speech provision,with no different analysis for the state law claim,this hardly supports the majority assertion that as a general rule,and absent exceptional circumstances,article i,section a,provides speech protection that is broader or greater than that afforded under the first amendment.
california has had for more than years the same core language in article i,section a the declaration that e very person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects.the majority asserts that this language affords greater protection to commercial speech than does the first amendment.
we have not been cited to any california decision prior to when the united states supreme court held there was no first amendment protection for commercial speech in valentine chrestensen,that recognized under article i,section a predecessors any greater protection for commercial speech than that afforded by the first amendment.from the filing of valentine chrestensen in,until,when the high court reversed itself and found that commercial speech enjoys some constitutional protection,subject to police power regulation.pharmacy bd.consumer council,d,our courts followed federal high court cases in upholding various commercial speech regulations.see,in re mares,supra,d.likewise,since no california decision has suggested that california protection of commercial speech is different in any respect from that provided under the first amendment.see,leoni state bar,supra,cal d,fn,metromedia,city of san diego,supra,cal d,loska superior court,supra,d.people superior court olson d.this history suggests that it would be quite suspect now to read into article i,section a,an expansive protection of commercial speech that the california courts have failed to discern again,the cases demonstrate that although our free speech clause is written in terms broader than the first amendment,california courts nevertheless have long interpreted it as providing no greater protection for commercial speech than is afforded by the first amendment.
finally,at least other states have constitutional provisions with language that is substantively akin to that contained in the free speech provision of article i,section a.see los angeles alliance,supra,cal th,fn,d.nothing in the briefs filed in this case,or in the majority opinion,suggests that the history and treatment of the provisions in those states differs significantly from the history and treatment in ours.it appears that until the united states supreme court held in that commercial speech is entitled to some level of protection under the first amendment,in the few instances in which a state constitutional free speech provision was advanced as a basis for challenging a law,the courts of these other jurisdictions simply followed high court decisions in upholding various state regulations of commercial speech,planned parenthood committee maricopa county,state lambert.although sister state decisions since regularly contain general comments to the effect that the language of their provision is broader than that of the first amendment see cases cited in los angeles alliance,supra,cal th,d,most our own see ante,d at,at have in practice interpreted their provisions as providing protection coextensive with the first amendment,state wicklund,supra,observing that numerous other states with virtually identical language have interpreted the free speech provisions of their constitutions as coextensive with that of the first amendment see also,at,fn.citing cases.with the possible exception of cases from oregon no decision of which i am aware from these other states has held that the state protection of commercial speech is greater than that provided by the first amendment and a number of decisions have concluded otherwise finally,like california,numerous other states long have had substantially similar agricultural marketing programs that have included compelled funding of generic advertising see ante,at,at,and in many of those jurisdictions courts have entertained and rejected diverse constitutional challenges to such programs,floyd fruit florida citrus commission,so.state enking idaho,miller michigan state apple commission,louisiana state department of agriculture sibille,so d wickham trapani,see also swisher brown,noting that states had upheld similar marketing acts.although amicus curiae participation in the present case has been extensive,no case from any of these numerous jurisdictions has been brought to our attention suggesting,much less holding,that a state constitution free speech clause provides protection for commercial speech in the context here at issue,when a person or entity i properly is required to associate with other business enterprises in conjunction with a regulatory scheme,and ii is required,in conjunction with that regulatory scheme,to help fund generic,nonpolitical,and nonideological commercial advertising that is germane to the purpose of the compelled association 
this considerable history,and the absence of a holding from any other state similar to the one proposed by today majority,suggest it would be inappropriate to now read into article i,section a,rights with respect to commercial speech that numerous other courts in numerous other analogous jurisdictions previously have failed to recognize.i believe that this first teresinski factor militates in favor of following the approach set out in glickman.
the final three teresinski factors yield the same conclusion.
does the federal decision in question overrule precedent or limit previously established rights under the united states constitution teresinski,supra,cal d.as the majority recognizes,the answer is no,ante,d at,at.this factor militates in favor of following the approach set out in glickman.
was the decision unanimous,and has it inspired incisive academic criticism teresinski,supra,cal d,italics added.glickman was closely divided and,like many high court opinions,it has been criticized,although it may be doubted whether the academic literature reflects the kind of incisive criticism contemplated in teresinski as the majority recognizes,the result reached by glickman also has support in the academic community,ante,d at,at.on the whole,this third factor does not provide a strong basis for declining to follow the reasoning of glickman.
the last teresinski factor presents the question if glickman is followed by our courts,would it overturn established california doctrine affording greater rights under article i,section a teresinski,supra,cal d.the majority again admits that the answer is no,ante,d at,at.as explained above,and as the majority acknowledges,at,fn,at,fn,there is no california precedent to overturn,because before today holding there simply was no decision establishing greater commercial rights under the state provision than are provided under the first amendment.further,although agricultural marketing programs,with their generic advertising components,have been in existence in california for many decades,no california decision has suggested that such programs pose constitutional problems under article i,section a.
accordingly,i conclude,contrary to the majority assertion,that the four teresinski factors militate in favor of adopting glickman approach in construing article i,section a.
as just explained,i am not convinced that we should disavow glickman in construing our free speech provision.if we were to follow glickman here,we would conclude that article i,section a is not implicated by the challenged marketing program.
nevertheless,the majority holds that article i,section a is implicated by the plum marketing program.having so concluded,however,the majority leaves for the court of appeal the task of attempting to resolve,on remand,whether the program actually violates the state constitution.this issue was fairly raised in the petition for review,it is well addressed in the briefs,and the majority fails adequately to explain why this court should not also determine the standard of review and then apply that standard in order to decide whether the state free speech provision is violated here.

the majority in glickman,supra,d,stated that had it concluded that free speech rights were implicated in the case before it,the appropriate standard of review would not be that set out in central hudson,supra,d,but instead the test used in abood,supra,d,and keller,supra,d,both of which addressed the compelled funding of speech.glickman,supra,fn.in abood and keller the high court was forced to determine whether it is permissible to compel the funding of contributions from individuals properly required to associate,and against objections that such funding implicated political or ideological matters and hence violated core first amendment rights of the persons compelled.the court in keller,following the test first set out in abood,approved compelled funding for state bar those that implicated political or ideological long as i the compelled association was justified in the first place by the need to regulat e the legal profession and improv e the quality of legal services,and ii the compelled funding from mandatory dues was for activities that were germane to those goals meaning that the challenged expenditures were reasonably incurred for those purposes.keller,supra.
consistent with the majority in glickman,i agree that if free speech rights are implicated here,the appropriate standard of review would not be the one developed to assess restrictions on commercial speech the central hudson test,but instead the test used to assess compelled funding of speech the test.accord,gallo cattle california milk advisory bd.cir,gallo case note,constitutional advertising free speech or not even glickman wileman brothers elliott,d land water,forced advertising.
although in its phrasing the test is plainly less exacting than central hudson intermediate scrutiny standard,still,as the majority in glickman implicitly reasoned,if the test is sufficient for the purposes of assessing core first amendment interests concerning compelled funding of political or ideological speech,the same test also should be quite adequate for the task here at hand,which concerns assessing the constitutional propriety of compelled funding of mere generic commercial advertising.
under abood and keller as applicable in this context,i believe that our inquiry and the conclusions we draw should be as follows 
i is there a legitimate basis for the compelled association yes.the interest in maintaining the stability of markets for california plums justifies legislation that allows producers and handlers to establish compelled associations designed to accomplish that goal.ii is the generic advertising program germane to the purposes of the marketing order here at issue yes.one purpose of the marketing order is to create and support a market for california plums.the advertising program clearly is germane to that purpose the costs of the advertising program are reasonably incurred keller,supra.to promote that goal.see gallo,supra,forced advertising,supra,land water.
in summary,assuming the program here at issue implicates article i,section a,it is subject to review pursuant to the test,and under that test the program does not violate article i,section a.
accordingly,i would affirm the unanimous judgment of the court of appeal,upholding the validity of the challenged marketing program under both the federal and state constitutions.

we recognize that our conclusions concerning article i free speech clause and commercial speech,which are set out in the text,have not been anticipated completely and in their entirety in prior california judicial decisions.that is because article i free speech clause and commercial speech were not considered on their own terms in any of these prior decisions,but only,for example,through the distorting lens of the united states supreme court commercial speech dichotomy in first amendment jurisprudence.see,leoni state bar cal d,fn,dealing with commercial speech under both article i free speech clause and the first amendment,but,in effect,construing and applying only the first amendment free speech clause and not article i metromedia,city of san diego cal d,revd.sub nom.metromedia,san diego,d same jacoby state bar,supra,cal d at,fn,same welton city of los angeles cal d,dealing with commercial speech solely under the first amendment free speech clause wirta costa transit dist.cal d,citing article i free speech clause,but dealing with commercial speech solely under the first amendment mckay jewelers,bowron cal d,dealing with commercial speech apparently under article i free speech clause as well as under the first amendment loska superior court d.dealing with commercial speech under both article i free speech clause and the first amendment,but,in effect,construing and applying only the first amendment free speech clause and not article i women internat.league.freedom city of fresno d.dealing with political speech over against commercial speech under article i free speech clause in re mares d,dealing with commercial speech under the first amendment free speech clause and perhaps also under article i pittsford city of los angeles d,citing article i free speech clause,but dealing with commercial speech under the first amendment alone people osborne,d supp,dealing with commercial speech under the otherwise unspecified constitutional liberty of speech,which may refer to article i free speech clause and perhaps also the first amendment.

whether,and how,article i free speech clause may accommodate government speech see ante,d at,fn,at,fn.is a question that we need not,and do not,answer.in its amended complaint,gerawan did not allege facts that would show that generic advertising under the california plum marketing is not so much a mechanism of regulation of the producers and handlers of an agricultural commodity by a governmental agency,as a mechanism of by the producers and handlers to speech of this sort.neither did the secretary of food and agriculture so claim in his motion for judgment on the pleadings.at oral argument,counsel for certain of the amici curiae supporting the secretary position attempted to raise the point.too little,too late.
because of the result that we reach,we need not,and do not,address the issue,which was raised before the superior court and the court of appeal,whether the california plum marketing program implicates gerawan right to freedom of association under either the first amendment or article i by compelling funding of generic advertising.
the court further explained congress enacted the agricultural marketing agreement act of amaa in order to establish and maintain orderly marketing conditions and fair prices for agricultural commodities.citation.marketing orders promulgated pursuant to the amaa are a species of economic regulation that has displaced competition in a number of discrete markets they are expressly exempted from the antitrust laws.citation.collective action,rather than the aggregate consequences of independent competitive choices,characterizes these regulated markets.in order to avoid unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices,citation,these orders may include mechanisms that provide a uniform price to all producers in a particular market,that limit the quality and the quantity of the commodity that may be marketed,citation,that determine the grade and size of the commodity,citation,and that make an orderly disposition of any surplus that might depress market prices citation.pursuant to the policy of collective,rather than competitive,marketing,the orders also authorize joint research and development projects,inspection procedures that ensure uniform quality,and even certain standardized packaging requirements.citation.the expenses of administering such orders,including specific projects undertaken to serve the economic interests of the cooperating producers,are paid from funds collected pursuant to the marketing order.citation.marketing orders must be approved by either of the affected producers or by producers who market at least of the volume of the commodity.citation.the amaa restricts the marketing orders to the smallest regional production areas practicable.citation.the orders are implemented by committees composed of producers and handlers of the regulated commodity,appointed by the secretary,who recommend rules to the secretary governing marketing matters such as fruit size and maturity levels.citation.the committees also determine the annual rate of assessments to cover the expenses of administration,inspection services,research,and advertising and promotion.citation.among the collective activities that congress authorized for certain specific commodities is any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising.citation.the authorized promotional activities,like the marketing orders themselves,are intended to serve the producers common interest in disposing of their output on favorable terms.the central message of the generic advertising at issue in this case is that california summer fruits are wholesome,delicious,and attractive to discerning shoppers.citation.all of the relevant advertising,insofar as it is authorized by the statute and the secretary regulations,is designed to serve the producers and handlers common interest in promoting the sale of a particular product.glickman,supra,fns.omitted.
at this point,the court explained in glickman we considered,in abood,supra,whether it was constitutional for the state of michigan to require government employees who objected to unions or union activities to contribute to an agency shop arrangement requiring all employees to pay union dues as a condition of employment.we held that compelled contributions to support activities related to collective bargaining were constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to labor relations,at.relying on our cases,however,the court found that compelled contributions for political purposes unrelated to collective bargaining implicated first amendment interests because they interfere with the values lying at the heart of the first amendment the notion that an individual should be free to believe as he will,and that in a free society one beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his conscience rather than coerced by the state,at.see also,at.glickman,supra.
phrased affirmatively,keller stands for the proposition that assessments to fund a lawful collective program may be used to pay for speech over the objection of association members so long as the if ideological or germane to the purposes for which the compelled association is justified.
even if i concluded otherwise on the merits,i could not endorse the tone of the majority criticism of the united states supreme court in glickman.

the assessments under the california plum marketing the assessments that have been imposed by other calculated based upon weight of produce marketed.currently,the assessment is set at a rate not to exceed cents per pound box of fruit.that sum is earmarked as follows cents for research,cents for quality standards and inspections,and cents for generic advertising,sales promotion,and market development.
akin to the antitrust immunity conferred under the federal programs see,ante,d at,fn,at,fn,california law expressly grants these producers and handlers a defense to any action alleging violation of state antitrust,unfair practices,unfair trade,or monopoly laws.food.
the impetus for the cma is well described in voss superior court th,d the cma constitutes a legislative entrustment of the power to regulate the marketing of agricultural commodities to those who produce or otherwise deal with such products,subject to the approval of the secretary.shimomura,a new look at the california marketing act of davis.it grew out of the chaotic conditions which characterized california agriculture during the early part of the twentieth century.id.at.before the promulgation of the cma,each of california many fruit and vegetable growers attempted to be the first in the market with his or her commodity,in order to take advantage of the premium prices paid on early shipments.this led to the marketing of inadequately ripened produce,and the glutting of the market during the peak season with poor quality commodities.deceptive packaging,improper sampling,and false grading were often resorted to in order to attempt to enhance the attractiveness of the produce.this unregulated scramble had an adverse effect upon consumer acceptance of california fruits and vegetables,and the unstable and fluctuating markets had an exaggerated impact on the livelihood of the state agricultural producers.id.at.the depression of only exacerbated these problems the prices paid to growers plummeted.id.at.
the legislature has described the purpose of the cma consistent with these findings and observations.the act is designed to a enable the producers of this state to correlate more effectively the marketing of their commodities with market demands for those commodities.b establish orderly marketing of commodities.c provide for uniform grading and proper preparation of commodities for market.d provide methods and means for the maintenance of present markets,or for the development of new or larger markets,for commodities that are grown within this state or for the prevention,modification,or elimination of trade barriers that obstruct the free flow of those commodities to market.e eliminate or reduce economic waste in the marketing of commodities.f restore and maintain adequate purchasing power for the producers of this state.g inform the general public of the processes of producing agricultural commodities.and h foster cooperation and understanding between urban and rural sectors of society.food.
i am unpersuaded by the majority attempts to invoke secondary historical sources as support for the conclusion that the drafters of california and constitutions,and the drafters of a later revision and a later amendment to the free speech provision,had in mind the need to protect commercial speech,at least in the form of truthful and nonmisleading messages about lawful products and services,ante,d at,at.the majority does not point to any direct evidence in the constitutional debates,revision records,or amendment materials,or otherwise to support its hypothesis see,ante,at,at,and it ignores the circumstance that the california drafters did not fashion a new free speech provision that fit the majority description of the distinctive culture of mid century california,but instead simply adopted the preexisting language of the corresponding new york constitution.i also note that the minnesota supreme court in state wicklund,recently conducted a similar historical review of its substantively identical provision,at and found nothing from either the d ebates and proceedings of the constitutional convention for the territory of minnesota or decisions of other states having similar or identical provisions to suggest that our state free speech protection was intended to be applied more broadly than its federal counterpart.that court concluded,t here is nothing inherent in the language of the state provision which requires more expansive protection for free speech than does the first amendment.at.

the majority does not assert that the student works that it cites reflect the requisite incisive criticism contemplated by teresinski,but instead focuses upon three professional articles.the first two of these materials do not offer incisive criticism.volume of smolla and nimmer,freedom of speech,much like some of the cited student works,contains primarily a detailed description of the various glickman opinions at,to,after which the authors announce,in conclusory fashion and with no independent analysis,that justice souter dissent presented the better argument.at.fried,perfect freedom,perfect justice,is even less substantive.there,at the conclusion of a published lecture on jurisprudential attempts to attain perfect freedom and perfect justice,the author does little more than mention,in a footnote that contains no independent analysis,his disagreement with the majority in glickman and agreement with justice souter dissent.at,fn.the third professional work relied upon by the majority,cásarez,do tell me what to say compelled commercial speech and the first amendment.cásarez,does indeed present a thoughtful critique of the contextual approach of the majority in glickman at,but these five pages of this one work hardly constitute the kind of incisive academic criticism contemplated by teresinski.
