this appeal presents a question that remains surprisingly unanswered by the circuit courts does the sale of an item via the ebay internet auction site provide sufficient minimum contacts to support personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant in the buyer forum state paul boschetto boschetto was the winning bidder for a ford galaxie sold on ebay by the,jeffrey hansing hansing for.boschetto arranged for the car to be shipped from wisconsin to california,but upon arrival it failed to meet his expectations or the advertised description.boschetto sued in federal court his complaint was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.we now affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
boschetto lives in san francisco,california jeffrey hansing resides in milton,wisconsin.id.chrysler,gordie boucher ford and boucher automotive group boucher defendants are private corporations with their principal places of business in wisconsin.the boucher defendants operate a website that advertises their auto dealerships although it is not alleged that this website was connected in any way with the transaction at issue in this case.hansing is an employee of one of the boucher defendants,frank boucher chrysler.the complaint avers that on august,all defendants owned and advertised a ford galaxie xl hp r code in awesome condition,not restored,rust free chrome in excellent condition,recently rebuilt and ready to be driven,with clear title,and a vehicle warranty number of.
the car was advertised for sale on the ebay internet auction site a copy of a portion of the ebay listing was attached to boschetto complaint.id.the ebay listing indicated that the item was located in janesville,wisconsin.boschetto bid for the galaxie on august,and was notified through ebay that same day that he was the winning bidder.id.boschetto and hansing communicated via email to arrange for delivery of the vehicle from wisconsin to california.boschetto ultimately hired a transport company to pick up the car in wisconsin it arrived in california on september.id.
upon delivery,boschetto discovered that the car was not an r code as advertised,and noted a variety of other problems,including a motor that would not turn over,rust,and extensive dents on the body of the vehicle.id.boschetto contacted ebay and hansing in an attempt to rescind the purchase,but those efforts failed.id.he filed a complaint in united states district court,northern district of california on february.boschetto alleged four state law causes of action violation of the california consumer protection act breach of contract misrepresentation and fraud,and pled jurisdiction pursuant to the federal diversity statute,a.
all defendants moved to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction.on july,the district court granted the motion.the district court reasoned that the lone jurisdictionally relevant contact with california,an ebay sale consummated with a california purchaser,was insufficient to establish jurisdiction over any of the defendants.although hansing used ebay to market the automobile,the district court observed that ebay acted not as a distribution center but rather as a virtual forum for the exchange of goods,and that in a standard ebay the one at issue in this item goes to whomever is the highest bidder,and so the ebay seller does not purposefully avail himself of the privilege of doing business in a forum state absent some additional conduct directed at the forum state.id.
the district court also rejected boschetto request to conduct additional discovery relevant to jurisdiction.id.noting its broad discretion to permit or deny such discovery,the court found that boschetto request for further discovery was premised on speculat ion without any support that the additional discovery would yield jurisdictionally relevant information.id.judgment was entered on july,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.personal jurisdiction 
we review a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo.see myers bennett law offices,cir.in opposition to a defendant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction is proper.see sher johnson,cir.if the district court decides the motion without an evidentiary hearing,which is the case here,then the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of the jurisdictional facts.id.citation omitted.absent an evidentiary hearing this court only inquire s into whether the plaintiff pleadings and affidavits make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction.caruth int l psychoanalytical ass n,cir.uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiff complaint must be taken as true.see at t,at.conflicts between the parties over statements contained in affidavits must be resolved in the plaintiff favor.schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir.
when no federal statute governs personal jurisdiction,the district court applies the law of the forum state.see panavision int l toeppen,cir.california statute is with federal standards,so a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction if doing so comports with federal constitutional due process.id.at.for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant,that defendant must have at least minimum contacts with the relevant forum such that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.schwarzenegger,at quoting international shoe washington.there are two forms of personal jurisdiction that a forum state may exercise over a nonresident jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction.we deal here only with the latter 
a.the district court correctly dismissed boschetto complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.
we apply a test to determine whether the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is appropriate 
the defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws 
the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant activities and 
the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial justice,it must be reasonable.
id.at citing lake lake,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden on the first two prongs.id.if the plaintiff establishes both prongs one and two,the defendant must come forward with a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.id.quoting burger king rudzewicz,d.but if the plaintiff fails at the first step,the jurisdictional inquiry ends and the case must be dismissed.see pebble beach caddy,cir plaintiff arguments fail under the first prong.accordingly,we need not address the remaining two prongs.
for part one of this test,we have typically analyzed cases that sound primarily in boschetto case a purposeful availment standard.schwarzenegger,at we often use the phrase purposeful availment in shorthand fashion,to include both purposeful availment and purposeful direction,but availment and direction are,in fact,two distinct concepts.a purposeful availment analysis is most often used in suits sounding in contract.internal citation omitted see also mcglinchy shell chemical,cir distinguishing purposeful direction precedents where personal jurisdiction is sought on a contract claim,not on a tort claim.to have purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum,a defendant must have performed some type of affirmative conduct which allows or promotes the transaction of business within the forum state.sher,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.our evaluation of the jurisdictional significance of a defendant contract or other business in the forum is not rigid and formalistic,but rather practical and pragmatic.burger king,at.w e have emphasized the need for a highly realistic approach that recognizes that contract is ordinarily but an intermediate step serving to tie up prior business negotiations with future consequences which themselves are the real object of the business transaction.internal quotation marks and citation omitted lake,at the first step of the specific jurisdiction analysis involves a qualitative evaluation of the defendant contact with the forum state.emphasis added.in doing so,we are guided by the supreme court admonition that the formation of a contract with a nonresident defendant is not,standing alone,sufficient to create jurisdiction.burger king,at.if the question is whether an individual contract with an party alone can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts in the other party home forum,we believe the answer clearly is that it can not.emphasis in original see also mcglinchy,at same.
here,boschetto fails at step one of the test for specific jurisdiction,as the lone transaction for the sale of one item does not establish that the defendants purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of doing business in california.the arrangement between boschetto and hansing which is,at bottom,a contract for the sale of a good,is insufficient to have created a substantial connection with california.hansing and assuming arguendo that they had any involvement in the transaction,the boucher defendants did not create any ongoing obligations with boschetto in california once the car was sold the parties were to go their separate ways.neither boschetto complaint nor his affidavit in opposition to dismissal point to any continuing commitments assumed by the defendants under the contract.id.nor did performance of the contract require the defendants to engage in any substantial business in california.on boschetto version of the facts,funds were sent to wisconsin and arrangements were made to pick up the car there and have it delivered to california.this was,as the district court observed,a affair.see compuserve,patterson,cir.as the supreme court has expressly cautioned,a contract alone does not automatically establish minimum contacts in the plaintiff home forum.see burger king,at.see also doe unocal,cir however,an individual contract with an party alone can not automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts to support personal jurisdiction.internal quotation marks and citations omitted travelers health ass commonwealth of.purposeful availment found if business activities reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships and obligations emphasis added 
ignoring the limited nature of the transaction at issue,boschetto attaches special significance to the fact that the transaction was consummated via ebay,noting that the ebay listing could have been viewed by anyone in california or any other state for that matter with internet access.but the fact that ebay was used as the conduit for this sale does not affect the jurisdictional outcome,at least not on the particular facts presented here.
in cybersell,cybersell,cir,we discussed with approval a sliding scale analysis that looks to how interactive an internet website is for purposes of determining its jurisdictional effect.in sum,the common thread,well stated by the district court in zippo,is that the likelihood that personal jurisdiction can be constitutionally exercised is directly proportionate to the nature and quality of the commercial activity that an entity conducts over the internet.quoting zippo zippo dot com.the plaintiff in cybersell relied on the fact that the defendant operated a website,accessible in the forum state,that contained allegedly infringing trademarks.at.the defendant website advertised its services but did not allow parties to transact business via the site.id.at.noting the lack of interactivity on the defendant website,the court concluded that the defendant had done no act and consummated no transaction,nor has it performed any act by which it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities,in arizona,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of arizona law.id.
the cybersell analysis,while persuasive where the contact under consideration is the website itself,is largely inapplicable in this case.here,ebay was used to create a listing for the sale of a good.based on a superficial application of cybersell,the ebay listing process and the sale it engenders is interactive.id.noting the lack of evidence suggesting that defendant website resulted in any business generation.but,as the district court noted,the issue is not whether the court has personal jurisdiction over the intermediary ebay but whether it has personal jurisdiction over an individual who conducted business over ebay.in cybersell and related cases where the internet site actually belongs to and is operated by the defendant,the nature of the website has jurisdictional significance because the website allows the defendant to maintain some ongoing contact with the forum state as well as every other state that can access the site.see zippo.at we are being asked to determine whether dot com conducting of electronic commerce with pennsylvania residents constitutes the purposeful availment of doing business in pennsylvania.here,the ebay listing was not part of broader activity the listing temporarily advertised a good for sale and that listing closed once the item was sold,thereby extinguishing the internet contact for this transaction within the forum state and every other forum 
moreover,boschetto does not allege that any of the defendants are using ebay to conduct business generally.he does not allege that defendants conduct regular sales in california or anywhere else via ebay.based on his own affidavit he named the boucher defendants based on a good faith belief that hansing may have been acting as their agent during the sale.but he does not go on to information and belief or either hansing or the boucher defendants are regular users of the ebay sales platform to sell their cars 
this is a distinction with a difference,as the cases that have found that jurisdiction was proper based on ebay sales relied heavily on the fact that the defendant was using the platform as a broader vehicle for commercial activity.see,crummey morgan,so d,evidence of two prior sales to louisiana residents in prior year dedvukaj maloney,d,although the court research has not disclosed any personal jurisdiction cases involving the use of ebay auctions as a commercial seller primary marketing vehicle,it is clear from the record that defendants use of ebay is regular and systemic.malcolm esposito,wl at,defendants are commercial sellers of automobiles who,at the time the bmw was sold,were represented on ebay as power sellers with transactions.
at bottom,the consummation of the sale via ebay here is a distraction from the core issue this was a contract for the sale of a good that involved the forum state only because that is where the purchaser happened to reside,but otherwise created no substantial connection or ongoing obligations there.see mcgee,at.the supreme court has,in the past,sounded a note of caution that traditional jurisdictional analyses are not upended simply because a case involves technological developments that make it easier for parties to reach across state lines.volkswagen woodson,d w e have never accepted the proposition that state lines are irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes,nor could we,and remain faithful to the principles of interstate federalism embodied in the constitution.the use of ebay no doubt made it far easier to reach a california buyer,but the ease with which boschetto was contacted does not determine whether the nature and quality of the defendants contacts serve to support jurisdiction.that is not to say that the use of ebay digs a virtual moat around the defendant,fending off jurisdiction in all cases.where ebay is used as a means for establishing regular business with a remote forum such that a finding of personal jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,international shoe,at,then a defendant use of ebay may be properly taken into account for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction.see crummey,so d at dedvukaj,d at malcolm,wl at.but on the facts of this use of ebay as the conduit for that transaction does not have any dispositive effect on jurisdiction
