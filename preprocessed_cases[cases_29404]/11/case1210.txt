factual and procedural history 
the county of san diego enacted the ordinance to establish comprehensive guidelines for the placement,design and processing of wireless telecommunications facilities in all zones within the county of san diego.san diego county ordinance.the ordinance categorizes applications for wireless telecommunications facilities into four tiers,depending primarily on the visibility and location of the proposed facility.san diego county zoning ordinance.for example,an application for a structure in an industrial zone generally must meet lesser requirements than an application for a large tower in a residential zone.id.
regardless of tier,the ordinance imposes substantive and procedural requirements on applications for wireless facilities.for example,poles are prohibited in residential and rural zones certain height and setback restrictions apply in residential zones and no more than three facilities are allowed on any site,unless a finding is made that of more facilities is consistent with community character.id.an applicant is required to identify the proposed facility geographic service area,to submit a visual impact analysis,and to describe various technical attributes such as height,maintenance requirements,and acoustical information,although some exceptions apply.id.the proposed facility must be located within specified preferred zones or preferred locations,unless those locations are not technologically or legally feasible or a finding is made that the proposed site is preferable due to aesthetic and community character compatibility.id.the proposed facility also must meet many design requirements,primarily related to aesthetics.id.the applicant also must perform regular maintenance of the facility,including graffiti removal and proper landscaping.id.
general zoning requirements also apply.for example,hearings are conducted before a permit is granted,id,and on appeal,if requested,id.h.before a permit is granted,the zoning board must find 
that the location,size,design,and operating characteristics of the proposed use will be compatible with adjacent uses,residents,buildings,or structures,with consideration given to 
harmony in scale,bulk,coverage and density 
the availability of public facilities,services and utilities 
the harmful effect,if any,upon desirable neighborhood character 
the generation of traffic and the capacity and physical character of surrounding streets 
the suitability of the site for the type and intensity of use or development which is proposed and to 
any other relevant impact of the proposed use.
id.a.the retains discretionary authority to deny a use permit application or to grant the application conditionally.id.
soon after the county enacted the ordinance,sprint brought this action,alleging that the ordinance violates a because,on its face,it prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting sprint ability to provide wireless telecommunications services.sprint sought injunctive and declaratory relief under the supremacy clause and,and damages and attorney fees under.the county argued that a did not apply to the ordinance,because c exclusively governs wireless regulations,and that,in any event,the ordinance is not an effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services.the county also argued that damages and attorney fees are unavailable because congress did not create a private right of action enforceable under.
the district court first held that facial challenges to a local government wireless regulations could be brought under either a or c,because neither is exclusive.the district court next held,relying on our decision in city of auburn qwest,cir,that the ordinance violated a.the district court therefore permanently enjoined the county from enforcing the ordinance against sprint.finally,the district court held that a claim under for a violation of a was not cognizable and granted summary judgment to the county on that claim.the parties.a panel of this court affirmed,and we granted rehearing en banc.

discussion 
sprint argues that,on its face,the ordinance prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless telecommunications services,in violation of the act.as a threshold issue,the parties dispute which provision of the a or c b i ii applies to this case.

when congress passed the act,it expressed its intent to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.stat.at see also ting,at t he purpose of the act is to provide for a,deregulatory national policy framework by opening all telecommunications markets to competition.quoting,at conf,reprinted in.the act represents a dramatic shift in the nature of telecommunications regulation.cablevision of boston,pub.improvement comm n,cir see also ting,at characterizing the act as a dramatic break with the past.congress chose to end the states longstanding practice of granting and maintaining local exchange monopolies.at t iowa utils,d thomas,concurring in part,dissenting in part.
congress did so by enacting,a new statutory section that preempts state and local regulations that maintain the monopoly status of a telecommunications service provider.see cablevision of boston,at congress apparently feared that some states and municipalities might prefer to maintain the monopoly status of certain providers section a takes that choice away from them.section a states no state or local statute or regulation,or other state or local legal requirement,may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.
the act also contained new provisions applicable only to wireless telecommunications service providers.the house originally proposed legislation requiring the federal communications commission fcc to regulate directly the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities.see.i,at,reprinted in.but the house and senate conferees decided instead to preserve the authority of state and local governments over zoning and land use matters except in the limited circumstances set forth in the conference agreement,at conf,reprinted in.
accordingly,at the same time,congress also enacted c.section c a preserves the authority of local governments over zoning decisions regarding the placement and construction of wireless service facilities,subject to enumerated limitations in c b.one such limitation is that local regulations shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.id.c b i ii.
