the federal trade commission ftc sued commerce planet,and three of its top officers for violating a of the ftc act,which prohibits unfair or deceptive business practices.a.the company and two of the individual defendants settled with the ftc.the remaining defendant,appellant charles gugliuzza,elected to stand trial.after a day bench trial,the district court found that commerce planet had violated a and held gugliuzza,the company former president,personally liable for the company unlawful conduct.the court permanently enjoined gugliuzza from engaging in similar misconduct and ordered him to pay million in restitution.
in a memorandum disposition filed together with this opinion,we reject gugliuzza challenges to the district court liability ruling.we address here his arguments contesting the validity of the restitution award 
the ftc brought suit to enjoin commerce planet deceptive marketing of a product called onlinesupplier.the company touted onlinesupplier as a service that would enable consumers to make money by selling products online.the company charged a membership fee for the service that ranged over time from to per month.
commerce planet sold onlinesupplier through its website.the landing page for the website,however,said nothing about onlinesupplier.what consumers saw instead was an offer for a free online auction starter kit that explained how they could sell products on ebay.to obtain the starter kit,consumers needed to enter their shipping address and a valid credit card number to pay for shipping and handling for standard delivery,for expedited delivery.buried in the fine print for this transaction was an advisement stating that,by ordering the free starter kit,consumers were also agreeing to purchase onlinesupplier through what is known as a negative option.here,that meant consumers received onlinesupplier at no charge during a day trial period,but if they failed to take affirmative steps to cancel within that period the company automatically charged their credit cards for the recurring monthly membership fee.many consumers did not realize that by ordering the free starter kit they had also agreed to purchase onlinesupplier.they first learned of that fact when the monthly charges for the service began showing up on their credit card bills.
the district court found that commerce planet failure to adequately disclose the negative option constituted an unfair and deceptive practice that violated a of the ftc act.in addition,the court held gugliuzza personally liable for the company unlawful conduct during the period he exercised operational control over the company,first as a consultant and then as the company president.throughout that period gugliuzza oversaw and directed the marketing of onlinesupplier,which included reviewing and approving the manner in which the negative option was disclosed to consumers.
in addition to enjoining future unlawful conduct,the district court ordered gugliuzza to pay million in restitution.the court arrived at that figure by determining that commerce planet net revenues from the sale of onlinesupplier during the relevant period totaled million.the court credited gugliuzza assertion that it would be unfair to assume that all consumers who purchased onlinesupplier were deceived by the company inadequate disclosure of the negative option.but because gugliuzza failed to offer any reliable method of determining how many consumers were not deceived,the court relied on testimony from one of the ftc experts,who opined that most consumers would have been deceived by the manner in which the negative option was disclosed.based on that testimony,the court estimated as a conservative floor that at least half the consumers who purchased onlinesupplier were deceived by commerce planet marketing practices.the court therefore reduced the restitution award to million,of the net revenues commerce planet received from the sale of onlinesupplier during the relevant period.
gugliuzza challenges the validity of the restitution award on two fronts.first,he contends that the district court either lacked the authority to award restitution at all or at the very least had to limit the award to the unjust gains he personally received,which in this case totaled roughly million.second,gugliuzza argues that even if he can be held liable for restitution exceeding his own unjust gains,the district court million award is nonetheless arbitrary and must be reduced.
the district court had the authority to award restitution under b of the ftc act.section b provides in relevant part that in proper cases the commission may seek,and after proper proof,the court may issue,a permanent injunction.b.although this provision mentions only injunctive relief,we have held that it also empowers district courts to grant any ancillary relief necessary to accomplish complete justice,including restitution.ftc pantron i,cir quoting ftc singer,cir.
we grounded this holding on the supreme court decision in porter warner holding.that case involved an action brought by the government under a of the emergency price control act of.the government sued to enjoin the defendant from charging excessive rents in violation of the act and to obtain restitution of the excess rents already collected.the defendant argued that a did not authorize an award of restitution,as the statute spoke only of applications for a permanent or temporary injunction,restraining order,or other order.id.at.the court disagreed.it held that by authorizing the issuance of injunctive relief,the statute invoked the court equity jurisdiction,which carries with it all the inherent equitable powers of the district court unless the act provided otherwise.id.at.those equitable powers are comprehensive.to ensure that complete rather than truncated justice is done,a court sitting in equity may go beyond the matters immediately underlying its equitable jurisdiction and decide whatever other issues and give whatever other relief may be necessary under the circumstances.id.that is especially true in cases involving the public interest,the court held,such as actions brought by the government to enforce a regulatory statute.in those cases the court equitable powers assume an even broader and more flexible character than when only a private controversy is at stake.id.moreover,limitations on the court equitable jurisdiction are not to be casually inferred.unless a statute in so many words,or by a necessary and inescapable inference,restricts the court jurisdiction in equity,the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.id.
in light of these principles,the court had little difficulty concluding that ordering a defendant to pay restitution fell comfortably within the scope of the broad equitable authority conferred by a.nothing is more clearly a part of the subject matter of a suit for an injunction than the recovery of that which has been illegally acquired and which has given rise to the necessity for injunctive relief.id.at.indeed,ordering a defendant to return unjust gains,the court noted,is within the highest tradition of a court of equity.id.at.
under porter and our cases applying it,district courts have the power to order payment of restitution under b of the ftc act.the equitable jurisdiction to enjoin future violations of a carries with it the inherent power to deprive defendants of their unjust gains from past violations,unless the act restricts that authority.we see nothing in the act that does.
gugliuzza contends that b of the ftc act,b,eliminates a court power to award restitution under b,but we have refused to read b in that manner for one thing,itself states that the r emedies provided in this section are in addition to,and not in lieu of,any other remedy or right of action provided by state or federal law.e see singer,at.for another thing,the court in porter rejected essentially the same argument gugliuzza makes here.the defendant in that case argued that courts could not award restitution under a of the emergency price control act because a separate provision of the act e authorized suits by the government to recover damages.the court held that,to the extent a court exercising its equitable jurisdiction under a might otherwise have been able to award damages,e supersedes that possibility and provides an exclusive remedy relative to damages.porter,at.however,e in no way eliminated a court power under a to award restitution,a remedy that differs greatly from the damages remedy available under e.id.at.we think the same can be said of the relationship between b and b of the ftc act.while b precludes a court from awarding damages when proceeding under b,it does not eliminate the court inherent equitable power to order payment of restitution.
gugliuzza also contends that,even if a court may award restitution under b,any such award must be limited to the unjust gains each defendant personally received.we find no support in our case law for this proposition.restitution does involve the return to the plaintiff of gains a defendant has unjustly received.restatement third of restitution and unjust enrichment cmt.a.but the relevant question in a case like this one in which an individual defendant violates the ftc act by acting in concert with a corporate entity is whether the individual may be held personally liable for restitution of the corporation unjust gains.the answer is yes provided the requirements for imposing joint and several liability are satisfied,and here they are.
we have established a test for determining when an individual may be held personally liable for corporate violations of the ftc act.that test requires the ftc to prove that the individual participated directly in,or had the authority to control,the unlawful acts or practices at issue and had actual knowledge of the misrepresentations involved,was recklessly indifferent to the truth or falsity of the misrepresentations,or was aware of a high probability of fraud and intentionally avoided learning the truth.ftc network services depot,cir ftc stefanchik,cir.the district court found that the ftc proof satisfied both prongs of this test and,as explained in the accompanying memorandum disposition,those findings are adequately supported by the record.
if an individual may be held personally liable for corporate violations of the ftc act under this test,nothing more need be shown to justify imposition of joint and several liability for the corporation restitution obligations.satisfaction of the test establishes the degree of collaboration between necessary to justify joint and several liability in analogous contexts,such as actions brought by the securities and exchange commission sec to obtain disgorgement in securities fraud cases.see,sec first pacific bancorp,cir hateley sec,cir.for that reason,in actions brought by the ftc,we have repeatedly held individuals jointly and severally liable for a corporation restitution obligations without requiring an evidentiary showing beyond the findings needed to satisfy the test described above.see network services depot,at stefanchik,at,ftc publishing clearing house,cir ftc gill,cir joint and several liability for two individual.
notwithstanding the cases just cited,gugliuzza contends that a court exercising its inherent equitable powers under b lacks authority to impose joint and several liability because that is a form of liability only the law courts could impose.gugliuzza is wrong.equity courts have long exercised the power to impose joint and several liability,most notably in cases involving breach of the duties imposed by trust law.see,jackson smith.restatement of trusts cmt.a john norton pomeroy,a treatise on equity jurisprudence,at ed.we therefore see no basis for holding that courts are categorically precluded from imposing joint and several liability in actions brought under b.
because joint and several liability is permissible,restitution awards need not be limited to the funds each defendant personally received from the wrongful conduct,as gugliuzza urges.defendants held jointly and severally liable for payment of restitution are liable for the unjust gains the defendants collectively received,even if that amount exceeds as it usually will what any one defendant pocketed from the unlawful scheme.indeed,we have previously upheld joint and several liability for payment of restitution even though the award exceeded the unjust gains any individual defendant personally received.see network services depot,at stefanchik,at gill,at.the same is true in disgorgement actions brought by the sec,cases in which courts also exercise the broad equitable powers described in porter.there,too,courts have upheld disgorgement orders imposed jointly and severally that exceeded the unjust gains any one defendant personally received.see,sec platforms wireless international,cir sec clark,cir.
gugliuzza argument against joint and several liability rests primarily on great west life annuity insurance knudson,d,but we do not think that decision has any bearing on the analysis here.in great west,the court interpreted the meaning of the phrase other appropriate equitable relief in a of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a,a provision that authorizes suits by private parties alleging violations of duties.the court held that a plaintiff may obtain an award of restitution under that provision only if the plaintiff seeks equitable rather than legal restitution.at.equitable restitution requires tracing the money or property the plaintiff seeks to recover to identifiable assets in the defendant possession thus permitting imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien,whereas legal restitution seeks imposition of a merely personal liability upon the defendant to pay a sum of money.id.at quoting restatement of restitution cmt.a.
gugliuzza concedes correctly that the tracing requirements for equitable restitution do not apply in b actions.see ftc bronson partners,llc,cir.adopting those tracing requirements would greatly hamper the ftc enforcement efforts by,among other things,precluding restitution of any funds the defendant has wrongfully obtained but already managed to spend on items.see montanile board of trustees of the national elevator industry health benefit plan,d.we have never applied that rule in b cases.
given gugliuzza concession that tracing requirements do not apply,it is far from clear what relevance he contends great west has to this case.he appears to argue contrary to his concession that courts proceeding under b must make the same fine distinction between legal and equitable restitution required under erisa a.great west,at.we take a different view.
the court holding in great west relied heavily on mertens hewitt associates,d,where the court stated that the phrase other appropriate equitable relief could be construed to mean one of two things either whatever relief a court of equity is empowered to provide in the particular case at issue,or,more narrowly,only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity.id.at.the court felt compelled to adopt the latter,more narrow reading because it assumed that congress intended equitable relief as a limitation on the relief available under a.because equity courts could award all forms of relief whether legal or equitable for breach of trust,the court thought reading the phrase equitable relief to mean whatever relief a court of equity could provide would limit the relief not at all.id.at.
the interpretive constraints facing the court in great west and mertens are wholly absent here.we do not have before us a statute that limits the court to providing equitable relief.section b invokes a court equity jurisdiction by authorizing issuance of injunctive relief,so absent a clear limitation expressed in the statute,congress is deemed to have authorized issuance of whatever relief a court of equity is empowered to provide in the particular case at issue.mertens,at.that includes the power to award complete relief even though the decree includes that which might be conferred by a court of law,porter,at,such as monetary relief that would traditionally be viewed as legal.dan dobbs,law of remedies,at ed.absent a clear textual basis for doing so,reading into b the remedial limitations imposed in great west and mertens would be particularly,gi
