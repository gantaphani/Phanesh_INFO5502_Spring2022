plaintiffs,producers of walnuts,appeal the trial court order striking all class action allegations from their complaint.plaintiffs claim that a class action waiver in their arbitration agreements with defendant,a walnut processor,was unconscionable.the trial court disagreed with their argument,as do we.we affirm the trial court order.
allegations 
for purposes of this appeal,we assume all factual allegations in the complaint are true.
plaintiff walnut producers of california producers is a nonprofit cooperative marketing association.its members are persons and entities who grow walnuts.its members have assigned to it all of their claims against the defendant.
plaintiff george miller ranch,miller ranch is a corporation engaged in the production of walnuts.
defendant diamond foods,diamond foods is the successor by way of merger to an agricultural cooperative known as the diamond walnut growers,the.diamond foods had been a wholly owned subsidiary of the.
prior to,the members would deliver their walnut crops to the,and they would be paid on a cooperative crop pool basis based on the net proceeds generated by the sale of the walnuts.
in,diamond foods proposed the merger with the.as part of that process,it gave to the members a proposed walnut purchase agreement the agreement that it would use with the members.the agreement would replace the marketing agreements that existed between the and its members once the ceased to exist.
on july,the members approved the merger with diamond foods.with the cancellation of the marketing agreements,the members needed to find an entity to purchase their walnuts.they could either deliver their crops to diamond foods as arm length suppliers pursuant to the terms of the agreement or,because smaller processors did not have sufficient capacity to process the members crops,they could let their crops fall to the ground and go to waste.
the agreement was presented to the growers on a basis without an explanation of its terms and without an opportunity to negotiate its terms.with no real options available to them,most of the growers had no choice but to sign the agreement.approximately percent of the members,including miller ranch,signed the agreement 
under the agreement,the growers agreed to sell,and diamond ranch agreed to buy,their entire crop of walnuts each year during the agreement term.the agreement terms were for three,five,or ten years.the agreement did not set forth a purchase price.rather,it provided that diamond foods would establish the price in good faith each year following the harvest,taking into account market conditions,quality,variety,and other relevant factors.
this appeal concerns the agreement dispute resolution requirements and,in particular,its prohibition of class actions.the agreement in general requires all disputes to be resolved by binding arbitration.it specifically prohibits any type of class action as follows each dispute will be resolved based upon its own facts and merits,and no procedure in the nature of class actions will be permitted.
plaintiffs filed this action in,alleging diamond foods breached the agreement by failing to pay them the reasonable market value for their walnuts,the price plaintiffs alleged the agreement required.plaintiffs sought damages,reformation and declaratory relief.despite the agreement class action waiver,plaintiffs brought this action as a class action on behalf of all california walnut growers who executed the agreement with diamond foods,a class of growers in excess of persons and entities.
of relevance here,plaintiffs sixth cause of action sought declaratory relief that the agreement dispute resolution clauses,including the class action waiver,were unenforceable and unconscionable.plaintiffs contended the class action waiver was unconscionable because the agreement was a contract of adhesion,and the prohibition effectively insulated diamond foods from any liability towards the growers for its wrongful conduct.
diamond foods filed a motion to strike all class allegations contained in the complaint.it argued the agreement class action waiver was enforceable and that plaintiffs could not demonstrate as a matter of law that the waiver was unconscionable.diamond foods also filed a demurrer.
the trial court granted the motion to strike the class allegations,and it sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.the court did not state its reasoning.
plaintiffs appeal from the trial court order granting the motion to strike the class allegations.they claim the doctrine of unconscionability applies to commercial contracts,they successfully pleaded facts showing the agreement is an adhesion contract,and the agreement arbitration provisions,including the class action waiver,are unconscionable 
discussion 
istandard of review 
initially,we must determine which standard of review applies to this appeal.plaintiffs argue we are to review the trial court decision de novo.diamond foods asserts we are to review the court decision only for an abuse of discretion.we agree with plaintiffs.
generally,an order granting a motion to strike is not an appealable order.yandell city of los angeles cal,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.and when the order is reviewed on appeal following entry of final judgment,the appellate court usually applies the abuse of discretion standard.quiroz seventh center th.
this case,however,is not the usual case.the trial court order is appealable in this instance because it effectively was a final judgment.the order struck all class allegations from the complaint,essentially dismissing the action as to all members of the purported class other than the named plaintiffs.such an order is appealable,even if made at the pleading stage.whatever its form,an order that has the effect of denying certification as a class action disposes of that action and is an appealable final judgment.prince cls transportation,th,fn.
moreover,our review of this particular order is de novo.although an appeal from a denial of class certification is subject to an abuse of discretion standard drug stores,superior court cal th,diamond foods motion did not attack plaintiffs factual allegations regarding the merits of certifying the class.instead,it argued the class allegations should be stricken because plaintiffs did not successfully allege,and could not as a matter of law allege,facts showing that the class action waiver in the agreement was unconscionable.the motion was akin to a general demurrer,the sustaining of which without leave to amend we would review as a question of law after assuming all factual allegations to be true.brunius parrish th.
civil code section requires a trial court to make a preliminary determination of whether a contract may be unconscionable.if it finds the contract may be unconscionable,it must afford the parties an evidentiary hearing before it determines as a matter of law whether the contract is unconscionable.the statute reads when it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting,purpose,and effect to aid the court in making the determination,subd.b.
in this instance,diamond foods motion to strike the class allegations triggered the court obligation to make a preliminary determination under civil code section whether the class action prohibition appeared to be unconscionable.this determination is similar to determining whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to state a cause of action.because the issue was raised as a motion to strike,the court was required to assume the truthfulness of the complaint factual allegations and could rule on the issue only as a matter of law.
thus,our review on this appeal is the same.at the pleading stage of this case,where diamond foods has sought to strike the class allegations,and plaintiffs assert the contractual prohibitions of those class allegations are unconscionable,our review under civil code section,subdivision b,is to determine de novo whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts demonstrating the class action waiver may be unconscionable.morris redwood empire bancorp th,morris.if plaintiffs have met this burden,they are entitled to a full evidentiary hearing at which the trial court can definitively determine whether the class action waiver is unconscionable.
even the case cited by diamond foods,freeman stores,th freeman,stated that unconscionability is ultimately a question of law for the court.citations.id.at,fn.omitted.although the freeman court concluded the trial court in that matter did not abuse its discretion in sustaining a demurrer to a claim of unconscionability,it reached that conclusion by examining the pleadings and the contract as a matter of law to determine the legal sufficiency of the alleged facts to state a cause of action,fn.omitted.it in effect reviewed the sufficiency of the pleadings de novo.
we thus turn to the questions of law before us.
unconscionability of commercial contracts 
the parties dispute the extent to which the doctrine of unconscionability applies to commercial contracts.plaintiffs claim california courts apply the same rules of unconscionability to commercial contracts as they do to consumer contracts.diamond foods asserts courts give greater deference to agreements between merchants when evaluating unconscionability.both parties are correct,but the deference accorded to business contracts arises from the facts surrounding their making,not solely their characterization of being a business or commercial contract.
in california,the doctrine of unconscionability applies to all contracts rather than being limited to those sales transactions governed by the commercial code.a m produce fmc d,a m produce.the legislature codified the doctrine of unconscionability at civil code section,rather than as part of the commercial code,thereby making the doctrine applicable to all types of contracts.id.at,fn.
u nconscionability is a doctrine fundamental to the operation of contract law,irrespective of the particular application.a m produce,supra,d at,fn.t he concept of unconscionability applies to businesses as well as consumers.morris,supra,th at.
indeed,one of the cases relied upon for the development of the unconscionability doctrine in the uniform commercial code,on which civil code section is based,involved an agricultural output contract similar to the agreement at issue here.legis.comm.com,west ann.ed.foll.that case,campbell soup wentz cir campbell soup,concerned a contract under which a company agreed to purchase all of the carrots two farmers were to harvest in a year.a section of the contract excused the company from accepting carrots under certain circumstances,but it prohibited the farmers from selling the rejected carrots elsewhere unless the company agreed.another section limited the amount the farmers could recover in liquidated damages.id.at.
the farmers refused to deliver the carrots when the market price exceeded the contract price by percent.the court of appeals affirmed the denial of specific performance sought by the company,holding that the contract,and in particular its clauses restricting sale of rejected carrots and limiting liquidated damages,were too an agreement to entitle the plaintiff to relief in a court of conscience.campbell soup,supra,at.that equity does not enforce unconscionable bargains is too well established to require elaborate citation,fn.omitted.the campbell soup court did not apply a different standard of unconscionability based on the commercial nature of the contract.
diamond foods,however,argues courts apply a different standard for determining unconscionability to consumer and employment contracts than they do commercial contracts,and it intimates a class action waiver can never be found unconscionable in a commercial contract as a matter of law.this is incorrect.the same standard for determining unconscionability applies to all types of contracts,and no published california appellate court opinion has determined that class action waivers in commercial contracts are not unconscionable as a matter of law.merely calling the agreement a commercial or business agreement does not save it from a finding of unconscionability.t here appears to be no basis in california law for concluding that class action waivers in the commercial context can not be found to be unconscionable and unenforceable.in re litigation.
rather than being based on categories of contracts,unconscionability is determined based on the unique factual situations of each case.w hile unconscionability is ultimately a question of law,numerous factual inquiries bear upon that question.citation.the business conditions under which the contract was formed directly affect the parties relative bargaining power,reasonable expectations,and the commercial reasonableness of the risk allocation as provided in the written agreement.a m produce,supra,d at.
we thus turn to determine whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts demonstrating the class action waiver in the agreement may be unconscionable.
determination of unconscionability 
plaintiffs claim the agreement class action waiver is unconscionable when viewed under the traditional test of procedural and substantive unconscionability.as to substantive unconscionability,they also claim the waiver is unenforceable because it prevents vindication of unwaivable statutory rights.see gentry superior court cal th,gentry.the latter argument,however,has become a separate issue from unconscionability id.at,so we will address it separately.
to briefly recapitulate the principles of unconscionability,the doctrine has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.citation.the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.citations.discover bank superior court cal th,discover bank.
under this approach,both the procedural and substantive elements must be met before a contract or term will be deemed unconscionable.both,however,need not be present to the same degree.a sliding scale is applied so that the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz.morris,supra,th at.
applying this test to plaintiffs allegations,we conclude plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficiently the class action waiver is unconscionable.
procedural unconscionability 
the procedural element of the unconscionability analysis concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.citations.the element focuses on oppression or surprise.citation.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power that results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.citations.surprise is defined as the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.citations.gatton usa,th,gatton,fn.omitted.
plaintiffs claim the agreement is procedurally unconscionable because it is an adhesion contract.an adhesion contract is a standardized contract imposed upon the subscribing party without an opportunity to negotiate the terms.intershop communications ag superior court th.the term signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.neal state farm ins.d.
the california supreme court has consistently stated that t he procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion.discover bank,supra,cal th at see also armendariz,supra,cal th at unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion little auto stiegler,cal th.
whether the challenged provision is within a contract of adhesion pertains to the oppression aspect of procedural unconscionability.a contract of adhesion is imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength and relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.discover bank,supra,cal th at.gatton,supra,th at.a bsent unusual circumstances,use of a contract of adhesion establishes a minimal degree of procedural unconscionability notwithstanding the availability of market alternatives.id.at,fn.omitted,italics added.
plaintiffs have not successfully pleaded the agreement is a contract of adhesion under the unusual circumstances of this case.it is true that plaintiffs pleaded the agreement is a standardized contract drafted by diamond foods that was presented to plaintiffs without any opportunity to negotiate its terms.however,it is not true according to plaintiffs allegations that diamond foods had superior bargaining strength or that plaintiffs had no real alternatives available to them at the time they entered into the agreement.
the obvious alternative for plaintiffs was not to approve the merger into diamond foods.plaintiffs choice was not limited to entering into the agreement.rather,their choice was between continuing in the,or merging the with diamond foods and entering into the agreement.since plaintiffs controlled the as members,we can not say the agreement was imposed on the members by a party of superior bargaining strength or that they had no other alternative but to merge the and enter into the agreement.
moreover,plaintiffs can not demonstrate the agreement class action waiver was a surprise.the class action waiver was set forth in the same sized text as the rest of the agreement and under a heading,dispute resolution.plaintiffs also had an opportunity to read the provision before executing the agreement,as the agreement was presented to them before they voted in favor of merging the into diamond foods.
nevertheless,because we are reviewing only the sufficiency of the pleading,and because we apply a sliding scale to the determinations of procedural and substantive unconscionability,we continue with our analysis to determine whether plaintiffs met their burden to plead a greater showing of substantive unconscionability.we conclude they did not.the adhesive nature of the contract alone justifies scrutiny of the substantive fairness of the contractual terms.gatton,supra,th at,fn.
substantive unconscionability 
the substantive element of the unconscionability analysis focuses on overly harsh or results.gatton,supra,th at.no precise definition of substantive unconscionability can be proffered.cases have talked in terms of overly harsh or results.citations.one commentator has pointed out,however,that unconscionability turns not only on a result,but also on an absence of justification for it.citation,which is only to say that substantive unconscionability must be evaluated as of the time the contract was made.citation.the most detailed and specific commentaries observe that a contract is largely an allocation of risks between the parties,and therefore that a contractual term is substantively suspect if it reallocates the risks of the bargain in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.a m produce,supra,d at.
a provision is substantively unconscionable if it involves contract terms that are so as to shock the conscience,or that impose harsh or oppressive terms.citation.the phrases harsh,oppressive,and shock the conscience are not synonymous with unreasonable.basing an unconscionability determination on the reasonableness of a contract provision would inject an inappropriate level of judicial subjectivity into the analysis.with a concept as nebulous as unconscionability it is important that courts not be thrust in the paternalistic role of intervening to change contractual terms that the parties have agreed to merely because the court believes the terms are unreasonable.the terms must shock the conscience.citations.morris,supra,th at.
plaintiffs claim in the complaint the class action waiver is indisputably because it insulates diamond foods from any liability to its walnut suppliers for its wrongful conduct.plaintiffs allege because of the size of the individual claims being made and the uneven financial resources of the parties,the only effective way that grower suppliers can prosecute and maintain litigation against diamond foods is through a procedure in the nature of a class action.
plaintiffs also claim the waiver is in how it operates.even though the class action waiver applies to plaintiffs and to diamond foods,plaintiffs assert it is because it is much more likely that the growers would initiate a class action against diamond foods than would diamond foods against the growers.
in their brief,plaintiffs also argue there is no business justification for refusing to allow class arbitration of the growers claims.they assert the lack of a business justification weighs in favor of a finding of unconscionability.
we conclude plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded substantive unconscionability so as to earn a hearing under civil code section to determine whether the class action waiver is in fact and law unconscionable.plaintiffs complaint does not demonstrate the agreement is so that a class action is the only effective means of enforcing plaintiffs rights under the agreement.
class action waivers have been invalidated as unconscionable where the individual claims are so small against the defendant that a class action waiver effectively operates as an exculpatory contract in discover bank,our supreme court invalidated a class action waiver in an adhesion contract between a bank and its credit card customers where the bank assessed a late fee on overdue payments a few hours before it was allowed to under the contract.because the individual amounts were small,the class action waiver effectively exempted the bank from liability arising from its scheme.the supreme court determined that a class action waiver in such circumstances was unconscionable.discover bank,supra,cal th at.
the high court,limiting its holding to the facts before it,stated we do not hold that all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable.but when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.discover bank,supra,cal th at.
the supreme court has clarified that discover bank was not intended to suggest that consumer actions involving minuscule amounts of damages were the only actions in which class action waivers would not be enforced.rather,discover bank was an application of a more general principle that although c lass action and arbitration waivers are not,in the abstract,exculpatory clauses discover bank,supra,cal th at,such a waiver can be exculpatory in practical terms because it can make it very difficult for those injured by unlawful conduct to pursue a legal remedy.gentry,supra,cal th at.
unlike in discover bank,plaintiffs complaint does not establish that the agreement class action waiver acted as an exculpatory clause or unduly hindered plaintiffs from pursuing a legal remedy.plaintiffs amended complaint shows that a class action is not the only viable means for recovering plaintiffs damages or enforcing the contract against diamond foods.the amended complaint seeks damages for the class of at least million.divided evenly among class action plaintiffs,the alleged size of the c
