introduction 
plaintiff dkn holdings llc dkn appeals from a judgment of dismissal after the trial court sustained,without leave to amend,defendant wade faerber demurrer to dkn complaint for monies due under a commercial lease.code civ,subd.e.dkn also appeals from a postjudgment order awarding faerber in attorney fees as the prevailing party in the action on the lease,claiming the fee award is unreasonable.the two appeals have been consolidated for oral argument and decision.
in this appeal,we affirm the judgment of dismissal and the attorney fee award.in case no,dkn appeals a postjudgment order dismissing another defendant,matthew neel,whose default was entered after he was served with the complaint but failed to appear.in that appeal,we affirm the order dismissing neel.
ii.background 
by its complaint in the present action,dkn,a lessor on a commercial lease,sued faerber and neel,two of three colessees,for unpaid rents and other monies due under the lease.in a prior action,dkn obtained a money judgment for over million against the third colessee,roy caputo,following a court trial on the merits for monies due under the lease.the lease provides that colessees shall be jointly and severally responsible to comply with its terms.although dkn sued faerber and neel in the prior action,along with caputo,dkn dismissed them without prejudice before trial and judgment.the judgment against caputo is apparently unsatisfied.
the question on the present appeal from the judgment of dismissal is whether the judgment against caputo in the caputo action bars dkn claims against faerber and neel in the present action.the trial court concluded that the judgment against caputo bars dkn claims in the present action,and we agree.we conclude that the complaint does not and can not state a cause of action against faerber and neel for monies due under the lease,because dkn claims against faerber and neel in the present action are barred by the claim preclusion aspect of the res judicata doctrine.
b.the lease agreement 
in june,faerber,neel,and caputo agreed to lease retail space in a murrieta shopping center known as margarita square from the center and lessees,dkn and cdft limited partnership cdft.the parties signed a standard tenant lease net lease with a year term.section of the lease provides that multiple parties signing the lease as lessors or lessees shall have joint and several responsibility to comply with its terms.italics added.for purposes of the present demurrer,faerber and dkn do not dispute that caputo,faerber,and neel were jointly and severally liable to dkn under the lease.
faerber is an orthopedic surgeon,and caputo is also a physician.faerber,caputo,and neel intended to use the leasehold to build and operate an upscale fitness and training center under the trade name evolution elite sports and fitness club.in september,the lease was amended to increase the size of the leasehold from approximately square feet to approximately square feet,and the rent was increased.around march,faerber and caputo acquired neel interest in the business and orally agreed to indemnify neel for any liability he may incur for monies due under the lease.
c.the first action on the lease 
in june,caputo sued dkn,seeking to rescind or cancel the lease and for money damages based on fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and other grounds or causes of action the caputo action in a nutshell,caputo alleged that dkn failed to make material disclosures concerning the leasehold and breached its obligations under the lease,resulting in the failure of the fitness club.among other things,caputo claimed dkn failed to disclose that a streambed near the shopping center was required by law to be planted with native vegetation that could not be trimmed and that would block views to the leasehold,and a center median would have to be constructed on murrieta hot springs road,reducing and inhibiting access to the shopping center.
in the caputo action,dkn and cdft against caputo,faerber,and neel for monies due under the lease.caputo was served with dkn first amended,but faerber and neel were not served.following a june court trial and statement of decision on the complaint and first amended,caputo was denied any relief on his complaint,and was awarded over million in money damages on its against caputo.faerber and neel were dismissed as unserved following the entry of the judgment against caputo.thereafter,did not move to add faerber or neel to the judgment against caputo as additional judgment debtors.
d.the present complaint against faerber and neel 
on june,shortly before the statement of decision was issued in the caputo action,dkn filed the present action against faerber and neel,asserting two cause of action.the first cause of action,for breach of the lease,names both faerber and neel and seeks the same money damages that dkn was awarded against caputo in the caputo action.the second cause of action,for breach of an oral indemnity agreement against faerber,alleges dkn is entitled to the benefit of faerber march oral agreement to indemnify neel for any liability neel may incur under the lease.the claim alleges faerber is now obligated to dkn for neel of rent on the oral contract for indemnity.
faerber general demurrer 
faerber demurred to the complaint on the ground it failed to state a cause of action because the judgment against caputo barred dkn claims against faerber and neel for monies due under the lease,subd.e.faerber claimed that dkn was improperly splitting its single cause of action or primary right for monies due under the lease into two separate suits,the first against caputo in the caputo action and the second against farber and neel in the present action.in opposing the demurrer,dkn claimed that joint and several obligors,such as caputo,faerber,and neel,may be sued in separate actions under california law.
the trial court sustained faerber demurrer,without leave to amend,and entered judgment in favor of faerber.in a postjudgment order,faerber was awarded in attorney fees.
iii.general demurrer 
standard of review on demurrer 
we independently review the court order sustaining,without leave to amend,faerber general demurrer to dkn complaint in the present action.federal home loan bank of san francisco countrywide financial th.we first review the complaint de novo to determine whether it contains facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory.citation.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.citation.we affirm if any ground offered in support of the demurrer was well taken but find error if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citations.we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons,if any,supporting its ruling we review the ruling,not its rationale.citation.citation.estate of dito th.
b.the judgment against caputo in the caputo action bars dkn claims against faerber and neel in the present action 
dkn claims faerber demurrer was erroneously granted and the complaint states a cause of action.dkn argues that,under california law,joint and several obligors,such as faerber,neel,and caputo,may be sued in separate actions.as we explain,dkn is mistaken.joint and several obligors may not be sued in separate actions when,as here,the claim or claims against them are barred by a prior judgment under the claim preclusion aspect of the res judicata doctrine.
as generally understood,t he doctrine of res judicata gives certain conclusive effect to a former judgment in subsequent litigation involving the same controversy.citation.the doctrine has a double aspect.citation.in its primary aspect,commonly known as claim preclusion,it operates as a bar to the maintenance of a second suit between the same parties on the same cause of action.citation.citation.in its secondary aspect,commonly known as collateral estoppel,t he prior judgment operates in a second suit based on a different cause of action as an estoppel or conclusive adjudication as to such issues in the second action as were actually litigated and determined in the first action.citation.citation.boeken philip morris usa,cal th.
the purpose of the doctrine of res judicata is to preserve the integrity of the judicial system,promote judicial economy,and protect litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation.citations.brinton bankers pension services,th.the prerequisite elements for applying the doctrine to either an entire cause of action or one or more issues are the same a claim or issue raised in the present action is identical to a claim or issue litigated in a prior proceeding the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom the doctrine is being asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding.citations.citation.boeken philip morris usa,supra,cal th at.the party asserting the preclusive effect of a prior judgment bears the burden of establishing it.ferraro camarlinghi th.
the present case concerns the claim preclusion aspect of res judicata,not the issue preclusion or collateral estoppel aspect.we independently conclude that all three elements of the res judicata doctrine apply,and that the judgment in the caputo action bars dkn claims against faerber in the present action.
first,it is undisputed,and the judicially noticed records from the caputo action show,that dkn was a party to the caputo action and the action resulted in a final judgment on the merits against caputo.as a party to the caputo action,dkn is bound by the judgment in that action,and res judicata may be invoked against dkn based on the final judgment.arias superior court cal th,res judicata operates only against those who were parties,or in privity with parties,to that prior litigation and who are thus bound by the resulting judgment.
furthermore,faerber and neel may invoke res judicata against dkn in the present action based on the final judgment in the caputo action,even though faerber and neel were not parties to the caputo action.the party seeking the benefit of the res judicata doctrine need not have been a party to the earlier lawsuit.arias superior court,supra,cal th at.only the party against whom the doctrine of res judicata is invoked must be bound by the prior proceeding.vandenberg superior court cal th.
in addition,the present action against faerber and neel is based on the same claims that dkn asserted against caputo in the caputo action.in california,the primary rights theory applies in determining whether two proceedings involve identical causes of action,for purposes of claim preclusion.mycogen monsanto cal th.under the primary rights theory of code pleading,which has long been followed in california,a cause of action is comprised of a primary right of the plaintiff,a corresponding primary duty of the defendant,and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.citation.the most salient characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible the violation of a single primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action.citation.
as far as its content is concerned,the primary right is simply the plaintiff right to be free from the particular injury suffered.citation.it must therefore be distinguished from the legal theory on which liability for that injury is premised even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated,one injury gives rise to only one claim for relief.citation.the primary right must also be distinguished from the remedy sought the violation of one primary right constitutes a single cause of action,though it may entitle the injured party to many forms of relief,and the relief is not to be confounded with the cause of action,one not being determinative of the other.citation.mycogen monsanto,supra,cal th at.
dkn claims against faerber and neel are based on the same primary right the right to recover monies due under the lease that dkn asserted against caputo in the caputo action.the first cause of action against both faerber and neel for their failure to pay monies due under the lease is based squarely on dkn right to recover monies due under the lease.similarly,dkn second cause of action against faerber only seeks the benefit of faerber oral agreement to indemnify neel for any liability neel may incur under the lease.as such,the second cause of action is based on dkn primary right to recover monies due under the lease,even though it seeks to vindicate that right by the alternative remedy of obtaining the benefit of faerber agreement to indemnify neel.boeken philip morris usa,supra,cal th at under the primary rights theory,the determinative factor is the harm suffered.
dkn argues that because joint and several obligors are jointly and severally,or individually,liable on an obligation,a claim against each of them constitutes a separate claim.dkn is mistaken.under the primary rights theory,and for purposes of applying the res judicata doctrine,the claims are identical.lippert bailey d,fourth,div.two a single cause of action may not be maintained against various defendants in separate suits as the plaintiff has suffered but one injury.
relying on a passage from the california supreme court year old decision in williams reed cal d,williams,dkn argues that a judgment against one joint and several obligor does not foreclose a later action against another joint and several obligor on the same obligation.the williams court observed it is true in most jurisdictions,including california,that joint obligors upon the same contract are indispensible parties.they may not be sued separately citations.if judgment is obtained in a separate action against one,it bars an action against the others.citation.when the obligation is joint and several,it is not nonjoinder to sue one alone citations.the same is true of an action against one or more and less than all of a number of persons jointly and severally obligated as tort feasors.in such a case the judgment obtained against one is not a bar to an action against the remaining joint and several obligors.nothing short of satisfaction in some form constitutes a bar,quoting grundel union iron works cal.
based on this passage from williams,dkn argues that because caputo,faerber,and neel are jointly and severally liable for the unpaid rents and other monies due under the lease,the judgment against caputo does not bar dkn identical claims against faerber and neel in the present action.we disagree.as the trial court noted in sustaining the demurrer,the passage from williams is wrong and incorrectly states the law to the extent it may be construed as allowing an obligee,such as dkn,to obtain separate judgments in separate actions against joint and several obligors,based on the same claims.williams did not address the issue presented here whether a final judgment on the merits against one joint and several obligor bars a subsequent action and judgment against additional joint and several obligors,on the same obligation,by the same claimant.people alvarez cal th,cases are not authority for propositions not considered.thus,williams does not support dkn position 
to be sure,courts are generally authorized to render separate judgments,in the same action or in separate actions,against joint and several obligors.melander western nat.bank,construing former,now,as authoring courts to enter separate judgments in separate actions against joint and several obligors see also grundel union iron works,supra,cal.at joint and several tort feasors may be sued in separate actions.but even when joint and several obligors are not required to be sued in the same action see,when,as here,a final judgment on the merits has been rendered in one action against a joint and several obligor,res judicata will bar the assertion of identical claims against other joint and several obligors,in a subsequent action,by parties bound by the judgment in the prior action.
dkn also relies on the following passage from witkin if the defendants are both jointly and severally liable,joinder is not mandatory but permissive,and the plaintiff,although he or she has but one cause of action,may sue one defendant first and another later.despite the theoretical incongruity,the plaintiff is not barred in the second action because the defense of res judicata is available only when both the cause of action and the parties are the same.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,italics added.like the passage from williams,supra,cal d at page,the trial court rejected this passage from witkin as an incorrect statement of the law and we agree it is incorrect.the passage from witkin mistakenly indicates that defendants in the current proceeding must have been parties to the prior proceeding,in which a final judgment on the merits was obtained on the same claims,in order to invoke res judicata in the current proceeding,but this is not the law.as discussed,only the party against whom res judicata is invoked must have been a party to the prior action and bound by the judgment in that action.arias superior court,supra,cal th at.it is not necessary that the party invoking the doctrine in the prior proceeding have been a party to the prior proceeding,or bound by the judgment in that proceeding.ibid.
dkn partnership claim is unavailing 
dkn further claims its complaint states a cause of action because the trial court in the caputo action found that faerber,along with caputo and neel,were partners on the lease.dkn is mistaken.in its statement of decision in the caputo action,the trial court did not find that caputo,faerber,and neel were partners,and even if it had,the finding would not be binding on faerber or neel because they were not parties to the caputo action.in generally describing the lease,the trial court in the caputo action loosely referred to caputo,faerber,and neel as partners who wanted to lease and build out premises for a fitness club 
in any event,dkn argues faerber partnership liability under the lease creates an independent basis for holding him responsible in the present action on the lease,apart from his joint and several liability as a colessee.dkn reasons that california uniform partnership act of,et permits a plaintiff to sue partners in separate actions.though the uniform partnership act of provides that an action may be brought against the partnership and any or all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions,subd.b,italics added,this statutory authorization to sue partners in separate actions does not apply when,as here,the claims asserted in the subsequent action are barred by res judicata principles.
dkn misrepresentation claim is unavailing 
based on facts neither alleged in the complaint nor judicially noticed,dkn claims faerber misled and deceived dkn to dismiss faerber from the caputo action,without prejudice.dkn argues that faerber has unclean hands because,near the outset of the caputo action,the attorney representing caputo,faerber,and neel falsely represented to dkn that,shortly after the lease was signed in june,the three colessees,together with dkn representative,bill dendy,amended the lease to exclude faerber and neel as colessees and to provide that caputo was the sole lessee.dendy was the managing partner of cdft,the of the shopping center,and dkn colessor on the lease with caputo,faerber,and neel.
dkn represents that dendy,who died in,was the only person on dkn side of the transaction who had personal knowledge of whether the lease was amended to exclude faerber and neel as lessees,as faerber claimed.the lease was not well documented,and there were ambiguities and omissions in the documents constituting the lease.dkn claims it did not serve faerber or neel with its amended in the caputo action and instead dismissed faerber and neel,without prejudice,based on their attorney representation that the lease was amended to exclude them.now,however,dkn argues that the evidence presented at trial in the caputo action,including faerber testimony,shows faerber counsel misrepresented the facts,and that faerber and neel were in fact intended to be bound by the lease.
dkn argument is unavailing.even if the complaint were amended to allege that faerber negligently or intentionally misled dkn regarding his and neel status as colessees under the lease,the complaint would not state a cause of action against faerber or neel.estate of dito,supra,th at when the facts pleaded do not state a cause of action,we determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.dkn does not argue that faerber is equitably estopped from asserting that the present action against him is barred by res judicata principles,and even if it did,it could not state facts sufficient to support the reasonable reliance element of equitable estoppel.see superior dispatch,insurance of new york th,reasonable reliance element of equitable estoppel is question of fact for the trier of fact unless reasonable minds could reach only one conclusion based on the evidence.
dkn was represented by counsel in the caputo action,and dkn dismissed faerber and neel from that action before discovery was completed and the matter proceeded to trial.in the absence of documentation showing the lease had been amended to exclude faerber and neel as colessees,dkn did not reasonably rely on any oral misrepresentation by faerber or his counsel that the lease had been amended,shortly after it was signed,to exclude faerber and neel as colessees.
iv.attorney fee award 
the trial court awarded faerber in attorney fees as the prevailing party on dkn complaint pursuant to a fee provision in the lease.the award was around percent less than the sum faerber sought for defending the complaint.dkn claims the award is unreasonably high,and constitutes an abuse of the trial court discretion.we find no abuse of discretion.
background 
in support of the attorney fee motion,faerber lead counsel,edward susolik,submitted a declaration,together with invoices to faerber,showing the hours billed and the hourly rates charged to faerber in connection with representing him in the present action.the hours billed were recorded contemporaneously with the hours worked.susolik had over years of experience as a litigator and trial lawyer,had handled numerous complex real estate litigation matters,and charged an hour.two attorneys who assisted susolik had and years of experience,and were billed at an hour.a paralegal time was charged at per hour.
in susolik experience,the hourly rates charged were consistent with the hourly rates charged by other attorneys and paralegals in the community with similar skill and experience.susolik law firm,callahan blaine,was located in orange county.the law firm representing dkn,prenovost,normandin,bergh dawe,was also located in orange county.
the total number of hours billed was.the invoices show the attorneys billed for time incurred in preparing the demurrer and the attorney fee motion,attending the hearings on the motions,reviewing and analyzing the complaint and the rulings in the caputo action,arranging for and attending a mediation at judicial arbitration and mediation services,preparing a comprehensive mediation brief,engaging in further settlement discussions,conducting factual investigation and legal research relevant to the claims and defenses in the present action,and preparing and serving a motion for sanctions,which was not filed.the attorneys also prepared and presented a demand letter to dkn counsel,with case citations,demanding the dismissal of the complaint because its claims were barred by the rule against splitting causes of action.the letter warned that dkn and its attorneys would be subject to sanctions if the complaint was not dismissed.by its complaint,dkn was seeking over million from faerber for monies due under the lease.
in opposing the attorney fee motion,dkn argued the amount sought was grossly excessive for the filing of a single demurrer based on a simple,straightforward legal theory.in addition,the community for determining counsel compensable hourly rates was the riverside county area,and the rates charged,an average of an hour,was excessive for riverside county.
further,there was no need for faerber to hire new counsel in the present action,and the fees counsel billed in order to get up to speed on the caputo action were u
