a week later,founders assigned the founders note and founders option,and founders security interests in the superior shares,ifs shares,and real estate to american summit.pursuant to the assignment,founders transferred certificate and the ifs shares certificate to american summit.contrary to the sale procedure outlined in the february letter,american summit notified the beardmores of its intent to sell publicly the beardmores ifs shares on april.american summit then sold the ifs shares at a public sale for.

on summary judgment,the district court concluded,inter alia,american summit sale of the ifs shares before the superior shares violated the february,letter agreement and constituted a commercially unreasonable disposition,american summit converted the beardmores superior shares when it rejected the beardmores tender of the million check to satisfy the founders note,the texas absolute bar rule did not absolve the beardmores from liability under the founders note,and american summit lacked standing to challenge the issuance of certificates,and.on appeal,american summit claims it properly refused the beardmores tender and has standing to challenge the issuance of certificates,and.the beardmores,asserting the texas absolute bar rule absolves them from liability.
notwithstanding the numerous issues raised by the parties,we address only the issues necessary to resolve the parties interests in the superior shares,the beardmores liability under the founders note,american summit interest in the beardmores real estate,and american summit standing to challenge the issuance of certificates,and.resolving these issues will also resolve the parties other concerns raised on appeal.

texas abandoned the absolute bar rule effective july.see act of june,ch.laws codified at.bus.ann.a a west.although texas abandoned the absolute bar rule,we apply the absolute bar rule here,because the foreclosure sale occurred before the abrogating act became effective.
as neither the beardmores nor american summit challenge the district court rationale in concluding american summit disposed of the collateral in a commercially unreasonable manner,we address only the texas absolute bar rule effect on the parties rights to the superior shares the texas courts have not addressed the secured creditor rights and the debtor rights to repossessed,but not yet disposed of collateral,after the secured creditor has disposed of a portion of the collateral in a commercially
