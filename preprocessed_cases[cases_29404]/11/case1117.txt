the defendants below,appellants here,engaged in discovery misconduct that was sufficiently egregious to cause the district court to enter an order of default against them.although they now contend for a variety of reasons that the default order was erroneous,the defendants did not challenge the order of default by way of federal rule of civil procedure c or b.six months later,at the plaintiffs request,the district court entered default judgment against them with respect only to liability,but deferred ruling on damages pending further briefing and evidentiary submissions.in their papers opposing this request,the defendants chose not to attack the default order,opting instead to argue that a default judgment was not appropriate.they asserted that the court should exercise its discretion to deny plaintiff application for default judgment.
in ruling against them,the district court revisited the propriety of the order of default and concluded,in light of malone united states postal service,cir,that the order was appropriate.the district court also issued a precisely detailed disclosure order to the defendants requiring them to produce information the court needed to calculate damages.when they appeared to fail to comply with this disclosure order,the district court assigned the matter to a magistrate judge to determine if in fact the disclosure order had gone unheeded.
the magistrate judge held that the defendants indeed had not complied.when the district court finally had all the information it needed,it conducted a full,contested,and comprehensive hearing on damages and entered judgment on behalf of the plaintiffs in the amount of million.during this process,the district court commented that defendants are trying to evade the requirements of the collective bargaining agreement which,of course,is consistent with defendants general approach to this litigation.
the defendants timely appeal,challenging only the legal validity of the district court original order of default,but not the ensuing default judgment on liability itself or the denial of their motion for summary judgment on that issue.nor do they challenge the district court careful and thorough decision with respect to damages.we affirm.
according to the unchallenged declaration of james cope,the effective beneficiaries of this action are musicians who have banded together in an entity known as the film musicians secondary markets fund musicians fund or fund.these musicians are contractually entitled to deferred wages derived from revenues earned in the secondary market of the films they helped create.these monies,known as residuals,come from the distribution of films after the films have been initially released.
the musicians fund is the creation of master collective bargaining agreements between the motion picture industry and the american federation of musicians of the united states and canada.distilled to its essence,this agreement cba requires motion picture companies to keep records on subsequent releases of films and to report on and pass to the musicians fund all monies owed to it,a sum which is calculated according to a fixed formula in the cba.the musicians fund in turn distributes these residuals to the musicians to whom they are owing.
the various producers and secondary market distributors of these films are typically covered,as illustrated by this case,by assumption agreements,which make the films subject to the cba.signatories agree expressly for the benefit of the musicians fund to make the payments required,and that the musicians fund shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and damages.moreover,a signatory agrees to keep or have access to complete books and records showing the income and the administrator of the musicians fund shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine and inspect such books and records.
the films in this case are subject to those rules regarding inspection,as set forth in the relevant assumption agreements and other documents.needless to point out,this arrangement puts the musicians fund and the musicians at the mercy of the film companies collectively,the companies willing compliance with their obligations under the cba,obligations which the companies appear to have ignored.
the musicians fund started informally to attempt to enforce its rights under the cba in,writing to the companies seeking information and payment.then,the problems began,as evidenced by nu image lawyer irrelevant claims that it was not a signatory to the cba,a denial which ignored the assumption agreements.eventually,the musicians fund attorney wrote to nu image in stating the following 
i understand that subsequent to my letter of last year to you,nu image,et and cope have had discussions concerning the films and that nu image,et have expressed a wish to work with the fund to research and resolve the matter.i further understand that there have been delays caused by the difficulty in researching some of the matters and by a personal tragedy.the fund has,of course,accommodated these delays,but must now ask that the matter be brought to an overdue conclusion.
by monday,july,please therefore call or write either cope or me,to resolve this matter promptly without the necessity of a lawsuit.otherwise,the fund will file an action in the united states district court seeking full payment,interest,liquidated damages and cost of enforcement including the fund attorneys fees.
we previously forwarded a courtesy copy of a form of draft complaint.in light of nu image previous indication that it would resolve the matter,the fund has not yet filed a lawsuit.based on recent information,we will file an expanded action.we hope to avoid litigation,but will pursue the matter through judgment and collection if you do not take this final opportunity.please call with any comments or question,or if we may provide further information.
emphasis added.nu image did not respond.counsel wrote again on april,saying delay would no longer be accommodated.no response.accordingly,the musicians fund was forced to resort to legal action and to file this lawsuit.
on june,dennis dreith sued several of the offending movie production companies in his capacity as administrator of the musicians fund.the suit alleged at its core that the companies had failed to pay owed residuals to musicians who performed film soundtracks,in violation of the cba.the district court issued a case notice admonishing counsel,inter alia,that with the local rules and federal rules of civil procedure may lead to the imposition of sanctions which may include the striking of pleadings and entry of judgment or dismissal of the action.this notice ordered the parties as contemplated by federal rule of civil procedure a to schedule an initial meeting and file a joint report thereon.the companies immediately responded to the order not with compliance,but with motions to dismiss and for a more definite statement.the companies refused to meet or file the requisite joint report,arguing that they were excused from so doing because they had filed motions to dismiss and for a more definite statement.thus,the proposed discovery plan which they were required in good faith to attempt to develop pursuant to rule could not be accomplished,and no joint report could be filed.
two of the companies,dog watch and breakstreet,failed to appear,precipitating the entry of default against them.those defaults were vacated by joint stipulation subsequent to their appearance on october.the district court then denied the companies motions to dismiss and for a more definite statement.in january,the parties,citing settlement negotiations,agreed to continue the pretrial conference and trial date by three weeks.the fund alleges that the companies agreed to furnish discovery by march.
on march,still having provided no formal discovery,the companies,disclaiming liability,moved for summary judgment.the fund opposed summary judgment based on its allegation that the companies had failed to provide any documents,failed to provide any responses to written interrogatories or requests for admission and production,and in two cases had failed to make any disclosures under federal rule of civil procedure.the companies responded that the motions could not be denied for any alleged failure to provide discovery,and that numerous documents had been produced informally during settlement negotiations.
on april,the companies moved,ex parte,to postpone pretrial production,due on april,until after their summary judgment motions were heard.the ex parte motion was denied on april.in its order,the district court directed the defendants to return to plaintiff an electronic copy of the joint stipulation re discovery,with signature and shortened the time in which it would hear the fund forthcoming discovery motion.also on april,the fund filed a motion in limine seeking exclusion of the companies evidence based on lack of disclosure.the companies opposed the motion,arguing that the requested discovery had been provided during settlement negotiations,and that pending discovery,not including initial disclosures,had been stayed.they did not comply with the order regarding the joint stipulation re discovery.
on april,the fund moved to compel discovery,seeking depositions,responses to its interrogatories,requests for admission,and production.the parties filed a joint status stipulation outlining the basis of the companies dispute with the fund motion to compel,as required by the local rules.the companies stated that if their summary judgment motions were denied they would provide supplemental responses by april.the companies alleged,however,that they were unable to comply with the court pretrial production deadline of april,the extension of which was unsuccessfully sought in the ex parte motion of april,because defendants counsel was preoccupied with drafting the lengthy summary judgment papers,filing disclosures,filing a motion in limine,noticing plaintiff expert depositions,and providing defendants portion for this joint stipulation.
the district court denied the companies motions for summary judgment at a hearing on april.the next day,april,the district court adopted the fund proposed order denying the companies summary judgment motions and ordering the companies to provide initial disclosures,respond to written discovery,and schedule depositions.the order stated 
none of the defendants produced any documents as part of the initial disclosures.two of the companies provided no initial disclosure in any form.none of the defendants have provided any answers,as opposed to objections,to written discovery.defendants are ordered within five days of the date of this order april,to provide documents in connection with the initial disclosure,and provide responsive answers to the written discovery.
emphasis added.
the companies did not comply with this order either.the fund had received no additional discovery from the companies when it filed its requisite final pretrial order on april.the pretrial order was to be filed jointly,but the companies,after exchanging drafts with the fund,decided to file an independent pretrial order on april.
the fund received supplemental discovery from the companies on april.the fund alleged that the companies partially answered only four of the propounded interrogatories,objecting entirely to the rest.the fund further alleged that the four responses were undecipherable,as it was unclear to which specific company a given response applied.
the may,pretrial conference was short.scheduled to be heard were both parties motions in limine and the fund motion to compel.the district court asked the companies counsel why the companies had not produced discovery related to the summary judgment motions.counsel replied that the documents previously could not be located,but had subsequently been found in storage.the district court characterized the objections to twenty of the interrogatories as silly absolutely silly objections.the district court continued i told you guys not to do what you are doing.i told you to start trying this case and not play games,and you did do it.the district court then entered default against the companies.the district court may,minute order stated 
the court finds that defendants have deliberately and willfully carried out discovery abuse and attempted to stall and block the progress of this action,and deliberately and willfully disobeyed the orders of this court in so doing.the court sanctions defendants and orders the answers of the defendants hereby stricken and the default of each of the previously answering defendants is now entered 
plaintiff motion for order compelling responses to interrogatories,admissions and requests for production is granted.the defendants are ordered to produce all the documents requested of them by the plaintiffs forthwith.
the motions in limine and pretrial conference were stricken.the companies were directed,in connection with damages,to produce all records and books within their custody showing or evidencing receipt of money or other consideration by defendants from or in connection with the movies within five days of this order.the companies default was entered on may.
on may,the fund moved for an order,effectively a motion to compel,regarding the companies failure to produce necessary documents identified in the orders of may and,and to compel disclosure in compliance therewith.in response to this motion,and well after the court deadline,the companies produced some documents and stated that they did not have any additional documents sought by the fund.the district court granted the fund motion to compel on june,stating i had enough now.the next time you come to this court somebody is going to jail.now get those documents.get them before june.
notwithstanding their earlier protestations on may,that they did not have any additional documents,the companies discovered pages of discovery on june.on june,the district court entered a written order captioned order re defaulted defendants continuing breaches of the court orders,stating that the companies have deliberately and willfully disobeyed the court orders of may,and may.the district court ordered the companies to produce forthwith the specified discovery,indicating that it would assist the court in,among other things,a calculation of the amount of residuals owed to the fund 
the companies substituted counsel on july,causing judge real to recuse himself due to a relationship with one of the companies new attorneys.the case was reassigned to judge stephen wilson.
the fund moved for default judgment on october.adhering to the rule that default does not entitle the party to a default judgment as a matter of right,judge wilson considered the issues and the companies arguments and granted the fund motion as to liability in an order dated march.as previously indicated,his order revisited judge real entry of default and concluded that it was.judge wilson methodically went through the five malone factors more on this later and determined that the companies egregious behavior deserved default.however,because he was unsatisfied with the parties competing declarations on damages,judge wilson ordered the companies,no later than march,to produce all of the information upon which their underlying calculations are based for the purposes of assessing damages.the district court also scheduled a status conference for march,for the main purpose of ensuring that the companies disclosure of information was complete.
at the status conference on march,no one appeared for the companies because of a calendaring error by the companies trial counsel.
due to the companies apparent recalcitrance to provide the requested discovery,judge wilson referred the matter to magistrate judge nagle,asking her to examine the companies compliance with the march order.on june,judge nagle granted the fund motion to compel,finding that the companies failed to comply with judge wilson march order,and ordering production of the missing material.
the district court held a formal damages hearing on march.the fund disputed motion for damages was granted on december,in a thorough,page order.the amount of damages was million.final judgment was entered on january.
on appeal,the companies raise only two issues whether judge real lacked the power to impose defau
