this case requires us to answer two questions whether the owner of cargo,who contracted with an intermediary operating common carrier nvocc to arrange for the carriage of cargo on a ship,was bound by the clause in the bill of lading issued by the ship owner to the nvocc,and whether the nvocc was entitled to take advantage of a statutory limitation of liability by having given the cargo owner a fair opportunity to opt for higher limits by paying a greater charge.we hold that the cargo owner was bound by the clause and that the statutory limitation of liability applies.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff kukje hwajae insurance company is the subrogated insurer of the doosan corporation,a korean manufacturer of machinery.doosan contracted with glory express,an nvocc,to ship a doosan brand vertical twin spindle cnc lathe from busan,korea,to los angeles,california,on the vessel the hyundai liberty.glory express issued three bills of lading to cover the shipment.each one identifies doosan as the shipper and the hyundai liberty as the exporting carrier.the glory express bills of lading contain a clause requiring that all suits relating to the carriage of goods covered by the bills of lading be brought in the federal courts in new york,although glory express has not sought to enforce that clause here.
glory express,in turn,contracted with hyundai merchant marine company to ship the lathe on its vessel,the hyundai liberty.it did so by acting through streamline shippers association,a nonprofit organization of shippers streamline hyundai merchant marine issued a bill of lading identifying streamline as the shipper.that bill of lading provided 
the claims arising from or in connection with or relating to this bill of lading shall be exclusively governed by the law of korea except otherwise provided in this bill of lading.any and all action concerning custody or carriage under this bill of lading whether based on breach of contract,tort or other wise shall be brought before the seoul civil district court in korea.
emphasis added.
according to plaintiff complaint,the lathe was damaged during the course of the sea voyage,resulting in more than in damages.plaintiff paid doosan claim and then initiated this action.the complaint asserted claims for damage to cargo,breach of contract,negligence,breach of duty to care for property in bailment,and unseaworthiness.plaintiff brought the action in personam against defendant glory express and in rem against the hyundai liberty hyundai 
hyundai moved to dismiss plaintiff complaint as to the vessel,seeking to enforce the clause in its bill of lading.the district court denied the motion,in part because it found that hyundai had not properly authenticated the copy of the bill of lading that it had attached to its motion additionally,the court denied the motion because plaintiff subrogor,doosan,had not accepted the bill of lading and it was,therefore,not enforceable against plaintiff.the court stated further that,if plaintiff accepted the bill during the litigation by relying on it to establish an element of one of its claims,the court would entertain again hyundai motion to enforce the clause.
hyundai filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the ground that the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa specifically app.limited the ship in rem liability.over plaintiff opposition,the court granted the motion.
plaintiff then moved for summary judgment against glory express.the court granted the motion in part,holding that glory express was liable to plaintiff for damage to the lathe,but that its liability was limited by the terms of the glory express bills of lading and by cogsa.at that time,the court did not calculate the total amount of damages for which glory express was liable,because plaintiff had not established how many packages had been shipped for purposes of cogsa.glory express then moved for summary judgment on the ground that the total number of packages shipped was six.the court granted the motion.
plaintiff and hyundai filed for summary judgment on the issue of the vessel in rem liability.each party opposed the other motion.the court denied both parties motions and,instead,dismissed the case.the court reasoned that plaintiff use of a part of the hyundai bill of lading to establish that the goods were delivered on board the hyundai liberty in good condition constituted acceptance of the bill of lading.the court also held that any claim that kukje has against the hyundai liberty must be brought pursuant to the hyundai bills of lading.the court dismissed the action with respect to the hyundai without prejudice to plaintiff right to bring a claim that complies with the forum selection clause of the hyundai bills of lading.
plaintiff and hyundai timely appealed.

discussion 
whether plaintiff is bound by the clause in the hyundai bill of lading.
plaintiff argues that the district court erred by dismissing the in rem action because of the clause.plaintiff contends that the clause does not bind it because plaintiff subrogor,doosan,never accepted the hyundai bill of lading and,therefore,is not a party to the contract.plaintiff argues that its evidentiary use of the bill of lading did not operate as acceptance of the contractual terms of the bill.because plaintiff does not seek to enforce the contractual terms of the bill of lading,but has brought a tort claim for cargo damage,and because neither plaintiff nor its subrogor is a party to the bill of lading,plaintiff reasons that the clause is not enforceable against it.
hyundai,by contrast,argues that the court erred by not enforcing the clause at the outset of the litigation.hyundai asserts that the clause is enforceable against plaintiff because plaintiff subrogor is a party to the bill of lading or,in the alternative,is so closely related to the transaction that the clause is enforceable.we agree with hyundai that the in rem action should have been dismissed at the outset for want of jurisdiction.
as an initial matter,it is clear that plaintiff in rem action for cargo damage,characterized by plaintiff as a tort is within the scope of the clause.the text of the clause provides any and all action concerning custody or carriage under this bill of lading whether based on breach of contract,tort or otherwise shall be brought before the seoul civil district court in korea.plaintiff action concerns damage to the lathe that occurred during carriage under this bill of lading on board the hyundai liberty.
it also is clear that enforcement of the clause does not contravene cogsa.in fireman fund,we approved a similar clause requiring that a claim for cargo damage be brought in korea.at.in that case,the plaintiff the consignee of the cargo covered by the bill of lading at issue brought claims for cargo damage in both an in rem action against the vessel and an in personam action against the vessel charterer.id.at.we rejected the plaintiff argument,which posited that cogsa barred enforcement of the clause because in rem proceedings are not available under korean law,and we held that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to enforce the clause.id.at.we remanded the case to district court to dismiss the in rem and in personam proceedings for want of jurisdiction.id.at.
therefore,we can,consistent with both precedent and the terms of the bill of lading,apply the korean clause to plaintiff in rem action.the question is whether the clause can be enforced against plaintiff.we conclude that it can.that is because the commercial role of an nvocc,as well as the facts of this case,lead to the conclusion that glory express was acting as doosan agent when it accepted the hy
