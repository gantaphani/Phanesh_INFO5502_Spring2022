in moradi shalal fireman fund insurance companies cal d moradi shalal the supreme court reversed its decision in royal globe ins.superior court cal d and held the prohibitory provisions of insurance code section part of the unfair insurance practices act uipa,et did not create a private right of action under that statute against insurers who commit unfair practices enumerated in that provision.moradi shalal,at.the holding and rationale of moradi shalal have been extended by the courts of appeal to preclude claims under california unfair competition law bus,et ucl based directly on violations of the uipa.
insurance code section section prohibits an insurer from either requiring an insured automobile be repaired by a specific automobile repair dealer or suggesting or recommending that a specific automobile repair dealer be used unless the insured is informed in writing of his or her right to select another repair dealer.although section is not part of the uipa,section,subdivision f,provides the powers of the insurance commissioner to enforce the section include those granted by the uipa.does moradi shalal bar a cause of action by an insured against its insurer under the ucl based solely on allegations the insurer violated section we conclude section does not expressly bar such a claim,and the legislature intended the insurance commissioner authority to use uipa enforcement powers to be cumulative,not exclusive.accordingly,we reverse the order of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of progressive direct insurance company progressive direct to chris hughes putative class action complaint for violation of business and professions code section.
factual and procedural background 
progressive direct practice of steering insureds to approved automobile repair facilities 
progressive direct provides automobile insurance to california drivers.progressive direct direct repair program drp certifies certain approved repair facilities that have agreed to repair vehicles referred by progressive direct under strict conditions set by the insurer.
hughes,who at the time was a resident of california covered by an automobile insurance policy issued by progressive direct,was involved in an accident on august,that damaged his car.hughes advised progressive direct of the accident and informed it he wanted his automobile repaired by a specific repair shop that was not a drp facility.progressive direct responded to hughes claim by telling him he should take his automobile to champion collision paint champion in el cajon,california,which participated in the drp,explaining that his claim would be approved and the repairs on his car completed more quickly there.progressive direct did not inform hughes of his right under section to select the facility that would repair his vehicle.
without knowing he had a right to use the shop he preferred,hughes took his car to champion for repairs.champion repaired hughes car and returned it to him on november.hughes was dissatisfied with champion work,believing that not all repairs necessary to restore the vehicle to its condition had been completed and that substandard or used parts had been used.
hughes lawsuit for violation of the unfair competition law 
on november,hughes filed a complaint against progressive direct for violation of business and professions code section on behalf of himself and a proposed class of a ll persons who are or were a resident of california,who had a claim covered by a progressive automobile insurance policy,and who had their vehicle repaired by a shop belonging to progressive direct repair program without having been provided written notification of their right to select a repair shop of their own choice.in addition to the factual allegations described above,hughes complaint alleged progressive direct tells its insureds that drp facilities are carefully selected to provide only the highest quality work,but,in fact,repair shops are selected because they have agreed to progressive direct demands to reduce the costs of repairs without regard to the interests of their customers progressive direct insureds.progressive direct then closely monitors all drp shops for compliance with mandated restrictions on repairs,allowing progressive direct to control its payouts on claims to repair its insureds vehicles.
the complaint further alleged progressive direct has a policy and practice of steering its insureds to its drp shops progressive uses its position of power over its insured,in the form of incentives and requirements to carry out its program of steering.the tactics employed include telling insureds that it does not do business with shops that a claim may not get paid if done at another shop it is easier to have the car repaired at drp shops that the insured can receive free towing if the vehicle is brought to a drp shop that the insured can receive a discount off of his or her deductible by using a drp shop that it will not guarantee work done at a shop,but will guarantee the work at its drp shops for the life of the vehicle and that payment of their claims and the repair of their vehicles will be delayed if take n to a shop.
the complaint asserted a single cause of action for violation of california ucl bus,alleging progressive direct policy and practice of steering insureds to its drp shops is unlawful,unfair and deceptive.on behalf of himself and the members of the putative class he seeks to represent,hughes requested disgorgement of profits received,restitution injunctive relief and attorney fees.
progressive direct demurrer and the trial court order 
progressive direct demurred to the complaint on the ground it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.code civ,subd.e.progressive direct argued moradi shalal,supra,cal d and appellate decisions following it prohibit private actions to enforce provisions of the insurance code,including claims under the ucl.accordingly,its alleged violation of section does not support a claim for violating business and professions code section.
in his opposition to the demurrer hughes emphasized that section is not part of the uipa and argued moradi shalal has never been extended to preclude a ucl claim based on violations of insurance code provisions or regulations.
in its reply brief progressive direct analyzed the legislative history of section and argued it demonstrated the section did not create a private right of action.progressive direct also cited a nonpublished federal district court decision,aho enterprises,state farm mutual automobile insurance,cv sba dist.lexis,which denied leave to amend a complaint to allege a ucl claim based upon alleged violations of section,explaining,in moradi shalal,the california supreme court held that the unfair insurance practices act uipa cal,et does not create a private right of action for violations of its provisions and,instead,can only be directly enforced by the insurance commissioner.subdivision f of section provides that the statute should be enforced by the insurance commissioner pursuant to the uipa.therefore,just as there is no private right of action under the uipa,there is no private right of action created by section.because no private right of action exists under section,section can not be used to circumvent moradi shalal.
at the may,hearing on progressive direct demurrer,the trial court,although noting that the federal district court ruling in aho enterprises was not binding,stated it found that case a persuasive analysis of california law.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.

section,subdivision f,the statutory provision relied upon by the trial court in sustaining progressive direct demurrer,states,the powers of the commissioner to enforce this section shall include those granted in article commencing with section of chapter of part of division that is,the uipa.as the trial court also noted,section does not create a private right of action to enforce its provisions.
california ucl comprehensively prohibits any practices forbidden by law,be it civil or criminal,federal,state,or municipal,statutory,regulatory,or.citation.it is not necessary that the predicate law provide for private civil enforcement.hewlett squaw valley ski th.specifically,a private right of action under the predicate statute is not necessary in order to state a cause of action under the ucl for violation based on that statute.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,stop youth addiction rejecting contention that plaintiff can not sue under the ucl when the conduct alleged to constitute unfair competition violates a statute for the direct enforcement of which there is no private right of action kasky nike,cal th,same.indeed,a practice that is unfair or deceptive can be challenged as a violation of the ucl even if not unlawful.cel tech communications,cellular telephone cal th.

given the breadth of the ucl,absent some competing principle of law,a violation of section should be a proper basis for hughes ucl claim.progressive direct argues,and the trial court ruled,moradi shalal and its progeny provide such a mandate barring this action.we disagree 
moradi shalal and claims based solely on violations of the unfair insurance practices act 
the uipa is intended to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance in accordance with the intent of congress as expressed in the mccarran ferguson act,by defining,or providing for the determination of,all such practices in this state which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined or determined.in particular,insurance code section defines and prohibits a series of improper insurance practices including in subdivision h specific unfair claims settlement practices k nowingly commit ed or perform ed with such frequency to indicate a general business practice.see,subd.h misrepresenting facts or policy provisions relating to coverage,not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt,fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear,failing to prove promptly a reasonable explanation of the basis for the denial of a claim or for the offer of a compromise settlement.the uipa does not expressly create a private right of action,but insurance code section,part of the uipa,states the insurance commissioner issuance of an administrative order under the act does not does not relieve or absolve such person from any civil liability or criminal penalty under the laws of this state arising out of the methods,acts or practices found unfair or deceptive.see generally manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th.
in royal globe ins.superior court,supra,cal d the supreme court examined the language and legislative history of the uipa and held,although the statutory scheme itself provided only regulatory remedies,the legislature intended to create a new private right to sue.in reversing royal globe nine years later,the moradi shalal court held,neither insurance code section nor section was intended to create a private civil cause of action against an insurer that commits one of the various acts listed in section,section h.the contrary royal globe holding reportedly has resulted in multiple litigation or coerced settlements,and has generated confusion and uncertainty regarding its application.moradi shalal,supra,cal d at.the court further explained that private suits brought under the uipa by claimants against insurers were undesirable because of the adverse social and economic consequences,such as encouraging lawsuits against the insured insurer,inflated settlements to avoid exposure to bad faith actions,the awkwardness of owing a direct duty to a claimant and escalating insurance costs due to inflated settlement demands and litigation.id.at.
moradi shalal holding barring a claimant from bringing a private action against an insurer for uipa violations has been extended to include not only claims under the uipa see,maler superior court d,zephyr park superior court d,but also ucl claims based directly on violations of the uipa.as explained in an early opinion by our colleagues in division two of this court,to permit a plaintiff to maintain such a ucl action would render moradi shalal meaningless.safeco ins.superior court d.in safeco a motorcyclist who had been involved in a collision with a driver insured by safeco settled his claim with the insured and then sued safeco seeking both monetary damages and injunctive relief under the ucl,alleging safeco refusal to pay a collision damage waiver on an automobile he had rented while his motorcycle was being repaired constituted an unfair and deceptive claims settlement practice under insurance code section,subdivision h.the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate,directing the superior court to grant safeco motion for summary judgment,explaining,w e have no difficulty in holding the business and professions code provides no toehold for scaling the barriers of moradi shalal.safeco ins,at.
similarly,in maler superior court,supra,d plaintiffs sued their insurers after they had refused to defend or indemnify them in an underlying action.emphasizing that insurance code section,adopted by the electorate as part of proposition after moradi shalal,subjects the business of insurance to california laws applicable to any other business plaintiffs asserted their action was authorized by that statute and business and professions code section.division three of this court rejected the argument,holding that plaintiffs were impermissibly attempting to plead a cause of action based solely on a violation of the uipa.in essence,plaintiffs allege that defendants breach of their statutory duties under section amounts to unfair competition within the meaning of business professions code section,thereby constituting a violation of section.s ection,subdivision a,simply declares that the insurance industry is subject to california laws applicable to any other business,including the antitrust and unfair business practices laws.citations.because the insurance industry obviously was subject to section prior to the adoption of section,the latter section did not extend the application of section to the business of insurance.thus,section can not be construed to supersede moradi shalal ban on a private action for damages under section.further,plaintiffs can not circumvent that ban by bootstrapping an alleged violation of section onto business and professions code section so as to state a cause of action under section.maler,at,fn.omitted accord,textron financial national union fire ins.th,parties can not plead around moradi shalal holding by merely relabeling their cause of action as one for unfair competition.
safeco and maler were cited with approval in rubin green cal th,an action against an attorney for soliciting clients,in which the supreme court described them as helpful authority to support its holding a unfair competition claim could not be maintained based on conduct immunized by civil code section,subdivision b notably in the case of actions arising out of an insurer alleged bad faith refusal to settle insurance claims,formerly brought under the insurance code,several decisions of the courts of appeal have held that the bar on such implied private causes of action,imposed by our decision in moradi shalal,may not be circumvented by recasting the action as one under business and professions code section.rubin,at.
the limits on moradi shalal 
moradi shalal,of course,does not bar all private actions against insurers for unfair or anticompetitive behavior.as discussed,insurance code section,subdivision a,makes the business of insurance generally subject to the provisions of california ucl thus,ucl actions may be maintained against an insurer when the alleged conduct,even though violating the uipa,also violates other statutes applicable to insurers.
for example,in manufacturers life ins.superior court,supra,cal th plaintiff insurance agency sued several insurance companies alleging they had violated the uipa,the ucl and the cartwright act bus,by engaging in an unlawful boycott.the court of appeal had held the trial court properly overruled a demurrer to the complaint because the conduct on which the plaintiff predicated the ucl cause of action violated not only the uipa but also the cartwright act.manufacturers life,at.the supreme court affirmed explaining,as the court of appeal recognized a cause of action for unfair competition based on conduct made unlawful by the cartwright act is not an implied cause of action which moradi shalal held could not be found in the uipa the court in moradi shalal concluded that the legislature did not intend to create new causes of action when it described unlawful insurance business practices in insurance code section,and therefore that section did not create a private cause of action under the uipa.the court did not hold that by identifying practices that are unlawful in the insurance industry,practices that violate the cartwright act,the legislature intended to bar cartwright act causes of action based on those practices.manufacturers life,at.
several years later,the supreme court in quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,elaborated on its ruling in manufacturers life,expressly stating that the uipa did not exempt insurance companies from civil liability for anticompetitive conduct i n adopting the uipa the legislature had not granted a general exemption from antitrust and unfair competition statutes.rather,the legislature intended that rights and remedies available under those statutes were to be cumulative to the powers the legislature granted to the insurance commissioner to enjoin future unlawful acts and impose sanctions in the form of license and certificate suspension or revocation when a member of the industry violates any applicable statute,rule,or regulation.citations.we observed that no court had accepted the argument that the uipa exempted insurance companies from other state antitrust laws or from civil liability for anticompetitive conduct 
a violation of section may serve as a predicate unlawful business practice for a ucl claim 
the supreme court in stop youth addiction,supra,cal th recognized that a ucl claim is barred when it is based on conduct that is absolutely privileged,as was held in rubin green,supra,cal th,involving conduct protected by the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b,or effectively immunized by another statute,as has been held with respect to the uipa by moradi shalal and its progeny.with respect to this latter category,however,the court emphasized that the ucl states,unless otherwise expressly provided the remedies or penalties provided by this chapter,ch,enforcement,bus,are cumulative to each other and to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.stop youth addiction,at.the court continued,the term expressly means in an express manner in direct or unmistakable terms explicitly definitely directly.ibid.the court refused to hold the penal code provision prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors impliedly precluded a private cause of action under the ucl,explaining to do so we would have to read the word implicitly into business professions code section or read the word expressly out of it.see also state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at.
here,hughes is not suing progressive direct for violating the uipa but another,express statutory provision,section.nor does the allegedly unlawful conduct at issue the failure to provide a statutorily required notice that the insured could have his automobile repaired at a facility of his own choosing approximate the bad faith refusal to settle insurance claims or other claims handling misconduct at the heart of moradi shalal analysis rejecting royal globe.thus,recognizing a violation of section as a predicate unlawful business practice for a ucl claim does not appear to conflict with moradi shalal and the case law extending its holding to ucl causes of action based solely on alleged violations of the uipa.indeed,several other appellate decisions have allowed ucl claims expressly based on violations of the insurance code.see,troyk farmers group,th,fn.alleging violation of,subd.f,based on failure to disclose service charge as part of premium farmers apparently do not,and could not successfully,argue that a violation of section,subdivision f,can not constitute a predicate unlawful business practice or conduct for a ucl cause of action ticconi blue shield of california life health ins.th reversing denial of class certification in ucl action alleging unlawful postclaims underwriting by rescinding disability insurance policies in violation of.
to be sure,there is no express private right of action for a violation of insurance code section.moreover,as the trial court emphasized,section,subdivision f,grants the insurance commissioner the power to enforce the section in the same manner that is,primarily the issuance of administrative orders and the imposition of civil penalties as uipa violations.in our view,that is not enough to constitute an express repeal of the cumulative remedies made available by the legislature under the ucl or to transform section into simply another unlawful practice under the uipa,a conclusion that is reinforced by the legislative history of senate bill reg.sess,which added section to the insurance code.
insurance code section does not expressly bar a ucl claim 
as originally introduced by senator jackie speier,senate bill reg.sess,with the short title auto body repair consumer choice act of,would have added a new section to the insurance code,providing simply in subdivision a,it is unlawful for an insurer,including an affiliate or subsidiary of an insurer,in connection with a claim,to direct,suggest,or recommend that an automobile be repaired,or not be repaired,at a specific auto body repair shop,unless the claimant specifically requests a referral from the insurer.bill reg.sess.as introduced,a.subdivision b of section as proposed in senator speier original bill created a private cause of action to enforce the new law an insurer that violates this section shall be liable for any damages suffered by the claimant or auto body repair shop,including compensatory,special and exemplary damages.any injured party may bring an action for damages.the prevailing party in any action brought pursuant to this section shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs,b.
the initial amendment to senate bill made only minor language changes in the substantive prohibition barring insurers from directing their insureds to specific repair locations and retained the private cause of action,but eliminated the right to recover attorney fees.amend.to bill reg.sess.a further amendment in the senate deleted the right to recover punitive damages,simplifying proposed subdivision b of the new section to read an insurer that violates this section shall be liable for compensatory damages suffered by the insured or other claimant,or by the automotive repair dealer.amend.to bill reg.sess.may,b.as so amended,senate bill was approved by the senate on june.
assembly amendments to senate bill substantially modified its substantive provisions,allowing an insurer to suggest particular repair facilities provided the insured was informed in writing of his or her right to select a different shop.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.july.in addition,the private cause of action was eliminated entirely.in its place,proposed section,subdivision h,provided the powers of the commissioner to enforce this section shall include those granted in article commencing with section of chapter of part of division that is,the uipa.any person who violates this section shall be deemed to have violated that article,and shall be liable to the state for a civil penalty to be fixed by the commissioner pursuant to section and.
a report on senate bill prepared for a july,hearing before the assembly committee on insurance identified various organizations that supported or opposed the legislation and specifically noted,the civil justice association of california is opposed to this bill unless it is amended to remove a provision creating a new private cause of action.as the report explained,however,in the most recent version of this bill as amended in the assembly on july,the author removed this provision from the measure.assem.com.on insurance,analysis of bill.reg.sess as amended july.
senate bill was further revised by assembly amendments following the hearing before the assembly committee on insurance.these additional amendments struck all reference to enforcement either by the commissioner or by private cause of action.see assem.amend.bill reg.sess.july.these assembly amendments also deleted the short title and the legislative findings regarding the shortcoming of existing law regulating the consumer right to choose an automobile repair shop.ibid.two months later,however,enforcement of proposed section by the commissioner was reinserted in the legislation as a new subdivision f,but without the earlier language deeming a violation of the new section to be a violation of the uipa itself the powers of the commissioner to enforce this section shall include those granted in article commencing with section of chapter of part of division.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.this is the enforcement language that was ultimately adopted and remains in insurance code section,subdivision f,today 
as this legislative history demonstrates,the legislature neither authorized direct private enforcement of insurance code section the provision creating a private right of action was removed in the initial assembly amendments nor intended simply to classify a violation of the section as another unfair insurance practice with enforcement limited to those remedies set forth in the uipa that alternative,too,was eliminated from the legislation.rather,the grant to the insurance commissioner of enforcement powers was in addition to other,existing enforcement mechanisms hence the language shall include.even more significantly in light of the language in stop youth addiction requiring an express repeal of the cumulative remedies generally made available under the ucl,the legislature did not in any way indicate a violation of section fell within the sweep of moradi shalal or suggest such a violation could not serve as a predicate unlawful business practice for a ucl claim.see people harrison cal d,legislature is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence,and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof shirk vista unified school dist.cal th,same people licas cal th,same.
in sum,if a plaintiff relies on conduct that violates the uipa but is not otherwise prohibited,the principles of moradi shalal require that a civil action under the ucl be considered barred.an alleged violation of other statutes applicable to insurers,however,whether part of the insurance code or,as in manufacturers life ins.superior court,supra,cal th,the business and professions code,may serve as the predicate for a ucl claim absent an express legislative direction to the contrary.because there is no express legislative direction here,hughes allegations that progressive direct violated section properly stated a cause of action for unfair competition.progressive direct demurrer should have been overruled.
disposition 
the order dismissing the action is reversed.hughes is to recover his costs on appeal.
woods,concurring 
i write separately to respectfully state my thoughts on concurring,but with considerable misgivings.
fast forwarding to the summation set forth in the concluding paragraph of the opinion,the issue in this case hangs precipitously on one word,namely express.or,as the opinion states,the business and professions code may serve as the predicate for a ucl claim absent an express legislative direction to the contrary.in my view,the reed on which the opinion stands may not be thin,as is sometimes used in the vernacular,but the reed certainly appears to me to be quite frail and perhaps suffering from detectible anemia.
i have no quarrel with comments in the opinion pertaining to moradi shalal,or the decisional law following the moradi decision or the accuracy of the statement of legislative history after the moradi shalal decision.
what is disturbing is the demonstrated inroads that have been made into the policy articulated by our high court in dealing with the social problems brought on in part by our high court decision in royal globe,in which the court commented that the case has reportedly caused multiple litigation or coerced settlements and has generated confusion and uncertainty.no doubt royal globe had a profound impact on the cost of insurance in california,and which raised a storm of adverse comments throughout california and the nation in its holding that the uipa did not preclude private enforcement of insurance code section,subdivision h.
now we are faced with a similar dilemma pertaining to insurance code section and whether a private cause of action is inclusive in the right to enforce the problems addressed in the statute.our conclusion is that it does,but my concurrence in the opinion is accompanied by a desire to report storm warnings on the horizon.
i respect the separation of powers principle endemic in our constitutional framework and the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislature to constitutionally address and enact legislation with the purpose of remedying a social problem,as in this case.however,to hold that insurance code section allows a private right of enforcement based upon one word ie.expressed strikes me as a bit weak and will advance the drift away from and the legislative enactments intended to cement the holding in that case to cure a social problem but with limited reservations.
by allowing the unfair competition statute in business and professions code section to proceed without any uipa constraints is most unfortunate.this decision adds to a growing list of problems,in my opinion.
the first that comes to mind is the continued attack on micra and the desire in some circles to eliminate or lift
