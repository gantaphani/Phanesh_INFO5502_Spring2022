plaintiffs,a group of strip club owners in ohio,challenged ohio liquor control commission rule on first amendment grounds.enacted in,rule provided that an establishment holding a liquor permit may not knowingly or willfully allow nudity or sexual activity on its premises.the district court granted plaintiffs a temporary injunction against enforcement of rule.later,it declared that parts of rule were unconstitutionally overbroad and it permanently enjoined their enforcement anywhere in ohio.defendants now appeal,arguing that rule is constitutional.we hold that rule is not overbroad and we reverse.
background 
the strip club owners challenge a,b,and b of revised rule.the challenged sections read as follows 
a definitions as used in this rule 
nudity means the showing of the human male or female genital,pubic area or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering,the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple areola the exposure of any device,costume,or covering which gives the appearance of or simulates the genitals,pubic hair,natal cleft,perineum,anal region,or pubic hair region or the exposure of any device worn as a cover over the nipples areola of the female breast,which device simulates and gives the realistic appearance of the nipples areola.
b prohibited activities no permit holder,his agent,or employee shall knowingly or willfully allow in and upon his licensed permit premises any persons to 
appear in a state of nudity 
engage in sexual activity as said term is defined in orc chapter.
sexual activity means sexual conduct or sexual contact,or both.orc chapter.the ohio revised code defines sexual conduct as 
vaginal intercourse between a male and female,anal intercourse,fellatio,and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex and,without privilege to do so,the insertion,however slight,of any part of the body or any instrument,apparatus,or other object into the vaginal or anal cavity of another.penetration,however slight,is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse.
sexual contact is defined as any touching of an erogenous zone of another,including without limitation the thigh,genitals,buttock,pubic region,or,if the person is a female,a breast,for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.orc chapter.
in july,the district court permanently enjoined enforcement of several sections of old rule,finding them invalid under the first and fourteenth amendments.as a result,the ohio liquor control commission the commission commenced proceedings for the enactment of a new version of rule.in september,the commission received evidence and testimony regarding the validity of proposed new language for rule.at this hearing,mark anderson,executive director of the commission,testified that the earlier version of rule had been rescinded and that all of the filing requirements imposed by state law for the new version of rule had been met.
the commission heard extensive testimony from bruce taylor,an attorney from fairfax,virginia.throughout his career he prosecuted vice crimes,including obscenity,prostitution,and liquor violations.he spoke at length about his understanding of precedent in this area and the constitutionality of liquor regulations.he testified that nude dancing does contribute to its own types of secondary effects and to a greater degree than other liquor bars that do have nude dancing.specifically,prostitution,drug trafficking,and fights occur more frequently in and around bars that allow nude dancing than those that do not permit nude dancing.taylor expressed his opinion that the language under consideration for the new rule would be held constitutional by the courts.
the new version of rule was finalized and filed on february.it was scheduled to take effect on february.on february,the strip club owners filed suit after learning of plans for enforcement agents to investigate strip clubs to determine compliance with rule.they claimed that the rule provisions concerning nudity and sexual activity were broadly restrictive of protected expression.they sought a declaratory judgment that these sections were unconstitutional and a permanent injunction barring their enforcement.the district court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing.
at the preliminary injunction hearing,the plaintiffs called judith hanna,a cultural anthropologist and sociologist who researches and writes about arts,dance,and society.she stated that exotic and erotic dance has artistic value and conveys a range of potential messages.she also discussed a variety of mainstream ballet,modern dance,and theater performances that allegedly involve types of nudity and sexual contact that could be prohibited by rule.the club owners also presented testimony from daniel linz,a sociologist and psychologist,who stated that his research showed no positive correlation between the presence of establishments featuring nude or dancing and the types of crimes cited by the commission in support of its decision to adopt rule.linz stated that in some cases there was a negative correlation,meaning that nude dancing establishments actually decreased crime in the surrounding community.
the commission then presented testimony from scott pohlman of the ohio department of safety in support of rule.he described numerous occasions where he personally observed illicit behavior in and around establishments that feature nude or dancing.he stated that rule was needed to limit illicit behavior.
following the hearing,the commission agreed to refrain from enforcing rule until at least april,in order to grant the district court enough time to enter a ruling on the strip club owners motion for a preliminary injunction.on april,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction against the commission.it enjoined the defendants from enforcing a,b,and b anywhere in ohio.in january,it granted plaintiffs a permanent injunction and declared a,b,and b unconstitutionally overbroad.the district court concluded that it could not sever the unconstitutional language from the regulation because a,b,and b were overbroad.
we review constitutional issues de novo.vasha gonzales,cir.we find that rule is a constitutional,regulation of the undesirable secondary effects,including prostitution,drug trafficking,and assault,associated with nude dancing in an environment serving alcohol.it is not overbroad.
rule is almost identical to the regulation upheld by the supreme court in city of erie pap,d.while pap involved a challenge on first amendment freedom of expression grounds,not an overbreadth challenge,a discussion of pap is necessary.in pap,the united states supreme court upheld a regulation making it a summary offense to knowingly or intentionally appear in public in a state of nudity.id.at.the regulation had wording and definitions very similar to rule.
the court began its analysis by stating that while being in a state of nudity is not an inherently expressive condition,nude dancing is expressive conduct and it falls within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection.id.at.to determine what level of scrutiny applies,a court must decide whether the state regulation is related to the suppression of expression.id.if the governmental purpose is unrelated to suppression of expression,then the regulation must satisfy the less stringent standard from united states,d.id.if,on the other hand,the government interest is related to the content of the expression,the regulation must be justified under a more demanding standard.id.
the court held that government restrictions on public nudity,such as the one passed by erie,should be evaluated under the framework set forth in for restrictions on symbolic speech.id.if a law is a general prohibition on public nudity,then by its terms it regulates conduct alone,not speech.id.at.the ordinance at issue did not attempt to regulate the primary effects of expression,the effect of the audience watching nude dancing,but rather the secondary effects that impact the public health,safety and welfare.id.
the regulation must pass muster under the standard the regulation must be within the constitutional power of the government to enact,the regulation must further an important or substantial government interest,the government interest must be unrelated to the suppression of free expression,and the restriction must be no greater than essential to the furtherance of the government interest.id.at.the erie regulation passed the test.first,erie efforts to protect public health and safety were clearly within the police powers.id.at.second,the regulation furthered a substantial government interest because erie found that lewd,immoral activities carried on in public places for profit are highly detrimental to the public health,safety,and welfare,and lead to the debasement of both women and men,promote violence,public intoxication,prostitution and other serious criminal activity.id.at.quoting erie findings contained in petition for cert.erie did not need to carry out a study documenting these effects and it did not need to develop a specific evidentiary record to support its ordinance.id.at.it is that strip clubs cause public health and safety problems.id.at.third,the government interest in suppressing the negative secondary effects of strip clubs was unrelated to the suppression of free expression.id.at.finally,the restriction was no greater than was essential because it only had a de minimis impact on the expressive element of nude dancing.id.the requirement that dancers wear pasties and is a minimal restriction that leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer erotic message.id.
overbreadth 
pap would be directly and would decide the issue were it not for the fact that the district court struck down rule on the grounds that it was overbroad,not that it violated the first amendment guarantee of freedom of expression under.pap did not address an overbreadth argument.see at.stating that lower court did not reach the overbreadth issue.the overbreadth doctrine prohibits the government from proscribing a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.virginia hicks,d.a finding that a law is overbroad suffices to invalidate all enforcement of that law,until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression.id.at.internal quotations omitted.overbreadth doctrine exists to allay the concern that the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law may deter or chill constitutionally protected when the law provides criminal sanctions.id.many persons would refrain from engaging in speech rather than risk litigation of their rights,putting them at substantial risk.id.thus the overbreadth doctrine exists to protect the marketplace of ideas and reduce the social costs of withheld speech.id.
however,there comes a point at which the chilling effect of an overbroad law,significant though it may be,can not justify prohibiting enforcement of that law.id.this principle is especially important when a law reflects the legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful,constitutionally unprotected conduct.id.overbreadth doctrine creates substantial social costs when it blocks application of a law to constitutionally unprotected conduct.id.to ensure that these costs do not swallow the social benefits of declaring a law overbroad,the supreme court has insisted that a law application to protected speech be substantial relative to the scope of the law plainly legitimate applications before applying the strong medicine of overbreadth invalidation.id.at.internal quotations omitted.the overbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrating from the text of the law and from actual fact that substantial overbreadth exists.id.at.we have emphasized that overbreadth doctrine is only to be used as a last resort.sensations,city of grand rapids,cir.
the strip club owners can not carry their burden to show that rule is substantially overbroad.nude dancing is protected by the first amendment,but it is within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection.pap,at.rule has a minimal impact on the marketplace of ideas because persons desiring to perform mainstream works of art involving nudity and sexual activity may do so in an establishment that is not licensed to sell liquor.in the alternative,they may perform their works in an establishment licensed to sell liquor if they wear clothing or pasties and a and avoid sexual conduct or sexual contact.ohio narrowly defines sexual conduct to include vaginal intercourse,oral sex,and vaginal or anal penetration.the prohibition against sexual contact applies only if the purpose of the contact is to arouse sexually or to gratify either person.by its own terms,rule does not apply to contact done in furtherance of legitimate works of art for the purpose of conveying artistic meaning,such as the touching of an actor thigh in a play.thus,mainstream works of art that merely suggest sexual activity will not be burdened.invalidating rule as overbroad would impose substantial societal costs because it would hamper ohio legitimate interest in curtailing the negative secondary effects,such as prostitution and drug trafficking,associated with an environment mixing alcohol with nudity and sexual activity.see hicks,at.
the district court concluded that numerous examples of mainstream theater and dance which contain nudity sexual contact,such as oh calcutta,would be prohibited by rule.however,such productions may still be held in venues that do not have a liquor license,or by requiring the performers to wear pasties and a and to avoid vaginal intercourse,oral sex,and vaginal or anal penetration.see pap,at.the requirement that dancers wear pasties and is a minimal restriction in furtherance of the asserted government interests,and the restriction leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer erotic message.while there may be legitimate artistic works that involve actors appearing in a state of nudity,b eing in a state of nudity is not an inherently expressive condition that is protected by the first amendment.id.at.moreover,the first amendment does not provide a right to engage in sexual activity in public.the effect of rule on legitimate artistic works is incidental and does not call for the strong medicine of overbreadth doctrine.
furthermore,a law is not invalid simply because some impermissible applications are conceivable.new york ferber,d concluding that a new york statute prohibiting possession of child pornography was not overbroad see also sensations,at upholding regulation banning total nudity in sexually oriented businesses because there was no realistic danger that the statute would significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the court.in ferber,the supreme court upheld against an overbreadth challenge a statute criminalizing possession of child pornography even though it may have reached some protected expression,such as medical textbooks and artistic works.at.the court upheld the statute because it seriously doubt ed that these arguably impermissible applications of the statute amount to more than a tiny fraction of the materials within the statute reach.id.here,analogizing to ferber,any arguably impermissible application of the statute to citizens engaged in artistic expression amounts to no more than a fraction of rule reach.also,as in sensations,there is no realistic danger that the regulation will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the c ourt because there is no constitutional right to appear in public in a state of nudity or engage in sexual intercourse in public.at.
the district court relied heavily on triplett grille,city of akron,cir,in striking down rule as overbroad.in triplett grille,we struck down as overbroad an akron ordinance banning public nudity.the city lawmakers testified that they enacted the provision because of constituents moral outrage toward nude dancing.id.at.no witness testified that the prevention of prostitution or other illegal activity was the ordinance goal.id.instead,lawmakers passed the ordinance to establish a community standard even though akron had never experienced any negative secondary effects commonly associated with nudity.id.we struck down the ordinance as overbroad 
because the city has failed to demonstrate a link between nudity in entertainment and secondary effects,we do agree with the district court that the akron ordinance must be struck down as facially unconstitutional under the first amendment overbreadth doctrine.
id.at emphasis added.the public indecency ordinance prohibited all public nudity,including live performances with serious literary,artistic,or political value.id.at.because the ordinance covered expressive conduct with literary and artistic value that is not generally associated with prostitution,sexual assault,or other crimes,it was overbroad.id.
triplett grille is distinguishable from the situation presented here and does not control.first,in triplett grille,the city ordinance banned all public nudity in all public places.at.however,rule bans public nudity only in establishments licensed to sell liquor.therefore,rule is much less restrictive and covers much less speech than did the regulation at issue in triplett grille.second,in triplett grille,the city enacted its ban because of constituents moral outrage toward nude dancing,not concern over the negative secondary effects of nude dancing.id.here,however,the commission enacted rule out of a concern over the negative secondary effects of nude dancing,not moral outrage.moreover,the pap court rejected justice souter concurrence in barnes glen theatre,d souter,concurring,upon which the triplett grille court exclusively relied,at,and held that the proponent of a regulation did not need to carry out any study documenting secondary effects and it did not need to develop a specific evidentiary record to support its ordinance pap,at.rejecting justice souter position that erie should have conducted a study because negative secondary effects are amenable to empirical treatment.triplett grille progeny are similarly distinguishable.see,hamilton bogarts michigan,cir odle decatur county,cir.rule is constitutional and the commission was not required to study the application of the ordinance to or theater.
the ohio liquor control commission commission enacted ohio administrative code rule in order to fight the negative secondary effects resulting from the combination of liquor and nudity or sexual activity at establishments.but instead of limiting the reach of rule to those establishments,the commission chose to burn the house to roast the pig,butler michigan,d,by applying rule to all liquor permit holders in the state of ohio,and by failing to exempt persons engaging in performances with literary,artistic,or political value.because i believe that rule is not reasonably restricted to its intended purpose and thus unconstitutionally overbroad,i respectfully dissent.
first things first.my colleagues and i agree on at least one significant of erie pap,d,has no bearing on this case.in pap,the supreme court considered an ordinance enacted by the city of erie,pennsylvania,making it an offense to knowingly or intentionally appear in public in a state of nudity.while a plurality of the court ultimately reversed the pennsylvania supreme court decision to enjoin the statute,concluding that the ordinance satisfied the test established in united states,d,the court did not reach the question of the law overbreadth.see pap,at.as the majority recognizes,this distinction is significant because there is little question,nor do the plaintiffs even dispute,that rule as applied to establishments would be constitutional.see id.at.but the question on,the only question before whether rule,as written,unnecessarily infringes upon first amendment freedoms outside of the permissible regulation of establishments.
the answer to this question is where we respectfully part ways.i acknowledge that the overbreadth doctrine should be considered strong medicine to be used sparingly and only as a last resort.broadrick oklahoma,d.but when a law criminalizes a substantial amount of protected speech,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep,id.at,we must enjoin the enforcement of the law,until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression,id.at.this longstanding rule is rooted in the assumption that the statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.id.at.see also deja vu of nashville,metro.gov t of nashville davidson county,cir.with that in mind,i see three main problems with rule.
rule applies to substantially more venues than necessary.by issuing rule,the commission intended to address the undesirable secondary effects throughout the state of ohio of sexually oriented or adult businesses where alcohol was served namely,the increased presence of drugs,prostitution,underage drinking,and inappropriate physical contact between dancers and patrons,including assault.joint appendix ja.but instead of being limited to those establishments,rule applies to all privately owned and operated manufacturers,distributors,and retailers of alcoholic beverages in the state of ohio.see dep t of liquor control annual report,at,available at.
of those permit holders,about half are retail stores,and about half are establishments that could potentially present live entertainment.of those approximately venues that could potentially present live entertainment,only or so are venues which currently feature nude or dancing.ja.that means that about alcohol permit holders in ohio that potentially present live entertainment are needlessly required to conform to rule mandates.
to illustrate the staggering breadth of rule application,here is a sampling of the venues affected bars,restaurants,nightclubs,hotels,country clubs,convention centers,theaters,stadiums,comedy clubs,concert halls,playhouses,ballet houses,and museums.in fact,the following venues in cleveland alone are subject to the rule the amphitheater at tower city,the cleveland museum of arts,the cleveland agora theater and ballroom,the great lakes science center,the beachland ballroom,the cleveland play house club,jacobs field,gund arena,the cleveland convention center,the nautica pavilion,the state theater,the playhouse square foundation,the allen theatre at playhouse square,and severance hall.none of those venues have been identified by the commission as places where illegal narcotics are taken or distributed,and none are places where prostitution is a recurring problem.but they are,however,places where constitutionally protected speech might be prevented.this brings me to my second concern.
rule affects a substantial number of artistic performances protected by the first amendment.rule prohibits any permit holder,his agent,or employee from knowingly or willfully allow ing in and upon his licensed permit premises any persons to appear in a state of nudity engage in sexual activity as said term is defined in chapter of the revised code.ohio admin.code b.sexual activity,in turn,is defined as sexual conduct or sexual contact,or both.ohio c.
there are two provisions that i find particularly troubling.first,nudity includes not only the showing of male or female genitalia,pubic area or buttocks,or the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering,but also the exposure of any device,costume,or covering which gives the appearance of or simulates those body parts.ohio admin.code a emphasis added.so rule criminalizes any performance,whether a play,ballet,or musical,which contains a fleeting scene involving the exposure of a female breast,even if a performer wears a device or costume giving the appearance of a female breast.
second,sexual contact is defined as any touching of an erogenous zone of another,including without limitation the thigh,genitals,buttock,pubic region,or,if the person is female,a breast,for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.ohio b emphasis added.this carries a risk of enforcement against a variety of ballet and dance performances,in which choreographers frequently require participants to touch the erogenous zones of one another for the purpose of conveying a sexual message.
together,these two provisions prohibit on licensed premises any live entertainment that contains even a brief scene involving simulated nudity or the touching of any erogenous zone,even if the nudity or touching is integral to the narrative of the performance,and even if alcoholic beverages are not being served during the actual performance.to name but just a few examples the buttocks of the dancing murderesses in chicago,the jarring depiction of incest in the dance big bertha,the rebellious nudity of the performers in hair depicting the of the,the nudity of a woman staging a poetic battle as she dies of ovarian cancer in the pulitzer prizewinning drama wit,the dramatic portrayal of sexual assault in a streetcar named desire,and the nudity of a young man suffering from a psychological condition in equus,recently popularized by daniel radcliffe more commonly known for his role as harry potter.whatever one might think of these we could disagree for years as to whether they should be considered mainstream,independent,subversive,or some combination of the simply does not matter in the eyes of the first amendment,they are no less valuable than the famous works by shakespeare or arthur miller.
in short,rule does not apply only to nude dancing,which falls only within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection,pap,at,but also to a variety of live entertainment,such as musical and dramatic works,schad borough of mount ephraim,d,that are entitled to the full protection of the first amendment.see also endowment for the arts finley,d put differently,art is entitled to full protection because our cultural life,just like our native politics,rest s upon the ideal of governmental viewpoint neutrality.citation omitted,alterations in original.this is true even if those performances contain nudity or other sexual elements that some citizens might find offensive,see reno aclu,d,which brings me to my final concern.
rule does not offer any limiting construction.as part of our analysis,we must consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered,village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d,that can save an otherwise unconstitutional statute by eliminating the statute substantial overbreadth,virginia hicks,d.if a statute is readily susceptible to a limiting interpretation that would make it constitutional,the statute must be upheld,but we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.virginia am.booksellers ass n,d.
the commission concedes that rule is not readily susceptible of any construction that would exempt persons engaging in performances that have literary,artistic,or political value,because it has no discretion in pick ing and choos ing which permit holders are subject to rule requirements,and is to enforce it evenly and equally against all permit holders in the state of ohio.ja.in fact,the only reason advanced by the commission for not excluding legitimate high culture theater,is because it would be impossible to have a rule that would make sense if you went through and tried to have exceptions for all sorts of things.ja.
the majority attempts to sidestep this issue by noting that such productions may still be held by requiring the performers to wear pasties and a.but pap,upon which my colleagues rely for this proposition,held only that the nude dancers at establishments may be required to wear these devices because they are a minimal restriction in furtherance of the asserted government interests,and the restriction leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer erotic message.at.no court,to my knowledge,has ever held that a state may require pasties or for performances with serious artistic or literary value,particularly when the state fails to assert a single interest for such a requirement.
more to the point,rule prohibits not only actual nudity,but also the exposure of any device,costume,or covering which gives the appearance of or simulates nudity,ohio admin.code a,which would almost certainly include both the use of pasties or a.the result,according to the testimony of john duvall,the director of the ohio department of public safety,is that a venue reading the plain language of rule would discover that the language of the rule forbids it from presenting an artistic performance that has a fleeting scene involving the exposure of a woman areola and nipple.ja.if those venues wanted to be safe,duvall opined,they would refrain from presenting that particular performance at all.id.
the same can be said of the provision prohibiting sexual contact.while sexual contact is limited to touching for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person,ohio b,there are a large number of contexts in which performers undertaking constitutionally protected forms of expression might seek to convey a message with a sexual component at the very least,there is a high probability rule would be interpreted as prohibiting the kinds of touching that commonly occurs in ballets,plays,or musicals.when duvall was asked whether those venues would know they better not present the performance that would be so interpreted or else they risk the possibility that they could be punished,he admitted that they should not.ja.
true,as the majority points out,the mere fact that one can conceive of some impermissible applications of a statute is not sufficient to render it susceptible to an overbreadth challenge.city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d.but this does not mean the speech must be presently ongoing.because the overbreadth doctrine is designed to prevent the chilling of future protected expression,staley jones,cir emphasis added,whether such performances have been put on in the past,or whether there are plans to do so in the future,is irrelevant.see odle decatur county,cir n either proof that an ordinance as currently applied has no unconstitutional effect,nor assurances offered by the relevant local authorities that the ordinance will not be put to such an effect in the future,constitute constructions of the ordinance,as that term is ordinarily understood.in any event,the commission can hardly say that the application of rule to serious theatrical performances is merely hypothetical,since it actually issued a citation against the production of oh calcutta in the past.ja.
perhaps most importantly,even if one believes that the impact on these performances will be minimal,or that the state interest in preventing prostitution or distribution of illegal narcotics is especially worthwhile,it is worth reemphasizing that rule burdens these performances without any justification.much of the commission argument focuses on the relative insignificance of the affected speech.i admit that hair may not be substantial judged in relation to the entire spectrum of protected activities under the first amendment.but the overbreadth doctrine,limited as it may be,requires us to judge rule in relation to its plainly legitimate sweep.broadrick,at.with respect to nude or topless dancing at clubs or bars,an interest in limiting the harmful secondary effects may justify the challenged provisions.with respect to ordinary theater and ballet performances,concerts,and other artistic forms of entertainment,however,the commission provides no evidence,no judicial opinion,and not even any argument to suggest that these mainstream entertainments,to which it has conceded the restrictions apply,produce the kind of adverse secondary effects that the state seeks to prevent.giovani carandola,bason,cir.because rule plainly legitimate sweep is extraordinarily narrow compared to the breadth of the rule,it criminalizes substantially more speech than constitutionally permissible.
the foregoing observations are,in my view,sufficient to resolve the issue before us.but i will add one more odle,controls the outcome of this case.in odle,we invalidated a county ordinance prohibit ing,among other things,nudity and the performance of a wide range of
