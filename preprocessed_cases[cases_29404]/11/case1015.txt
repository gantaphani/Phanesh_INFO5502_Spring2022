the terms are intended to form the basis and general understanding of the proposed acquisition.binding terms and conditions for a potential transaction will depend on a number of factors,including but not limited to,the satisfactory completion of legal,business and financial due diligence investigations,and negotiation and execution of definitive legal documentation,including agreements with all existing owners.

on september,fcl counsel notified evergreen that fcl had elected to terminate the letter of intent and all negotiations and other discussions concerning the sale of the assets of fcl,or any other transaction between fcl,its shareholders,and evergreen.by letter dated october,evergreen advised fcl that it ha d no right unilaterally to elect to terminate the letter of intent,which was a binding agreement between fcl and evergreen,and that evergreen was fully prepared to move forward with its obligations under the letter of intent.after these letters were exchanged,negotiations ended and the sale did not take place.
evergreen filed suit in missouri state court,and the case was subsequently removed to the united states district court for the western district of missouri.in its first amended complaint,evergreen alleged breach of contract,breach of duty to negotiate in good faith,and fraud.evergreen also sought to recover under a theory of promissory estoppel.fcl moved for summary judgment on all four counts.with respect to the breach of contract claim,fcl argued that the plain language of the august letter demonstrated that the parties did not intend the letter to be a binding contract for the purchase and sale of fcl.the district court summarily denied fcl motion,concluding that material factual issues remained as to each of evergreen claims.evergreen then filed a motion in limine asking the court to exclude evidence outside the four corners of the parties contract dated august.according to evergreen,e xtrinsic evidence was neither relevant nor admissible,because it was clear and unambiguous from the face of the parties written agreement that they formed a contract for the sale and purchase of the assets of defendant fcl,and intended to be bound by their agreement.in denying this motion,the district court found the august letter to be ambiguous as to the parties intent to be bound.shortly before trial,however,the court reversed its ruling and entered an order granting fcl motion for summary judgment on counts one and four of evergreen complaint,the breach of contract and fraud claims.in a later order,the court explained that the clear language of the face of the letter demonstrated that the parties did not intend the august letter to be a binding contract for the purchase and sale of fcl.having voluntarily dismissed its two remaining claims,evergreen now appeals,arguing that the district court erred by granting fcl motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.

the district court determined that illinois law governs evergreen claims,a ruling that neither party contests.the seventh circuit,in applying illinois law,has recognized that it is a common commercial practice for two negotiating parties to sign a letter of intent or an agreement in principal,signaling that they have come to a tentative agreement on the general outlines of a deal without having nailed down all of the details.ocean atl.dev.aurora christian,cir citing empro,cir see venture assocs.zenith data,cir.whether such a letter reflects a binding agreement between the parties turns not on what the parties subjectively believed,but on what they expressly manifested in their writing.ocean atl.dev,at citing empro,at venture assocs,at.thus,in accordance with traditional contract principles 
a court must initially determine,as a question of law,whether the language of a purported contract is ambiguous as to the parties intent.if no ambiguity exists in the writing,the parties intent must be derived by the court,as a matter of law,solely from the writing itself.if the terms of an alleged contract are ambiguous or capable of more than one interpretation,however,parol evidence is admissible to ascertain the parties intent.if the language of an alleged contract is ambiguous regarding the parties intent,the interpretation of the language is a question of fact

the parties agree that the first question before us is whether the august letter,viewed as a whole,is ambiguous as to their intent to be bound.we conclude that it is not.the clear language of the letter demonstrates that the parties did not intend the letter to constitute a binding agreement for the purchase and sale of fcl.
the first several paragraphs of the letter,which outline the purchase price,items to be purchased,and manner of payment,indicate that the parties had reached an agreement on the major issues,leaving minor issues for future negotiations.the remainder of the letter,however,clarifies that this was a proposed acquisition and a potential transaction that depend ed on and was subject to several factors and conditions,including,but not limited to,the satisfactory completion of legal
