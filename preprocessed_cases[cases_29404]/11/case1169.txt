birdsong,a louisiana resident,filed this action in the western district of louisiana,seeking to represent a class of ipod consumers.the case was transferred to the northern district of california on the parties joint motion pursuant to a.birdsong then filed a first amended complaint asserting claims under california law.apple moved to dismiss the first amended complaint and birdsong responded by filing a second amended complaint.apple then moved to partially dismiss the second amended complaint.the district court granted apple motion,and granted birdsong leave to amend.

implied warranty of merchantability 
the california commercial code implies a warranty of merchantability that goods a re fit for ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.cal.c the implied warranty provides for a minimum level of quality.am.suzuki motor superior court,th,d quotation omitted.a breach of the warranty of merchantability occurs if the product lacks even the most basic degree of fitness for ordinary use.mocek alfa leisure,th,d citing cal.
the plaintiffs argue the district court erred in determining that the third amended complaint failed to sufficiently plead an implied warranty claim.they alleged that the ipod comes with stock ear buds designed to be placed deep into the ear canal rather than over the ears,which increases the danger of hearing damage,lacks noise isolating or cancelling properties,and lacks any volume meter that will inform users they are listening at dangerous levels.
the plaintiffs contend the district court failed to take their factual allegations as true,and instead made its own that any dangers of hearing loss were obvious and avoidable.the district court also determined the danger of hearing loss did not exist unless the consumer decided to use the ipod in an extreme way.
the district court did not err.the plaintiffs admit that the ipod has an ordinary purpose of listening to music,and nothing they allege suggests ipods are unsafe for that use or defective.the plaintiffs recognize that ipods play music,have an adjustable volume,and transmit sound through earbuds.the third amended complaint includes statements that the ipod is capable of playing decibels of sound consumers may listen at unsafe levels and ipod batteries can last to hours and are rechargeable,giving users the opportunity to listen for long periods of time.taken as true,such statements suggest only that users have the option of using an ipod in a risky manner,not that the product lacks any minimum level of quality.see am.suzuki,th at,d.
the plaintiffs rely upon hicks kaufman broad home,th,d,but that case is distinguishable.in hicks,homeowners brought a putative class action alleging a defect in the foundations of their homes.the defect arose from the use of a material called fibermesh,which,according to the homeowners,caused their foundations to crack badly and resulted in insect and vermin infestation,bumps in the floor and premature wearing of carpeting.id.at,d.although some of the foundations had not yet cracked,the court cited expert testimony suggesting that the cracks were most likely to develop,and stated,we see no reason why a homeowner should have to wait for the inevitable injuries to occur before recovering damages to repair the defect and prevent injuries from occurring.id.at,d.
the hicks plaintiffs identified the defect in the foundations,which was the use of fibermesh,and the injury inevitably caused by that defect,a cracked foundation.id.hicks distinguished cases in which there was no history of the products failing.id.
in the present case,the plaintiffs make no allegations of any history of malfunction,but merely suggest possible changes to the ipod which they believe would make the product safer earbuds with features volume control software more and different warnings printed onto the actual ipod and a digital meter to display the output volume in decibels.the plaintiffs fail to allege,however,how the absence of their suggested changes caused any user an injury.the plaintiffs do not allege the ipods failed to do anything they were designed to do nor do they allege that they,or any others,have suffered or are substantially certain to suffer inevitable hearing loss or other injury from ipod use.hicks,th at,d.accordingly,the district court correctly determined that the plaintiffs failed to allege sufficiently the breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.see am.suzuki,th at,d.
express warranty and implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose 
the plaintiffs third amended complaint alleged claims for breach of an express warranty and breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.however,the plaintiffs have apparently abandoned those claims on appeal,as their opening brief contains no discussion of them.we review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party opening brief we will not manufacture arguments for an appellant,and a bare assertion does not preserve a claim,particularly when,as here,a host of other issues are presented for review.greenwood fed.aviation,cir.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of those claims.
california unfair competition law 
california ucl prohibits unfair competition by means of any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice.cal.bus.each prong of the ucl is a separate and distinct theory of liability.kearns ford motor,cir.
to have standing under california ucl,as amended by california proposition,plaintiffs must establish that they suffered an injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.cal.bus.walker geico ins,cir.in approving proposition,the california voters declared their intent to prohibit private attorneys from filing lawsuits for unfair competition where they have no client who has been injured in fact under the standing requirements of the united states constitution.buckland threshold,th,d quoting,e emphasis in original.thus,to plead a ucl claim,the plaintiffs must show,consistent with articl
