workmen auto insurance company company sued guy carpenter company,carpenter for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.after the trial court eliminated the fiduciary duty claim during pretrial proceedings,a jury decided in favor of carpenter.the company appeals.it contends that the trial court erred when it granted summary adjudication regarding the allegation that carpenter did not obtain the best terms for reinsurance,when it sustained a demurrer without leave to amend the fiduciary duty cause of action,and when it denied the company permission to conduct discovery on and add allegations for price fixing.we find no error and affirm.in particular,we hold that an insurance broker can not be sued for breach of fiduciary duty.

carpenter moved for summary adjudication regarding the allegation that it did not secure the best available terms.even though the motion was not authorized by code of civil procedure section,subdivision f because it did not dispose of a cause of action,an affirmative defense,a claim for damages or an issue of duty,the company did not object.the trial court granted the motion the ruling left the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty still standing because it did not adjudicate all the alleged breaches.

discussion 
i.the demurrer to the third amended.standard of review.
case law requires us to independently review the success of a demurrer.lazar hertz th,lazar.in doing so,w e treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.blank kirwan cal d,blank.
the company advocates a different standard of review,one which has no support in the law and which we therefore decline to adopt.it contends that t he situation is akin to where a trial court grants a nonsuit or refuses to instruct the jury on a plaintiff theory of liability.because the trial court has denied the appellant an opportunity to have a jury weigh its theory of liability,the standard of review is the opposite of the traditional substantial evidence test the reviewing court must assume the jury might have believed appellant evidence and,if properly instructed,might have decided in appellant favor.
for authority,the company cites to eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,to eisenberg to explain why eisenberg is not authority for the proposition advanced,we have examined eisenberg in detail.
paragraph begins eisenberg discussion of the impact of substantial evidence review on statements of fact on appeal and avers the substantial evidence rule significantly impacts the manner in which appellants must state the facts and respondents may recite the facts in their briefs,as well as the manner in which appellate courts will state the facts in their opinions.eisenberg,supra.next,paragraphs through discuss the requirements and options for a statement of facts in an appellant and respondent brief.continuing on,paragraph discusses the statement of facts in a decision on appeal and states,inter alia on substantial evidence review,the appellate court opinion will state the facts in a manner that resolves all conflicts and draws all inferences in favor of the prevailing party.citations.eisenberg,supra.
finally,paragraph states on certain appeals such as appeals from orders of dismissal following sustaining of demurrers appellate courts must view the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant the substantial evidence rule is essentially reversed because appellant was deprived of the benefits of a trial on the merits citations.eisenberg,supra.in support of this statement,paragraph cites gab business services,lindsey newsom claim services,th,gab,disapproved on other grounds in reeves hanlon cal th.
the problem for our purposes is that gab did not involve a demurrer.at the pinpoint cite referenced by eisenberg,gab discussed the rule that instructional error requires reversal only if it is reasonably probable that the error prejudicially affected the judgment.to make this determination,a reviewing court must consider whether the evidence was sufficient for a properly instructed jury to find in the appellant favor.gab,supra,at.in our view,the literal language of paragraph in eisenberg contains a misstatement of the law appellate review of orders sustaining demurrers 
as secondary authority,the company refers us to gab,meyer blackman cal d,meyer,and whiteley philip morris th,whiteley.gab,as previously discussed,does not support the company position regarding the appropriate review of an order sustaining a demurrer.neither does meyer or whiteley.meyer explained that while in most appeals it is the duty of the reviewing court to indulge every reasonable intendment in favor of sustaining the trial court,substantially the reverse is true when the appeal is from an order of nonsuit.in the latter case the appellate court must view the evidence as though judgment had gone in favor of the appellant,and order a reversal if such a judgment can be sustained.citation.meyer,supra,at.whiteley,like gab,merely cited law regarding instructional error,stating with respect to our review of issues relating to the failure to give requested jury instructions,as well as the question of their prejudicial impact,we do not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the successful party and draw all inferences in favor of the judgment.rather,we must assume that the jury,had it been given proper instructions,might have drawn different inferences more favorable to the losing party and rendered a verdict in that party favor on those issues as to which it was misdirected.citations.citation.whiteley,supra,th at.
simply put,the company failed to persuade us to deviate from the rules set forth in cases such as lazar and blank.
notably,the company changed its argument on the standard of review in its reply brief and at oral argument.it asserted that we must analyze the legal sufficiency of the allegations in the operative pleading.if error appears,it argues that we can look at the trial to determine whether it had the opportunity to litigate an overlapping claim or whether the evidence presented disposed of the dismissed claim.if so,the company says we can apply the harmless error rule.
b.the nature of a broker duties in california.
according to the company,we must determine whether carpenter was the company agent and,if so,whether that agency imposed fiduciary duties on carpenter as a matter of law such that carpenter can be held civilly liable for breaching those duties.the first issue is a nonissue because,as a reinsurance,carpenter is an agent it has been held that an independent insurance broker is not an agent of the insurer,but rather is an agent of the insured.citations.marsh mclennan of cal.city of los angeles d.in our view,the sole battlefield is the second issue.we conclude that even if an insurance broker has certain fiduciary like duties,it can not be sued for breach of fiduciary duty in a manner that conflicts with existing insurance law.in reaching this conclusion,we confess that agency law and insurance law are in conflict,resulting in a legal conundrum.that conundrum is resolved only by stare decisis and public policy 
the conflict.
a n insurance broker will be liable to his client in tort where his intentional acts or failure to exercise reasonable care with regard to the obtaining or maintenance of insurance results in damage to the client.citation.saunders cariss d.for example,a broker failure to obtain the type of insurance requested by an insured may constitute actionable negligence.nowlon koram ins.center,th,desai farmers ins.exchange th.but as a general proposition,a broker does not have a duty of care to advise a client on insurance matters unless a the agent misrepresents the nature,extent or scope of the coverage being offered or provided,b there is a request or inquiry by the insured for a particular type or extent of coverage,or c the agent assumes an additional duty by either express agreement or by holding himself out as having expertise in a given field of insurance being sought by the insured.fitzpatrick hayes th,jones grewe d,jones an insurance agent does not have a duty of care to advise the insured on specific insurance matters absent an express agreement or holding out as an expert free republic ins.th,no general duty of care to advise regarding the sufficiency of insurance.
turning to the issue at hand,we are unaware of even a single california precedent permitting a client to sue an insurance broker for breach of fiduciary duty.we note that eddy sharp d,suggested in dicta that a broker owes a fiduciary duty to the entity for which the broker procures insurance.and it has been acknowledged that a broker acts in a fiduciary capacity when he receives and holds premium or return premium hydro mill,hayward,tilton rolapp ins.associates,th,hydro mill.thus,in a technical sense,a broker is charged with certain fiduciary duties whether or not the relationship is fiduciary.ibid.but as one leading treatise noted,it is unclear in what respect the fiduciary duty owed by an independent insurance agent differs from the duty of due reasonable care.as used in reference to an independent agent,fiduciary duty may refer merely to avoidance of conflict of interest,excessive compensation,citation.ibid.recently,a federal court held this c ourt will not expand the doctrine of fiduciary duty to include insurance brokers,given that it has not been recognized by california courts.miniace pacific maritime,no.c si dist.lexis.
a case that offers a modicum of light in the legal darkness is kotlar hartford fire ins.th,kotlar.in kotlar,an insurance broker was sued for breaching a duty to provide the insured with notice of the insurer intent to cancel a policy.no such duty existed in case law,and the court declined to create one.though the appellant attempted to analogize a relationship to an relationship,the court stated that the analogy was wide of the mark.the relationship between an attorney and client is a fiduciary relationship of the very highest character,and attorneys have a duty of loyalty to their clients.citation.thus,while an attorney must represent his or her clients zealously within the bounds of the law citation,a broker only needs to use reasonable care to represent his or her client.citation.ibid.to support the distinction,the court noted that a dual agency can exist where a broker represents both the insured and the insurer.citation.for example,an insurance broker acts as an agent for the insured in procuring insurance for the insured,but the broker may also be the agent of the insurer in respect to the policy.citation.lawyers,on the other hand,normally do not represent both parties to a transaction.ibid.though the holding was not articulated in the most direct language possible,kotlar is authority for the proposition that a broker duties are defined by negligence law,not fiduciary law.
hydro mill cites and is consistent with kotlar.in hydro mill,a broker was held liable for professional negligence,breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty.the hydro mill court reversed based on a statute of limitations.in declining to apply a statute of limitations to the breach of fiduciary duty claim,the court stated t he applicable statute of limitations is determined by as variously phrased the nature of the right sued upon,the primary interest affected by the defendant wrongful conduct,or the gravamen of the action.citations.here,the complaint shows that the allegations of professional negligence subsume all of the allegations for breach of fiduciary duty.the statement of decision indicates that liability on both of those causes of action is based on the same findings the broker failed to obtain the requested insurance coverage and did not disclose that failure.in short,the client causes of action,regardless of appellation,amount to a claim of professional negligence.because a statute of limitations governs that type of claim citation,the client can not prolong the limitations period by invoking a fiduciary theory of liability.hydro mill,supra,th at.like kotlar,hydro mill held that a broker failure to disclose information is actionable only if it breaches the duty of care 
older cases reached the same result.in wilson all services ins.d wilson,a broker was sued on five theories,including negligence and breach of fiduciary duty,for placing insurance without looking beyond the insurer certificate of authority to conduct business and investigating its financial condition.the court held that the urged investigation was no
