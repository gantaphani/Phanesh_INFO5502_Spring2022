defendant and appellant warner.entertainment warner appeals a judgment on a jury verdict awarding plaintiffs and appellants alan ladd,ladd,jay kanter,producers corporation,ketram corporation and kanter corporation collectively,ladd in damages.warner also appeals the trial court orders denying its four motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov 
ladd from the judgment,insofar as the trial court granted warner motions for nonsuit on certain claims by ladd 
warner licensed packages of movies to broadcast television and cable networks.ladd movies were included in those packages.in a practice known as,warner allocated the same share of the licensing fee to every movie in a package,regardless of its value to the licensee.the gravamen of ladd action against warner is that by allocating the same portion of the licensing fee to every movie in a package without regard to the true value of each movie,warner deprived ladd of a fair allocation of the licensing fees to which ladd was entitled as a profit participant.
we hold that under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,warner was bound to act in good faith toward profit participants.warner had an obligation,as conceded by a warner executive,to fairly and accurately allocate license fees to each of the films based on their comparative value as part of a package.therefore,the record supports the jury determination that warner method of allocating licensing fees to profit participants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
we further hold that because the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,a defendant who asserts the plaintiff claims are partially barred by the statute of limitations has the burden of proving which portion of plaintiff damages are.here,warner failure to present damage segregation evidence constituted a failure of proof on an affirmative defense,entitling ladd to recover all of his proved damages.
in sum,we uphold the jury verdict in its entirety.however,the orders granting nonsuit on ladd claims relating to blade runner and deletion of screen credits and deletion of ladd company logo are reversed and the matter is remanded for a retrial of those claims.
factual and procedural background 
this action arises out of ladd claim that warner undervalued and underpaid the license fees attributable to the following twelve motion pictures blade runner,body heat,night shift,tequila sunrise,outland,chariots of fire,and the police academy franchise,consisting of the original and sequels,and.
by way of background,in,warner and ladd entered into a joint venture,essentially a within a studio.ladd had control over development of movies,financing of movies,production and distribution.warner role was to finance the films.
in,the parties entered into a termination agreement,under which the parties ended their joint venture,with warner remaining obligated to pay ladd the profit participation called for under their earlier agreement.
in,ladd conducted a profit participation audit the first audit of the motion pictures for the period from october,through september.the audit did not cover blade runner because warner represented to ladd said movie was unprofitable and was so far in the red it was not worthwhile to issue profit statements.in march,warner provided ladd with a statement indicating blade runner had lost million as of december.
following this audit,the parties entered into a settlement agreement and release.warner agreed to pay ladd and to increase royalty payments on home videos.pursuant to the settlement agreement,the parties released all claims,whether known or unknown,arising from,based on,or in any way relating to the distribution and exploitation through september,of the motion pictures the properties produced pursuant to,referenced in the earlier agreements between warner and ladd.
in,ladd learned another blade runner investor,empress investments empress,was receiving payments from warner even though warner told ladd the movie was unprofitable.ladd retained james perry perry to audit warner records the second audit.warner limited perry audit to the period from april,through march,for all films except blade runner and outland,which warner allowed perry to audit back to their inception.following the second audit,ladd filed the instant lawsuit.
proceedings.
on july,ladd filed this action against warner.the operative third amended complaint included causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and negligent misrepresentation.in addition to compensatory and punitive damages,ladd sought an accounting and imposition of a constructive trust.the gravamen of the action is that warner deprived ladd of the bargained for profit participation in the termination agreement by undervaluing ladd films relative to other films in television licensing packages.
trial testimony.
on july,the matter came on for a jury trial.the evidence showed warner licensed films to broadcasters or to cable in a package,in a practice known as straight lining,in which every feature film in that group or package is given the exact same value regardless of its value to the broadcaster or to the channel.david simon simon,ladd expert,with years experience in the television and entertainment industry,testified that in treating every movie as though it had the same value,the studio was not doing its expert work,as a provider or distributor of content,in weighing the value of each of these titles 
simon testimony in this regard was corroborated by eric frankel frankel,the president of warner domestic cable distribution,who was called by ladd as an adverse witness.frankel testified that in the licensing process,warner has an obligation to act in good faith toward profit participants,and as part of warner good faith obligation,warner was required to fairly and accurately allocate license fees to each of the films based on their comparative value as part of a package.
with respect to damages,simon determined warner should have allocated an additional million in licensing fees to ladd films.ladd was entitled to percent of gross revenues on all films once warner recouped its costs,except for chariots of fire,on which ladd was entitled to percent.thus,on the million in underallocated licensing fees,ladd profit participation should have been.
nonsuit rulings.
after ladd case in chief,the trial court granted nonsuit on ladd cause of action for fraud in connection with blade runner,finding no evidence of fraud.
the trial court also granted nonsuit on ladd claim for blade runner profits,on the ground said claim was foreclosed by the settlement agreement.with respect to blade runner,ladd was permitted to proceed solely on the claim that warner had underallocated licensing fees to said film during the period before this action was commenced.
the trial court also granted nonsuit on ladd claim warner improperly deleted lad screen credits or company logo from the films chariots of fire and once upon a time in america.the trial court ruled it found no evidence of any lost opportunities or any ascertainable loss due to loss of screen credit in the record.
the defense rested its case on july,
d.the verdict.
due to the nonsuit rulings,only two causes of action went to the jury breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the jury was instructed,inter alia,there are no express contractual obligations restricting the discretion afforded to warner in licensing the library films in which ladd has a participation interest.therefore,to prove their claims regarding warner licensing of the films,ladd must prove that warner breached the contract or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
on august,the jury returned a special verdict in ladd favor.the jury specifically found warner breached the contract with ladd or the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied into the contract,and that ladd suffered a monetary loss in the form of underpayment of profit participation as a proximate result of that breach.the jury determined that in the period from august,four years prior to the filing of the complaint to the present,warner had underallocated the license fees for ladd films,including blade runner,in the amount of which was consistent with simon testimony.with respect to damages,the jury found ladd should have been paid in additional profit participation on said license fees.
judgment on the verdict was entered on september.
on october,warner filed a motion for new trial as well as four motions for jnov,seeking entry of judgment in its favor.warner later withdrew its new trial motion.
warner sought jnov on the following grounds ladd was restricted to recovering damages incurred on or after august,but the verdict included damages on claims barred by the statute of limitations the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the amount of damages awarded by the jury the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that the damages awarded were proximately caused by any breach and the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that warner breached its contract,including the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,with ladd.
on november,the jnov motions came on for hearing.warner counsel acknowledged that in withdrawing the motion for new trial,warner was purposely going for broke,leaving the trial court with only two to uphold the entire verdict for ladd or to enter a judgment in favor of warner,notwithstanding the jury verdict 
the trial court denied all four motions for jnov.it found substantial evidence supported the jury determination that the way in which warner allocated license fees to ladd breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and that said breach caused ladd damage.
as for the jnov motions relating to the amount of damages,the trial court expressed concern that some portion of the damage award represented damages which may have been incurred prior to august,but recognized nobody ever told the jury how much of the licensing fees were earned before or after that date.a t no time did anybody ever break down these numbers.the trial court explained the reason i ca grant the motion for jnov is because there is evidence to support the verdict i ca say the plaintiff can not win i f i grant the jnov,i saying that there is no money that they can get.and it would have been easier for this court if there was the new trial motion.
f.the appeals.
the parties filed timely notices of appeal and.warner appealed the judgment and the orders denying its motions for jnov.ladd appealed the judgment,specifying the partial grant of nonsuit.
contentions 
warner contends ladd failed to prove warner breached its contractual obligations by undervaluing ladd films in license fee agreements the judgment must be reversed because ladd failed to specify the amount of damages ladd incurred during the permissible time period assuming simon testimony provides a basis for establishing liability and calculating ladd damages during the relevant time frame,the judgment should be reduced to the maximum amount of damages supported by his testimony and in the event this court does not reverse the judgment outright or reduce it to the maximum supported by simon testimony,this court should grant warner a new trial.
ladd contends the trial court erred in its nonsuit rulings because more than sufficient evidence and inferences exist to allow a reasonable jury to conclude warner knew the falsity of its representations that blade runner was not profitable the settlement of the audit claims did not bar ladd blade runner profitability claims,especially those accruing after and warner movie credit and logo deletions undeniably damaged ladd,precluding nonsuit.
discussion 
warner appeal 
substantial evidence supports the jury determination warner breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
as indicated,the special verdict included the finding that warner breached the contract with ladd or the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied into the contract.warner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support said finding.the contention fails.
warner owed a duty to allocate license fees fairly to ladd movies.
as a preliminary matter,every contract in california contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.kransco american empire surplus lines ins.cal th.the implied covenant finds particular application in situations where one party is invested with a discretionary power affecting the rights of another.such power must be exercised in good faith.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th.
consistent therewith,frankel,the president of warner domestic cable distribution,who was called by ladd as an adverse witness,testified that in the licensing process warner has an obligation to act in good faith toward profit participants.frankel acknowledged that as part of warner good faith obligation,warner was required to fairly and accurately allocate license fees to each of the films based on their comparative value as part of a package.frankel testified the valuation factors included the vintage of the film,the box office,the genre,the star,the awards,the utility,can you play it in multiple day parts or is it a movie that too sexy that maybe you can only play at at night.
thus,ladd established warner owed a duty to fairly allocate license fees to each of the films based on their relative value in an overall package.
substantial evidence supports the jury finding that warner breached said duty to ladd.
in this regard,ladd expert witness,simon,testified warner often licensed films to broadcasters or to cable in a package,in a practice known as straight lining,in which every feature film in the package is given the exact same value regardless of its value to the broadcaster or to the channel.in evaluating its movies,warner internally assigned each movie a grade of a,b or simon generally agreed with warner ratings and noted that all ladd films were rated either a or b.the problem was that warner allocated the same proportion of the license fee to each title in the package,irrespective of the film letter grade.simon opined that in treating every movie as though it had the same value,the studio was not doing its expert work,as a provider or distributor of content,in weighing the value of each of these titles 
simon also testified that in lined film packages,movies that were less valuable than ladd received greater value.for example,there were times when daffy duck and bugs bunny animated films were allocated double the money that was allocated to chariots of fire,a valuable feature film which won multiple academy awards,including best picture.those animated films are wholly owned by warner,which means warner keeps every dollar generated by licensing fees on those films.simon determined that warner was overallocating license fees to movies that were studio owned or that did not have profit participants.
warner purported justifications for are meritless.
warner seeks to avoid the unfairness of its allocations by contending that in certain cases,the buyers insisted on paying the same license fee for every film they acquired.however,the evidence showed licensees only care about the aggregate amount they are paying for an entire package of films.for example,in one licensing deal between warner and hbo,a package of films was negotiated for a price of,of which was allocated to chariots of fire.however,hbo did care whether warner internally allocated million of the licensing fee to chariots of fire,and some other picture would have been allocated less.
further,robert levi,a defense expert,testified the did not have a say in what the allocation would be from warner standpoint,and the buyer could not dictate how warner would allocate internally the monies from a licensing package to specific films within that package.thus,warner claim the buyer made me do it is meritless.
warner also defends its of films in a licensing package on the ground it is undisputed the practice of is common in the industry.however,the prevalence of was a disputed issue at trial.defense expert levi testified it was unusual that a licensing agreement would list each film in the package as having an equal license fee.the evidence also showed mgm did not engage in because different movies have different values.
moreover,even if were a common practice,it would not absolve warner of its duty to ladd,as a profit participant,to fairly allocate fees derived from licensing packages.
conclusion as to breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
substantial evidence supports the jury determination that warner breached its obligation to ladd,as a profit participant,to fairly allocate licensing fees to ladd movies based on their relative worth in licensing packages.
warner remaining contentions all relate to ladd damages.we now address those issues.
no merit to warner contention the judgment must be reversed on the ground the verdict includes damages that were incurred prior to the permissible time period warner had the burden at trial to prove all facts essential to its affirmative defense and failed to do so.
warner contends the judgment can not stand because the record contains no evidence identifying the amount of damages ladd suffered during the permissible time period.warner asserts the verdict includes damages that are barred by the settlement agreement,which agreement expressly barred claims arising through september.warner further argues the verdict includes damages incurred prior to august,damages which are barred by the statute of limitations.code civ.
warner contention the verdict can not stand because it includes damages that preceded the permissible time period is resolved by certain basic principles.the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,as is a settlement and release.samuels mix cal th,walton city of red bluff th.as with any affirmative defense,warner had the burden to prove all facts essential to its defenses that the settlement and release and the accrual of the statute of limitations barred some portion of ladd damages,samuels mix,supra,cal th at a defendant must prove the facts necessary to enjoy the benefits of a statute of limitations walton,supra,at defendant bears burden of proving a claim is barred by a release.
as stated in western recreational vehicles,swift adhesives,a div.of reichhold chemicals,cir,t he statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and its elements must be proved by the party asserting it.where a part of plaintiff claim for damages is barred by the statute of limitations and a part of it is not,the defendant pleading the statute as an affirmative defense has the burden of specifically proving which portion of plaintiff damages are barred by the statute.failure to so prove will result in a complete failure of the affirmative defense the obligation to segregate the damage should fall upon the wrongdoer and not upon the person he has harmed.italics omitted.
although warner faults ladd for not presenting evidence to establish what portion of damages may have been barred by warner statute of limitations and release defenses,the burden of producing such defense evidence rested with warner,not with ladd.
we reiterate the trial court ruling on warner motions for jnov i did hear this argument before.the one thing i remember about this case is that i could put my finger on an specific amount before and after the pertinent dates i could never put my finger on the amounts before,after,before,after.t here no question that before was released by the agreement.there no question that the statute of limitations barred anything before august the.i have those dates firm in my head and i understand that.the trial court explained,y ou giving me an argument that was never made to the jury.nobody wanted to play with numbers in this case.this is the first time we playing with numbers.
the essence of the numbers presented to the jury was as follows.simon testified ladd films were underallocated million in licensing fees.ladd claimed profit participation percentage in said licensing revenues was.the jury awarded ladd precisely that amount in compensatory damages.
when simon testified to the amount of underallocated licensing fees,warner could have elicited on what portion,if any,of the million in licensing fees preceded august.alternatively,warner could have presented its own witnesses to break down the licensing fees it earned from ladd movies,year by year.warner chose not to do so at trial.warner can not at this juncture complain about a damages case it wishes it had presented at trial.
as the trial court stated to warner counsel at the hearing on the jnov motions,you got accountants,and there absolutely no reason why they could have been broken down.but i do know why they were broken down.but you taken the position,well,since you did break them down there no evidence to support the verdict.but i can not say that the plaintiff can not win.the motion for jnov is a dispositive motion.and if i were to grant the jnov,i say under no circumstances can they win.and that not true.the trial court added,you know,i get this all the time in cases where the defendants will say,well,if you are going to award i do think you me tell you damages that you should award if any.
the trial court also recognized warner counsel had intentionally placed the court in a dilemma,by not seeking a new trial on the ground of excessive damages and moving solely for jnov.however,because the evidence,and particularly simon testimony,provided substantial support for the damages awarded by the jury,a jnov did not lie.
in sum,we reject warner contention the judgment must be reversed because ladd failed to specify the amount of damages incurred during the permissible time period.we hold warner had the burden at trial to show what portion,if any,of ladd damages may have been barred by the settlement agreement which released all claims through september,or by the august,accrual of the statute of limitations.warner failed to meet its burden below,entitling ladd to recover all the proven damages.
begin nonpublished portion.
no merit to warner challenge to sufficiency of evidence to support the damage award.
simon methodology.
by way of background,simon testified he reviewed all license agreements warner produced in this lawsuit.of the licensing agreements,simon selected a core group of agreements from the larger markets which typically dictate the value of movies and which,in his opinion,collectively provided a of the domestic and international marketplace.as indicated,warner internally assigned each movie a grade of a,b or c and simon generally agreed with warner ratings.ladd titles were all a or b.simon differed with warner as to the allocation of the license fees within a package.simon increased warner revenues on ladd a films by percent,and on ladd b films by percent.guided by the average underallocation in the core licensing deals,simon determined warner had underallocated million to ladd films.
warner arguments regarding simon testimony are unavailing.
even assuming warner contentions in this regard are not barred by warner failure to seek a new trial on the ground of excessive damages county of los angeles southern cal.edison,supra,th at,the contentions fail.
warner asserts simon speculated that ladd films were undervalued by the same percentages in the more than license agreements he had not reviewed,and that simon extrapolated from agreements that he analyzed to the other agreements that he failed to analyze.the record is contrary.simon testified he reviewed all license agreements produced by warner,and those agreements were consistent with the undervaluation he found in the core agreements.
warner further contends the damage award is unsupported because only of the licensing agreements reviewed by simon were admitted as documentary exhibits.warner argues that without all the licensing agreements in evidence,the jury lacked sufficient information to determine whether ladd films were undervalued and could not verify whether simon correctly performed his analysis.
thus,in essence,warner is attacking the weight of simon testimony,on the ground simon oral testimony was not fully corroborated by the documentary exhibits.however,simon testified he reviewed all agreements,thereby laying a foundation for his testimony,and the jury found simon testimony credible.jurors need not review and sift through every document on which experts base their opinions to the accuracy of the analysis.the jury was entitled to rely on simon testimony.if warner believed simon testimony regarding the other licensing agreements was inaccurate,it could have him on those other agreements,or presented its own expert testimony about them.
moreover,warner did not object or seek to restrict the scope of simon testimony to the licensing agreements which were admitted as documentary exhibits.therefore,warner waived said objection.e vidence which is admitted in the trial court without objection,although incompetent,should be considered in support of that court action citations and objection may not be first raised at the appellate level.estate of fraysher cal d.
in an attempt to overcome its failure to object below to simon testimony regarding licensing agreements which were not admitted as documentary exhibits,warner reply brief contends it is not here raising an evidentiary challenge to simon testimony,it is arguing that the verdict is not supported by substantial evidence.the argument is meritless.the effect of warner failure to object below to simon testifying to damages beyond the licensing agreements which were admitted as documentary exhibits is that said objection to simon testimony was waived.therefore,simon testimony regarding those other licensing agreements was properly considered by the jury estate of fraysher,supra,cal d at,and it constitutes substantial evidence to support the verdict.
remaining issues not reached.
because simon testimony constitute substantial evidence to support the verdict,it is unnecessary to discuss warner contentions that this court should reduce the judgment to the maximum amount of damages supported by simon testimony,or that this court should grant warner a new trial.
standard governing appellate review of nonsuit.
as we stated in claxton atlantic richfield th,claxton,b ecause a successful nonsuit motion precludes submission of plaintiff case to the jury,courts grant motions for nonsuit only under very limited circumstances.campbell general motors cal d.a court may not grant a motion for nonsuit if the evidence presented by the plaintiff would support a jury verdict in the plaintiff favor.carson facilities development cal d,carson dipalma seldman th,dipalma.

trial court erred in granting nonsuit on ladd blade runner fraud claim.
by way of background,ladd showed warner fraudulently represented that blade runner was so grossly unprofitable that there was no need to send ladd accounting statements or to conduct an audit as to ladd profit participation in the movie.the trial court granted nonsuit on this claim,finding no evidence of fraud.
generally,t he elements of fraud are a misrepresentation false representation,concealment,or nondisclosure b knowledge of falsity or scienter c intent to defraud,to induce reliance d justifiable reliance and e resulting damage.citation.small fritz companies,cal th.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to ladd,in accordance with the applicable standard of review,the evidence showed in march,warner provided ladd with a statement indicating blade runner had lost million as of december.warner repeatedly misrepresented to ladd that blade runner was so far in the red it would never make a profit.warner told ladd there was no reason to send accounting statements or to bother with a costly audit because the movie was so unprofitable.ladd relied on warner representations,knowing warner had a duty to act in good faith.warner misrepresentations only came to light in,when ladd discovered warner was paying profit participation to empress.
warner payment of profit participation to empress,but not to ladd,on the same movie,is sufficient to raise a triable issue as to fraud.therefore,the trial court erred in taking the issue away from the jury by granting nonsuit on the blade runner fraud claim.that claim must be resolved by the trier of fact.
trial court erred in ruling the settlement barred ladd claims relating to blade runner profits a release procured by fraud is ineffective.
in the settlement agreement,the parties released all claims,whether known or unknown,arising from,based on,or in any way relating to the distribution and exploitation through september,of the motion pictures the properties produced pursuant to,referenced in the earlier agreements between warner and ladd.
in granting nonsuit with respect to ladd blade runner claims,the trial court ruled both past and future claims were barred by the settlement agreement between the parties.italics added.the jury was advised,ladd claims for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on the dispute over the accounting treatment of the negative cost and interest for the film blade runner are no longer in this case.
as a preliminary matter,to the extent the trial court held the settlement agreement barred future claims relating to blade runner,that ruling is contrary to the language in the agreement resolving all claims only through september.
further,as discussed above,ladd presented substantial evidence warner falsely represented that blade runner was so deeply in the red that there was no need to bother with a costly audit.thus,ladd d id even bother to audit because it made no sense.as a result,the first audit,which led to the settlement agreement,omitted the film blade runner.
