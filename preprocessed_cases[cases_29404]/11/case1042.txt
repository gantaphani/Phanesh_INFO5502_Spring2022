this appeal arises from a contract dispute.both parties prevailed on some of their claims,and both appeal.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
orion financial orion and american foods group,american foods entered into a consulting agreement the agreement on april,under which orion agreed to procure grants and loans for the benefit of american foods.under the agreement,orion is entitled to a flat rate fee and success fees determined as a percentage of each grant or loan amount orion procured.the agreement defines various categories of grants and loans in subsections b to b and sets forth applicable success fees for each type.american foods terminated the agreement effective april.the agreement provides that orion is entitled to full success fees for any loans or grants american foods received within one year of termination and that it is entitled to fifty percent of the applicable success fees for any loans and grants received between twelve and eighteen months after termination.
as the district court observed,the definitions found in b to b of the agreement are not a model of clarity.only section b and subsections b,b and b are relevant to this appeal.these sections state 
b a success fee is to be paid upon the completion of each component of financing american foods shall not be obligated to pay orion success fees in excess of the success fees shall be paid based on the following 
upon the completion of new senior secured debt,subordinated debt,convertible debt or equity.this success fee will be three and one half percent on the first of any such debt or equity placed and four and one half percent of any such additional debt or equity placed.subordinated debt,convertible debt or equity shall be any capital which is not secured by a perfected first security interest in real estate,capital equipment or accounts receivable and inventory.
upon the completion of any grant or forgivable loans provided by the state of south dakota or any other governmental entity related to the john morrell incentive package.this success fee will be three and one half percent sic of any such financing above.
upon the completion of any loans provided by the state of south dakota or any other governmental entity related to the john morrell incentive package.this success fee will be two percent of any such financing above.
american foods received numerous grants and loans during the period covered by the agreement.it paid the base fee and some success fees,as follows.first,it paid on a million forgivable loan from the governor office of economic development under b.this fee is not disputed.american foods also paid success fees of on a loan from the greater huron development corporation under b greater huron development loan.american foods counterclaimed for refund of this payment.the district court granted summary judgment to orion on the counterclaim,and american foods appeals.
orion sued to recover success fees on several other instances of funding.the district court granted fees on the following amounts.the district court placed under subsection b a renegotiated revolving loan from cit corporation cit loan and a capital lease from cryovac cryovac lease under subsection b a grant to the city of huron,south dakota huron grant and under subsection b a million loan to the city of huron,south dakota huron loan,a loan from the city of mitchell,south dakota mitchell loan,a loan from the areawide business council for the city of mitchell areawide loan,and a redi loan from the south dakota board of economic development to american foods redi loan.the district court granted success fees on all these transactions on summary judgment,except on the cryovac lease,which it granted after trial.american foods appeals from all these rulings.orion appeals from only some of them,claiming that it should have received more fees on some of the loans.
in addition,the district court granted prejudgment interest to orion from the date orion demanded payment from american foods.on appeal,orion claims that it should have been awarded prejudgment interest from earlier dates.
finally,orion also claims it should receive attorney fees and collection costs as provided in the agreement.the district court held that the attorney fees provision in the contract violated south dakota law and denied the request.

in south dakota,whether a contract is ambiguous is a matter of law.ducheneaux miller.a contract is ambiguous if it is reasonably capable of being understood in more than one sense.id.quotation omitted.a contract is not ambiguous just because the parties disagree on the meaning rather,the contract must be ambiguous to an objective observer.id.only if a court finds that a contract is ambiguous may it consider extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of the contract.id.
before turning to the specific provisions of the agreement,we must dispense with the parties differing interpretations of the threshold under the success fee provisions.as to particular loans,american foods repeatedly argues that success fees should not be awarded because each individual loan or grant at issue did not meet the applicable minimum threshold provision.the district court employed a different method it applied the minimum threshold to the aggregate amount of funding under the relevant subsection.we conclude that the district court did not err in adopting this approach,because the threshold amounts are phrased in terms of any such financing above a certain level.an objective observer would conclude that the only reasonable way to read this phrase is that orion is entitled to success fees on the aggregate level of funding it produced,for otherwise orion would have no incentive to procure lower level loans and grants.
with that in mind,we will examine each subsection in turn,first considering the issues of interpretation relevant to that subsection and next the individual loans and grants the district court placed under that subsection.
fees under subsection b 
as described above,the agreement contains a clause providing success fees for loans and grants received after the agreement was terminated.american foods argues that the success fee clause allows such fees only on loans and grants that relate to the john morrell incentive package that are covered by subsections b and b and does not allow fees on loans that fall under b.this argument is contrary to the plain meaning of the agreement.the clause refers to loans such as those relating to the morrell package.an objective reader would interpret the phrase such as to mean for example.american foods would have us read the phrase such as to exclude all other possibilities.because american foods interpretation is contrary to the plain meaning of the contract,we reject it.accordingly,the district court did not err in awarding post termination fees under b.
the cit loan 
on september,cit provided american foods with a revolving loan with a maximum credit of million.after rising temporarily,the loan maximum credit returned to million as of the beginning of.in june of,troy jones,president of orion,and an associate accompanied carl kuehne,ceo of american foods,to new york for a meeting with cit officials to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the revolving loan.after the meeting,cit reduced the interest rate,extended the term,increased the sublimits within the overall revolving loan,and increased the overall maximum credit to million.
american foods contends that prior to going to new york,kuehne and jones orally agreed that orion would not expect compensation for any work on the cit loan,other than expenses of the trip.such an agreement would constitute an oral modification of the agreement,which requires additional consideration,or the doing or the suffering of something not required to be done or suffered by the terms of the writing.jones longerbeam.the agreement already required american foods to pay orion travel expenses,so in taking jones along and paying for his trip american foods did not do anything it was not already required to do.furthermore,belying american foods claim that jones did no work on the renegotiated cit loan,kuehne sent jones a note after the meeting thanking him for his help in new york,which was instrumental in our successful meeting.thus,orion is entitled to a success fee for the cit loan.
american foods also contends that because the term new senior secured debt in b is ambiguous,the district court should have admitted the testimony of american foods expert to explain the term.american foods argues that the cit loan was a working capital loan,not new senior secured debt.however,the term new senior secured debt in the agreement unambiguously includes working capital loans.the agreement specifically includes working capital loans and excludes only loans from a different company.accordingly,because the term new senior secured debt includes the cit loan,the district court did not err in excluding testimony from american foods expert.
american foods also argues that orion should be estopped from asking for a success fee on the cit loan because it reasonably relied on orion promise not to ask for a success fee.american foods did not raise this argument in the district court,however,and thus we will not consider it for the first time on appeal.see colonial ins.of cal.spirco,cir.we consider newly raised issues only if they are purely legal and no additional factual development is necessary,or where manifest injustice would otherwise result.first bank investors trust tarkio,cir.neither exception applies here.
american foods final argument on the cit loan is that the course of performance between the parties indicates that no success fee was owed on the cit loan.as evidence of this,american foods points out that orion did not assert that a fee was owed until april,months after the new york meeting,despite having billed american foods for other success fees in the interim.american foods cites of the restatement second of contracts as the only authority for this proposition.that section provides that where an agreement involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other,any course accepted or acquiesced in without objection is given weight in the interpretation of the agreement.restatement second of contracts.this language simply does not cover orion delay in billing american foods for the cit loan.the occasion for performance in the agreement were orion work on individual loans,not its sending of bills.orion completed its duties,and its delay in sending a bill is irrelevant to the question whether the contractual language covers the cit loan.
because orion is entitled to success fees for the renegotiated cit loan,we must consider the amount of the fees.orion argues that it earned a success fee on the loan entire million maximum credit and that the fee was earned as soon as the amendments to the loan and security agreement were executed.orion argues that the district court erred by not considering the additional benefits to american foods,such as the lower interest rates and the deferral of repayment.orion argument that the extension of credit on the entire amount creates new debt is unpersuasive,because the purpose of the contract was to have orion find new funding sources.the district court was correct in ruling that the success fee provisions do not cover the negotiation of more favorable terms.the negotiation of more favorable terms was presumably covered by the flat rate fee.
the only new debt is the increase in the revolving loan maximum credit,so at most orion would be entitled to fees on the million increase.orion contends that it became entitled to success fees on the million increase in maximum credit upon the execution of the amendments to the cit loan.the district court disagreed and determined the new secured debt was not completed until cit actually advanced the loan funds to american foods.the district court calculated the success fee as of october,when the outstanding loan balance was the highest within an period after termination of the agreement.according to the agreement,orion was entitled to percent of the success fee on any funding received by american foods within a period of more than twelve months but less than eighteen months following termination of the agreement.
under the terms of the agreement,american foods was obligated to pay orion a success fee upon the completion of each component of financing.we agree with orion position that completion of the cit loan occurred upon execution of the second amended loan and security agreement.once executed,the revolving loan increase in maximum credit became effective,and cit was contractually obligated to advance funds to american foods in an amount up to million.upon execution of the amendment documents,the million of increased financing was immediately available to american foods for use in its business planning and in its representations to suppliers,customers and shareholders.as of the execution date,orion had fully performed its obligations under the agreement.nothing further remained for completion.
accordingly,we conclude the district court award of success fees on the cit loan was inconsistent with the plain language of the agreement.success fees should be awarded at percent under subsection b.we thus reverse and remand for entry of a revised award as to the renegotiated cit loan,subject to the agreement cap on success fees.
the cryovac capital lease 
after trial,the district court considered several equipment leases and held that orion provided tangible services as to only one of cryovac awarded a success fee award for that lease.american foods asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support this award.
the district court evaluated jones testimony that he provided services on the cryovac lease and found it to be credible,a finding that we can not say was clearly erroneous.accordingly,we affirm this award.
fees under subsection b 
subsections b and b provide success fees for loans or grants related to the john morrell incentive package morrell package.this phrase is not defined in the agreement.american foods argues that because the definition of the morrell package is ambiguous,the district court should not have granted summary judgment on most of the loans and grants under these two subsections.
the district court agreed that the definition of the morrell package was ambiguous,but ruled that deposition testimony from kuehne and an affidavit from jones provided the definition and eliminated any issues of material fact,thus making summary judgment appropriate.jones affidavit described the morrell package as including only pass through assistance,which is money from the state to cities for projects designed to benefit american foods,and direct loans and grants from the state.kuehne testified that john morrell received pass through assistance and direct loans from the state as part of a financing package it received and that the phrase in the contract was a shorthand way to refer to the funding john morrell received from the state.kuehne later filed an affidavit in which he stated that loans from the state of south dakota,city of huron,loan sic and the city of mitchell were included in the phrase john morrell incentive package.
like the district court,we fin
