facts and procedural history 
louis vuitton is the sole and exclusive united states distributor of its merchandise,which includes a variety of luxury goods bearing its trademarks and copyrighted designs.to guard the reputation and exclusivity of its brand and to otherwise maintain its rights,louis vuitton polices its intellectual property,including its trademarks and copyrights,through various monitoring and enforcement strategies.
in late,louis vuitton discovered websites selling goods that it believed infringed its copyrights and trademarks.the websites did not sell merchandise directly instead,they listed an email address that interested parties could use to initiate a transaction.upon further investigation louis vuitton discovered that the websites were using ip addresses assigned to defendants msg and akanoc.
msg and akanoc were in the web hosting business.chen managed both msg and akanoc,which were based in san jose,california.according to defendants,msg leased servers,bandwidth,and some ip addresses to akanoc.akanoc,in turn,operated the servers and otherwise ran the business akanoc leased packages of server space,bandwidth,and ip addresses to its customers some of akanoc customers were located outside the united states.according to louis vuitton,the customers who directly infringed the trademarks and copyrights were based in china.
from to,louis vuitton sent defendants at least eighteen notices of infringement nois documenting trademark and copyright infringement occurring on numerous websites hosted by defendants.the nois demanded that defendants either remove the infringing content from their servers or require their customers to do so.louis vuitton received no response from defendants.although defendants asserted that they took regular steps to curb any infringement by websites using their servers,defendants were not able to identify any action taken in response to the notices sent by louis vuitton,and the websites continued to operate using servers and ip addresses owned by defendants.
louis vuitton sued defendants in the northern district of california,alleging contributory copyright and trademark infringement under federal law.louis vuitton contended that defendants had actual knowledge of the websites activities,that defendants knowingly avoided learning the full extent of the infringing activities and deliberately disregarded louis vuitton notifications,that defendants knowingly enabled the infringing conduct by hosting the websites and willfully permitting websites to display the products,and that louis vuitton suffered irreparable harm and damage as a result of defendants conduct.
the case went to trial and the jury returned a verdict for louis vuitton,holding akanoc,msg,and chen liable for contributory infringement of thirteen of louis vuitton trademarks,and of two of louis vuitton copyrights.the jury also found that defendants acted willfully.the jury awarded in statutory damages for willful contributory trademark infringement of the thirteen trademarks against each defendant,for a total of.the jury also awarded in statutory damages for willful copyright infringement of the two copyrights against each defendant,for a total of.
after the verdict,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law,requesting among other things that the court discard the jury verdict.the district court granted the motion as to msg,concluding that there was no evidence indicating that msg sold domain names,operated the servers,or did anything more than own and lease the hardware operated by akanoc and chen.the district court denied the motion as to akanoc and chen,awarded statutory damages,and entered a permanent injunction restricting them from engaging in similar conduct.akanoc and chen timely appealed.louis vuitton the district court order granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of msg.

iii.discussion 
a.the cross appeal 
louis vuitton contends that the district court erred when it set aside the jury verdict against msg.we disagree.the jury verdict as to msg was not supported by substantial evidence.see johnson paradise valley unified sch,cir substantial evidence is evidence adequate to support the jury conclusion.
with regard to both contributory copyright and trademark infringement,the district court verdict form asked the jury to determine whether each defendant,while knowing that its customers were using its services to directly infringe louis vuitton intellectual property rights,had reasonable means to withdraw its services so that they could not be used to directly infringe but continued to provide its services.we agree with the district court that no evidence presented at trial showed that msg operated the servers that hosted the direct infringers websites.even assuming that the direct infringers could be construed as msg customers,louis vuitton presented no evidence that msg had reasonable means to withdraw services to the direct infringers.
appellants motion for judgment as a matter of law 
appellants akanoc and chen urge that the district court erred in denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law.but appellants give no reasoned argument to support their conclusory assertion.it would be permissible to conclude that this issue is not properly presented,and as a consequence to decline to review it.see united states loya,cir issues raised in a brief which are not supported by argument are deemed abandoned.leer murphy,cir we will only review an issue not properly presented if our failure to do so would result in manifest injustice.however,in reviewing the particular issues of substantive law raised by appellants as described below,we have concluded that the jury had sufficient facts before it to find appellants liable as a matter of law,and therefore the district court did not err in denying appellants motion for judgment as a matter of law.
jury instructions 
contributory trademark infringement 
to prevail on its claim of contributory trademark infringement,louis vuitton had to establish that appellants continued to supply its services to one who it knew or had reason to know was engaging in trademark infringement.inwood,ives.because appellants provided services rather than a product,louis vuitton also needed to establish that appellants had d irect control and monitoring of the instrumentality used by a third party to infringe louis vuitton marks.lockheed martin network solutions,cir holding that the court must consider the extent of control exercised by the defendant over the third party means of infringement.
appellants contend that the district court did not instruct the jury about the proper scope of the means of infringement.according to appellants,the servers and internet services they provided and operated were not the means of infringement instead,they maintain,the websites selling the infringing goods were the sole means of infringement.appellants claim that the jury instructions failed to distinguish between the servers or services provided by appellants and the websites maintained by appellants customers.but websites are not ethereal while they exist,virtually,in cyberspace,they would not exist at all without physical roots in servers and internet services.as the district court held,appellants physically host websites on their servers and route internet traffic to and from those websites.this service is the internet equivalent of leasing real estate.louis vuitton malletier,akanoc solutions,d.appellants had control over the services and servers provided to the websites.stated another way,appellants had direct control over the master switch that kept the websites online and available.the district court did not abuse its discretion by formulating jury instructions that referred to the servers and services provided by appellants see wall data,at.
appellants also contend that the jury instructions were erroneous because,in their view,contribution to infringement must be intentional for liability to arise.we disagree.plaintiffs asserting contributory trademark infringement claims must prove that defendants provided their services with actual or constructive knowledge that the users of their services were engaging in trademark infringement.see inwood,at perfect,visa int l serv.ass n,cir.an express finding of intent is not required 
contributory copyright infringement 
appellants claim the jury instructions on contributory copyright infringement were erroneous because they omitted both the elements of intent and material contribution.although we agree that the instructions deviated from the ninth circuit model jury instructions,we reject appellants arguments.see mcdowell calderon,cir explaining that model jury instructions are not blessed with any special precedential authority.
we have never held that an express finding of intent is necessary to support liability for contributory copyright infringement.to the contrary,we have held that intent may be imputed as a result of a service provider knowing failure to prevent infringing actions,at.the district court was not required to instruct the jury,as appellants suggest,to make a separate finding that appellants knowing action evinced intent to contribute to copyright infringement.see a m records,napster,cir contributory liability requires that the secondary infringer know or have reason to know of direct infringement.appellants also argue that the jury instructions should have required an express finding of material contribution.we disagree.
material contribution turns on whether the activity in question substantially assists direct infringement,at.there is no question that providing direct infringers with server space satisfies that standard.in visa,at,we held as a matter of law that defendants did not materially contribute to infringement because t hey d id not operate the servers on which the infringing images reside d.the opposite is true here.akanoc servers are an essential step in the infringement process.id.at kozinski,dissenting.the district court did not err by narrowing the instruction on material contribution to the only genuine question as to that appellants provided their services to direct infringers.see also napster.at holding that napster materially contribute d to the infringing activity because,w ithout the support services defendant provides,napster users could not find and download the music they want with the ease of which defendant boasts internal quotation marks removed alteration in original 
appellants further contend that the jury instructions erroneously allowed the jury to find that appellants engaged in willful infringement based solely on a finding of knowing contribution to direct infringement.appellants object that under this formulation,a finding of willfulness requires proof of no element beyond those of contributory copyright infringement.but appellants do not explain what additional element should be required.the district court formulation accurately reflected the law.a finding of willfulness in the copyright context can be based on either intentional behavior,or merely reckless behavior.in re barboza,cir.to prove willfulness under the copyright act,the plaintiff must show that the defendant was actually aware of the infringing activity,or that the defendant actions were the result of reckless disregard for,or willful blindness to,the copyright holder rights.island software computer,microsoft corp,cir.
contributory trademark infringementa.statutory damages 
appellants contend that c does not authorize statutory damages against contributory infringers.section c provides for statutory damages for the use of counterfeit marks 
in a case involving the use of a counterfeit mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,or distribution of goods or services,the plaintiff may elect,at any time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court,to recover,instead of actual damages and profits under subsection a of this section,an award of statutory damages for any such use in connection with the sale,offering for sale,or distribution of goods or services in the amount of 
not less than or more than per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold,offered for sale,or distributed,as the court considers just or 
if the court finds that the use of the counterfeit mark was willful,not more than per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold,offered for sale,or distributed,as the court considers just.
c.appellants assert that statutory damages can not be awarded against contributory infringers because the statute defines infringement in terms of the unauthorized use of a counterfeit mark.but c does not require defendants to use the counterfeit mark.it applies so long as the case involves such use.id.emphasis added.at bottom,appellants urge us to hold that a defendant may avoid the consequences of contributory liability,statutory damages simply by claiming that the infringing acts the unauthorized uses were committed by others.but holding a defendant liable for the unauthorized acts of another is a primary purpose of the doctrine of contributory trademark liability.
appellants contend that,read as a whole,lays out an integrated scheme for recovery of damages.under appellants proposed reading of the statute,damages for contributory infringement involving the use of a counterfeit mark may only be awarded under b,which requires courts assessing damages under subsection a to treble the award if the violation consists of providing goods or services necessary to the commission of an intentional,knowing use of a counterfeit mark.b.appellants ignore,however,that a plaintiff may eschew actual damages under a and elect to seek statutory damages under c.k n eng g,bulat,cir.
likelihood of confusion 
the district court instructed the jury that t here is a likelihood of confusion when the offending mark is a counterfeit mark,or a mark virtually identical to a previously registered mark coupled with the intent to pass off or borrow from established good will.appellants urge that this instruction misstates the law.they cite our decision in kendall jackson winery,gallo winery,where we held that proof of intent to cause confusion is entitled to great weight,not that it creates a presumption of confusion that shifts the burden of proof to the other party,cir citing fuddruckers,doc others,cir.but the district court instruction specified that the presumption arises when intent to cause confusion is coupled with the use of a counterfeit mark or a mark virtually identical to a previously registered mark.this formulation accurately tracks the law.we have approvingly cite
