background 
emi is a trade association consisting of manufacturers of agricultural,construction,forestry,materials handling,and utility equipment.many of emi members enter into individual contractual relationships with dealers whom they have determined are qualified to market and service their machinery to consumers in specified markets.agco,case,john deere,and new holland are manufacturers of agricultural equipment,and members of emi.the relationships between the manufacturers and dealers are governed by dealership agreements,which establish the respective rights and duties of each party and the essential structure of the business relationship between them.
sections,and of the south dakota codified laws,in force since,make it a class misdemeanor for a manufacturer to coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to take certain actions,or to cancel a dealership agreement unfairly,without due regard to the equities of the dealer and without just provocation.codified laws to,laws ch.these protections were augmented by the passage of the act,which took effect on july,codified laws to,laws ch.section sets forth five circumstances that do not constitute cause for termination of a dealership contract.

ii.discussion 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and applies the same standards as did the district court.wildman marshalltown sch,cir educational employees credit union mut.guar,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a ruling in its favor as a matter of law.c jensen taco john int l,cir.
the central question to this appeal is whether section of the act entitled an act to provide certain restrictions for dealership contracts for machinery,impermissibly impairs dealership agreements between manufacturers and south dakota dealers that were in effect prior to july.on appeal,the manufacturers argue that section impairs the obligations within the dealership agreements in violation of the contract clauses of the south dakota and united states constitution.under south dakota law,the determination of whether a statute violates the contract clause is the same under both the south dakota and united states constitutions.const.art.vi,engelcke farmers state bank.therefore,the court analysis focuses on the contract clause of the united states constitution,which provides no state shall pass any law impairing the obligations of contracts.const.art.i.
the test to determine if a statute violates the contract clause has three parts 
the first inquiry is whether the state law has,in fact,operated as a substantial impairment on contractual relationships.energy reserves group,kansas power light,d educational employees credit union,at.if there is no substantial impairment on contractual relationships,the law does not violate the contract clause.if,however,the law does constitute a substantial impairment,the second part of the test is addressed 
the state must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation.educational employees credit union,at,energy reserves group,at.at the requirement of a legitimate public purpose guarantees that the state is exercising its police power,rather than providing a benefit to special interests.if there is no significant and legitimate public purpose,the state law is unconstitutional under the contract clause.id.if a significant and legitimate public purpose has been identified,the third part of the test is applied 
this court must determine whether the adjustment of the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties is based upon reasonable conditions and is of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the legislation adoption.energy reserves group,at.at quoting united states trust new jersey,d.
section of the act is a substantial impairment on dealership agreements 
the first part of the contract clause test is whether section of the act substantially impairs dealership agreements.in general motors romein,d,the supreme court set forth a test to determine whether a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship exists.this inquiry has three components whether there is a contractual relationship,whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship,and whether the impairment is substantial.id.at.at holding there was no contractual relationship regarding the statutory terms at issue,and therefore no violation of the contract clause.in the current case the first component is clearly satisfied,as neither party disputes that contracts between the manufacturers and dealers exist it remains,then,to determine whether section impairs the dealership contracts,and whether that impairment is substantial.
section of the act is an impairment on dealership agreements 
the second component of the inquiry into whether there is a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship is to find the contractual rights that are impaired.in assessing the validity of the manufacturers contracts clause claim in this case,we begin by identifying the precise contractual right that has been impaired keystone bituminous coal ass debenedictis,d.in other words,before the court can determine whether the impairment is substantial,it must first identify what contractual rights,if any,have been impaired.the manufacturers contend,and this court agrees,that several contractual terms within the dealership agreements have been impaired,including a terms governing a change in dealership executive management or ownership b terms about dealers stocking machinery parts and accessories c terms covering the manufacturer attempts to further penetrate the market d terms regarding a dealer sale of another of machinery and e terms about required dealer participation in advertising and promotional activities.
dealership agreement terms governing a change in dealership executive management or ownership 
all of the dealership contracts before this court contain language prohibiting a dealer from selling the dealership,or changing executive management,without approval by the manufacturer under section of the act,a manufacturer does not have cause to terminate a dealership contract if there is a change of executive management or ownership of the dealer,unless the manufacturer can show that the change would be detrimental to the representation or reputation of the manufacturer product.codified laws,laws ch.
dealership contract terms regarding dealers stocking machinery parts and accessories 
all of the dealership contracts at issue contain language requiring the dealer to maintain an adequate stock,as determined by the manufacturer,of parts and accessories under section of the act,a manufacturer does not have cause to terminate a dealership contract if the dealer refuses to purchase or accept delivery of any machinery,parts,accessories,or any other commodity or service not ordered by the dealer unless such machinery,parts,accessories,or other commodity or service is necessary for the operation of machinery commonly sold in the dealer area of responsibility.codified laws,laws ch.
dealership contract terms covering manufacturers attempts to further penetrate the market 
all of the dealership contracts proffered by contain language which allows a manufacturer to terminate a dealership contract for the sole reason that the manufacturer desires further penetration of the market under section of the act,a manufacturer does not have cause to terminate a dealership contract,or establish a new dealership in the original dealer community for the same,for t he sole fact that the manufacturer desires further penetration of the market.codified laws,laws ch,
dealership contract terms regarding a dealer sale of another of machinery 
two of the dealership agreements are terminable if the dealer does not comply with the conditions of selling another of machinery under section of the act,a manufacturer does not have cause to terminate a dealership contract if 
the dealer owns,has an investment in,participates in the management of,or holds a dealership contract for the sale of another of machinery,or that the dealer has established another of machinery in the same dealership facilities as those of the manufacturer,if the dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each of machinery.
codified laws,laws ch.
dealership contract terms regarding required dealer participation in advertising and promotional activities 
several of the dealership agreements contain specific provisions that set forth the dealer responsibilities concerning advertising and sales promotion activities under section of the act,a manufacturer does not have cause to terminate a dealership contract if the dealer refuses to participate in any national advertising campaign or contest or purchase any promotional materials,display devices,or display decoration or materials which are at the expense of the dealer.codified laws,laws ch.
as outlined above,section of the act impairs specific contractual rights contained in the dealership agreements.therefore,the second component for determining whether the dealership agreements are substantially impaired by section of the act is satisfied.
the impairments on dealership agreements by section of the act are substantial 
the third component of the inquiry for determining whether the dealership agreements are substantially impaired is to ascertain whether section of the act has,in fact,operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.energy reserves group,kansas power light,d quoting allied structural steel spannaus,d.this court will consider the extent to which the parties reasonable contract expectations have been disrupted to determine whether the impairment is substantial.in re workers compensation refund,cir in determining the extent of the impairment,we are to consider whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been regulated in the past.energy reserves group,at.at.the impairment does not need to be total,but the more severe the impairment,the closer scrutiny the statute will receive.allied structural steel,at.at,united states trust new jersey,d,workers compensation refund,at.therefore,to analyze the nature of the impairment,we a first set forth the nature of the impairment produced by each subsection of section of the act on the dealership agreements and then b consider how previous regulation affects the extent of the impairment.
a.the nature of the impairment 
section of the act 
under all the dealership contracts before this court,the dealer has the burden of proving to the manufacturer the fitness of a prospective owner or manager of a dealership any change in ownership or executive management without the manufacturer approval is cause for termination of the dealership agreement.see supra.section of the act shifts that burden to the manufacturer,requiring it to show that the change would be detrimental to the representation or reputation of the manufacturer product.codified laws,laws ch.shifting the burden to the manufacturer substantially impairs the terms of the dealership agreement,especially given the special nature of the relationship between dealers and manufacturers.among the distinctive features typical of that relationship are the credit that manufacturers extend to dealers intangible factors manufacturers use in choosing dealers and the extensive degree to which dealers represent the manufacturers to the public.see appellees separate appendix appellees app.
the identity of the owner or executive management of the dealership is important to the manufacturer because,as the state acknowledges,many manufacturers provide machinery to dealers on credit.see appellees app.a manufacturer reasonably may be concerned that a mismanaged dealership will sell the machinery,provided on credit,and fail to reimburse the manufacturer.for this reason,manufacturers routinely place the burden on dealers to show that a change in ownership or management of the dealership would not be injurious to the manufacturer interests.see supra.
shifting the burden from the dealers to the manufacturers is a significant impairment on the contractual terms of the dealership agreements because manufacturers consider many tangible and intangible factors to evaluate the fitness of dealers,not solely whether the dealers are a detriment to the representation of the manufacturers products.see appellees app.accord appellants app,in no case is the evaluation limited to a determination of whether transferring the management or ownership of a distributorship to a particular candidate would be detrimental to the representation or reputation of komatsu products.to evaluate prospective dealers,manufacturers typically consider factors such as experience in agricultural and other equipment sales financial status development of a business,personnel and marketing plan management talent willingness to be involved in the operations of the dealership dedication,character,trustworthiness,personality,energy,enthusiasm,intelligence,customer relations skills,and similar qualities competency of staff business acumen and commitment to the manufacturer products.see appellees app,accord appellants app,case evaluation of dealer prospects is based substantially on subjective and intangible determinations that would make any showing of detriment difficult and,moreover,it is unclear to us just how detrimental the dealer prospect would have to be under the act.manufacturers conduct this extensive review of potential dealers because if the dealership becomes insolvent,the manufacturer reputation in the community may suffer and its customers may be left without a local dealership for repairs and parts.appellees app.manufacturers entrust dealers with significant responsibility for marketing,selling and servicing the companies products.
therefore,assuming that section of the act was not reasonably foreseeable,infra part ii a b,manufacturers contract expectations about their control of the representatives of their products are substantially disrupted under section of the act.see mcdonald nelson,franchise agreements were substantially impaired by the iowa franchise act,in part because it shifted the burden to franchisors to show that prospective franchisees could not satisfy the reasonable current qualifications as set out in the franchise agreements,aff sub,holiday inns franchising,branstad,cir.section of the act is therefore a substantial burden on the contractual rights of manufacturers under the dealership agreements.see workers compensation refund,at.
ii.section of the act 
section of the act prohibits a manufacturer from terminating a dealership contract if the dealer does not purchase or accept any machinery,parts,or other product or service not ordered by the dealer,unless it is necessary for the operation of machinery commonly sold in the dealer area of responsibility.codified laws,laws ch.dealers agreed to stock more than what section requires in the dealership agreements.see supra.thus,manufacturers contract expectations under section are significantly impaired,in part because a dealer is often the sole representative and sales and service outlet for customers and potential customers in a given area.see appellees app.accord appellants app.the manufacturers are reasonably concerned that without the ability to require dealers to purchase certain machinery,the manufacturers products would not be represented in certain areas to their fullest potential.
it is also important to manufacturers contract expectations that dealers be required to stock a full range of parts and service equipment because prompt service is important to farmers.the state acknowledges that the current inventory of farm machinery on south dakota farms is aged and requires adequate facilities for repair and servicing equipment.appellees app.thus,it is important that parts and service equipment are available to promptly repair machinery in order to enhance the manufacturer reputation with customers and potential customers.see appellees app.therefore,assuming that section of the act was not reasonably foreseeable,infra part ii a b,section of the act substantially impairs the contractual rights of manufacturers under the dealership agreements.
iii.section of the act 
under the dealership agreements,unsatisfactory market penetration alone was grounds for termination of the dealership agreement.see supra.section of the act,however,prohibits the manufacturer from using the market penetration measure as the sole reason for dealer termination.codified laws,laws ch.the manufacturers point out that market penetration is an easily quantified proxy for dealer performance,and that dealer termination for poor market penetration is permissible under all the dealership agreements.appellants app.the state does not dispute this claim,except to argue that regulation in south dakota would not have allowed the manufacturers to enforce contract clauses which allowed termination for poor market penetration see appellees app.citing appellees app.section of the act limits the manufacturers ability to ensure that dealers are using their best efforts to sell and service the products.so long as section of the act was not reasonably foreseeable,infra part ii a b,it substantially impairs manufacturers rights under the dealership agreements.
iv.section of the act 
section of the act provides that a dealer participation in the ownership or management of a dealership contract for the sale of another of machinery can not be the sole grounds for the manufacturer to terminate the dealership contract,unless the dealer does not maintain a reasonable line of credit for each of machinery.codified laws,laws ch.clauses in contracts typically permit manufacturers to terminate dealers who begin dealing in another of machinery.see supra.manufacturers concerns with dealers selling other of machinery are not limited to whether the dealer has a reasonable line of credit for each of machinery.rather,they are concerned that dealers will not devote enough sales staff,service equipment,service personnel,showroom space,and advertising efforts to the individual manufacturer of machinery.see appellants app.since dealers are often the sole representative of the manufacturer in a region,manufacturers are reasonably concerned that their products will not be effectively represented to the consumers in that sales area,absent contractual limitations on the ability of dealers to represent other.see appellees app.admitting that a dealer is frequently the manufacturer sole representative in an area.by not allowing manufacturers to terminate dealers who undertake to represent another of machinery,section of the act substantially impairs the manufacturers rights under the dealership agreements,provided that section of the act was not reasonably foreseeable.see infra part ii a b.
section of the act 
section of the act prohibits a manufacturer from terminating a dealership agreement solely because the dealer refuses to participate in any national advertising campaign or purchase any promotional materials,that are at the expense of the dealer.codified laws,laws ch.three of the dealership agreements before this court include provisions outlining dealers responsibilities for sales promotion and advertising activities.see supra.manufacturers develop their advertising and promotion programs based on dealers participation in the programs,and manufacturers use dealer advertising and promotion involvement to gauge whether dealers are using their best efforts to promote the manufacturers products.see appellants app.at.the state does not dispute manufacturers reliance on dealer participation in advertising and promotion activities section is a substantial impairment on the dealership agreements because it realigns the contract rights between manufacturers and dealers,assuming that section of the act was not reasonably foreseeable,infra part ii a b.
b.the impairment was not foreseeable 
the second step in analyzing the nature of section of the act impairment on dealership agreements is to ascertain whether previous regulation affects the nature of the impairment,whether the impairment was foreseeable.although section of the act substantially impairs the contractual rights bargained for in the dealership agreements,supra part ii a a,if previous regulation of the relationship between manufacturers and dealers made the terms of section of the act foreseeable,then section of the act does not substantially impair the dealership agreements in violation of the contract clause.in re workers compensation refund,cir.parties expectations of future regulation are important in determining whether contractual rights are substantially impaired because parties bargained for terms in the contract based on those expectations if those expectations were fulfilled,the court will not now relieve parties of their obligations energy reserves group,at.at.
in the current case,agricultural machinery relationships were previously regulated.these regulations,in force since,made it a class misdemeanor for manufacturers to coerce or attempt to coerce a dealer to take certain actions,or for a manufacturer to cancel a dealership agreement unfairly,without due regard to the equities of the dealer and without just provocation.codified laws to,laws ch,however,the statutes,unlike section of the act,do not regulate terms of a contract.
the state argues that even if sections through did not put the manufacturers on notice that there would be future regulation of the type in section of the act,section did.that section,which dates to,prohibits contract provisions which waive compliance with chapter codified laws,laws ch.section establishes an equitable remedy for violations of chapter,in addition to the criminal sanctions,by providing that any contractual provision purporting to waive compliance with chapter is void.the state argument fails,however,because section does not realign the rights of manufacturers and dealers under dealership agreements,as does section of the act.allied structural steel spannaus,d.thus,previous regulations were not sufficiently pervasive to destroy the contract expectations of the manufacturers.
in addressing the question of the foreseeability of future regulation,the supreme court has focused on whether previous regulation was in the area of the future regulation.in allied structural steel,the court considered the constitutionality of a minnesota pension regulation as applied to contracts.at.at.the court found that,although the plaintiff company pension plan had been previously subject to regulation by the irs,it had not previously been regulated in the area covered by the minnesota regulation.id.for that reason,the court held the minnesota regulation unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff company,as it had no reason to anticipate that the terms of the pension plan would be altered by subsequent legislation.similarly,in the instant case,the regulations prevent manufacturers from taking actions outside the obligations and rights of the dealership agreement,by coercion,duress,or acting unfairly.in contrast,section of the act purports to place extensive limitations on arrangements,and thus exceeds what the manufacturers could have reasonably anticipated in light of the previous south dakota regulation.
in workers compensation refund,this court also found substantial impairment in the context of the workers compensation insurance industry.at.we agreed that h eavy regulation of an industry may reduce reasonable expectations.however,regulation does not automatically foreclose the possibility of contract impairment we find that minnesota regulation of excess reinsurance premiums has not been sufficiently pervasive so as to destroy all reasonable contractual expectations.id.at.as in that case,this court finds that the previous state regulation at issue here was not sufficiently pervasive so as to destroy all reasonable contractual expectations by the manufacturers.id.
therefore,because the dealership agreements are impaired,and because this substantial impairment was not foreseeable,this court finds that the first part of the contract clause test is answered in the affirmative section of the act substantially impairs dealership agreements.the second part of the contract clause test must now be addressed,to ascertain whether there is a significant and legitimate public purpose for section of the act.
b.there is no significant and legitimate public purpose for section of the act 
because a substantial impairment of contractual rights exists,south dakota must demonstrate a significant and legitimate public purpose underlying the act.workers compensation refund,at.the state must show that the regulation protects a broad societal interest rather than a narrow class.allied structural steel spannaus,d.the state bears the burden of proof in showing a significant and legitimate public purpose underlying the act.i f a state undertakes to alter substantially the terms of a contract,it must justify the alteration,and the burden that is on the state varies directly with the substantiality of the alteration.white motor malone,cir.
there is no statement of legislative intent or any other legislative history from which to directly ascertain the purpose of the act the state post hoc rationalization is that the act benefits a broad social interest serving the farmer and rural communities in south dakota.such an interest is unquestionably significant and legitimate,see farmers union oil allied products,and we would be compelled to uphold the act if we credited the state rationale for the act.workers compensation refund,at.the state evidence contradicts this asserted broad social interest,however,in several aspects.first,the state has produced no evidence of the harm to be avoided by passage of the act.see mcdonald.at allegations that unfair practices can harm consumers,without more,do not sufficiently allege harm for contract clause analysis purposes equipment mfrs.inst.janklow,finding no evidence of the asserted purpose to protect farmers and rural communities regarding the act restrictions on manufacturers establishing new dealerships.the alleged harm is that termination of dealers by manufacturers will result in loss of jobs,hardship on farmers required to travel farther for equipment and repairs,and the consequent acceleration of the decline of rural communities and farms.see appellees app.but the state has produced no evidence that manufacturers currently,or will in the future,prohibit sales of dealerships,require dealers to maintain inventories of machinery and parts inappropriate for the dealers area,prohibit the sale of additional by dealers,terminate dealers for inadequate market penetration,or terminate dealers for refusing to participate in advertising activities while the state cites to a decrease in the number of farmers and farms,it does not cite to evidence that there has been or will be an actual decrease in the number of farm equipment dealers,let alone tie such a decrease in farms and farmers to the restrictions contained in extant dealership agreements.but see appellees app.growth in nonfarm economy contributes to decrease in the number of farmers advances in technology contributed to a decrease in the number of south dakota farms.the decline in the number of farmers has little to do with the number of equipment dealers.
second,both the state and the concede that the act purpose is to level the playing field between manufacturers and dealers.see appellees app.i t assists in leveling the playing field between manufacturers and dealers,it imparts a degree of security and predictability to relations between dealers and manufacturers.however,leveling the playing field between contracting parties is expressly prohibited as a significant and legitimate public interest see allied structural steel,at.see also mcdonald nelson,aff sub nom.holiday inns franchising,branstad,cir.
third,the sparse legislative history reinforces that the suspect purpose of the act is to directly change the obligations of the manufacturers and dealers,as illustrated by its title,an act to provide certain restrictions for dealership contracts for machinery.appellees app.whirlpool ritter,cir because the law at issue here directly alters the obligations and expectations of the contracting parties,it is not merely general,social legislation.fourth,any claim that its purpose is to benefit farmers and rural communities is belied by the fact that only implement dealers and manufacturers attended committee hearings on the act,and the record contains no evidence of farmers participation.appellees app.
it is clear that the only real beneficiaries under the act are the narrow class of dealers of agricultural machinery.see appellees app.dealers are the principal class of persons protected by the act.as the case law makes clear,such special interest legislation runs afoul of the contract clause when it impairs contracts.in mcdonald nelson,the court determined that there was no significant and legitimate public purpose for the iowa franchise act.the court based its conclusion on an affidavit of the president of the iowa senate,which articulated the legislature study of franchising and development of the iowa franchise act.the senate,according to the affidavit,heard testimony that franchising was a growing industry in iowa,and that the unfair practices of some franchisors can harm iowa franchises,consumers,and other businesses.mcdonald.at.a review of the record developed for purposes of summary judgment showed that the primary purposes of the iowa franchise act were to equalize bargaining power and protect franchisees from abuses by franchisors.the district court then contrasted valid laws under the contract clause,which advanced a broad social interest,with invalid laws that directly adjusted the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties.id.at internal quotation marks omitted,quoting exxon eagerton,d.in the instant case,as in mcdonald,the suspect purpose of the legislation at issue is to directly adjust the rights and responsibilities of dealers and manufacturers under the dealership agreements,not to advance a broad social interest.
without evidence of a significant and legitimate public purpose underlying section of the act,section is void as applied to dealership agreements in existence before july.therefore,the court does not need to address the last step of contract clause analysis,whether the adjustment of contract rights is appropriate to the public purpose.energy reserves group,kansas power light,d.because we grant summary judgment to the manufacturers on the contract clause claim,we need not address their substantive due process claims in regards to dealership contracts.with respect to the manufacturers claims that the act application to future dealership contracts violates their substantive due process rights,the court concludes that the manufacturers have not met their burden of proof to establish a violation of the united states or south dakota constitutions due process clauses,and thus affirms the disposition of these claims by the district court.see wellwood johnson,cir crowley state,under south dakota constitution due process clause analysis,a ll presumptions are in favor of the constitutionality of a statute and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a reasonable doubt.state nuss.
iii.conclusion 
for all the foregoing reasons,this court finds and concludes that section of the act entitled an act to provide certain restrictions for dealership contracts for machinery,is not based on a significant and legitimate public purpose,sufficient to justify the substantial impairment that its provisions have on dealership agreements in effect prior to the act effective date.the grant of partial summary judgment of the district court on the contract clause claim is reversed,and the manufacturers motion for summary judgment is granted.the grant of partial summary judgment of the district court on the substantive due process claims is affirmed.
although south dakota new law impairs contracts,as the majority holds,i believe the impairment was foreseeable to equipment manufacturers.for that reason,i respectfully dissent.
an impairment is not substantial in a field where prior regulation existed and new legislation was foreseeable as the type of law that would alter contract obligations.energy reserves group.power light,d.the idea is that if the party to the contract who is complaining could have seen it coming,it can not claim that its expectations were disappointed.holiday inns franchising,branstad,cir.
since,south dakota has prohibited manufacturers from terminating dealerships unfairly,without due regard to the equities of the dealer and without just provocation.codified laws.all provisions in dealership contracts which purport to waive compliance with are void.codified laws.thus,manufacturers have long been on notice that their dealership contract terms,at least those terms relating to termination,were subject to state regulation.see groseth int l,tenneco,interpreting and holding that the just provocation standard requires some sort of misconduct or shortcoming on the part of the dealer,and rejecting the manufacturer argument it could meet the standard where a termination was in good faith.the restrictions on dealership termination now found at merely those existing regulations,providing specific circumstances under which a termination will be considered unfair and without just cause.i am therefore unable to conclude that the provisions of pertaining to termination violate the contract clause.
in reaching this conclusion,i find persuasive the reasoning of the seventh circuit in chrysler kolosso auto sales,cir.wisconsin had a longstanding statute prohibiting auto manufacturers from terminating auto dealerships unfairly,without due regard to the equities of said dealer and without just provocation.stat.a enacted in,renumbered at i by act,to,eff.april.in,wisconsin amended the law to allow a dealer to challenge a manufacturer refusal to allow the dealer to relocate,and create a specific procedure for resolving relocation disputes.see.stat.renumbered at a by act,to,eff.april.in,when kolosso auto sales informed chrysler it wanted to move its dealership,chrysler sued to enforce a provision in the dealership contract that forbid kolosso from relocating without chrysler permission,and to declare the new law invalid under the contract clause.kolosso,at.
the seventh circuit held the amendment did not violate the contract clause.the court noted wisconsin had interpreted the law just provocation clause to forbid termination without good cause.id.at.the court reasoned the law would have prevented ch
