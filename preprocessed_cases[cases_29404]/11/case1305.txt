roque de la fuente ii petitions for review of an order of the board of the federal deposit insurance corporation board removing him as a director of first international bank fib and forbidding him from participating in,voting shares of,or serving on the board of any federally regulated bank for life.the board found that de la fuente had used his position at fib to secure several loans in excess of applicable limits for entities in which he and his close associates were interested,as well as to engage in other self interested lending practices.we have jurisdiction to review the board decision under the judicial review provisions of the administrative procedures act.see h see also a courts may set aside agency orders if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we grant the petition in part,deny it in part,and remand the matter to the board.
i.the entities,the transactions,and the agency proceedings 
de la fuente became a board member of fib,formerly known as people bank,on march,and served in that position until he was removed.this appeal centers around twelve fib loans and two transactions,all of which occurred between and,involving entities in which de la fuente,his family,or his close associates were interested.
the loans that formed the basis for the removal action are in chronological order 
a may,loan in the amount of million to the roque de la fuente alexander trust fuente alexander trust,a revocable trust set up by de la fuente father in which de la fuente had a contingent interest.
an october,loan in the amount of million to rancho de la fuente international industrial park fuente iip,an entity owned by de la fuente mother through offshore corporations.de la fuente mother is a housewife who lives in mexico city and does not participate in the operations of.jose luis andreu,one of de la fuente close is also vice president of american international enterprises aie,a company solely owned by de la the agent for.
a december,loan in the amount of to rancho vista del mar,rvdm,another entity owned by de la fuente mother through offshore corporations.as he is for,andreu is the company agent.rvdm has no employees.

a november,loan in the amount of to fptc.
a december,loan in the amount of to produce,an entity of which andreu is a director,and which is engaged in a joint venture with nei.
a december,loan in the amount of to fptc.
the board removal order was based on two additional transactions involving collateral for fib loans 
a fib decision to accept the substitution of inferior substitute collateral to secure a loan the bank had made to rvdm the collateral substitution transaction and 
a fib decision to allow a nei employee to assume liability for a loan the bank had made to the parking company of america pca transaction.
in,the federal deposit insurance corporation notified de la fuente that it was proceeding against him under e for his role in fib lending practices.it charged him with lending sums to the various entities identified above over the period from through,which exceeded the percentage of a bank funds that may be loaned to affiliates or insiders of a bank directors under regulation o and section of the federal reserve act.it also charged de la fuente with facilitating the collateral substitution transaction and the pca transaction,alleging that his role in these transactions violated e.
the case was tried before an administrative law judge alj,who issued a recommended decision finding that all of the above loans and transactions violated e and concluding that de la fuente should be ordered removed from the board of fib and prohibited from participating in the banking industry for life.on review,the board adopted and incorporated these findings,and affirmed the alj recommended decision.
ii.control under regulation o 
the board correctly found that de la fuente controlled all of the loan recipients,and that the loans therefore violated the provisions of regulation o.regulation o restricts the ability of member banks in the federal reserve system as well as nonmember,banks such as fib,see j to extend credit to their insider s.a.the regulation defines insider,in turn,as an executive officer,director,or principal shareholder,and includes any related interest of such a person,id.h a r elated interest is defined to include a company that is controlled by that person,id.n.under the regulation,a person controls a company,when inter alia he or she owns or more of the shares of a company,id.c i,or h as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the company,id.c iii.the regulation also creates certain rebuttable presumptions of control for persons who own more than of the stock in a company.id.c.
the board found that de la fuente controlled fptc by owning,controlling,or having the power to vote or more of its shares,under c i.with respect to the other loans except the loan to produce,the alj found that the borrowing entities were actual ly control led by de la fuente,which the board determined constituted a finding of exercising a controlling influence under c iii.
de la fuente argues that because the regulation contains rebuttable presumptions of control in c for persons who own more than of a company shares,it creates a safe harbor insulating people who do not fall within the rebuttable presumption,de la fuente from a finding of control under c iii.we disagree.subsection c establishes the test for control the following subsection,c,sets forth a list of circumstances from which control is to be presumed control may be established if a proper finding under the first subsection is made,or if one of the requirements of the second subsection is met and the presumption of control is not rebutted.de la fuente would have us disregard the test in the first subsection because he was not presumed to have control under the second subsection.this is illogical.to read the regulation in this manner would render portions of the regulation surplusage,and would defeat the plain purpose of the regulatory scheme.
de la fuente cites two unpublished federal reserve board interpretive letters in support of his position that the presumptions in c create a safe harbor.see wl,at the rebuttable presumptions in c are intended to be dispositive of the issue of control of a company by an individual who is an executive officer or director of that company.wl,at stating that when the share ownership condition is met,these presumptions in c are intended to be dispositive of the issue of control of a company by an individual who is an executive officer or director of that company.
in response,the fdic cites an interpretive letter from the office of the comptroller of the currency occ,which explains that the rebuttable presumptions of c are only implicated when an agency relies for its determination of control on the person stock ownership,but that a finding of control under c iii is not dependent upon share ownership.wl if share ownership were a prerequisite for a finding of control in all circumstances,the regulation could be easily evaded,especially by limiting share ownership to passive investors within the family.such a formalistic approach ignores the fact that regulation o clearly contemplates situations in which control may be established by indirect means.
we are not sure whether any deference is due to the frb determination that c creates a safe harbor,especially given the contrary interpretation of the regulation by the occ.even if we were to give some deference to the frb letters,however,we would have to reject its position as clearly erroneous and inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation.see ins,cir we therefore agree with the board that its interpretation of c is the reasonable one,and conclude that it correctly found that all twelve loans violated regulation 
iii.notice and hearing requirements of section 
although we agree with the board regulation o analysis,we disagree with its determination that all of the loans except the fuente alexander trust loan and the de la fuente personal loan were extended to entities that de la fuente controlled in violation of section of the federal reserve act.de la fuente correctly argues that the board findings of control under section were improper because they were made without affording de la fuente the statutorily required notice and hearing in advance of making such a determination.
section restricts the ability of member banks in the federal reserve system as well as nonmember,banks such as fib,see id.j to engage in certain as the extension of their affiliates.id.a the term affiliate is defined,inter alia,as any company that is controlled by the company that controls the member bank.id.b a emphasis added.the statute defines control to mean,inter alia,ownership of or more of a company shares,id.b a i,or circumstances where the board determines,after notice and opportunity for hearing,that the person exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the company,id.b a iii emphasis added.
the board determined that the alj finding of actual control under regulation o satisfie d the requirements for a finding of control under b a iii.this can not be the case the board did not provide de la fuente with the required notice and opportunity for hearing in advance of making such a determination.
we reject the agency argument on appeal that the board could have made a finding of control under b a i with respect to certain of the entities because de la fuente owned in excess of of the shares of the entities.we can uphold an agency decision only on the basis of the reasoning in that decision.anaheim mem l hosp.shalala,cir.because the board determined that the loans violated b a iii,not b a i,we decline to consider whether this provision could support its decision.
we also reject the agency argument that any error was harmless because all of the loans found to violate section were also found to violate regulation o.we recognize that the board concluded that findings of violations of either regulation o or section,standing alone,would support its decision.however,as we discuss below,the penalty the board assessed against de la fuente was extraordinary,and the board may decline to reimpose it in the absence of section violations.
iv.statute of limitations 
we also agree with de la fuente that the board erred in failing to apply the statute of limitations in to limit the conduct for which he could be held liable.the fdic commenced this action on june.therefore,the agency should not have prosecuted him for transactions that occurred before june,the may,fuente alexander trust loan,the october,loan,and the december,and january,rvdm loans.
section provides except as otherwise provided by act of congress,an action,suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine,penalty,or forfeiture,pecuniary or otherwise,shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the date when the claim first accrued.although we have previously stated that t here is no federal statute of limitations specifically applicable to action under,simpson office of thrift supervision,cir,we agree with the circuit that this statute of limitations is applicable to fdic enforcement actions,see proffitt fdic.the circuit reasons persuasively that an fdic proceeding under e,such as here,imposes a penalty within the meaning of.see id.the simpson statement is dictum because that case involved a action predicated on transactions,at thus,whether the statute of limitations applied was not properly before us in that case.in fact,the fdic now concedes that the statute of limitations applies.
de la fuente raised the limitations issue before the agency solely as to the fuente alexander trust loan thus the board erred in relying on this loan in its order.de la fuente argues that we should exercise our discretion to apply the limitations period to the other loans,citing our rule that we may do so when the issue presented was purely one of law and the opposing party would suffer no prejudice as a result of the failure to raise the issue in the trial court.taniguchi schultz,cir citing united states,cir.we need not do so at this juncture rather,on remand the board may exercise its discretion in the first instance and determine whether to address this issue.if it chooses to do so,it may also consider the agency argument that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled as to these other loans due to de la fuente fraud or concealment.
equitable estoppel 
the board correctly found that the agency should not be equitably estopped from prosecuting de la fuente for his role in transactions that had been previously investigated by agency inspectors.from to,agency inspectors reviewed the alexander trust loan,the rvdm and loans,and the nei loan,but never reported any violations.in addition to the traditional elements of equitable estoppel,w hen a party seeks to invoke equitable estoppel against the government,we require a showing that the agency engaged in affirmative conduct going beyond mere negligence.united states hemmen,cir quoting watkins united states army,cir en banc.because de la fuente has not alleged any such affirmative conduct going beyond mere negligence,the agency is not equitably estopped from prosecuting him for these transactions.
vi.substantial evidence 
we reject de la fuente contention that three of the board factual findings were not supported by substantial evidence its determinations that de la fuente owned,controlled,or had the power to vote more than of the shares of fptc de la fuente violated e in facilitating the collateral substitution transaction by committing an improper act that either benefitted de la fuente or hurt fib and was accompanied by a culpable state of mind and de la fuente violated e in facilitating the pca transaction by committing an improper act that either benefitted de la fuente or hurt fib and was accompanied by a culpable state of mind.
control of fptc 
reviewing the record as a whole,reddick chater,cir,we conclude that the finding of control underlying the board conclusion that fib four loans to fptc totaling over million in one year violated regulation o and section is supported by substantial evidence.see mayes massanari,cir hoffman fdic,cir.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.mayes,at internal quotation marks omitted.because de la fuente owned,controlled,or had the power to vote or more of fptc shares,fptc was an affiliate or related interest of de la fuente under regulation o,c i,and section,b a i.
de la fuente owned of fptc,which he transferred to trusts for his children in.among fptc other share holders are andreu and zapata,both close associates and frequent business partners of de la fuente.andreu is also the president of fptc,and has been a director and board chairman.the company has no employees.andreu purchased his share in fptc with funds drawn on the account of witec patents a company of which de la fuente was a part owner,and of which andreu eventually became president supported by the votes of de la fuente and zapata.
furthermore,one business day after fib directors were faced with per day fines as a result of noncompliance with an fdic order,fptc purchased two loans from fib,saving it from the payment of the penalties.in addition,fptc diverted of a loan it received to de la fuente on undisclosed terms,who used the funds to pay down an unrelated loan,not connected with fptc.finally,both the alj and the board found that andreu represented to a third party that fptc was one of the de la fuente companies.
de la fuente attempts to provide innocent explanations for this evidence,arguing that it could be consistent with a scenario in which he did not control fptc.however,when the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,we will not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.edlund massanari,cir.it is a reasonable inference from the evidence as a whole and the very structure of fptc that de la fuente controlled fptc.as the trier of fact,the alj was in a superior position to evaluate any conflicting testimony and assess de la fuente arguments that fptc actions were not controlled by his interests.
collateral substitution transaction 
as collateral for a million loan to rvdm,fib held a lien over acres of real property owned by.de la fuente orchestrated a complex transaction whereby this encumbered property was to be released so that it could be sold to a third party mcmillin as environmental mitigation property the real property to be sold to mcmillin eventually came to include some rvdm property and some property personally owned by de la fuente.the property to be substituted as collateral was other rvdm land on which fib already had a secondary lien.
thus,de la fuente requested that fib release its lien on the land.around the same time,nei,one of de la fuente other companies,committed the proceeds of the mcmillin sale to pay down a different loan.de la fuente then met with fish and wildlife service officials on behalf of and rvdm to clear any environmental regulatory hurdles to the transaction.
the fib board of directors met on june,to consider the collateral substitution on the rvdm loan.de la fuente initially was not present during the fib board deliberations.however,when it became clear that the other fib board members did not understand the transaction,de la fuente was called in to explain it.de la fuente answered the board members questions,but did not disclose certain crucial facts which later came to light.at the time,the fib board members were under the mistaken impression that was in bankruptcy,so that it might be advantageous for fib to divest itself of property in fact,however,de la fuente knew that bankruptcy proceedings had terminated a few months earlier.de la fuente also knew and did not disclose that rvdm was delinquent on the loan in question and subject to foreclosure proceedings by another bank.finally,although the fib board was under the impression that the property would be difficult to sell because of environmental issues,de la fuente knew that the property was in fact valuable because it could be used as environmental mitigation property.
after the transaction was approved,rvdm defaulted on its loan,and fib foreclosed on the substituted collateral and lost over.de la fuente sold the released property to mcmillin for million,and received an additional for his own land.
the board found that de la fuente actions in facilitating this transaction violated e.this statute has three elements the banker committed an improper act the act had an impermissible effect,either an adverse effect on the bank or a benefit to the actor and the act was accompanied by a culpable state of mind.see seidman office of thrift supervision in re seidman,cir we examine the board order to ensure that substantial evidence supports its findings as to each of these elements.see id.at.
improper act 
the board correctly found that de la fuente acted improperly by engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice by breaching his fiduciary duty to fib.we have held that an unsafe or unsound practice is one which is contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent operation,the possible consequences of which,if continued,would be abnormal risk or loss or damage to an institution,its shareholders,or the agencies administering the insurance funds and that it is a practice which has a reasonably direct effect on an association financial soundness.simpson office of thrift supervision,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the board properly relied on the fact that at the time fib was deciding whether to approve this transaction,de la fuente failed to disclose critical facts that should have counseled against its approval.
de la fuente objects that because he answered all of the fib board members questions regarding the transaction,he could not have breached a fiduciary duty by simply failing to volunteer additional relevant information.de la fuente is wrong.it is well established that a person can breach a fiduciary duty by failing to disclose material information,even if not asked,see,harmon kobrin in re harmon,cir in bankruptcy context,and that de la fuente had a fiduciary duty to disclose everything he knew relating to the transaction.a fiduciary duty of candor is encompassed within the duty of loyalty.the duty of candor requires corporate fiduciaries to disclose all material information relevant to corporate decisions from which they may derive a personal benefit.seidman,at emphasis added and internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
that de la fuente may only have possessed information about the existing collateral does not alter our decision.the information he possessed was relevant because the fib board agreed to permit the transaction only as long as the replacement collateral was equal or superior in value and market ability to the existing collateral.this required the fib board to know the value of the existing collateral,an inquiry de la fuente hindered by failing to disclose the information he had.
impermissible effect 
the board also correctly concluded that de la fuente actions had an impermissible effect because he received financial benefit from the transaction because the interests of fib depositors were prejudiced thereby.de la fuente argues that neither his financial gain his receipt of loan proceeds to pay off an nei loan and of the proceeds of selling his personal property to mcmillin nor the bank loss the costs associated with the foreclosure and the losses from the substitution of the inferior collateral were proximately caused by his failure to disclose the information he possessed.see e b b y reason of the violation such insured depository institution has suffered or will probably suffer financial loss or other damage emphasis added.
the circuit has interpreted e to require that the risk of loss to the bank be reasonably foreseeable to the offender any risk must of course be reasonably foreseeable.that is not to say that the exact series of events that cause injury or loss to the institution must be perceived or even perceivable,but surely no director can be faulted for approving a management proposal that does not pose an increased risk of some kind to the financial institution.kaplan united states office of thrift supervision.it is undoubtedly reasonably foreseeable to any banker that substituting inferior collateral for superior collateral on a bank loan would pose an increased risk of some kind to the financial institution.we agree with the circuit that it is immaterial whether or not de la fuente should have been aware of the precise sequence of events that would transpire leading to this impermissible effect.
culpable state of mind 
we agree that de la fuente actions evidenced personal dishonesty willful or continuing disregard for the safety and soundness of fib.although some scienter is required to establish culpability under this standard,there are many types of misconduct that,by their very nature,evidence willful disregard for a bank safety or soundness.oberstar fdic,cir.willful disregard means deliberate conduct which exposed the bank to abnormal risk of loss or harm contrary to prudent banking practices.grubb fdic,cir internal quotation marks omitted.continuing disregard means conduct which has been voluntarily eng
