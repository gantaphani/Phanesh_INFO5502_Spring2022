plaintiffs naranjibhai patel and ramilaben patel are owners and operators of motels in los angeles.they challenge the constitutionality of los angeles municipal code lamc,which requires operators of hotels in the city to maintain certain guest registry information and to make that information available to police officers on request.appellants contend that lamc is facially unconstitutional under the fourth amendment because it authorizes unreasonable invasions of their private business records without a warrant or pursuant to any recognized warrant exception.following a bench trial on stipulated evidence,the district court held that the ordinance was reasonable and granted judgment in favor of the city,concluding that the hotel operators did not establish that they had a privacy interest in the guest registry information.
a facial challenge is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exist under which the act would be valid.united states salerno,see washington state grange washington state republican party,that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.that the ordinance might operate unconstitutionally under some circumstances is not enough to render it invalid against a facial challenge.the patels have not satisfied that high standard.as a result,this facial challenge to the ordinance fails.we affirm.
background 
the facts of this case are simple and undisputed.the only exhibit introduced at the bench trial was the text of lamc.the parties stipulated that the patels have been and continue to be subjected to searches and seizures of their motel registration records by the police,pursuant to the ordinance,without consent or a warrant.the parties also stipulated that the only issue at trial was the facial constitutionality of lamc.
the ordinance defines hotel broadly to cover hotels,motels,inns,rooming houses,and other establishments offering space for overnight accommodations for rent for a period of less than days.it requires that every operator of a hotel record certain information concerning its guests,including name and address total number of guests make,type and license number of the guest vehicle if parked on hotel premises date and time of arrival scheduled date of departure room number rate charged and collected method of payment and the name of the hotel employee who checked the guest in.the record may be kept in electronic,ink,or typewritten form.lamc.the ordinance requires that the record be kept on the hotel premises in the guest reception area or in an adjacent office for at least days after the last entry.it provides specific requirements for the form of the guest register and requires that it must be printable if maintained electronically.lamc.
with regard to the authority of the police to require that the registration records be made available,the ordinance provides that 
the record shall be made available to any officers of the los angeles police department for inspection.whenever possible,the inspection shall be conducted at a time and in a manner that minimizes any interference with the operation of the business.
based on the stipulated record,the district court entered judgment in favor of the city.the patels timely appealed.

we review interpretations of and constitutional challenges to regulations de novo.mapes united states,cir.a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo as well.hapner tidwell,cir.
the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.not all intrusions violate the fourth amendment only unreasonable ones do.as the supreme court has observed,reasonableness is still the ultimate standard under the fourth amendment.soldal cook county,quoting camara municipal court of san francisco.
the fourth amendment applies when government officers violate a person reasonable expectation of privacy.united states jones.in addition,the fourth amendment embodies a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas persons,houses,papers,and effects the fourth amendment enumerates.id the test has been added to,not substituted for,the trespassory test.id.at.we will discuss both in turn.
reasonable expectation of privacy 
most applications of the fourth amendment focus on an individual reasonable expectation of privacy.see minnesota carter,in order to claim the protection of the fourth amendment,a person must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched,and that his expectation is reasonable.the expectation of privacy must be one which society accepts as objectively reasonable.united states thomas,cir.
the information covered by the los angeles ordinance principally concerns hotel guests.the information does not,on its face,appear confidential or private from the perspective of the hotel operator.
we have already held that hotel guests do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in guest registry information once they have provided it to the hotel operator.united states cormier,cir.we noted that the information at issue in that case,the guest name and room number,was not highly personal information.id.we also noted that once the guest has voluntarily revealed factual information to the hotel in the process of checking in,he can no longer claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in that information,citing united states.miller,holding that a bank customer did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in records maintained by the bank.cormier,at.
the patels presented no evidence to support their contention that hotel owners and operators,including themselves,have their own expectation of privacy in the information contained in guest registers.it may be true,as they allege,that the information could be used by the hotel operators for other purposes,but that does not mean hotel owners have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the registers.just because information can be used by a business does not mean that the business owner desires to keep the information private,or that society would accept such a desire as objectively reasonable.here,there is no evidence that all hotel owners affected by the regulation even consider the information to be private,let alone that any such expectation is reasonable.
moreover,the patels have presented no evidence that hotel owners customarily maintain guest registers in a manner that would support a claim of privacy.as miller and cormier recognized,once information is revealed to others it is unlikely that a reasonable expectation of privacy can be established.an guest register may take the form of a book located on the counter in the guest reception area,a form that would appear to satisfy the ordinance.but it is unlikely society would recognize a reasonable expectation of privacy in information kept in a manner so easily accessible by anyone entering the hotel.
to be clear,we do not hold that a hotel owner or operator can never have a reasonable expectation of privacy in guest register information.to this end,we reject the argument of the city that hotel owners can never have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the guest registries simply because the regulation informs them that the police can inspect the registries on request.an individual otherwise reasonable expectation of privacy can not be so easily stripped away merely by the adoption of a regulation authorizing searches of an item or location.to hold otherwise would allow the government to conduct warrantless searches just by announcing that it can.see united states consol.coal,cir,vacated and remanded on other grounds,u,judgment reinstated,cir,cert.denied even where a statute requires records to be maintained and authorizes inspection of them in the normal course,no precedent sanctions direct access to the records without demand in the absence of a search warrant.see also mclaughlin kings island,cir t he concept of required records is not synonymous with the absence of a privacy interest.brock,cir concluding business had a privacy interest in records osha req
