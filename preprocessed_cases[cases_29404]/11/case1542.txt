this case deals with dc dc power converter systems used to power circuitry in large computer systems and telecommunication and data communication equipment.such systems convert direct current dc from one voltage level to another.the patents at issue involve converters with separate isolation and regulation stages.
a converter provides isolation if its input and output are not directly connected by wires.the parties dispute whether,in the context of the patents,the term isolation requires the absence of a wired connection between any two points,or only the absence of a wired connection between an input and an output of a particular stage,component,or circuit.see part iv below.
in an isolated circuit,a transformer conveys current to the load.the mere presence of a transformer does not isolate the circuit,however,because a wired connection between the input and output might also defeat the isolation.isolation serves both as a safety feature and also as a stability guarantor by preventing unwanted ground current from flowing through the circuit.isolated converters are typically larger,more complicated,and less efficient than converters.
a converter provides regulation by restricting its output to a desired voltage even when the input voltage varies.a fully regulated converter monitors the output voltage and modifies the operation of the circuit to maintain a desired output voltage.a converter monitors the input voltage to maintain a desired output voltage.
synqor asserted patents relate to a distributed power architecture known as an intermediate bus architecture iba.in an iba,external power,volts alternating current ac is first converted to relatively dc power,volts by a front end converter.next,an intermediate bus converter steps down the volt dc power to a lower voltage,volts.the intermediate bus converter provides isolation either with no regulation or with semiregulation.the final stage uses multiple regulators to convert volt dc to proper levels for power logic circuitry,volts.
iba improved prior art power converter systems that used integrated converters,each performing both isolation and regulation,to step the volt input down to the voltage levels required to power logic circuitry.large computer and communication systems use multiple voltage levels for different logic circuitry housed on a single load board,and the prior art systems required a separate converter for each voltage level.this array took up valuable space on the load board,which could otherwise accommodate more memory and other logic circuitry.iba saves space by using a single isolation stage with multiple regulators.the regulators can be smaller,less expensive,and more efficient than integrated converters.
the patent,patent,and the patent cover power converter systems comprising a isolation stage and a plurality of regulation stages,each receiving the output of the isolation stage.see,patent ll.the patent claims a isolating dcdc power converter,which is the intermediate bus converter component of the power systems claimed in the other patents.patent.the patent claims a dc dc converter system comprising circuitry and a plurality of switching regulators receiving the output of the circuitry.patent ll.
defendants manufactured and sold intermediate bus converters overseas.synqor asserted claims for induced and contributory infringement under b and c,alleging defendants sold the power supply components with knowledge that they would be used in,or were especially made to be used in,infringing systems imported into the united states.synqor also asserted direct infringement under a with respect to certain sales.

a plurality of regulation stages 
defendants assert that the doctoral thesis of loveday mweene mweene thesis anticipates claims and of the patent,claim of the patent,claim of the patent,and claim of the patent.similarly,defendants argue that the mweene thesis combined with a paper on distributed power systems written by bob mammano would have made obvious claims and of the patent,claim of the patent,and claim of the patent.
each of the forgoing claims,except claim of the patent,requires a plurality of regulation stages that receive the output of a isolation stage.this court concludes that the record contains sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that claims,and of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claims and of the patent would not have been anticipated at the time of invention in view of the mweene thesis,which lacks a plurality of regulation stages.
the mweene thesis focuses primarily on the design of a ac dc converter for converting ac current from the utility to a dc output bus.in its discussion of the stability of the overall distributed power supply system,the thesis also addresses downstream elements,such as the converters.the mweene thesis discloses a distributed power architecture,including the converters,in figure 
the converter is a isolation stage.defendants assert that the point of load converters are a plurality of regulation stages.as support,defendants point to mweene disclosure of a buck converter in figure.synqor admits that the buck converter of figure is a regulator.its experts explained at trial,however,that the mweene thesis discloses the buck converter only as a simplified model for purposes of a mathematical stability analysis,not as something you would really use as a converter in a working system.at.
synqor technical expert,james dickens,testified that a person of skill in the art would have understood the point of load convertors in mweene system to be isolated.according to dickens,the artisan would have considered isolation necessary to account for safety issues and to help prevent a catastrophic board failure,which could be caused by a fault in the front end converter propagating through to the logic circuitry.id.inventor martin schlecht similarly testified that if the point of load regulators shown in figure of the mweene thesis were not isolated,a voltage drop could result that would cause the logic circuitry to malfunction.several of defendants witnesses and documents confirmed that an isolation stage is required between a volt input and the logic circuitry.further,mweene acknowledged his thesis did not in detail describe the design of converters,and therefore did not disclose use of a switching regulator as a regulator.at.
anticipation requires the presence in a single prior art disclosure of all elements of a claimed invention arranged as in the claim.connell sears,roebuck,see also therasense,becton,dickinson.the mweene thesis discloses a distributed power architecture with a isolation stage supplying power to a plurality of regulators,and separately discloses a regulator in a simplified mathematical analysis.thus,the record contains sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that the buck converter discussed by the mweene thesis was not disclosed as a point of load converter to be used in an actual system.in other words,even if the mweene thesis discloses each discrete element of each claim defendants assert is anticipated,the thesis does not disclose those elements arranged as required by the claim.
for similar reasons,this court concludes defendants did not prove any of the asserted claims of the patent,the patent,or the patent would have been obvious at the time of invention in view of the mweene thesis in combination with other references.the jury found that the mweene thesis does not teach a plurality of regulators that receive the output of a isolation stage.defendants did not assert that any other prior art reference provides such a teaching,nor that mweene alone would have rendered such a system architecture obvious.
defendants argue only that mammano supplies a motivation to use the specific voltage ranges recited in dependent claims.this court need not consider defendants arguments that certain dependent claim limitations would have been obvious where the base claim has not been proven invalid.see callaway golf acushnet,holding verdict irreconcilably inconsistent where jury found dependent claim obvious and found independent claim nonobvious.
because neither the mweene thesis alone nor any combination of the asserted prior art teaches or suggests a distributed power architecture having a plurality of regulation stages,this court affirms the denial of defendants motion for jmol that claims,and of the patent,claims and of the patent,and claims and of the patent would have been invalid as anticipated or obvious.
uncontrolled rectifiers are both conducting 
claim of the patent requires plural controlled rectifiers,each in parallel with an uncontrolled rectifier.patent.when each controlled rectifier is turned off,current flows through its paired uncontrolled rectifier.the claim requires a first and a second controlled rectifier which switch on alternately.id.ll.claim further requires a short time when the first controlled rectifier and the second controlled rectifier are both off and their corresponding uncontrolled rectifiers are both conducting.id.ll.emphasis added.
the mweene thesis describes a circuit with plural controlled rectifiers,each in parallel with an uncontrolled rectifier,and states that the rectifiers can be turned on late,the current being initially carried by their antiparallel diodes.at.defendants assert this shows that,when the controlled rectifiers are off,their parallel uncontrolled rectifiers are conducting as required by claim of the patent.synqor expert,dickens,testified that it is impossible for the uncontrolled rectifiers in the mweene circuit corresponding to those required by claim to be conducting at the same time,because current can not flow through the necessary paths simultaneously.at.dickens testimony therefore supplies substantial evidence to support the jury verdict.in sum,the record contains sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that mweene does not anticipate claim of the patent.this court therefore affirms the denial of defendants motion for jmol.
claim of the patent 
claim of the patent covers a dc dc converter system comprising circuitry with an output of about volts,which is connected to a plurality of switching regulators whose outputs are of voltage levels to drive logic circuitry.patent.defendants argue that claim of the would have been anticipated or obvious at the time of invention in view of a article by douglas arduini arduini.alternatively,defendants assert the patent is not entitled to a priority date earlier than its filing date,and is therefore anticipated by a article by seiya abe.
defendants expert,mercer,opined at trial that arduini anticipated the patent,but did not offer an opinion as to obviousness.arduini discloses a universal dc dc converter with a series of interchangeable components that can be put together to build a desired dcdc converter.at.arduini figure provides a specific exemplary system that teaches a plurality of nonisolating linear regulators,rather than the switching regulators required by claim of the patent.
defendants argue arduini own teachings would have rendered obvious the differences between the claimed system and that shown in figure.specifically,defendants argue it would have been obvious to substitute switching regulators for arduini linear regulators.arduini figure teaches that various different post regulators can be used to build a dc dc converter.the text mentions use of a simple buck regulator,a type of switching regulator.further,schlecht admitted it was known in the art that switching regulators provided the most efficient choice of load regulators.
nonetheless,synqor expert dickens explained that arduini does not teach substitution of switching regulators for linear regulators in the context of a circuit like that shown in figure,and never teaches the use of multiple switching regulators.rather,dickens and defendants expert mercer both testified that figure of arduini discloses a vast number of possible combinations with a wide variety of possible options for each component listed.specifically,mercer testified that in the eyes of a person skilled in the art,the box labeled ldo post regulator in figure explodes dramatically to whatever you want to put for the design.at.defendants presented no evidence of a reason to combine the elements of arduini in the manner required by claim,other than mercer statement that arduini teaches putting those building blocks together in any manner the circuit designer desires.at.
moreover,synqor introduced extensive objective evidence of nonobviousness at trial,including commercial success,industry recognition,initial skepticism of experts,unexpected results,and copying by competitors.the record links this convincing evidence to the claimed invention thus supplying a nexus to the claimed intermediate bus architecture.for example,the record shows that even defendants engineers were highly skeptical of the claimed invention,at one point describing it as a whopper in terms of technical challenge.another engineer stated that separating isolation from regulation almost surely would cost more in dollars,efficiency,and board space.further,defendants expert mcalexander admitted that there is certainly an element of commercial success to synqor architecture,and synqor expert,leeb,testified that there were significant efforts by defendants to copy synqor products.
the jury found claim of the patent not invalid as anticipated or obvious.in doing so,the jury implicitly resolved underlying factual issues including the presence of objective indicia of nonobviousness and whether there was a reason to combine the various elements taught by arduini in the manner claimed in favor of synqor.see agrizap,woodstream,holding the court will presume all factual disputes were resolved in favor of the verdict.the record contains substantial evidence to support the jury findings.accordingly,this court affirms the denial of defendants motion for jmol that claim of the patent is invalid for obviousness.
defendants also did not prove claim of the patent lacks entitlement to priority based on synqor original patent applications.a claim is entitled to the filing date of an earlier application if the disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.ariad,eli lilly,en banc.
the specification of the patent,to which the patent claims priority,states 
when the regulation stage precedes the isolation stage,it is not necessary to sense the isolated output voltage to control the regulation.an alternative approach is to sense the voltage on the primary side of the isolation stage,which may eliminate the need for secondary side circuitry and the need to bridge the feedback control signal across the isolation barrier.
patent,emphasis added.the second quoted sentence undisputedly describes semiregulation.defendants argue that the specification is limited to preceding the isolation stage,whereas claim of the patent requires regulation following an stage.
dickens and schlecht testified that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the specification taught use of in the isolation stage,and that such a isolation stage could precede several dc dc switching or linear regulators.additionally,the specification states that dc dc switching regulators can be used on the secondary side to achieve the additional regulation desired.patent,ll.emphasis added.
the jury made a factual finding that the parent specification adequately supports claim of the patent.the record supplies sufficient evidence to support that factual finding.this court therefore affirms the denial of jmol that the patent is not entitled to the priority date.
this court reviews the district court claim construction and grant of partial summary judgment without deference.metropolitan life ins.bancorp.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
the district court construed the terms isolation,isolating,and isolated,to mean the absence of an electric path permitting the flow of dc current other than a de minimus amount between an input and an output of a particular stage,component,or circuit.claim construction order,dist.lexis,at bold emphasis added.defendants argue the construction should require isolation between two points rather than between an input and an output of a particular stage,component,or circuit.defendants assert that consumers connect the input and output of the claimed system to a common ground such that the system is not isolated.
t he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning that they would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.phillips awh,en banc quoting vitronics conceptronic.in this case,the customary meaning of the contested terms,construed within their proper context in the claim,verifies the trial court construction.the term isolation is used as an adjective describing a stage or converter within the power converter system.for example,claim of the patent claims a power converter system comprising a dc power source a nonregulating isolation stage and a plurality of nonisolating regulation stages patent ll.emphasis added see also patent claiming a system comprising an isolating converter and plural regulators.the claim language thus only requires isolation within a particular stage.requiring isolation between every two points in the system would read the terms stage or converter out of the claims.
the figures in the specification further support the district court construction.see,patent.the figures show an isolation stage that has no electrical connection between its input and output.the figures do not depict the entire power converter system,and are therefore silent as to whether the input and output grounds of the entire system could be connected to one another.
moreover,defendants expert admitted that construing the claims such that employ ing the common technique of grounding the system would cause the converter to be considered would prevent the claims from encompassing the preferred embodiment.at.a claim construction that excludes the preferred embodiment is rarely,if ever,correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary support.adams respiratory therapeutics,perrigo.in this case,the specification,including the claims,supports a reading that encompasses the preferred embodiment.
thus,this court holds that the district court correctly construed isolation to require the absence of an electrical path between the input and output of a particular stage,component,or circuit.the record indicates that the defendants put forth no reason that the accused systems avoid infringement under the district court construction.thus,this court affirms the grant of partial summary judgment of infringement on this limitation.
liability for induced or contributory infringement under b or c requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.global tech appliances,seb,d.this includes,in part,actual knowledge of the existence of the patent that is infringed.id.
defendants argue the jury was incorrectly instructed as to the knowledge requirement for induced infringement.defendants also assert the record contains insufficient evidence to support the jury finding that they had actual knowledge of the patent a finding necessary to support the award of damages for induced infringement.finally,defendants argue the district court erred in excluding evidence of pending reexaminations of the patents in suit.
jury instruction on requisite knowledge 
this court reviews the legal sufficiency of jury instructions on an issue of patent law without deference to the district court.this court reviews jury instructions in their entirety and only orders a new trial when errors in the instructions as a whole clearly mislead the jury.dsu med.jms,en banc in relevant part internal citations and quotations omitted.in reviewing jury instructions,the full trial record and the jury instructions in their entirety must be examined because instructions take on meaning from the context of what happened at trial,including how the parties tried the case and their arguments to the jury.therasense,at.
the district court instructed the jury 
the plaintiff must show that the defendants actually intended to cause the acts that constitute direct infringement and that the defendants knew or should have known that its actions would induce actual infringement.a defendant also can not be liable for inducing infringement if it had no reason to be aware of the existence of the patent.
at emphases added.
defendants argue this instruction allowed the jury to find inducement if defendants lacked actual knowledge of the patents and only had reason to be aware of their existence.
while this instruction might be erroneous if considered in isolation,this court finds that the instructions as a whole in the context of the trial informed the jury that actual knowledge was required.synqor premised its theory at trial on actual knowledge of the patents,and told the jury during closing that to determine when the clock starts for damages,you need to know when defendants knew of synqor patent.at.
additionally,the record shows that the jury instructions on contributory infringement required actual knowledge of the patent.at.the jury found each defendant liable for contributory infringement,and awarded damages from the date the patent issued.at.thus,the jury,by following this instruction,in fact found each defendant had actual knowledge of the patent when it issued.
in this context,the jury instructions as a whole did not clearly mislead the jury.rather,the jury finding of liability for contributory infringement demonstrates the jury found each defendant had actual knowledge of the patent prior to suit.
actual knowledge evidence 
the record contained sufficient evidence to support the jury conclusion that each defendant had actual knowledge of the patent when it issued.synqor did not present direct evidence that any defendant possessed the patent on the date it issued,nor did any defendant admit it had actual knowledge of the patent.such direct evidence of knowledge is not required to support a finding of inducement.broadcom qualcomm.
synqor presented specific evidence for each defendant that allowed the jury to infer actual knowledge of the patent.the district court recounted this evidence in detail and found it sufficient to support the jury verdict.synqor,artesyn,cv,dist.lexis,at.among other evidence,synqor showed that each of the defendants possessed synqor datasheets or products marked with synqor earlier patents,including patent,to which the patents in suit claim priority.synqor expert,leeb,gave his opinion that there was a significant effort by the defendants in this case to synqor products,and that those efforts would have exposed defendants to synqor patents.id.at.further,some defendants admitted to monitoring synqor patents and one was shown to have possessed the patent prior to the time this suit was filed.
after examining the record,this court concludes that it contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that each defendant had actual knowledge of the patents in suit during the relevant time period.accordingly,this court affirms the denial of jmol of noninfringement under b.
reexamination evidence 
this court applies regional circuit law to evidentiary issues.the fifth circuit reviews a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.seatrax,sonbeck int l,cir.
the district court excluded evidence that,prior to trial,the united states patent trademark office had granted reexamination requests for the and had issued first rejections of the asserted claims of the and patents.the reexaminations were not final at the time of the trial,and the district court determined they would have been confusing and more prejudicial than probative.synqor,artesyn,denial of new trial,cv,dist.lexis,at.this court detects no abuse of discretion in the trial court ruling.
the jury adopted the damages model put forth by synqor expert,brett reed.this model included both damages and a reasonable royalty component.for both components,the jury awarded damages based on the price synqor asserts it would have been able to charge but for the price erosion caused by defendants infringement.those but for prices are roughly two to three times the prices actually charged by defendants.
defendants seek jmol or a new trial based on numerous alleged errors in the damages portion of the trial.defendants argue the record evidence does not support synqor price erosion theory and reasonably royalty rates.defendants also argue the district court erred in its jury instructions and exclusion of evidence relating to noninfringing alternatives.finally,defendants argue synqor improperly introduced evidence of the entire market value of customer end products containing the patented components.
price erosion reasonable royalty evidence 
an award of damages by a jury is upheld on appellate review unless it is clearly not supported by evidence,grossly excessive,or based only on speculation and guesswork.interactive pictures infinite pictures.
to establish entitlement to price erosion damages,synqor had the burden to show that but for infringement,it would have sold its product at higher prices.crystal semiconductor tritech microelectronics int l,fed.a credible analysis must account for the effect of a higher price on demand for the product.id.further,because a rational infringer is likely to offer an acceptable noninfringing alternative,if available,to compete with the patent owner rather than leave the market altogether,the analysis must consider the impact of such alternate technologies on the market as a whole.grain processing am.maize prods.
defendants argue the jury damages award is excessive because synqor price erosion theory is unsupported by the evidence.to the contrary,the jury heard evidence that synqor sold its bus converters for prices in the to as high as per unit when it first entered the market,at,and made sales to hewlett packard and sun for per unit in,at.additionally,synqor sold about converters to cisco in at and per unit during a market shortage.
while defendants expert opined that synqor could not have charged the prices over the long term,and a cisco representative testified that his company would not have paid that price over the period of infringement,synqor offered contrary testimony.specifically,synqor countered defendants suggestion that the industry would have moved to noninfringing converters rather than pay synqor higher prices for the patented converters.leeb,synqor expert,testified that the power handling capability,efficiency,and stability of converters was inferior to that of the patented technology.schlecht and leeb testified that,in late,new converters were just beginning to compete in performance with the earliest unregulated bus converters.
in sum,the jury reasonably could have concluded that testimony from some of defendants witnesses indicated customers would not have switched to noninfringing alternatives in response to synqor higher prices.cisco representative admitted his company would have had to incur significant costs to redesign its end products to use any noninfringing power converter that was not a replacement,and that replacements did not exist as of august.similarly,a defense witness testified he was not aware of any customers that had actually switched from unregulated intermediate bus converters to any noninfringing alternative for the same application.
upon review of the entire record,this court detects sufficient evidence for the jury to have accepted reed but for pricing.as such,both the and reasonable royalty damages are supported by substantial evidence and not excessive or based only on speculation and guesswork.accordingly,this court affirms the denial of defendants motion for jmol or a new trial.
cisco awards evidence 
defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in not admitting evidence that cisco had awarded certain defendants the right to develop converters as drop in replacements for the accused products cisco awards.on the eve of trial,in december,defendants produced preliminary technical specifications and data sheets on products in development.defendants assert that these converters developed under the cisco awards qualify as available noninfringing alternatives because defendants would have made such products but for their infringement.this court finds no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of the cisco awards evidence.
first,the district court reasonably excluded the evidence under federal rule of civil procedure as having been produced too late.denial of new trial,dist.lexis,at.the court found synqor would have been prejudiced by allowing evidence of the cisco awards at trial because there was insufficient time for synqor experts to test the availability or performance characteristics of the alleged substitutes.id.
second,the district court properly found the cisco awards not probative of the availability of noninfringing alternatives during the damages period.id.at.where,as here,an alleged substitute was not on the market during the damages period,the accused infringer has the burden to overcome the inference that the substitute was not available.grain processing,at.factors to consider include the ease with which a substitute was eventually made available,the state of the technology,and the availability of input products and equipment.see id.at see also micro chemical,lextron,finding an alternative product not available where new product required hours to design and another hours to test.
as the district court noted,uncontroverted evidence demonstrated that significant improvements in converter performance characteristics had just been made in.denial of new trial,dist.lexis,at.as such,the input components necessary to develop the replacement converters were not readily available during the infringement period,and there is no basis to conclude that the high performing fully regulated converters that defendants were working on in late could have been developed any earlier.id.moreover,the record shows that,even with the benefit of recent component improvements,it took defendants nearly a year,if not longer,to make the replacement converters available for commercial use.at.
accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of the cisco awards.
