introduction 
this writ proceeding arises out of a decision of the department of alcoholic beverage control department suspending for days the beer and wine license of a convenience store that sold beer to an underage decoy working with the police department.
when this matter was first heard by an administrative law judge alj,the department presented evidence relevant to the question whether the decoy displayed the appearance of a person under years of age,as required by a department rule.although the parties disputed whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that the requirement had been met,it was uncontroverted that the alj failed to address the issue in his decision,which the department adopted.on the licensees appeal to the alcoholic beverage control appeals board board,the board held the alj failure to address the appearance requirement mandated reversal,and it remanded so the department,the alj could make a finding on the issue.
following the remand,the alj,relying on the evidence presented at the original hearing before him,issued a new decision which contained a finding that the appearance requirement had been met.after the department adopted the alj new decision,the licensees again appealed to the board.the board held that it had envisioned something more such as an additional hearing before the it had earlier remanded the matter to the department for the requisite finding to be made,and again it reversed the department decision.
we conclude the board erred when it held the alj was required to do more than rely on the existing record.we also hold substantial evidence supports the alj finding that the appearance requirement was met.we therefore reverse the decision of the board and affirm the decision of the department.
factual and procedural history 
in march,an decoy working with the los angeles police department entered a convenience store in woodland hills,retrieved a of beer from the cooler,and proceeded to the counter.the decoy was feet inches tall,weighed approximately pounds,and wore a baseball cap.according to both the decoy and the police officer with whom he was working,the store clerk at the counter requested,and the decoy provided a california identification card,which stated that the decoy date of birth was july,and contained the words age in in large,italicized letters.although the identification card revealed the decoy was underage,the clerk proceeded to sell him the beer.after exiting the store with the beer,the decoy returned and,in the presence of the police officer with whom he was working,identified the clerk who had sold him the beer.the decoy was then photographed with the clerk 
the department filed an accusation against the holders of the beer and wine license for the convenience southland corporation the franchisor,and pardeep and sukhsagar pannu the franchisees 
in november,a hearing was held before alj sonny lo,during which the department presented evidence relevant to the determination whether the requirements of rule b cal.code,tit,subd.b hereafter rule b had been met.that rule provides in pertinent part that a decoy shall display the appearance which could generally be expected of a person under years of age,under the actual circumstances presented to the seller of alcoholic beverages at the time of the alleged offense.among other things,the department presented the photograph of the decoy with the store clerk taken immediately after the sale,as well as the testimony of the decoy,who stated that his manner of speaking was the same on the stand as it was when he purchased the beer.
alj lo submitted a proposed decision,calling for a suspension of the license.the decision contained no specific finding on rule b appearance requirement.
the department adopted the alj proposed decision and the licensees appealed to the board.
in january,the board issued a decision.as to the appearance requirement,the board concluded t he alj decision is flawed,in that it makes no finding one way or another as to whether the decoy presented the appearance required by rule b.the board went on to say the board is not the finder of fact,and it is not the board prerogative to make its own findings when those of the department are deficient.while we have viewed the photograph of the minor,and have our own views as to what it tells us,our views are irrelevant.that is why we believe the case must be returned to the department so that the critical b findings can be made.after rejecting the licensees other contentions,the board issued the following order the decision of the department is reversed and the case is remanded to the department for reconsideration of the issue whether the decoy presented the appearance which could be generally expected of a person under years of age,and for such other proceedings as may be appropriate or necessary in light of the comments herein.nowhere in its opinion did the board direct the alj to receive additional evidence or conduct an additional hearing before making the requisite finding.
in june,the department issued a decision following appeals board decision,remanding the matter to alj lo for decision and clarification as he deems appropriate including the submission of any further evidence he may require in his exclusive discretion.
in august,alj lo issued a proposed decision after remand.alj lo did not conduct an additional hearing or receive additional evidence before issuing the new decision.rather,he relied on the evidence presented at the hearing that took place before he issued his original decision.this time,the decision addressed the appearance requirement.among other things,the decision stated that a photograph of the decoy taken th e day of the sale shows he did display the physical appearance which could generally be expected of a person under years old.the decision also stated 
at the hearing,the decoy did not display the mannerism or demeanor which one would normally expect from a person who has such experience and responsibility referring to the decoy prior experience as an explorer with the los angeles police department.his voice was soft,not assertive.he sat slouched on the witness chair perhaps due in part to his lankiness.and,he seldom looked his questioners in the eye.in other words,without the decoy testimony regarding his rank and duties as an explorer,one would not know from the decoy nonphysical appearance that he held a position which required a substantial amount of maturity and leadership.
the decoy voice and manner of speaking at the hearing were the same as they were at respondents store.the decoy was not nervous at respondents store,and he did not appear nervous when testifying.
the administrative law judge observed the decoy maturity,mannerism,poise and demeanor while he testified,and finds that the decoy had the nonphysical appearance which could generally be expected of a person under years old.
the decision again provided for a suspension of the license.
the department adopted the alj decision and the licensees again appealed,arguing there was no substantial evidence to support the alj finding that the appearance requirement had been met.
in may,almost a year and a half after the completion of briefing,the board reversed.it stated in pertinent part 
with the benefit of hindsight,it is apparent to this board that the manner in which this case was resolved offends our sense of fairness.
we did not expect the department,and more particularly the alj,to simply declare,without further hearing and input from the parties,that he had in fact done exactly what the board had said should have been done,even though there is no hint in his original decision that he had done so.
the board,it can be said,envisioned something more,where the parties could have addressed the various indicia of age displayed by the decoy,and the weight to be accorded them.this did not happen.
while we do not question the alj good faith,we do feel that there are enough questions about his ability to isolate,from memory,from all the decoys he has seen before and since these cases were heard,this particular decoy,that the procedure which was utilized was flawed and inherently unfair.
