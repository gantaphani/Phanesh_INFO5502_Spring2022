this commercial dispute requires us to test the outer limits of a court in personam jurisdiction,consistent with the constraints of the due process clause.see const.amend.xiv.the district court concluded that the defendant lacked sufficient contacts with the forum state massachusetts to permit the exercise of jurisdiction and,accordingly,dismissed the action.see franchising,llc alpenrose dairy,wl,at.concluding,as we do,that the district court miscalibrated the jurisdictional scales,we reverse.
background 
franchising llc is a delaware special purpose limited liability company,which maintains its principal place of business in canton,massachusetts.it franchises independent persons and entities to operate ice cream stores.alpenrose dairy,alpenrose is a dairy products manufacturer incorporated in oregon and headquartered in portland.
in,predecessor in interest,entered into a territorial franchise agreement the agreement with alpenrose.at the time,had its principal place of business in glendale,california.the negotiations surrounding the formation of when consummated,the agreement in california.when consummated,the agreement gave alpenrose the right to operate franchises in washington and oregon for a term,commencing on december.subject to other conditions not relevant here,the agreement gave alpenrose an option to renew the franchise for successive terms as long as it also furnished written notice to at least one year prior to the expiration of the current term.
the agreement obligated alpenrose to comply with specifications,recipes,and processes for the manufacture of ice cream products.it likewise bound alpenrose to a set of specific procedures for operating stores.these obligations required alpenrose to have a certain amount of ongoing communication and coordination with.
as might be expected,the agreement controlled the financial relationship between the parties.it required alpenrose to pay royalties to based on monthly sales.the money stream flowed in both directions alpenrose recruited other franchisees for,and the agreement obligated to make monthly remittances to alpenrose based on royalties received by from those franchisees.
between and,the parties amended the agreement three times.these amendments expanded alpenrose franchise territory to include montana and parts of idaho.at the time of each amendment,remained headquartered in california.all material discussions and negotiations concerning the amendments took place in oregon alpenrose home state.
alpenrose exercised its renewal options without incident on five occasions.throughout this period,underwent several ownership changes.around some years after and alpenrose first executed the agreement the current owners moved headquarters from california to massachusetts.
in as it had done every six years since,alpenrose sent formal notice of its election to renew the agreement.alpenrose directed this notice to newly relocated headquarters in massachusetts.the agreement was thus extended for yet another term.
in,the ownership of parent company again changed hands headquarters remained in massachusetts and,in november of,alpenrose renewed the agreement for another term running from december,to december.this renewal notice like the immediately preceding renewal notice was sent to in massachusetts.
under the provisions of the agreement,alpenrose had until december,to notify of its intent to renew for a further term.on december,alpenrose informed that it did not intend to renew the agreement,stating p lease consider this our one year notice of intent to not renew.m aybe it time to take a slightly different direction.did not formally acknowledge that the agreement would lapse,but the parties began negotiating the terms of alpenrose transition out of the franchise arrangement.the negotiations stalled and,on july,alpenrose wrote to,stating that it wished to revoke its decision not to renew.instead,it requested another extension of the agreement,to begin when the current term expired that is,on december.alpenrose later warned that it would otherwise be entitled to fair compensation under the washington franchise investment protection act,see.code i.
responded that alpenrose had waited too long and was no longer entitled to renew the agreement.at the same time,it rejected alpenrose suggestion that any compensation was due in consequence of the of the franchise.then with an impasse in the offing raced to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts and sued for a judicial declaration that the agreement and all of alpenrose rights associated therewith will expire on december,and that alpenrose is not entitled to any compensation in connection with the expiration of the agreement.the record sheds no light on the current status of the parties commercial relationship.
alpenrose moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue,see fed.civ.b,or in the alternative to transfer venue to the united states district court for the western district of washington,see a.opposed both motions.after considering the parties arguments,the district court dismissed the case for want of in personam jurisdiction.see franchising,wl,at.the court concluded that nothing in the parties history suggests that alpenrose intended to purposefully avail itself of the privilege of conducting business within massachusetts.id.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
where,as here,a district court dismisses a case for lack of personal jurisdiction based on the prima facie record,rather than after an evidentiary hearing or factual findings,our review is de novo.downer bioriginal food sci,cir.in conducting this de novo review,we are not bound by the district court reasoning but,rather,may affirm the judgment for any reason made evident by the record.see phillips exeter acad.howard phillips fund,cir.
the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that jurisdiction over the defendant lies in the forum state.see adelson hananel,cir.faced with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,a district court may choose from among several methods for determining whether the plaintiff has met its burden.id.alteration in original quoting daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson poole,cir.here,the district court employed the prima facie method,which requires no differential factfinding rather,this method requires only that a plaintiff proffer evidence which,taken at face value,suffices to show all facts essential to personal jurisdiction.see,babcock wilcox,cir.
for the purpose of examining the merits of such a jurisdictional proffer,we like the district court take the facts from the pleadings and whatever supplemental filings such as affidavits are contained in the record,giving credence to the plaintiff version of genuinely contested facts.see sawtelle farrell,cir.we may,of course,take into account undisputed facts put forth by the defendant.see downer,at.
the case before us is a diversity case.see a.in determining whether a defendant is subject to its jurisdiction,a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction is the functional equivalent of a state court sitting in the forum state.sawtelle,at quoting,alioto,cir.it follows that must show that the district court assertion of personal jurisdiction over alpenrose would satisfy the requirements of both the due process clause of the federal constitution and the massachusetts statute.laws ch.
the jurisdictional requirements imposed by the massachusetts statute are quite similar to,though not completely congruent with,the jurisdictional requirements imposed by the due process clause.see cossart united excel,cir.because the modest difference between these requirements is not material here,we move directly to the constitutional analysis 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that a defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington,quoting milliken meyer.this due process test is flexible and,written more in shades of grey than in black and white.phillips exeter,at.
consistent with the demands of due process,a federal district court may exercise either general or specific jurisdiction over a defendant.see cossart,at.has not proffered a claim of general jurisdiction but,rather,has asserted only a claim of specific jurisdiction as the basis for the district court jurisdiction.we limit our appraisal accordingly.
specific jurisdiction allows a court to hear a particular case as long as that case relates sufficiently to,or arises from,a significant subset of contacts between the defendant and the forum.phillips exeter,at.the existence vel non of specific jurisdiction depends on the results of a tripartite inquiry.we evaluate whether the claim directly arise s out of,or relate s to,the defendant forum state activities whether the defendant contacts represent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of that state laws and making the defendant involuntary presence before the state courts foreseeable and whether the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.downer,at quoting daynard,at.all three of these elements must be present for specific jurisdiction to attach.see phillips exeter,at.
under this framework,the first element is relatedness.relatedness requires that the action directly arise out of the specific contacts between the defendant and the forum state.sawtelle,at.this requirement serves the important function of focusing the court attention on the nexus between a plaintiff claim and the defendant contact with the forum.id.relatively speaking,the relatedness inquiry is to be resolved under a flexible,relaxed standard.pritzker yari,cir.
argues that its claims arise from alpenrose letters to in and,both of which were sent to offices in massachusetts.the first letter communicated alpenrose decision not to renew the agreement the second letter constituted alpenrose attempt to reverse direction by revoking that decision and exercising its option to renew the agreement for another six years.
in its complaint,seeks declarations both that alpenrose second letter did not effectively renew the agreement with the result that the agreement expired on december,and that alpenrose is not entitled to any compensation in connection with the expiration of the agreement.we agree with that these claims arise directly out of alpenrose contacts.see sawtelle,at.
our conclusion is not altered by alpenrose asseveration that the question of expiration arises first out of the agreement itself and i t is only in the context of the agreement itself that the two letters relating to expiration can be analyzed.although it is transparently clear that the agreement itself ultimately determines the effect of alpenrose two letters that is,whether those letters collectively resulted in renewal of the agreement,it is the letters that set the present controversy in motion.that creates a sufficient nexus between alpenrose letters and claims to satisfy the flexible and relaxed standard for relatedness 
this brings us to the next element of the jurisdictional analysis purposeful availment.the purposeful availment inquiry asks whether a defendant has deliberately target ed its behavior toward the society or economy of a particular forum such that the forum should have the power to subject the defendant to judgment regarding that behavior.carreras pmg collins,llc,cir.such a requirement guarantees that a defendant will not be subjected to the exercise of jurisdiction based solely on random,isolated or fortuitous contacts with the forum state.adelson,at quoting sawtelle,at.it also ensures that a defendant will not be swept within a state jurisdictional reach due solely to the unilateral activity of another party or a third person.burger king rudzewicz,quoting helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall.
the main ingredients of purposeful availment are voluntariness and foreseeability.see downer,at.voluntariness requires that the defendant contacts with the forum state proximately result from actions by the defendant himself.phillips prairie eye,cir.emphasis in original quoting burger king,at.foreseeability requires that a defendant contacts with the forum state are such that the defendant could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.adelson,at quoting volkswagen woodson.
it is apodictic that the mere existence of a contractual relationship between an defendant and an plaintiff does not suffice,in and of itself,to establish jurisdiction in the plaintiff home state.phillips exeter,at see bond leather shoe,cir.here,relies chiefly on two kinds of contacts in endeavoring to demonstrate alpenrose purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting business in massachusetts.one set of contacts comprises the renewal notices sent by alpenrose to in massachusetts one in and another in.the other set of contacts consists,in words,of alpenrose actions in carr ying on a highly interactive business relationship with in massachusetts for twelve years.arguing the latter point,explains that alpenrose exchanged communications,information,products,and payments with at its headquarters in massachusetts,knowing and intending that would perform various support and oversight functions there.
given the parties relationship,the logical starting point is the supreme court seminal decision in burger king.we first query whether this decision controls and conclude that it does not.there,the court upheld the florida courts exercise of jurisdiction over a michigan franchisee of a florida franchisor.the court placed its primary emphasis on the parties prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,along with the terms of the contract and the parties actual course of dealing.burger king,at.it concluded that these matters were after all,the franchisee had entered into a carefully structured relationship that envisioned continuing and contacts with burger king in florida.id.at.in that way,he had voluntarily accepted and exacting regulation of his business from burger king miami headquarters.id.
in finding that florida could constitutionally exercise in personam jurisdiction over the franchisee,the court relied heavily on the contractual documents,which specified that burger king operations are conducted and supervised from the miami headquarters,that all relevant notices and payments must be sent there,and that the agreements were made in and enforced from miami.id.consistent with this contractual format,the parties course of dealing made manifest that decisionmaking authority was vested in the miami headquarters and that the burger king district office served largely as an intermediate link between the headquarters and the franchisees.id.at.to cinch matters,the court gave weight to the fact that many of the franchise documents provided for all disputes to be governed by florida law.see id.at.
to be sure,the case at hand also involves a suit by a franchisor that is trying to hail a franchisee into a court in its home state.but the similarity to burger king stops there the contract documents in this case evince no ties to massachusetts.they do not specify that any services are to be performed in or from massachusetts,that the nerve center of the franchisor operations is to be in massachusetts,or that massachusetts law will control any aspect of the parties dealings this is a critically important distinction.while the burger king court found that the franchisee should have envisioned continuing and contacts with burger king in florida from and after the time that the franchise agreement was signed,id.at,the record here does not permit a similar finding.
we add,moreover,that the franchisee contacts with burger king in florida were foreseeable precisely because burger king was located in florida when the franchise agreement materialized.not so here when alpenrose and joined forces in,was headquartered in california and that state had been the locus of the negotiations that led up to the franchise agreement.remained in california while the agreement was thrice amended,and those amendments were negotiated in oregon.massachusetts was in no way involved and,at least up to that point,neither the contract docum
