background 
procedural history 
in deciding granholm,the supreme court held that state laws permitting wineries to directly ship their products to customers and restricting wineries ability to do so violate the dormant commerce clause.on may,the same day that granholm was decided,huber winery,schneider,and reilly plaintiffs filed a complaint in united states district court for the western district of kentucky against defendant lajuana wilcher,in her official capacity as secretary of the kentucky environmental and public protection cabinet,and lavoyed hudgins in his official capacity as executive director of the kentucky department of alcoholic beverage control defendants.
plaintiffs filed a claim pursuant to,alleging that kentucky statutes violated the commerce clause by discriminating against wineries with respect to wine sales to customers and to licensed retailers.plaintiffs complaint explained that huber winery owns and operates a winery located in starlight,indiana and would sell and deliver wine directly to kentucky residents but for kentucky restrictions on the direct shipping of wine by wineries.plaintiffs schneider and reilly,residents of kentucky,are regular wine purchasers who would have wine shipped directly to them if not for kentucky direct shipping restrictions.
on july,wine and spirits wholesalers of kentucky inc the wholesalers,a corporation whose members are licensed kentucky wholesalers,filed a motion to intervene which was granted by the district court.after plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,the case was held in abeyance in anticipation of pending legislation.plaintiffs amended their complaint on february,adding cherry hill vineyards,llc,an oregon winery,as a plaintiff 
in april,the kentucky legislature responded to granholm by enacting senate bill sb.act,ch,revising its regulation of wine.on may,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,addressing the amended statutory language contained in sb.because the bill would not come into effect until january,the district court ruled on plaintiffs july,motion for judgment on the pleadings on august,holding portions of the kentucky statutory scheme unconstitutional defendants and the wholesalers appealed the district court order to this court,but on january,when sb came into effect,the appeals became moot and were dismissed.
on may,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint for declaratory relief pursuant to.plaintiffs claimed that kentucky statutory scheme violated the commerce clause by discriminating against wineries with respect to sales to consumers and to licensed retail wine sellers,and requested a judgment declaring kentucky statutory scheme that restricts the ability of wineries to sell and ship wine directly to consumers and retail license holders within the commonwealth of kentucky unconstitutional.in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs also requested a permanent injunction prohibiting from enforcing provisions of krs,f,and that prohibit wineries from selling and shipping wine directly to consumers and retail package and retail drink license holders in kentucky and requiring them to permit such direct sales and shipment.
the parties then filed for summary judgment,which were granted in part and denied in part on december.the district court upheld the constitutionality of the challenged sections of the revised statutes,but declared the purchase requirement of krs and unconstitutional as it discriminates in practical effect against small farm wineries,and has not been shown to advance the legitimate local purposes asserted that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.cherry hill vineyards hudgins,d.pursuant to this holding,the district court ordered the requirement stricken from both statutes and enjoined defendants from enforcing the requirement.defendants did not appeal the district court judgment.
on january,the intervening wholesalers filed a timely notice of appeal.plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to dismiss,claiming that the wholesalers lacked standing to appeal because defendants abandoned the suit.this motion has not been ruled on and has been sent to a merits panel for disposition.
ii.statutory framework 
as part of its overall regulation of alcohol manufacturing and distribution,kentucky regulates the sale of wine from small farm wineries,which are defined as wineries producing no more than gallons of wine per year.krs.any or small farm winery may apply for a small farm winery license.krs.this license allows a winery to ship its wine to a kentucky customer if.the wine is purchased by the customer in person at the small farm winery.the wine is shipped by licensed common carrier and.the amount of wine shipped is limited to two cases per customer per visit.krs g krs explicitly listing the same conditions on shipping to kentucky customers for small farm wineries.if an small farm winery ships wine directly to kentucky customers in violation of these conditions,the winery faces criminal penalties.krs.
discussion 
i.an intervenor standing to appeal 
plaintiffs claim that the wholesalers lack standing to appeal the district court judgment because defendants declined to appeal the decision.
as this court has explained,a n intervenor need not have the same standing necessary to initiate a lawsuit in order to intervene in an existing district court suit where the plaintiff has standing.associated builders contractors perry,cir citing trbovich united mine workers,d.the intervenor normally has the right to appeal an adverse final judgment by a trial court,just as any other party can.stringfellow concerned neighbors in action,d.
nonetheless,an intervenor seeking to appeal,like any other party,must fulfill the requirements of article iii of the constitution before it can continue to pursue an action in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted.diamond charles,d.accordingly,the standing requirement may bar an appeal even though an intervenor had standing before the district court.united states van,cir.
article iii of the constitution confines federal courts to adjudicating actual cases or controversies.allen wright,d.the plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.id.at.to establish injury in fact,a party must allege such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of jurisdiction.warth seldin,d quoting baker carr,d.although the type of injury that conveys standing has not been precisely defined,the alleged injury must be distinct and palpable,and not abstract or conjectural or hypothetical.perry,at quoting allen,at.palpable economic injuries have long been recognized as sufficient to lay the basis for standing,with or without a specific statutory provision for judicial review.sierra club morton,d.
here,we find that the wholesalers face a palpable economic injury that is sufficient to provide the basis for standing.the district court order declaring the requirement of krs and unconstitutional allows small farm wineries to sell directly to consumers,thereby bypassing the wholesaler tier of kentucky three tier distribution system.before the district court ruling,small farm wineries were statutorily prevented from making direct sales unless the purchase requirement was met,and were effectively required to pass through the wholesaler tier if they wished to reach kentucky consumers.after the district court ruling,however,small farm wineries can ship up to two cases of wine directly to consumers without an purchase,and the wholesalers are denied potential profits from each of these sales.
plaintiffs do not contend that the wholesalers lack a palpable economic interest in the outcome of the case.instead,plaintiffs rely upon diamond,d,and perry,for the proposition that an intervening trade association does not have standing to appeal a judgment that a state law is unconstitutional if the state accepts the ruling and elects not to appeal.
in diamond,the supreme court held that a doctor who had intervened in a challenge to an illinois abortion law lacked standing to defend the law when the state of illinois failed to challenge an unfavorable appellate court decision.at.the court noted that if illinois had sought review of the decision,both illinois and the intervenor would have had standing.id.at.diamond,the intervening doctor,attempted to equate his position with that of the opposing parties,doctors who brought suit because the abortion law potentially subjected them to criminal prosecution.the supreme court rejected diamond argument because diamond,unlike doctors who had an interest in being free from criminal prosecution,had no judicially cognizable interest in compelling the state to bring criminal prosecutions against other doctors.id.at.in a broad statement that is the focus of plaintiffs in this case,the court explained that b ecause the state alone is entitled to create a legal code,only the state has the kind of direct stake identified in sierra club in defending the standards embodied in that code.diamond,at.quoting sierra club,at.
however,contrary to plaintiffs representations,diamond does not preclude intervenors from appealing when the state fails to appeal,as long as the intervenors can independently establish standing.diamond,at.see also maine taylor,d recognizing that intervenors in lower federal courts may seek review in this court on their own,so long as they have a sufficient stake in the outcome of the controversy to satisfy the constitutional requirement of genuine adversity citation omitted.ultimately,the diamond court explained that the intervening doctor lacked standing because he was not able to assert an injury in fact and an intervenor right to continue a suit in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon a showing by the intervenor that he fulfills the requirements of art.iii.diamond,at.the intervening wholesalers in this case stand to suffer a concrete economic loss as a result of the district court judgment and can not be equated to the intervening doctor in diamond,who had no economic or personal stake in the outcome of the case.
plaintiffs also rely upon perry to support their argument that the wholesalers lack standing.in perry,this court found that neca,a trade organization,lacked standing to appeal a district court judgment striking down michigan laws governing apprenticeship.although neca argued that it had standing because it had an interest in the enforcement of industry safety and quality standards and in the competitiveness of the licensed electrical contractors it represented,this court found that it was dispositive that michigan did not appeal the district court decision.perry,at.relying upon diamond,this court held that because neca can not compel the state to enforce a law which it has chosen to abandon,neca can not demonstrate the kind of interest necessary to confer standing to prosecute this appeal.id.at.
plaintiffs argue that perry precludes any intervenor from appealing a judgment that a state law is unconstitutional when the state elects not to appeal.while perry does provide support for this argument,we decline to apply perry as broadly as the plaintiffs suggest,and hold that an intervenor does have standing to appeal an adverse judgment,even if the state declines to appeal it,if the intervenor can independently demonstrate that he fulfills the requirements of article iii.
our conception of standing comports with the supreme court statement that an intervenor right to continue a suit in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon a showing by the intervenor that he fulfills the requirements of art.iii.diamond,at.see also taylor,at.sierra club,at.holding that intervenors in lower federal courts may seek appellate review on their own,so long as they have a sufficient stake in the outcome of the controversy to satisfy the constitutional requirement of genuine adversity.it also comports with the supreme court analysis of standing in bryant yellen,where the supreme court expressly recognized that a group of intervening farm workers had a sufficient stake in the outcome of the controversy to afford them standing to appeal the district court decision,notwithstanding the fact that the government,who had the sole power to enforce the statute,had withdrawn,d.
as acknowledged in a concurring opinion in perry,there are a number of cases where two private parties were fully entitled to litigate the constitutionality or validity of state statutes.at merritt,concurring citing martin hunter lessee,wheat.gibbons ogden,wheat.charles river bridge warren bridge,pet.west coast hotel parrish.mullane central hanover bank trust.these cases reinforce the proposition that private parties can litigate the constitutionality or validity of state statutes,with or without the state participation,so long as each party has a sufficient personal stake in the outcome of the controversy so as to establish standing.
ultimately,in a case such as this,where the intervening wholesalers stand to suffer a concrete economic loss as a result of the district court judgment,they face the type of palpable economic injuries that have long been recognized as sufficient to lay the basis for standing.sierra club,at.accordingly,we conclude that the wholesalers have standing to pursue this appeal.
ii.the constitutionality of the challenged statutes 
having found that the wholesalers have standing to pursue this appeal,we now turn to the wholesalers argument that the district court erred when it granted in part plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and held portions of kentucky statutory provisions unconstitutional.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.lenscrafters,robinson,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a court considering a summary judgment motion considers the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the constitutionality of a state statute is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.cmtys.for equity.high school athletic ass n,cir.
commerce clause legal standards 
this case asks the question of whether kentucky laws governing the wine industry violate the commerce clause.the plaintiff wineries filed suit filed after the supreme court invalidated laws which allowed only wineries to sell and ship wine directly to consumers,granholm,d,so a brief examination of that case is warranted.
the granholm court examined the interaction between the amendment to the constitution,which grants broad authority to the states to regulate alcohol importation and distribution,and the commerce clause,which prohibits discrimination against goods.at.the court held that the amendment does not displace the rule that states may not give a discriminatory preference to their own producers.id.at.accord bacchus imports,dias,d.although the granholm court addressed statutes that it deemed to be facially discriminatory,the court recognized that statutes can discriminate against interstate commerce on their face or in effect.at.accordingly,when plaintiffs allege practical effect discrimination,we must turn to other commerce clause jurisprudence for guidance.
to determine whether a statute violates the commerce clause,this court must first determine whether the statute discriminates
