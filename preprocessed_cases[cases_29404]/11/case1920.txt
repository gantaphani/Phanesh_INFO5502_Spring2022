petitioners west corporation west and west telemarketing corporation wtc seek a writ of mandate directing the superior court to grant their motion to quash service of summons on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction.the issue presented is whether california may constitutionally assert jurisdiction over a nonresident telemarketing corporation when a california resident initiates a phone call to buy a product,reaches a telemarketer who handles the order,the telemarketer then initiates a sale of a separate product and allegedly makes misrepresentations during the sales pitch for the separate product.we conclude personal jurisdiction is proper.
factual and procedural background 
wtc is a wholly owned subsidiary of west.both corporations are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and have their headquarters in nebraska.neither maintains any offices or employees in california,is licensed to do business in california,nor owns property in california.
wtc is an inbound teleservices bureau.wtc answers telephone calls for numbers and collects orders for various products and services on behalf of its clients.one of wtc clients advertised and sold fitness tapes.another one of wtc clients was memberworks,mwi.mwi is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware and has its principal place of business in connecticut.
in march,wtc and mwi entered into a joint marketing agreement to market mwi membership programs and to share net profits and losses equally.in january,wtc and mwi entered into a separate wholesale agreement providing that wtc,at its sole expense,would market,accept orders,and charge consumers for enrollment in the membership programs while mwi would mail out the memberships kits for a fee.
in january,west accepted and assumed all of wtc rights and obligations under the joint marketing and wholesale agreements.west used wtc to fulfill its contractual obligations.in july,wtc,west,and mwi entered into a joint and wholesale marketing agreement which superseded and essentially consolidated the prior agreements into one contract.
in late february,patricia sanford,a california resident,called an number to order some fitness videotapes.a wtc operator located in virginia answered the phone call.after the wtc operator processed sanford order for the tapes,including obtaining her credit card information,the operator proceeded to read a sales pitch from a prepared script for a purportedly free trial membership in a buying club that was serviced by mwi.this type of sales pitch for additional products or services is commonly called an upsell.when sanford accepted the mwi offer,wtc forwarded her information,including credit card information,to mwi.according to sanford,she and other consumers are told to look for materials in the mail confirming the membership.sanford alleged several weeks later her credit card was charged an unsolicited and unexpected for mwi essentials.in january,she was assessed another unsolicited and unexpected charge again charged as mwi essentials.after inquiring about this charge,sanford learned this was a renewal fee for the membership buying program.she was not informed that she had been enrolled in the program the prior year and she had never used it.sanford requested and received a refund of the renewal charge.
sanford alleged that customers are not asked their permission to have their credit debit card information given to mwi and are not sent a bill or invoice indicating their cards will be charged.she alleged customers are charged between and annually for membership or renewal fees for the mwi buying clubs.
originally,sanford filed her class action suit in federal court sanford memberworks,h lsp alleging causes of action for a violation of federal laws regarding unordered merchandise,declaratory relief,conversion,unjust enrichment,and fraud.west and wtc unsuccessfully moved to dismiss sanford federal suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.however,sanford federal claim against west and wtc for the mailing of unordered merchandise was eventually dismissed because west and wtc had not been involved in mailing the membership kits to sanford.the federal court declined to take supplemental jurisdiction over sanford state claims.
on february,sanford filed a class action complaint in san diego superior court against west and wtc alleging causes of action for violation of the consumers legal remedies act unlawful,fraudulent and unfair business practices untrue misleading advertising conversion unjust enrichment fraud and deceit and negligent misrepresentation.
west and wtc unsuccessfully moved to quash service of summons on the ground the court lacked personal jurisdiction.
discussion 
west and wtc argue that personal jurisdiction was improperly asserted,pointing out they have no employees or offices in california,they are not licensed to do business in california,and they own no california property.they further point out they did not advertise the fitness videotapes or mwi memberships in california.nor did they mail anything to or bill sanford.they stress that sanford initiated the telephone call that wtc answered in virginia and assert they did not reach out to sanford or any other california resident.sanford focuses on the fact that the defendants initiated the upsell of the mwi membership program while knowing she was a california resident.
a court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the united states.code civ.a state court assertion of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who has not been served with process within the state comports with the requirements of the due process clause of the federal constitution if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d.
under the minimum contacts test,an essential criterion in all cases is whether the quality and nature of the defendant activity is such that it is reasonable and fair to require him or her to conduct his or her defense in that state.citations.t he minimum contacts test is not susceptible of mechanical application rather,the facts of each case must be weighed to determine whether the requisite affiliating circumstances are present.citations.t his determination is one in which few answers will be written in black and white.the greys are dominant and even among them the shades are innumerable.pavlovich superior court cal th,d.
jurisdiction may be general when the nonresident activities in the forum state are extensive or citation or substantial continuous and systematic.alexander heater d.in such a situation,there is a constitutionally sufficient relationship to warrant jurisdiction for all causes of action against him or her,regardless of whether the specific cause of action is connected to the defendant business activities in the forum.ibid.alternatively,jurisdiction may be specific,based upon the nature and quality of the defendant activities in the forum in relation to the particular cause of action,and the balance between the convenience of the parties and the interest of the state in asserting jurisdiction.ibid.when determining whether specific jurisdiction exists,courts consider the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.citations.a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits citation the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum citations and the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.pavlovich superior court,supra,cal th,d.
when a defendant moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds,the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.citation.once facts showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established,however,it becomes the defendant burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.citation.when there is conflicting evidence,the trial court factual determinations are not disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.citation.when no conflict in the evidence exists,however,the question of jurisdiction is purely one of law and the reviewing court engages in an independent review of the record.vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th,d.
purposeful availment 
the parties disagree as to whether the defendants purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business in california.
the purposeful availment inquiry focuses on the defendant intentionality.citation.this prong is only satisfied when the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs his or her activities toward the forum so that he or she should expect,by virtue of the benefit he or she receives,to be subject to the court jurisdiction based on his or her contacts with the forum.citation.thus,the purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts citations,or of the unilateral activity of another party or a third person.pavlovich superior court,supra,cal th,d.
the mere causing of an effect in california is not necessarily sufficient to afford a constitutional basis for the extension of jurisdiction.stanley consultants,superior court d.nor is it sufficient that it is foreseeable that a product would enter or cause injury in california for an assertion of jurisdiction over a foreign corporation.volkswagen woodson,d new york car seller not subject to jurisdiction in california for a lawsuit by plaintiffs who while new york residents purchased a car in new york and were injured in a collision in oklahoma on their way to their new home in arizona see also farris fronapfel d.florida marine surveyor not subject to jurisdiction in california for a lawsuit filed by a california resident involving survey of boat purchased and surveyed in florida t he effects in california of the alleged intentional misrepresentation in florida are too remote in time and causal connection to fairly and justly require the nonresident defendant to come to california to defend himself as a result of the florida transaction.
the placement of a product into the stream of commerce,without more,is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state there must be additional conduct indicating an intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum state resolution trust corporation first of america bank,resolution trust quoting from asahi metal industry superior court,d.thus,the court in resolution trust found that although a michigan bank had participated in a national clearinghouse service which made it foreseeable that its services would be used in california,an assertion of jurisdiction was improper because o ther than placing itself in the stream of commerce,the bank did no act to avail itself of california.resolution trust,supra,at.the resolution trust court also found noteworthy the fact that the california bank had initiated the contact with the michigan bank.ibid.the court explained 
participating in the national clearinghouse service seems analogous to having telephone service which allows people to call the bank from all parts of the country and world to perform banking transactions.yet,such technology which makes banking services more accessible to customers does not commit the bank to national jurisdiction without some affirmative action to avail itself of a particular forum.resolution trust,supra,e.
additional conduct supporting an assertion of jurisdiction includes marketing directed at residents of the forum state including by direct mail campaigns united states golf ass amateur golf ass,new jersey jurisdiction found over california partnership that mailed approximately promotional packages to various locations in the united states,including packages sent to new jersey the internet colt studio,badpuppy enterprise d,california jurisdiction found over company operating internet site selling subscriptions to areas of its website or the telephone american telephone telegraph mci communications,at t.as explained in surgical specialties instrument,
while,in isolation,telephone and mail communications may not establish a substantial connection between a nonresident and a forum,when these communications form an integral part of an ongoing business relationship,such contacts are relevant in assessing the nature and extent of defendant conduct within a forum.otherwise,those businesses that can conduct extensive commercial activity in other jurisdictions primarily by telephone or through the mails would tend to be immunized from suit by those with whom they do business in any but their home jurisdictions.
in at t,supra,mci communications corporation mci contracted with pioneer teletechnologies,pioneer to handle its telemarketing program.pioneer was incorporated and had its principal place of business in iowa.it did not have any offices or employees in new jersey and was not licensed to do business in new jersey.id.at.american telephone telegraph company at t sued mci and pioneer in new jersey for allegedly wrongful conduct in making false or deceptive statements to at t customers and directing local companies to switch customers without their consent.during,pioneer made over seventy five million telephone calls for mci,two percent of approximately one and million made to new jersey residents.pioneer has no relationship with new jersey beyond the telemarketing calls made to new jersey residents at the direction of mci.ibid.pioneer sought dismissal of at t claims against it on the basis new jersey lacked jurisdiction.
the court concluded pioneer had sufficient minimum contacts with the state of new jersey and had purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within new jersey.at t,supra.the court rejected pioneer argument that its contacts with new jersey were relatively minor compared with the claims asserted by at t because only percent of the more than million calls made by pioneer had been to new jersey residents,only a small selection of at t sample of individuals allegedly victimized by misrepresentations or unauthorized telephone service switching had been sold by pioneer,and because the telephone calls were fortuitous because it was mci,not pioneer,which determined what numbers would be called.id.at.the at t court stated 
by comparing pioneer contacts with this state to the total number of telephone calls made on behalf of mci,pioneer turns the analysis away from the relevant issue.that issue is whether pioneer purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in this state.the simple fact of the matter is that pioneer made approximately one and million telephone calls to this state in an effort to solicit business for mci.these contacts were made in the course of implementing a nationwide telemarketing campaign for mci.
that only two percent of the seventy five million calls made by pioneer were made to new jersey residents does not detract from the nature and quality of those contacts.the telemarketing efforts of pioneer reached approximately one and million new jersey residences.the record indicates these calls involved a prolonged sales presentation in an effort to persuade new jersey residents to adopt mci as their long distance carrier.this lawsuit arises directly from those telecommunications.although pioneer may be subject to suit for misrepresentation in every state in which it conducted substantial telemarketing activities,i t is realistically possible that a defendant corporation may have the required minimum jurisdictional contacts with all fifty states resulting from its business activities.citation.at t,supra.
the at t court noted that adopting pioneer arguments would effectively immunize pioneer from liability for misrepresentations arising out of its telecommunications in any state other than its home forum,a result to be avoided.at t,supra.the court also noted that to the extent the telephone contacts benefited mci,they indirectly inured to the benefit of pioneer.id.at.the court
