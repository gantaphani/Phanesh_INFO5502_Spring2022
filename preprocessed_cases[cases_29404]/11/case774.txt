india breweries,ibi and miller brewing miller entered into a license agreement that would have permitted ibi to brew and distribute three beers in india.miller executives visited india to inspect two breweries ibi wanted to use to brew the beer and rejected them as unsanitary and lacking in equipment.miller refused to return to india to inspect more breweries until ibi assured it that the breweries had the minimum equipment necessary to brew miller beer.ibi brought suit for breach of contract,alleging that miller had a contractual duty to inspect any brewery it proffered and failed to act in good faith in refusing to make inspections.miller counterclaimed,alleging that ibi fraudulently induced it into entering the license agreement and misrepresented its financial status.the district court granted summary judgment to miller on ibi claims,and ibi appealed.miller belatedly agreed to dismiss its counterclaims with prejudice,giving us jurisdiction over the case,and we now affirm.
background 
ibi is a canadian company that acts as a virtual brewer it acquires rights to various beers and enlists or partners with other entities to actually brew and distribute the beers.in,ibi entered into a joint venture with indian brewery and distillery mohan meakin,mohan to brew and distribute beer in india.the joint venture company was known as international breweries,or ibp,and was incorporated in india.
in,ibi approached miller,the manufacturer of popular beers such as miller genuine draft,miller lite,and milwaukee best and at that time a company,to seek the rights to brew miller beer as part of the ibp joint venture.miller provided ibi with a list of the minimum equipment necessary for the production of its beers,and ibi informed miller that it and mohan planned to upgrade mohan brewery in delhi,india,to meet miller specifications.after some lengthy back and forth,miller and ibi entered into a formal license agreement on september.
ibi initially proposed manufacturing miller beer at two mohan breweries,one in delhi and one in madras chennai.miller sent a team of executives,headed by giorgio sega,its director of international operations,to inspect the two breweries in october,pursuant to paragraph of the license agreement,the pertinent language of which reads 
with respect to each brewery where a licensed beer is to be brewed,ibi after consultation with and inspection by miller will conduct or cause to be conducted commercial scale test brews of each recipe that is to be used at that brewery.prior to beginning commercial brewing of each licensed beer at the brewery in the territory,ibi will obtain miller written approval of the brewery and the licensed beer s made at that brewery.as defined herein,commercial brewing shall mean production of licensed beer s for sale.where brewing is to be performed by a sublicensee or a contract brewer,no such sublicensed or contract sic may take place unless miller has approved in writing the brewer,the brewery,the confidentiality protection relating thereto,and the terms of the brewing relationship 
sega concluded that both the delhi and madras breweries were rudimentary in technology and lacking minimum standards of process quality assurance basic food plant hygiene and good manufacturing practices.he advised ibi that it would probably take seven to ten months and significant capital outlays to upgrade the delhi and madras breweries.ibi ultimately concluded that rehabilitating the breweries would be impracticable,and began exploring other brewing options.
on january,ibi wrote to miller that it was seriously investigating the possibility of upgrading another brewery,artos,and was considering an unnamed brewery in western india.ibi provided miller with some of artos technical specifications at that time,and informed miller that it would be in touch to arrange an inspection visit o nce we have completed the purchase agreement.
no purchase agreement for artos was ever signed,and there is no evidence indicating that ibi formally requested an inspection of the facility,though it contends that it made several oral requests to that effect.instead,on march,ibi told miller that it had completed a purchase agreement for a brewery,rajasthan,the brewery in western india to which it had previously alluded.ibi maintains that it shifted its focus to rajasthan at miller request.in the march to miller,ibi emphasized that rajasthan was being purchased specifically for producing the miller brands so it is important that you approve the plant before we proceed any further.miller responded by forwarding ibi information about its brewing standards and the minimum equipment that would be required to meet them.in that response,sega also explained that he would schedule a visit to the rajasthan brewery only after receiving ibi assurance that systems equipment hygiene process and packaged product procedures and specifications can be met at your prospective brewer,and that there is a total commitment to purchase and install what is missing.ibi told miller it would forward the equipment guidelines to rajasthan brewmaster and would wait for him to make an assessment of the brewery before making arrangements for another miller inspection.
six months later,in september,ibi was still having problems finalizing the rajasthan deal.it wrote to miller and explained that it was now trying to enter into a contract brewing arrangement rather than a purchase agreement with rajasthan.under such an arrangement,rajasthan would remain independent and would brew beer for ibi or ibp pursuant to a negotiated contract.ibi noted that rajasthan was the best brewery in south asia according to ernst young,but nonetheless expressed some uncertainty as to whether it could meet miller standards.to that end,ibi further informed miller that it was in discussion with several other breweries in india in himachal pradesh,haryana,and karnatka states for contract brewing or purchase deals.it did not provide further details about those other as names or technical that time.
by november,ibi had not yet entered into a formal contract to purchase a brewery or otherwise produce beer in india.but ibp the joint venture had entered into two memoranda of understanding mous,one with rajasthan and another with one of the other breweries it referenced in september,him neel,pursuant to which it pledged to work in good faith toward purchasing assets from those breweries.both mous also envisaged contract brewing between ibp and the respective breweries,though the rajasthan arrangement was conditioned on the brewmaster approval and was never executed,and the him neel mou was by its terms neither a commitment nor binding.neither mou contemplated the terms of these possible contract brewing relationships.nevertheless,on november,ibi told miller that it had entered agreements with both rajasthan and him neel for the immediate production of miller beer.miller responded by asking ibi for copies of the contracts,as well as equipment lists for rajasthan and him neel.it also reminded ibi that an inspection of the breweries would be contingent upon the presence and operation of process equipment required for the production of miller brands and the ability to meet miller quality standards.
despite experiencing difficulty obtaining detailed equipment lists for breweries it did not own,ibi quickly procured and sent to miller some technical specifications for the rajasthan brewery.miller reviewed the specifications and concluded that rajasthan lacked necessary equipment.on november,miller told ibi that rajasthan was an unacceptable facility.sega reiterated this assessment in a december letter he sent to another miller executive,william berg.in that letter,sega stated that rajasthan lacked basic equipment we would require for high gravity and processing of any and all of our brands,as well as basic equipment we require to meet our packaging standards.since this equipment is lacking at rajasthan,i see no benefit i n visiting the brewery at this time.no equipment list is available for the him neel brewery,so there is no sense in visiting that plant either.
ibi eventually managed to secure the him neel equipment
