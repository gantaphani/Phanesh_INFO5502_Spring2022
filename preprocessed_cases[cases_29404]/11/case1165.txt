this case involves a class action claim that a telephone company offer of a free phone to anyone who signs up for its service is fraudulent to the extent the phone company charges the new subscriber sales tax on the retail value of each free phone.
the phone company demanded the plaintiffs claims be submitted to individual arbitration,pointing to the arbitration clause of the written agreement,which arbitration clause requires arbitration,but bars class actions.because this is an action invoking diversity of citizenship jurisdiction,the point to california contract law,which they claim renders both the arbitration clause and the class action waiver unconscionable,hence,unenforceable.
at first blush,it seems we decided the invalidity of an arbitration agreement banning class actions in shroyer new cingular wireless services,cir.but,the phone company points to a new wrinkle unlike the arbitration clause in shroyer,this arbitration clause provides for a premium payment of the jurisdictional limit of california small claims court if the arbitrator awards the customer an amount greater than the phone company last written settlement offer made before selection of an arbitrator.hence,says the phone company,the arbitration clause is not an artifice that has the practical effect of rendering it immune from individual claims.
we will find,on second blush,the new premium payment does not distinguish this case from shroyer,and that under california law,the present arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable.further,we will also find no merit to the phone company claim the federal arbitration act faa preempts california unconscionability law.
thus,we will affirm the district court order.
factual and procedural history 
in february,vincent and liza concepcion signed a wireless service agreement wsa with at t mobility at t for cellular phone service and the purchase of new cell phones.the concepcions received the cell phones without charge for the devices themselves because they agreed to a contract term.however,at t charged them total in sales tax for the two phones,calculated as of both phones full retail value.the concepcions continued to renew their wsa through the filing of this lawsuit.
the wsa included both an arbitration clause,which required any disputes to be submitted to arbitration,and a class action waiver clause,which required any dispute between the parties to be brought in an individual capacity.in december,at t revised the arbitration agreement to add a new premium payment clause.under this clause,at t will pay a customer if the arbitrator issues an award in favor of a california customer that is greater than at t last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was selected.
on march,before the premium payment clause was added,the concepcions filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of california.the concepcions alleged the practice of charging sales tax on a cell phone advertised as free was fraudulent.in september,the district court consolidated the concepcions case with the laster case,a putative class action addressing the same issues.in march,after the premium payment clause was added,at t filed a motion to compel the concepcion plaintiffs to submit their claims to individual arbitration under the revised arbitration agreement.the district court denied the motion.it held that the class waiver provision of the arbitration agreement is unconscionable under california law and that california unconscionability law is not preempted by the federal arbitration act.at t timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
a.at t class action waiver is unconscionable under california law.
the district court did not err when it held at t class action waiver was unconscionable under california law,and thus unenforceable.under the federal arbitration act,arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.it is that unconscionability is a generally applicable contract defense,which may render an arbitration provision unenforceable.shroyer,at internal citations omitted.
to be unenforceable under california law,a contract provision must be both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.id.at.procedural unconscionability generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,that is,a contract drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength and imposed on the other,without the opportunity to negotiate the terms.id at.substantive unconscionability focuses on overly harsh or contract terms.id.both elements of unconscionability need not be present to the same degree california courts use a the more substantively unconscionable the contract term,the less procedurally unconscionable it need be to be unenforceable and vice versa.id.at.
the california supreme court addressed the unconscionability of class action waivers in arbitration agreements for the first time in discover bank,cal th,d,holding that class action waivers were at least sometimes unconscionable under california law.d,at.class actions,the court reasoned,serve the important policy function of deterring and redressing wrongdoing,particularly where a company defrauds large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money id.at.class action waivers pose a problem because,small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.id.at.in this way,the class action waiver allows the company to insulate itself from liability for its wrongdoing and the policy behind class actions is thwarted.id.at.with this in mind,the discover bank court held 
when the class waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.
id.at internal quotations omitted.the reasoning behind this rule is pretty easy to grasp.as we explained in shroyer when the potential for individual gain is small,very few plaintiffs,if any,will pursue individual arbitration or litigation,which greatly reduces the aggregate liability a company faces when it has exacted small sums from millions of consumers.at.
we have interpreted discover bank as creating a test to determine whether a class action waiver in a consumer contract is unconscionable is the agreement a contract of adhesion are disputes between the contracting parties likely to involve small amounts of damages and is it alleged that the party with superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme deliberately to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.id.at.in shroyer,we noted that there are most certainly circumstances in which a class action waiver is unconscionable under california law despite the fact that all three parts of the discover bank test are not satisfied.id.because we hold that the class action waiver at issue satisfies all three parts of the test,as was true in shroyer,it is unnecessary to explore those circumstances here.id.
at t class action waiver is unconscionable under the discover bank test.
a.at t wsa is a contract of adhesion.
as we noted in shroyer,a contract of adhesion under california law is a standardized contract imposed on the subscribing party without an opportunity to negotiate the terms.id.the concepcions were given the standardized wsa without the opportunity to negotiate the terms.thus,
