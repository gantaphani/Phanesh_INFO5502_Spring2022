hih marine insurance services,hereafter hih insurance,appeals a summary judgment dismissing its subrogation action against a cargo handler,gateway freight services hereafter gateway.we affirm.
procedural and factual background 
the litigation arises from the shipment of packages of hard disk drives from malaysia to san francisco via china airlines.the shipper was a malaysian company,perai seagate storage products,and the ultimate consignee was its parent company,seagate technology seagate.the shipment was arranged by a freight forwarder with affiliates in malaysia and the united states doing business as dimerco express malaysia and dimerco express usa.
the dimerco companies had an business relationship with china airlines and had arranged for shipment of cargo on the airline thousands of times over the course of a decade or more.china airlines had provided dimerco with a stock of its air waybills,which the freight forwarder would fill out and execute for particular shipments.these air waybills consisted of a standard form,with spaces for handling instructions and declaration of value of the goods shipped.on the reverse side,the form had printed provisions limiting liability for damaged and lost cargo.the form had not changed for at least five years and represented the only documentation of the contract of carriage.in the shipment of the hard disk drives in question,the air waybill lists dimerco express malaysia as the shipper and dimerco express usa as the consignee.no handling instructions are set forth on the waybill other than to notify consignee upon arrival,and the notation nvd,a customary trade expression indicating no value declared,appears in the space for declared value for carriage.to document the shipment,dimerco express malaysia issued a cargo manifest attached to the waybill that identified seagate as the consignee and its american affiliate as the agent.
gateway operated a cargo handling facility in south san francisco outside the geographical limits of san francisco international airport and performed services for china airlines under a ground handling agreement.pursuant to this agreement,it took possession of cargo arriving at san francisco international airport on china airlines and arranged for delivery to consignees 
the shipment of hard disk drives left malaysia on december,and arrived in san francisco the next day.during shipment,dimerco express usa had arranged for the insurance of the cargo by hih insurance.upon its arrival in san francisco,gateway received and transported the cargo to its storage warehouse in south san francisco,where it was inventoried and placed on shelves to be held until the consignee,seagate,could take possession.gateway warehouse records show that all packages arrived at the warehouse,but before the cargo could be delivered to seagate,four of the packages were stolen.
approximately six weeks later,a company contacted seagate to complain about a defective hard disk drive,which turned out to be one of those stolen from the gateway warehouse.a police investigation disclosed that two individuals,lance lo and steve toma,were active in marketing the stolen disk drives.both were charged with possession of stolen property and pled guilty to the charges.neither lo nor toma had any known relationship with gateway,and the investigation did not reveal that any gateway employee was involved in the theft.
hih insurance determined its insured,dimerco express usa,was liable to seagate for the loss of the four packages of stolen hard disk drives.on august,it paid seagate the sum of on behalf of its insured as compensation for the loss.
on june,hih insurance filed a subrogation action against gateway,lance lo and steve toma to recover its payment of for the loss.after answering the complaint,gateway filed a motion for summary adjudication to determine that its liability could not exceed per kilogram under both the warsaw convention and the federal common law governing the limitation of liability provisions of the air waybill.the gross weight of the stolen cargo was kilograms.in an order filed september,the trial court granted the motion for summary adjudication but relied only on federal common law,ruling that the case was not governed by the warsaw convention.
subsequently,gateway filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that a settlement between hih insurance and the two individual defendants eliminated any potential exposure it might have.under the terms of the settlement,the individual defendants paid hih insurance the sum of as compensation for the loss.in an order filed december,the trial court granted the motion.the order found that gateway maximum liability to hih insurance could not exceed and since gateway was entitled to offset the settlement payment against this liability,its ultimate liability to hih insurance was reduced to zero.a judgment dismissing the complaint was entered on the order.
discussion 
legal background 
in the field of air carrier liability,the two alternative bodies of law limiting liability for lost warsaw convention and federal common closely enough related that precedents and policies from one have possible relevance to the other.therefore,we can best approach the federal common law issues raised in this appeal by first reviewing the trial court adjudication of the warsaw convention issues.
the warsaw convention is a treaty with the force of federal law that offers a scheme of presumptive air carrier liability for damaged goods combined with strict monetary limitation on this liability.jaycees patou,pier air.article of the warsaw convention limits the carrier liability for lost or damaged cargo to a sum in francs equivalent to per kilogram,unless the consignor has made a special declaration of the value at delivery and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires.the scope of this limitation is governed by the provisions of article that imposes a liability for loss or damage if the occurrence which caused the damage took place during the transportation by air.article defines transportation by air to comprise the period during which the baggage or goods are in charge of the carrier,whether in an airport or on board an aircraft 
in the present case,gateway relied on the theory that transportation by air included the period during which the carrier held the goods in storage at the point of destination while awaiting delivery to the consignee the theory found support in certain federal district court decisions,royal ins.amerford air cargo,and if the term airport was given a functional definition,it could be reconciled with language of article defining air transportation to include the period during which the goods are in charge of the carrier in an airport.the theory,however,had been rejected by a divided panel in victoria sales emery air freight,cir,which held that the term airport should be given a simple geographical interpretation.under this interpretation,the warsaw convention does not apply to loss or damage sustained outside the geographical borders of the airport.whatever may be the merits of victoria sales,the trial court properly regarded it as controlling federal authority,which precluded application of the warsaw convention.it is undisputed that the gateway warehouse lies outside the boundaries of the san francisco international airport.
contractual limitation of liability 
the alternative basis for limiting gateway liability is predicated on a provision on the reverse side of the china airlines air waybill,which establishes the same monetary limitation of liability as the warsaw convention.the pertinent language in this provision is found in paragraphs,and.
paragraph implicitly defines air carriage to include incidental services as used in this contract carrier means all air carriers that carry or undertake to carry the goods hereunder or perform any other services incidental to such air carriage emphasis added.paragraph provides that the carrier shall be liable for the goods during the period they are in its charge or the charge of its agent.paragraph first addresses carriage governed by the warsaw convention or rules of compensation promulgated by
