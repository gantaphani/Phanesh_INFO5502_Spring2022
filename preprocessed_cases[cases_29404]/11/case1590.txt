this is an appeal from the trademark trial and appeal board board involving the requirements for an internet specimen of use.michael sones appeals a final decision of the board denying his registration application for the mark one nation under god for charity bracelets.in re sones,serial,wl,opinion.because the board applied an incorrect legal standard to deny sones application,we vacate and remand.
background 
sones filed an application for his mark with the patent and trademark office pto under b.the board published it for opposition,and after the opposition period expired,issued a notice of allowance on august.on february,within six months of allowance as required by d,sones submitted his statement of use with a specimen of use.sones specimen consisted of the following two pages from a website 
the submitted webpages bear the title beaches chapel school store and contain a product listing,one nation under god charity bracelet for.under the listing,the following text appears one nation under god,charity bracelet,choice of blue or red each.the pages also display shopping cart functionality for online ordering,including buttons for view cart and add to cart.next to the description is a shaded,square graphic that says only,photo not availble sic.
the pto rejected sones statement of use in a office action on june,noting that sones specimen does not show a picture of the goods in close proximity to the mark.trademark appl.serial,office action,at june.the office action informed sones that he could submit a substitute specimen to cure this defect.sones submitted rebuttal arguments,but did not submit a picture of his charity bracelets or a new textual description,apparently because he did not possess such a specimen of use prior to the filing date of his statement of use,as required by b.see oral arg.at,available at http.on july,the pto issued a final office action affirming the rejection over sones arguments.
sones appealed to the board.the board affirmed,echoing the examiner objections to sones specimen of use upon examination of the webpages,it is readily apparent that they do not include a picture of the goods.opinion at sones appealed according to a,and we have jurisdiction under a b.
discussion 
we review the board conclusions of law de novo and affirm its findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence.in re thrifty.
a trademark owner uses a mark to identify and distinguish his or her goods,including a unique product,from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods,even if that source is unknown.see also bellsouth datanational,the primary function of a trademark is to identify and distinguish the goods or services of one source from those sold by all others.to ensure that the applicant uses the mark in commerce for these purposes,the pto requires the applicant to submit a specimen of use showing the mark as used on or in connection with the goods.a.
sones argues that the board imposed a rule that a trademark specimen of use taken from a website must contain a picture.at oral argument,the court asked the pto counsel,is the patent office saying that for every internet marketing use you have to have a picture counsel eventually responded,we would say no.see oral arg.at.but the office actions,the board opinion,and the pto appeal brief belie counsel answer.in the first office action,the examiner cited the rule that a web catalog or webpage specimen is acceptable to show trademark use as a display associated with the goods only if it includes a picture of the relevant goods.see trademark manual of examining procedure tmep a b ed noting that examining attorneys should accept any catalog or similar specimen as a display associated with the goods,provided it includes a picture of the relevant goods.the examiner then followed this rule,stating that sones web catalog does not show a picture of the goods in close proximity to the mark.in fact,the specimen does not show a picture of the mark at all.trademark appl.serial,office action,at june.the final office action was more adamant about a picture requirement.the examiner the rule stated in the first office action,emphasizing that a display is acceptable only if it includes a picture of the relevant goods.trademark appl.serial,final office action,at july,emphases in original.the examiner then concluded that t he specimen of record does not contain a picture of the goods and thus is unacceptable as showing use of the goods in commerce.id.at emphasis added.
the board opinion followed the rule stated in the office actions.while it mentioned the inadequacy of sones textual description of his charity bracelets,the board noted that the purported ubiquitousness of charity bracelets does not obviate the requirement for a picture of applicant particular charity bracelets.opinion at.it then concluded that sones failed to satisfy the criteria that the specimen include a picture of the relevant goods and show the mark sufficiently near the picture of the goods to associate the mark with the goods.id.at.
the pto briefing to this court is to like effect.the pto briefly notes that the information in sones specimen would be insufficient to show use in commerce,contending that t he web pages do not contain even a single line of text to distinguish the source of the goods.pto br.otherwise,the pto arguments focus exclusively on the specimen lack of a picture,id.at sones argues that a photo of the goods in relation to the proposed mark is not required for a display specimen sones is mistaken.the pto also interprets the tmep as indicating that the webpage must show the goods,not merely list them,as sones has done.id.in sum,the pto position has been consistent from prosecution up to oral argument in this appeal a website specimen of use must have a picture of the goods.
the pto finds support for this rule in lands end,manback.in lands end,the district court addressed a specimen of use from a mail order catalog.lands end applied to register the mark ketch for purses.the company submitted a specimen that consisted of a page of its catalog that showed the picture of a purse,a verbal description,and the term ketch.id.at.the pto examiner and board rejected the specimen for failing to qualify as a display associated with the goods.in response,lands end filed a civil action in district court.in a brief opinion,the court concluded that lands end use of the term ketch with the picture of the purse and corresponding description constitutes a display associated with the goods.id.at.it observed that the catalog pages include a picture and a description of each item.id.at.the court decision,however,turned on the point of sale nature of this display,which allowed a customer to make a decision to purchase by filling out the sales form and sending it in.id.at.
afterwards,the pto interpreted and adopted lands end in the tmep,creating a new section specifically for catalogs as specimens.see tmep,instructions regarding revision ed see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy.this section defined the new test for catalogs,citing lands end 
in accordance with this decision,examining attorneys should accept any catalog or similar specimen as a display associated with the goods,provided that it includes a picture of the relevant goods,it includes the mark sufficiently near the picture of the goods to associate the mark with the goods,and it includes information necessary to order the goods.any form of advertising which satisfies these criteria should be construed as a display associated with the goods.
id.a emphases added.this test still appears in the latest version of the tmep,h ed.
the pto has since applied this test and lands end to electronic specimens of use.in in re hydron technologies,the board found that a television infomercial that displayed the trademarked slogan,with the goods shown immediately before or immediately after,was an acceptable specimen,wl may.it cited lands end for the importance of the proximity between the pictures of the goods in the catalog and the mark,but also noted that the infomercial provided a point of sale beca
