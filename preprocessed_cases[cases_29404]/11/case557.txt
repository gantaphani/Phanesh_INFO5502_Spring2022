this appeal involves the proper construction of the hanging paragraph in a,which was added to the bankruptcy code code by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa.under the code,a lien creditor generally holds a secured claim only to the extent of the present value of the collateral that the lien encumbers.if the amount of the secured claim exceeds the present value of the collateral,the code treats the excess amount as a separate,unsecured claim.this process is known as bifurcation or stripping down the secured claim to the value of the collateral.the hanging paragraph is an exception to this general rule,preventing bifurcation of a claim when the creditor has a security interest securing the claimed debt in a motor vehicle acquired for the debtor personal use within days of the debtor bankruptcy filing.the issue here is whether the security interest exception contained in the hanging paragraph applies to those portions of a claim attributable to the of negative equity in a vehicle,gap insurance,and an extended warranty.the district court found that it does.we affirm.
the facts of this case are undisputed.debtor rebecca ann dale purchased a ford truck from gullo ford mercury of conroe,texas.the vehicle was for her personal use and had a cash price of.ford motor credit company,llc ford financed the sale under a retail sales contract sales contract and retained a security interest in the vehicle to secure the unpaid balance of the total sale price.
as part of the transaction,dale traded in a ford expedition.that vehicle had a negative equity,with dale owing more on the vehicle than its value as required by texas law,ford paid off this negative equity before accepting dale and included the sum in the new vehicle total sale price the total sale price also included a gap insurance premium of taxes not included in the cash price totaling fees totaling and an extended warranty charge of.dale financed this entire amount totaling through ford at interest.
dale filed for bankruptcy less than one year later and submitted a chapter reorganization plan.of the still owed under the sales contract,dale chapter plan proposed to pay ford over months at interest.under dale proposal,the remaining amount owed to ford would be paid with other unsecured claims.ford objected to this plan and filed a proof of claim in the amount of,secured by the.the bankruptcy court declined to approve dale chapter plan and sustained ford objection in part.the court ruled that ford security interest did not extend to those portions of the vehicle loan attributable to the of negative equity,the gap insurance premium,and the extended warranty charge.the court deemed these portions of the loan unsecured.
on appeal,the district court reversed.the court held that ford had a security interest in the entire sales contract,including those portions attributable to negative equity,gap insurance,and the extended warranty.dale challenges that conclusion in this appeal.
ii.discussion 
the proper scope of the hanging paragraph presents a legal question,which we review de novo.in re sewell,cir.we must decide whether the code hanging paragraph applies to the portion of a secured claim attributable to the of a vehicle negative equity,gap insurance,and an extended warranty.
while bankruptcy courts across the country have divided on this issue,see in re graupner,cir collecting cases,three circuit courts and a state highest court on certified question have recently weighed in on the debate,uniformly holding that the hanging paragraph prevents bifurcation of vehicle loans,including those portions attributable to negative equity.see in re price,cir hanging paragraph prevents bifurcation of portions of claim attributable to negative equity and gap insurance graupner,at hanging paragraph prevents bifurcation of portions of claim attributable to negative equity in re ford,cir hanging paragraph prevents bifurcation of portions of claim attributable to negative equity in re peaslee,on certified question from the second circuit hanging paragraph prevents bifurcation of portions of claim attributable to negative equity we adopt this emerging majority position for the reasons explained below.
statutory scheme 
the hanging paragraph was enacted as part of the bapcpa.prior to the enactment of the bapcpa,the code allowed a chapter debtor to modify the rights of a secured creditor with a security interest in a vehicle by bifurcating the claim into secured and unsecured portions based on the vehicle value.a,a.section a of the code provides in relevant part 
an allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor interest in the estate interest in such property and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor interest is less than the amount of such allowed claim.
under this provision,a creditor with a claim secured by a vehicle with a present market value of would have a secured claim of and an unsecured claim of.under a chapter plan,the secured claim would be paid in full with interest,while the unsecured claim would be paid with other unsecured claims.use of in this manner is known as bifurcation and cramdown because the secured claim is reduced to the present value of the collateral,while the remainder of the debt becomes unsecured,forcing the secured creditor to accept less than the full value of its claim.see in re wright,cir discussing the effect of cramdown on the secured creditor ability to recover the full value of its claim.before the enactment of the bapcpa,this cramdown provision had a pernicious effect on car dealers it forced them to sustain a deficiency loss on the unsecured portion of the claim,while also forcing them to wait for payout on a loan balance,with all the attendant risks of default that accompanied the original loan.in re sanders,rev.
in apparent response to the undesirable effects of this cramdown on car dealers,congress enacted the hanging paragraph as part of the bapcpa.that provision eliminates bifurcation and cramdown in value if the vehicle was purchased within days of the filing of the bankruptcy petition,and if the creditor has a security interest securing the debt that is the subject of the claim.as relevant here the provision reads 
section allowing bifurcation and cramdown shall not apply to a claim if the creditor has a purchase money security interest securing the debt that is the subject of the claim,the debt was incurred within the sic preceding the date of the filing of the petition,and the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle as defined in section of title acquired for the personal use of the debtor.
a.under the hanging paragraph,a creditor with a claim secured by a vehicle with a present market value of would avoid bifurcation and cramdown under and instead retain a secured claim in the entire purchase price of the vehicle.
proper scope of the hanging paragraph 
in this case,it is undisputed that dale incurred her debt within days of filing for bankruptcy,that this debt was secured by a motor vehicle,and that dale acquired this vehicle for her personal use.thus,the sole issue is whether ford has a security interest securing that portion of the debt attributable to negative equity,gap insurance,and the extended warranty.
ford urges,and the district court held,that the plain and unambiguous meaning of security interest coupled with the hanging paragraph pertinent legislative history is sufficient to resolve this issue.statutory construction,of course,begins with the plain language of the statute.barnhart sigmon coal,d.but the phrase security interest does not have an ordinary or generally understood meaning rather,it is a term of art.the phrase is used in only one other place in the code,see f,and the code itself does not provide a definition.in short,the plain text of the hanging paragraph is insufficient to resolve this appeal.
because the code does not define security interest and that term does not have a common ordinary meaning,we agree with the great majority of courts to address this issue that state ucc law must be used to de
