the wind tower trade coalition appellant or the coalition,a group of domestic manufacturers of utility scale wind towers,appeals the decision of the united states court of international trade cit denying its motions for preliminary injunctions.see wind tower trade coal.united states,d.int l trade.this court affirms.
background 
after receiving petitions filed by the coalition,the united states department of commerce commerce initiated antidumping and countervailing duty investigations covering utility scale wind towers subject merchandise from the people republic of china china and an antidumping investigation covering subject merchandise from the socialist republic of vietnam vietnam.the antidumping and countervailing duty require commerce and the united states international trade commission itc to conduct parallel investigations to determine whether the application of one or both of these remedial duties is warranted.
pursuant to a and a,the itc issued a preliminary injury determination that there was a reasonable indication of threat of material injury to a domestic industry by reason of imports of subject merchandise from china and vietnam.commerce then issued a preliminary affirmative countervailing duty determination with respect to imports of subject merchandise from china and preliminary affirmative antidumping duty determinations with respect to imports of subject merchandise from china and vietnam.based on these determinations,and pursuant to the provisional measures requirements of d and d,commerce instructed the united states customs and border protection customs to suspend liquidation of all entries of subject merchandise that were entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the dates of commerce preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations.the instructions also required cash deposits for the entries based on the preliminary duty margins commerce calculated in its preliminary determinations.
commerce then made final affirmative determinations,after which the itc issued its final affirmative determination in an vote,three negative votes and three affirmative votes.utility scale wind towers from china and vietnam,itc,final injury determination itc determination.under the divided vote provision of,the itc split vote constituted an affirmative determination.if the commissioners voting on a determination by the itc are evenly divided as to whether the determination should be affirmative or negative,the itc shall be deemed to have made an affirmative determination.however,of the six commissioners on the investigation panel,three commissioners voted entirely in the negative,finding neither material injury nor threat of injury,two determined that the domestic wind tower industry had suffered present material injury,and a third determined that the domestic industry was threatened with material injury,but that the domestic industry would not have suffered material injury in the absence of the provisional measures.itc determination at.

appellant challenged commerce application of the special rule before the cit and sought temporary restraining orders tro and preliminary injunctions to enjoin commerce from ordering the termination of the suspension of liquidation and the refund of cash deposits and enjoin customs during the pendency of the litigation before the cit,including any subsequent remands and appeals,from discontinuing the suspension of liquidation and refunding the cash deposits.wind tower trade,d at.the cit initially denied appellant applications because it found appellant had not made an adequate showing of likelihood of success on the merits.id.appellant submitted a supplemental response further explaining its position on its likelihood of success.the cit then entered tros to provide the appellees an opportunity to respond to appellant motions.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
of the appellees,siemens energy,siemens alone challenges this court jurisdiction the coalition interlocutory appeal of the cit order,and its case as a whole,may be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,lack of standing,and lack of appellate jurisdiction.appellee siemens br.emphasis added.siemens bases its challenge on d,which provides 
when any judge of the cit,in issuing any other interlocutory order,includes in the order a statement that a controlling question of law is involved with respect to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from that order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,this court may,in its discretion,permit an appeal to be taken from such order emphasis added.siemens contends this appeal does not meet these criteria.siemens also acknowledges,however,that t his court previously has assumed jurisdiction over appeals of interlocutory orders pertaining to injunctions from the cit,relying on c.appellee siemens br.
in american signature,united states,for example,this court exercised jurisdiction over a case in which the cit denied a motion for a preliminary injunction.this court expressly stated that jurisdiction was proper under c,which provides that this court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from an interlocutory order or decree described in subsection a in any case over which the court would have jurisdiction of an appeal under section of this title.section a provides that this court has exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of the cit.section a,however,specifies that 
the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from i nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states,the united states district court for the district of the canal zone,the district court of guam,and the district court of the virgin islands,or of the judges thereof,granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.
because this subsection does not specify the cit,siemens argues that only those appeals from interlocutory orders that meet the criteria of d,the subsection that specifically references the cit,can be heard by this court.
contrary to siemens arguments,this court has held that a,c,and in conjunction confer jurisdiction upon this court over appeals of interlocutory orders issued by the cit granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions.a see,foods,united states,stating,in an appeal from the cit,p ursuant to c,this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from interlocutory orders described in section a,which include orders granting injunctive relief.under our precedent,this court has jurisdiction under c.
ii.standard of review 
the governing standard of review on appeal of a grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is abuse of discretion.am.signature,at citing titan tire case new holland.an abuse of discretion may be established under federal circuit law by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors or exercised its discretion based on an error of law or clearly erroneous fact finding.qingdao taifa grp.united states,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.to the extent a court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction hinges on questions of law,this court review is de novo.steel car,canadian pac.
iii.legal framework 
standard for preliminary injunctions 
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,d citations omitted.as observed by the cit,i n antidumping and countervailing duty cases preliminary injunctions against liquidation have become almost automatic due to the retrospective nature of trade remedies,the length of the judicial review process,and the cruciality of unliquidated entries for judicial review.wind tower trade,d at citing a zenith radio united states,skf usa,united states,the zenith rule renders a court action moot once liquidation occurs.qingdao taifa,at.
however,a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.winter,at citing munaf geren,d see also qingdao taifa,at noting the supreme court emphasis on the importance of the likelihood of success in the preliminary injunction calculus in munaf,at.therefore,even if a party establishes that it will be irreparably harmed,the party must also demonstrate that it has at least a fair chance of success on the merits for a preliminary injunction to be appropriate.qingdao taifa,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
itc injury determinations 
in parallel investigations,commerce investigates the extent to which foreign imports are dumped,sold or likely to be sold in the united states at less than fair value or subsidized by a foreign government,while the itc investigates whether the domestic industry has been materially injured,or threatened with material injury,as a result of the foreign imports.if both commerce and the itc make preliminary affirmative determinations,provisional measures take effect,which suspend liquidation and require cash deposits for entries of merchandise covered by the investigation.id.d,d.if commerce and the itc then make affirmative final determinations at the conclusion of their respective investigations,the statute directs commerce to publish antidumping countervailing duty orders.id.a,a.in such orders,commerce specifies the effective date of the the duty orders apply retrospectively to the entries that were suspended,or the orders apply prospectively from the date of publication of the final itc determination.
pursuant to b and b the effective date depends on the nature of the itc determination,which will lead to the application of either the general rule or the special rule collectively,the rules.the rules are as follows 
general rule 
if the itc,in its final determination finds material injury or threat of material injury which,but for the suspension of liquidation would have led to a finding of material injury,then entries of the subject merchandise,the liquidation of which has been suspended,shall be subject to the imposition of duties 
special rule 
if the itc,in its final determination finds threat of material injury,other than threat of material injury described in paragraph,then subject merchandise which is entered,or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of notice of an affirmative determination of the itc shall be subject to the assessment or imposition of duties,and customs shall release any bond or other security,and refund any cash deposit made.
id.b,b providing parallel rules for countervailing and antidumping duties,respectively.in other words,the general rule applies if the itc makes an affirmative finding of present material injury,or a finding of a threat of material injury that would have been a finding of present material injury in the absence of the provisional measures,a finding that but for the suspension of liquidation,the itc would have concluded that the domestic industry is materially injured.id.under this rule,duties are collected retrospectively on subject merchandise that entered the united states during the course of the investigation.on the other hand,the special rule applies if the itc finds that the industry is threatened with material injury,but there would not be present material injury in the absence of the provisional measures.id.under this rule,commerce orders are effective prospectively from the publication date of the itc final determination and provisional cash deposits are refunded.
the statutes do not explicitly address which of the rules applies to the fragmented itc voting pattern presented in this case,an affirmative determination comprising three negative votes and three affirmative votes,with two commissioners voting for material injury and one voting for threat with a negative but for finding.the cit,however,addressed this voting pattern in mbl usa united states.int l trade,where commerce applied the general rule based on its interpretation of b.the cit reviewed commerce interpretation of b under the second prong of chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and determined that the interpretation was unreasonable because commerce was effectively ignoring the three negative votes,and focusing only on the three affirmative votes.mbl.at.the cit found it unreasonable that two votes for and four votes against material injury during the period could justify retroactive application of the duties.therefore,the cit reversed commerce determination,holding that the special rule applies to this particular voting pattern.
here,expressly noting the holding of mbl,commerce applied the special rule,making the orders effective prospectively.because the cit did not find that appellant challenge based on commerce application of the special rule was likely to succeed on the merits,it denied the coalition motions for preliminary injunctions.appellant argues that the cit erred in this regard.
iv.likelihood of success of the merits 
in response to appellant contention that commerce erred in applying the special rule,the cit stated that it was persuaded that this issue is just not winnable.wind tower trade,d at.when a court examines the lawfulness of commerce statutory interpretations,it employs the test established in chevron.at.the court first examines whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,and if so,the agency and the court must comply with congress clear intent.id.at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,a analysis is warranted,under which the court must determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.to determine whether commerce interpretation is reasonable,the court may look to the express terms of the provisions at issue,the objectives of those provisions,and the objectives of the antidumping scheme as a whole.wheatland tube united states,quoting nsk united states,d.int l trade.
relying on chevron,the cit found,b eginning from the premise that congress did not address the specific itc voting pattern presented here,it is not difficult to sustain commerce interpretation of sections b and b as a reasonable construction of the statute to which the court must defer.wind tower,d at.the cit properly held it was reasonable for commerce to consider all of the itc commissioners votes not just the affirmative votes under the second prong of chevron.
appellant argues that the cit should not have moved beyond chevron first prong because the plain language of the statute is clear that the general rule applies to the voting pattern at issue.to appellant,as the text of the statute makes clear,the special rule is only applicable when the itc makes a final determination of threat of material injury.appellant br.id.at t he special rule is not applicable in circumstances where only one commissioner has made an affirmative finding of threat of material injury with a correspondin
