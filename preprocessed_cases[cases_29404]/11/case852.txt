williams,the manufacturer of mortal kombat and other video games,brought suit for fraud and related misconduct,federal and state illinois law governs the state law claims,against two of its components suppliers,arrow and milgray.national union,williams insurer,joined as a plaintiff,but need not be discussed separately.williams charges the suppliers with,among other things,having bribed one of its buyers,greg barry,to buy from them.williams also named as a defendant james garrity,a salesman for arrow.milgray counterclaimed.it charged that williams had conspired with two of milgray employees,gnat and slupik against whom milgray filed,to defraud milgray by purchasing components from a company named microcomp that gnat and slupik had created and were operating in violation of their duty to their employer.
the jury returned a verdict for williams against garrity for but exonerated the other defendants.the judge then rejected williams equitable claims.williams does milgray,because the judge rejected its claims against williams,gnat,and slupik.we discuss williams claims first.
barry received more than in cash bribes from arrow and milgray over a period during which these two suppliers sold williams some million in component parts.eventually williams discovered barry and fired him.the company may have been careless in failing to discover the bribes sooner it may even have known about the bribes but not cared because it thought it was getting a good price and excellent service from arrow and milgray.that is a matter of fierce dispute but williams does admit being aware that some of its suppliers,not limited to arrow and milgray,were giving gift certificates ranging from to to its employees at christmas time.williams had no policy against its employees accepting christmas gifts,provided that any gift in excess of was disclosed to and approved by a company audit board,except that buyers such as barry were forbidden to accept any gift,period.the cash bribes received by barry were not considered by either donor or recipient to be christmas gifts.
commercial bribery is a garden variety of fraud,ash wallenmeyer,appeal after remand,ash,cir see ginsburg united states,cir walker marshall field,here consisting of the suppliers concealing from williams the fact that they were bribing its buyer.the judge gave a standard fraud instruction.it required the jury to find that williams had justifiably relied on the facts known to it in continuing to purchase from arrow and in other words that williams had known about the bribes.at the request of the defendants,however,the judge also gave instructions on the affirmative defenses of ratification and in pari delicto.he instructed the jury that if williams had known or should have known of the defendants bribing barry,it should find that williams had ratified the fraud and could not recover damages.and likewise if williams had been in pari delicto equally at fault with the defendants,which it would be,the judge told the jury,if williams either was aware of a general practice of bribery of its buyers by its suppliers or knew or was recklessly indifferent to the fact that greg barry was soliciting accepting kickbacks from williams vendors.the jury found that williams had proved fraud,in accordance with the instruction on fraud,but also found that the corporate defendants garrity did not assert these defenses had proved both affirmative defenses and so arrow and milgray were exonerated.
the instructions on the affirmative defenses were erroneous at a quite fundamental level.as countless cases affirm,a victim negligence is not a defense to an intentional tort,such as fraud.chapman hosek,d,ty softbelly,cir eastern trading refco,cir in re mercer,cir.for that matter,it is no longer a complete defense to an unintentional tort,having been replaced by the partial defense of comparative negligence,spinozzi itt sheraton,cir alvis ribar.that should have been a clue as to how the law would treat the victim negligence in the setting of an intentional tort.yet by instructing the jury that it should return a verdict for the defendants if it found that williams should have known that barry was taking bribes,the judge allowed the jury to exonerate the defendants on the basis of the carelessness of their victim in failing to discover that it was a victim.
the error was compounded by a misunderstanding of the legal meaning of ratification.had williams after discovering barry decided that it was on the whole beneficial to williams maybe because it allowed williams to pay him a lower salary,and had decided not to fire him or otherwise discipline him,that would be ratification,much as if a restaurant owner decided after discovering that his headwaiter was accepting tips in order to seat patrons to condone the practice still common,especially in nightclubs.state brewer.or as if barry,as williams agent,had made an unauthorized transaction on williams behalf that williams,after discovering the transaction,had decided was in its interest after all,and so it would retain the benefits of it,eastern trading refco,supra,at hurd wildman,harrold,allen and dixon,d,progress printing jane byrne political committee,d.obviously it could retain the profits of the transaction but shuck off the costs on the ground that it had never authorized the transaction and therefore was bound by it.see extra equipamentos e exportação ltda.case,cir.
but that is the defendants theory.it is that williams knew all along about barry.if so,this would exonerate the defendants,all right,because it would mean there had been no fraud in the first place,not that the fraud had been washed away by ratification.no ratification instruction should have been given,let alone one that misstated the law by supposing that ratification can be premised on a careless accident.
the defense of in pari delicto is intended for situations in which the victim is a participant in the misconduct giving rise to his claim,pinter dahl,d crawford colby broadcasting,cir,as in the classic case of the highwayman who sued his partner for an accounting of the profits of the robbery they had committed together.note,the highwayman case,everet williams ex.byron clay,cir see also cisna sheibley.it has been extended to the not by the in pari delicto defense asserted by arrow and milgray but by the separate in pari delicto defense asserted by which each party is accused of having wronged the other milgray,as we see,claims that williams committed fraud against it at the same time that it was committing fraud against williams.
that is not the character of the in pari delicto defense that arrow and milgray asserted jointly against williams.clause of the instruction knew or was recklessly indifferent to the fact that greg barry was soliciting accepting kickbacks from williams vendors barred williams from recovering against either defendant if the jury found that williams knew that,or was recklessly indifferent to whether,barry was taking bribes.this part of the instruction did define a defense distinct from ratification,but merely repeated in different words the instruction on ratification,except that for negligence it properly substituted reckless indifference,which the law treats for most purposes including this one the same as knowledge,vigortone ag products,pm ag products,cir,illinois tool works,cir.clause was aware of a general practice of bribery of its buyers by its suppliers likewise repeated the defense of ratification in the guise of in pari delicto as if it helps a jury to have instructions translated into latin,but reinjected negligence as a basis for barring williams by suggesting that williams knowledge of a general practice,presumably a reference to the christmas gifts,should have alerted it to the possibility that barry was taking big bribes.
apart from the fact that the two instructions were at once erroneous and confusingly overlapping,they made a confusing with the instruction on prima facie fraud.the jury found that williams had been justified in relying on the facts known to it,yet how could it find that and at the same time find that williams both had ratified the fraud and had been equally at fault with the defendants there is a possible path,as we about to see,but we can have no confidence that it is the one the jury actually took.
so williams is entitled to a new trial on not,as it urges,to a judgment based on the jury finding of prima facie fraud.the jury may have based its findings of ratification and equal fault simply on negligence by instructions would have permitted which event williams would be entitled to a judgment.but,again given the confusing medley of instructions,we can not have any confidence that that was the jury thought process.
the separate in pari delicto instruction that the judge gave with respect to milgray claim against williams and its former employees required the jury to bring in a verdict for milgray if it found as it did that williams,acting through its agent barry,knowingly participated in slupik gnat unlawful diversion of business from milgray to microcomp.remember that gnat and slupik were employees of milgray who formed a company that sold components to williams in competition with milgray.this instruction did not commit the error of injecting the issue of the victim negligence into an case,but it had no basis in law,because it required no showing that williams benefited from,or even knew anything about,gnat and slupik conduct.all the instruction required the jury to find was that williams was acting through its agent barry,which we take to mean,and which the jury probably understood to mean as well,nothing more than that barry was williams agent.
barry doubtless harmed milgray by buying from microcomp,and milgray could sue him for that harm.but the fact that barry was bribed not only by milgray,to milgray benefit,but also by two employees of milgray,to milgray detriment,does not establish fault on the part of williams.an agent knowledge is not imputed to his principal when the agent is acting adversely to the principal,ash,supra,at lease resolution larney,d,as barry was.i n general when an agent acts entirely on his own behalf,doing things that could not possibly be interpreted as the merely overzealous or performance of his duties as agent,he is acting outside the scope of the agency and the principal is not bound.hartmann prudential ins.of america,cir emphasis in original.it is not as if gnat and slupik fraud benefited williams.it made milgray another victim,along with williams itself,of barry fraud it did not make williams equally at fault with barry.lawyers title ins.dearborn title,cir.the instruction was an example of blaming the victim,with a vengeance.
williams might be liable to milgray under one theory or another,but it was not a participant in the fraud against milgray,especially when we consider that,so far as appears,williams lost,and milgray on balance benefited,from barry conduct.the only fault of williams mentioned by the instruction is barry the jury was not asked to find that williams authorized or ratified barry conduct or even that it was negligent in failing to prevent it.
the defendants argue that if we reverse the judgment in their favor,damages should be capped at,the amount of the verdict against garrity,the arrow salesman who bribed barry on arrow behalf.it happens that that was the amount of the bribes that garrity paid.but it corresponds neither to the damages that williams may have sustained as a result of garrity bribing barry and remember that milgray as well as arrow bribed him nor to the profits that the defendants may have made from the bribery by overcharging williams,though the bribes might as we see be a estimate of the damages that arrow,garrity arrow on williams.the figure is a token of the jury confusion and an unreliable guide to either williams total loss or the defendants gain.
we have mentioned the defendants gain as well as williams loss because in addition to seeking damages for the fraud perpetrated upon it,williams asked the judge to impose a constructive trust in its favor on the profits that the defendants had made from their bribery.the victim of commercial bribery,who usually as here is the principal of an agent who was bribed,can obtain by way of remedy either the damages that he has sustained the damages remedy or the profits that the bribe yielded the restitution or unjust enrichment remedy.dan dobbs,dobbs law of remedies,ed.the total profits would consist of the bribe itself received by barry,of course,not by garrity or arrow,plus the revenue that the bribe generated for the briber,minus the cost of goods sold and any other variable costs incurred in making the sales that generated that revenue.see hill names addresses,d,taylor meirick,cir.
commercial bribery is a deliberate tort,and one way to deter it is to make it worthless to the tortfeasor by stripping away all his gain,since if his gain exceeded the victim loss a damages remedy would leave the tortfeasor with a profit from his act.id.at.the amount of the bribe paid is of course not a profit to the briber,but an expense,and it should not enter into the net profit calculation sketched above.it can be used as a minimum estimate of damages,however,on the theory that no one would pay a bribe who did anticipate garnering net additional revenue at least equal to the amount of the bribe and that additional revenue is,at least as a first approximation,an additional expense to the person whose agent was bribed.continental management,united states,donemar,molloy.arrow presumably jacked up its prices to williams by at least to cover the cost of the bribes that it was paying barry to swing business its way,as otherwise it would have lost rather than made money from bribing him.the implication is that had it not been for the bribes,arrow prices to williams would have been at least lower.so that amount is a minimum estimate of the loss to williams caused by arrow bribing barry.
restitution is available in any case in which the tortfeasor has made a profit that exceeds the victim damages if the damages exceed the profit,the plaintiff will prefer to seek damages instead,whether or not the tort involved a breach of fiduciary duty,roberts sears,roebuck,cir fraud cross berg lumber,douglas laycock,the scope and significance of restitution,though commercial bribery normally will involve such a breach.the only thing that turns on the precise character of the defendant wrongdoing is,in some cases,the availability of equitable as distinct from legal restitution.just as damages can be obtained either in a suit at law,or,in an equity suit,under the clean up doctrine,may stores federal ins,cir medtronic,intermedics,cir vowell fairfield bay community club,clark teeven holding,or by the imposition of a constructive trust on moneys wrongfully withheld from the plaintiff,may stores federal ins,supra,at stores.associates health welfare plan wells,cir,or by surcharging a trustee for the losses that he has caused to the trust,restatement second of trusts a john langbein,what erisa means by equitable the supreme court trail of error in russell,mertens,and,colum,so restitution,too,can be awarded in either a suit at law or a suit in equity.life annuity ins.knudson,d sec lipson,cir health cost controls of illinois,washington,cir reich continental casualty,cir.if as in this case the wrong consists of a breach of fiduciary kind of breach traditionally actionable in suits in equity fiduciary obligations were an invention of the english chancery court,in re estate of karmey,per curiam beckman farmer,austin wakeman scott william franklin fratcher,the law of trusts ed the usual form that restitution takes is to impress a constructive trust on the profits of wrongdoing,with the defendant the trustee and the plaintiff,of course,the beneficiary.health cost controls of illinois,washington,supra,at chicago park district kenroy,village of wheeling stavros,d.
but if all that the plaintiff is seeking is a sum of money equal to the defendant profit,an order of restitution will do fine,life annuity ins.knudson,supra,at,and the device of a constructive trust is surplus the device comes into its own only when the plaintiff is seeking title to specific property in the defendant hands.which means,by the way,that the imposition of a constructive trust can be sought as an equitable remedy for a legal as well as an equitable wrong on both points see health cost controls of illinois,washington,supra,at also frederickson blumenthal,d,just as,in a suit for damages for breach of contract,the court can order an equitable accounting if the computation of damages involves complexities that would baffle a jury.kirby lake shore michigan southern.for completeness,we note that when restitution is sought in a law case and the plaintiff is not seeking to impress a lien on particular property,but just wants an award of profits,he can not obtain a constructive trust,because there is no res that is,no fund or other specific piece of property for the trust to attach to.life annuity ins.knudson,supra,at.people ex rel.hartigan candy club,d,dobbs,supra.he can still get restitution in such a case,but as a legal remedy for a legal wrong,not as an equitable remedy for a legal or an equitable wrong.
williams situation was in between.it was not seeking to impose a lien on particular property,so it had no basis for seeking a constructive trust.but the wrong for which it was seeking a remedy properly described as restitution,or,what is synonymous as a practical matter,an accounting for profits,life annuity ins.knudson,supra,at.people ex rel.hartigan candy club,supra,at dobbs,supra,rather than as the imposition of a constructive trust was an equitable wrong,a breach of fiduciary obligation,and so williams was entitled to seek equitable restitution.and therefore it could seek legal damages from a jury and then,if it thought it could obtain a larger recovery by way of restitution,an order of restitution from the judge,since equitable remedies are determined by judges rather than by juries.hill names addresses,supra,at medcom holding baxter travenol laboratories,cir.of course it could not keep both damages and profits,only the larger of the two.and of course when an equitable remedy is sought in conjunction with a legal remedy the legal claim is tried first and the jury findings bind the judge,in order to vindicate the right to a jury trial on legal claims.dairy queen,wood,d snider consolidation coal,cir.
the jury having exonerated the defendants,the judge refused to order equitable relief but since we are setting aside the jury verdict,the judge ruling on equitable relief falls with it.again for completeness,we note that since restitution is a legal as well as an equitable remedy,williams could have sought such relief from the jury.no one doubts that williams was entitled to have a jury try its claim of fraud despite the equitable origins of remedies for fraud a suit complaining of fraud is treated as a case at law if a legal rather than an equitable remedy is sought.strom goldman,sachs,cir skippy,cpc int l,cir plechner widener college,cir hyde properties mccoy,cir james moore,moore federal practice e ed.and since restitution is equally a legal and an equitable remedy,it can be sought from a jury in a fraud case.
we turn now to williams statutory claims,all of which the judge threw out.one was that arrow and milgray had conspired to fix the prices they charged williams,in violation of section of the sherman act.they might have gotten together,agreed not to give volume discounts to williams williams was a very good customer,and might have been expected to receive such discounts,and agreed to bribe barry not to demand any discounts from them.and then there might be a good sherman act claim.but there is no evidence of concerted action by the two suppliers.the fact that both may have charged higher prices than they would have done had they not been bribing barry does not show that they agreed on those prices,or for that matter agreed to bribe barry.for even if both suppliers agreed with him separately to pay the bribes,one would expect the prices of both to rise,since otherwise the suppliers would both be profiting from the bribes.but the common price increase would not in that case be the result of collusion,and commercial bribery that does not involve any collusion between competitors does not violate the sherman act prohibition against,bunker ramo united business forms,cir calnetics volkswagen of america,cir compare delong equipment washington mills electro minerals,cir.
another nonstarter is williams rico claim,which alleges an enterprise consisting of arrow,milgray,and barry.how could that be an enterprise if briber and bribed constitute,solely by virtue of that unlovely relation,a rico enterprise,then any time one person bribes another both have violated rico.we can not see the sense of that.it is true that bribery is one of the offenses upon which a rico claim can be based,brokerage concepts,healthcare,cir,but the bribe itself is not the rico offense it is the predicate act of the rico enterprise and,as in ash wallenmeyer,supra,at,there is no enterprise here.bachman bear,stearns,cir.
williams last statutory claim is under the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act,ilcs et.the judge rejected the claim on the ground that williams is not a consumer.actually,it is a consumer as defined in the act,if the act is read literally,because it purchased components from arrow and milgray not for resale but instead for use in manufacturing its video games,which are products that it sells,not resells.the term consumer means any person who purchases or contracts for the purchase of merchandise not for resale in the ordinary course of his trade or business but for his use or that of a member of his household.ilcs e.however,we rejected the literal reading in first comics,world color press,cir,lest the act so read supplant many common law breach of contract and fraud cases,something the illinois legislature surely did not intend.id.at.in the reading adopted by that case,the business purchaser is not a consumer,because his only use of the purchased product is as an input into the making of a product that he sells,in contrast to the individual who consumes a of beer for pleasure or nutrition rather than incorporating the beer into a product his beer belly is not for sale.
in any event the section under which williams sued does not protect just consumers,but any person.ilcs a see also c.the courts have,it is true,glossed this provision to require that the fraud be of sufficient magnitude to be likely to affect the market generally,bank one milwaukee sanchez,d,speakers of sport,proserv,cir,and thus be likely to harm consumers in the colloquial sense of the ultimate buyers of the finished product,or in this case the patrons of the game arcades in which the video games manufactured by williams are played.but that requirement is satisfied.the fraud must have added something,and maybe a lot,to williams input costs,and given williams position in the video game market some part of the increase would undoubtedly have been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.passing on is impossible if a seller faces a horizontal demand curve,meaning that the slightest increase in price would cause his sales to plummet to zero.but that is an unreasonable assumption with regard to a differentiated product there is no perfect substitute for mortal kombat.
last is the appeal from the dismissal of the against gnat and slupik.milgray fired them apparently not knowing that they were still operating microcomp though they had promised years earlier to terminate this unauthorized competition with their employer.milgray gave them severance pay in exchange for a blanket release of any legal claims they might have against milgray slupik had threatened to sue for age discrimination.in exchange for their release,gnat and slupik received an equally broad release of any claims that milgray might have against them.milgray now argues that because gnat and slupik were,as employees,fiduciaries of milgray,they were required before accepting the releases to disclose that they had breached their fiduciary duty to milgray by competing with it through microcomp.
the district judge was right to dismiss this claim.he dismissed milgray counterclaim against williams at the same time,on the ground that the release of gnat and slupik releas
