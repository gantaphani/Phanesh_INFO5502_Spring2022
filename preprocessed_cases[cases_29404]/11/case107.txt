sedeco servicio de descuento en compras sedeco appeals a judgment entered against it for overdue demurrage owed to services,tag.the case was resolved on stipulated facts,and the primary question before us is which statute of limitations is most analogous to tag claim for overdue demurrage charges on international shipments to puerto rico.after careful consideration,we reverse.
background 
tag sued sedeco and its principal,alex menda on september.at an initial status conference,the parties consented to resolution of the case on the merits under stipulated facts after briefing on the issue of the applicable limitation period.these stipulated facts are,in relevant part,as follows.
tag brings this collection action as an agent of compañía chilena de navegación interoceánica ccni,an ocean carrier engaged in transporting goods by sea.sedeco purchased goods shipped to puerto rico by ccni.all such shipments originated in foreign ports and were discharged at the port of san juan.sedeco incurred in demurrage charges in connection with this shipping,as represented by thirteen invoices dated between january,and september.these demurrage charges represent amounts due as a result of sedeco retention of ccni containers beyond the time allowed.sedeco does not dispute that it incurred the charges represented in the invoices.
twelve of the thirteen invoices,totaling,are dated within three years of the date this action was filed.four of the invoices are dated within eighteen months of the filing of this action.none were issued within days of the filing of this action.tag sent sedeco a collection letter on january,and furnished supporting documents on february.

ii.discussion 
a.the established framework 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this action to enforce a maritime shipping contract pursuant to.i n determining whether a contract falls within admiralty,the true criterion is the nature and of the contract,as whether it was a maritime contract,having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.exxon cent.gulf lines,d internal quotation marks omitted.in this case it is clear that the maritime shipping contracts tag asserts trigger the district court admiralty jurisdiction.see pan am.grain,at.
our previous decision in pan american grain,in which tag sued pan american grain over demurrage incurred in connection with interstate maritime shipments,sets up the applicable legal framework 
in an admiralty case,maritime law and the equitable doctrine of laches govern the time to sue.when applying the doctrine of laches,the court examines whether plaintiff delay in bringing suit was unreasonable and whether defendant was prejudiced by the delay.
in the maritime context,a laches analysis utilizes as a benchmark the limitations period contained in the most analogous statute.that limitations period is not per se dispositive,but rather courts rely upon it to establish burdens of proof and presumptions of timeliness and untimeliness.hence,if a plaintiff files a complaint within the analogous statutory period,the burden of proving unreasonable delay and prejudice falls on the defendant.if a plaintiff files after the statutory period has expired,the burden shifts and a presumption of laches is created.the analogous limitation period can be located either in state or federal law.
id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.this much is clear the disputed question arises in choosing this analogous limitations period.
b.the analogous limitations period 
the initial determination of the most analogous statute of limitations is an issue of law,which we review de novo.doyle huntress,cir.
tag relies heavily on our reasoning in pan american grain,which held a federal limitations statute most analogous.we summarize this decision.the pan american grain court faced an action to collect demurrage on interstate,not international,shipping.that decision noted that our precedent had recognized a private right of action that maritime carriers could use to collect demurrage charges specified in tariffs set forth in certain statutes.pan am.grain,at citing.serv.sweet brokerage de,cir.but tag action against pan american grain was brought as an action for breach of a maritime contract,not as a shipping act claim,so we did not further analyze a direct statutory action,except to recognize that the same statutes of limitation found to be most analogous for laches purposes might control directly in such an action.id.
although pan american grain used language indicating that it is merely the subject matter of the federal statutes that creates the analogy,see id.at here,we are satisfied that the most analogous statutes are the federal statutes regulating the very tariffs under which the alleged demurrages arose,the better read is that the private right of action contained in that statute controlled our determination that it was most analogous.see id.this conclusion is also buttressed by our recent analysis of the issue in doyle.in deciding whether to apply the flsa or a limitations period to an admiralty labor dispute,we determined that largely because the flsa declined to cover maritime fishermen,it could not be deemed most analogous to such fishermen claims.see doyle,at.we also quoted a ninth circuit case noting that weight is generally given to the statute of limitations that would apply to a comparable action filed in state court in the state in which the cause of action arose.id.quoting sandvik.packers ass n,cir.
pan american grain argued that puerto rico state law,namely article of the puerto rico commerce code,should apply.pan am.grain,at.specifically,pan american grain relied on a puerto rico supreme court case that held that article limitations period applied to the collection of demurrage charges incurred in connection with shipments to puerto rico from a foreign port.id.at citing mortensen lange san juan mercantile,offic.trans.the pan american grain court conceded that the puerto rico statute was broad enough to apply to demurrage,but refused to apply it,stating that an admiralty court must apply the federal maritime rules that directly address the issues at hand,and only resort to state law when no federal rule applies.id 
this preference for federal law,however,need not derail application of state law if no federal law directly addresses these issues.in doyle,the highly related federal law explicitly declined to speak precisely to the relevant question and we determined that congress choice justified a refusal to borrow that limitations period.moreover,while there is some preference for choosing federal law in admiralty cases,there is also a long tradition of borrowing state limitations periods.see wilburn boat fireman fund ins.rejecting the idea that every term in every maritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined admiralty rule and stating that i n the field of maritime contracts as in that of maritime torts,the national government has left much regulatory power in the states footnotes omitted see also uisdean vass xia chen,the admiralty doctrine of laches,suggesting that resort to the limitations period governing an identical state claim is a good rule of thumb.
considering this exposition of our previous decisions,it should be easier to evaluate the candidates for the most analogous statute of limitations in this case involving demurrage on international shipments.after examining why the reasoning of pan american grain is not controlling,and after rejecting the possible federal analogues,we conclude that article is most analogous.we explain.
the first possibility is simply to apply the same limitations period as in the pan american grain decision.though no party asserts this position on appeal,this was the position tag advanced before the district court.while there is some appeal of simplicity in applying the iccta eighteen month statute of limitations period to all demurrage claims we conclude that doing so in the case of foreign shipments is not proper.this is because the iccta does not apply to shipments originating in a foreign port and terminating in a united states port,unless the shipment transships through one united states port on the way to the final united states port.a c.thus,in the iccta,congress has not spoken to the applicable limitations period for foreign shipments that arrive directly in the united states.
further,since the iccta does not apply in this case,whatever analogous private rights of action we acknowledged under it and its predecessor statutes would not be available.as explained above,pan american grain decision to reject the state limitations period in favor of the federal period was based,in part,on the idea that the similar private right of action under federal law naturally provided an analogous statute of limitations.see at.thus,in the present case,the iccta does not govern the action,and the reasons for concluding its limitations period are most analogous have diminished force 
so,we turn to the second federal candidate,the shipping act of.the district court concluded that tag current suit was brought under this act,which regulates international shipping,and so used it to find the analogous limitations period.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on its decision in an earlier case,which found that act applicable to foreign shipments involving only one united states port.see sl,int l food packers,d.that case concluded that the shipping act of appears to regulate the tariffs at issue since its purpose was to establish a nondiscriminatory regulatory process for the common carriage of goods by water in the foreign commerce of the united states with a minimum of government intervention and regulatory costs.id.quoting.the district court then applied a limitations period on actions filed with the fmc that assert a violation of the shipping act of.see a.
we agree that the shipping act of applies to the shipping at issue in this case but we disagree that the statute of limitations used by the district court is analogous.this statute of limitations is related to a provision of the shipping act of that bars shippers from obtaining transportation below applicable rates through an unjust or unfair device.id.a.a violation of this,or other provision of the shipping act of,is enforced through an administrative complaint with the fmc.id.a.such administrative complaints must be brought within three years,and it is this period that the district court found most analogous to the present case.
but that section is not on point here.first,the right of action created in does not extend to simple cases of failure to pay.rather,the statute requires an unjust or unfair device or means,and regulations make clear that the fmc will not infer such a device from the failure of a shipper to pay ocean freight.second,the provision is incongruous with this case since,unlike the private right of action available for interstate shipments,it requires that a plaintiff seek relief before an administrative body.thus,there is not the same need,as encountered in pan american grain,to ensure that the federal court hearing a maritime contract applies the same law as would be applied if the carrier had sought to collect through a direct action under the statutes.in sum,the shipping act of does not provide a right of action resembling the one found in the iccta.thus,we conclude that the shipping act of limitations period on administrative actions does not regulate actions for the collection of demurrage,and so is not perfectly analogous to tag claim.nor is another provision of the shipping act of on point 
thus,we are left with two flawed analogies.though the iccta contains a limitations period contemplating a collection claim,it explicitly does not apply to foreign shipments that do not include a domestic transshipment.though the shipping act of regulates the kind of shipments at issue,it does not provide a right of action comparable to that provided by the iccta and does not regulate simple collection claims like the one presently before us.
confronted with these imperfect analogies,we return to puerto rico article.it is precisely on point the actions relating to the collection of transportation,freights,expenses inherent thereto,and the contributions of ordinary averages shall prescribe six months after the goods which gave rise thereto were delivered.laws ann.tit.the puerto rico supreme court,the authoritative source for interpretation of puerto rico law,has recognized that this statute applies to demurrage on international shipments.mortensen,at,offic.trans.at.and we have already acknowledged the statute breadth.pan am.grain,at stating that statute is certainly broad enough to apply to a demurrage action.
thus,the relevant federal laws here do not apply to a simple collection action for demurrage on a foreign shipment to a single united states port.just as in doyle,in the absence of federal law on point,it makes most sense to apply a controlling state law.so,in the case of international shipments arriving directly to puerto rico,the limitations period in article is most analogous.
we note that this conclusion is narrow,in that it only applies to shipments sent directly to a single united states port.if a second united states port becomes involved through transshipment,thus increasing the risk of interstate conflict of laws,then the iccta supplies a federal rule.
application of laches 
with the applicable statute of limitations period resolved,the final question is whether tag can meet its burden of rebutting the presumption of unreasonable delay and prejudice.
the district court did not analyze the question of prejudice and delay,but simply entered judgment for tag on the worth of claims within the period and excluded the it found to be outside the presumptive laches period.no party challenges these particular rulings on appeal.aside from the mailing of a collection letter,no facts in the stipulation are relevant to this question.the collection letter was filed more than six months after all but one of the invoices,and tag makes no argument on appeal as to why sending such a letter rebuts the presumption against them 
the record shows that the parties stipulated to facts and consented to the district court entering judgment on those facts.when this happens in a case,we treat the matter as a case stated.lederle parenterals,cir.in such a case,i nstead of expending time and money on a trial,the parties may decide that the record establishes all the necessary grounds upon which a judge may enter a final ruling on one or all of the issues in dispute.id.thus,we conclude that no error arose from the district court failure to apply the laches presumption,since the parties offered scant facts relevant to such an inquiry,and since the parties consented to judgment on the stipulation.
considering this procedural posture,the proper course is clear.the presumption based on article applies to all of tag claims.tag offers no grounds for rebutting that presumption.and the parties consented to entry of judgment based on the stipulation.thus,we conclude that the district court should have entered judgment for the defendants.
