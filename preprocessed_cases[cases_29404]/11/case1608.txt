skf usa,skf france,skf aerospace france,skf gmbh,and skf industrie collectively skf appeal from the final judgment of the court of international trade affirming the department of commerce commerce revision of its methodology and its ongoing zeroing methodology in calculating antidumping margins for ball bearings and related parts.skf usa,united states,d.int l trade.because the court of international trade correctly determined that commerce zeroing practice and the revision of its methodology were supported by substantial evidence and were in accordance with law,we affirm.
background 
skf imports ball bearings and related parts into the united states,which have been the subject of an antidumping investigation and subsequent annual reviews by commerce.in performing these reviews,commerce compares the imported products with foreign like product as required by a b.foreign like product is defined as either identical merchandise,a,or similar merchandise,b and c.determinations of similar,merchandise are made using a methodology developed by commerce.
beginning with the first administrative review,commerce utilized a family methodology,whereby it grouped ball bearings into families based on exact matches of eight characteristics bearing design,load direction,number of rows of rolling elements,precision rating,dynamic load rating,outside diameter,inside diameter,and.bearing models within a family were treated as equally similar to all other models sharing these eight characteristics,regardless of other product variations.when commerce formulated the family methodology in,it grouped specific models of bearings into families t o minimize the necessity for comparisons among an exceptionally large number of bearing models,and to limit the need for adjustments for physical differences in merchandise and the need for model matching.at.
during the fourteenth administrative review,however,in a memorandum dated december,commerce indicated that it was considering modifications to the methodology.it explained that t he approach deviates from commerce normal practice in that commerce ha d considered all models within a family to be equally similar,and that this methodology was developed at a time when it was impossible for commerce to identify the single most similar foreign like product because the technological resources available were far less powerful than they are now.id.at.thus,a more complex methodology would have been prohibitively expensive and.id.commerce suggested changing the methodology in order to determine the single most similar model,taking advantage of intervening technological developments,id.at,but explained that it would not attempt to implement any changes to the methodology in the ongoing reviews,choosing instead to solicit comments and invite rebuttal comments before implementing the new methodology in the reviews.id.at.
on july,commerce issued a memorandum outlining the revised methodology and indicating that although it intended to use the new methodology,it reserved the right to make further modifications based on comments received or data collected during the course of the reviews.commerce summarized its proposed methodology as follows 
we recommend that we select the single most similar model among only those models that are in the same family,as redefined above,bearing design,load direction,number of rows,and,if we determine it appropriate,precision grade,on the basis of that model that is closest in terms of inner diameter,outer diameter,width,load rating,and,if appropriate,precision grade.we recommend further that we resolve ties by selecting the single model whose variable cost of manufacturing is closest to that of the model.
id.at.thus,under the new methodology,commerce would identify models in the comparison market and the market that share four of the physical characteristics of the old methodology.after finding an identical match of these characteristics,commerce would then identify a most similar model based upon a comparison of the remaining characteristics.
on may,commerce issued its preliminary results for the fifteenth administrative review using the new methodology.antifriction bearings and parts thereof from france,germany,italy,japan,singapore,and the united kingdom preliminary results and partial rescission of antidumping duty administrative reviews.dep t of commerce may.commerce also released a memorandum providing the revised methodology and addressing comments received.in this memorandum,commerce explained that b ecause there is a statutory preference for using comparisons and the technological constraints that led us to adopt the simplified family methodology are no longer operative,we find compelling reasons to change the methodology at.under the revised methodology,commerce identif ies the single most similar model within the redefined family of bearings using a methodology with a cap on the sum of the deviations,resolving ties among bearings with the same sum of the deviations using the smallest adjustment.id.at.commerce indicated that it would consider all arguments presented in case and rebuttal briefs and,if appropriate,revise this methodology for the final results of reviews.id.at.
on september,commerce published the final results of its fifteenth antidumping administrative review of ball bearings and parts thereof from various countries imported from may,to april.ball bearings and parts thereof from france,germany,italy,japan,singapore and the united kingdom final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews.dep t of commerce,final results.in a related memorandum,commerce indicated that t his new methodology is much closer to its normal matching practice than is the methodology in that it allows commerce to select the single model and allows commerce to avoid rejecting reasonable comparisons between models with slightly different physical characteristics.memorandum from barbara tillman,acting deputy assistant sec y for import,dep t of commerce,to ronald lorentzen,acting assistant sec y for import,dep t of commerce,issues and decision memorandum for the antidumping duty administrative reviews of ball bearings and parts thereof from france,germany for the period of review may,through april,at,issues decision memo.commerce explained that it had solicited extensive comments and incorporated numerous suggestions before adopting the new methodology.id.it concluded that compelling reasons exist to change the methodology,that it now possessed the technological capacity to use a more accurate methodology,and that t he new methodology is substantially more accurate than the methodology.id.at.
in calculating skf dumping margins,commerce also employed its usual methodology in which dumped sales are not offset by practice known as zeroing.skf challenged these results before the court of international trade,which sustained commerce final results.skf timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the court of international trade decisions regarding commerce antidumping determinations de novo,applying the same standard of review to commerce determinations as did that court.carpenter tech.united states,citations omitted.thus,commerce antidumping determinations must be sustained unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.at quoting b b i.
skf argues that the court of international trade erred in reviewing commerce decision to change its methodology for reasonableness rather than determining whether the change was supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law.see b b i.skf further argues that because commerce own policy permits changes to methodologies only when supported by compelling reasons,final results of antidumping duty administrative reviews and revocation in part of an antidumping duty order,dep t of commerce july,we must use a similar standard to review commerce actions.we disagree.the standard articulated by the court of international trade,whether commerce reasonably determined that there were compelling reasons to revise the model match methodology,skf usa,d at
