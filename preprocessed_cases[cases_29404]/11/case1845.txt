plaintiff luberski,luberski,appeals an order granting defendant oleificio amato amato motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction see code civ.proc,subd.a.as an italian olive oil company with limited sales to california customers,amato averred its contacts with california were insufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional due process.see.
we reverse.the court has specific jurisdiction over amato with regard to this matter because the subject of the dispute is amato alleged nondelivery of worth of olive oil to luberski in california.
on february,luberski,an entity operating in california,filed a complaint for breach of written contract,monies had and received,and fraud against amato,an entity operating in italy.the complaint alleged the parties agreed via purchase order and written confirmation that luberski would pay amato for cases of olive oil.the contract allegedly obligated amato to ship the olive oil to luberski by way of long beach,california,with duties and taxes paid by amato.the complaint alleged luberski paid to amato,but the promised shipment of olive oil never arrived and amato did not respond to subsequent written communications inquiring about the promised shipment.the exhibits to the complaint indicate the parties expected a second shipment of olive oil to occur at the same price following satisfactory completion of the first shipment,but the complaint does not allege this second shipment was part of the contract sued upon because payment was only made in the amount of and not.
amato specially appeared to contest personal jurisdiction.in support of amato motion to quash the summons and complaint,its president attested to the following facts amato is a corporation formed under the laws of italy and located at partanna,italy amato is in the business of producing olive oil and related products which it sells on a wholesale and retail basis in italy and to a lesser extent internationally amato has sold some olive oil to california customers over the years,mainly to two buyers not including luberski amato provides no services in california amato california sales consist of accepting purchase orders,preparing an invoice,and shipping the products to the closest harbor either long beach or oakland amato has no employees,assets,bank accounts,or offices in california amato is a small company for which defense of a california action would impose a material burden amato shipped the requested oil over eighteen months ago and this order was the first for luberski,which was introduced to amato by an existing california buyer.luberski countered by submitting a declaration which verified the facts alleged in the complaint.
the court found the record supported,for the purposes of the jurisdictional ruling,that amato was to deliver plus worth of olive oil to the port of long beach addressed to the plaintiff,which is a california corporation,and was responsible for the cost of shipping,insurance,and freight.nevertheless,the court granted the motion to quash service of the summons,ruling neither general nor specific jurisdiction was established.the minute order stated general jurisdiction does not exist because defendant contacts with california are not substantial,continuous,and systematic.specific jurisdiction does not exist.there is no evidence defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs activities toward california in order to obtain benefit from the state.
discussion 
california statute authorizes california courts to exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of the united states or the constitution of california.citation.a state court assertion of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who has not been served with process within the state comports with the requirements of the due process clause of the federal constitution if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons.when a defendant challenges personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff has the burden to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,the factual basis for the exercise of jurisdiction.shisler sanfer sports cars,th,d shisler.if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed,the question of jurisdiction is a purely legal question and,therefore,is subject to a de novo review.ibid.
personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific.a nonresident defendant may be subject to the general jurisdiction of the forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are substantial continuous and systematic.citations.in such a case,it is not necessary that the specific cause of action alleged be connected with the defendant business relationship to the forum.citations.such a defendant contacts with the forum are so that they take the place of physical presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction if the nonresident defendant does not have substantial and systematic contacts in the forum sufficient to establish general jurisdiction,he or she still may be subject to the specific jurisdiction of the forum vons,supra,cal th at,d.a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits citation the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum citations and the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice citations.pavlovich superior court cal th,d.
luberski claims the court erred by finding it lacked both general and specific jurisdiction over amato.we agree with the court that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of general jurisdiction over amato.see carretti italpast th,d carretti no general jurisdiction over italian company with no california offices or employees,and a small number of sales to a california buyer who showed up on its doorstep in italy.the record discloses that amato only contacts with california are its history of shipping olive oil to a small number of customers within the state.this does not represent substantial,continuous,and systematic contacts such that amato could be held to answer to any lawsuit whether related or unrelated to such sales of olive oil in california.thus,we will confine our analysis to the issue of specific jurisdiction 
in applying the test for specific jurisdiction identified above,it is clear this action arises out of an alleged contact with the forum,namely amato agreement to ship olive oil to a california company and the alleged nondelivery of such olive oil.see as you sow crawford laboratories,th,d complaint alleges products sold into california did not include adequate warnings,thus claim related to contacts with state.amato concedes this portion of the analysis by contending it complied with the contract by shipp ing the requested olive oil 
thus,the questions presented are whether contracting with a california company for the sale of in olive oil and shipping those goods to long beach harbor or failing to ship such goods purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the forum and,if so,whether it comports with justice to force amato to litigate this dispute in california.before analyzing applicable case law,it is useful to recall the undisputed,relevant facts luberski initiated the order from california not by travelling to italy the parties attempted to set the terms of the contract through the exchange by facsimile of a purchase order,a confirmation,and additional correspondence but no single,formalized contract the sale at issue is in american currency worth of olive oil to be delivered by an italian seller to a california buyer the terms of shipment are that the italian seller would pay for freight and insurance to long beach and the italian seller had no direct presence in california whether personnel,advertisements,or otherwise in relation to the transaction and nothing further to do with the jurisdiction other than shipping its goods there.
