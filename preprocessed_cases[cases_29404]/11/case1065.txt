plaintiffs gary marbut,the montana shooting sports association,and the second amendment foundation appeal the dismissal of their action challenging federal firearms regulations.marbut wants to manufacture firearms under the montana firearms freedom act,state legislation that declares that the manufacture and sale of certain firearms within the state is beyond the scope of congress commerce power.the district court dismissed the action because no plaintiff had standing to bring the claim and,in the alternative,because the complaint failed to state a claim in light of gonzales raich,d,and united states stewart,cir.on appeal,we conclude that marbut has standing to sue,but we agree with the district court that marbut has failed to state a claim.thus,we affirm the judgment.
background 
the montana legislature passed the montana firearms freedom act mffa or the act,which declares that a firearm or ammunition manufactured in montana and that remains within the borders of montana is not subject to federal law or federal regulation,including registration,under the authority of congress sic to regulate interstate commerce.ann.it purports to authorize the manufacture and sale of firearms within the state,but imposes certain requirements for a firearm to qualify under the act,notably that the words made in montana be clearly stamped on a central metallic part.id.
plaintiff gary marbut owns a business that manufactures shooting range equipment for law enforcement agencies and is involved in a variety of organizations and activities,including service as the president of the montana shooting sports association,another plaintiff.marbut wishes to manufacture and sell firearms and ammunition to montanans under the mffa without complying with applicable federal laws regulating firearms.
in particular,marbut wishes to manufacture and sell a caliber rifle called the montana buckaroo.marbut has design plans for the rifle that are ready to load into machining equipment for production,and he has identified manufacturers that will supply the individual component parts.several hundred montanans have offered to purchase the montana buckaroo at marbut asking price,but such sales are conditioned on marbut winning this suit and not having to comply with federal licensing requirements.according to the complaint,these customers do not want and will not buy the montana buckaroo if manufactured by a federal firearms licensee.marbut has also developed ammunition that he wants to sell under the mffa and that a state agency has expressed interest in purchasing.
after the passage of the mffa,the federal bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf distributed an open letter to all montana federal firearm licensees.the letter stated that the mffa conflicts with federal firearms laws,and that federal law supersedes the act and continues to apply.marbut subsequently sent a letter to the atf,asking whether he could manufacture firearms and ammunition under the mffa without complying with federal statutes and without fear of criminal prosecution.in response,an atf special agent wrote to marbut that unlicensed manufacturing of firearms of ammunition for sale is a violation of federal law and could lead to potential criminal prosecution.
marbut,along with the montana shooting sports association and the second amendment foundation,filed for declaratory and injunctive relief.the montana shooting sports association and the second amendment foundation are dedicated to gun education and advocacy.plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment that congress has no power to regulate the activities contemplated by the mffa and injunctive relief preventing the federal government from bringing civil or criminal actions under federal firearms law against montana citizens acting in compliance with the mffa.
a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissing the suit because plaintiffs lacked standing and,in the alternative,because plaintiffs failed to state a claim in light of the commerce clause jurisprudence of the supreme court and this court.the federal district court adopted these recommendations in full and dismissed the case.plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.standing 
plaintiffs argue that economic injury and the threat of criminal prosecution each provide a basis for standing.the district court held that none of the plaintiffs had standing.we review a motion to dismiss for lack of standing de novo,construing the factual allegations in the complaint in favor of the plaintiffs.tyler cuomo,cir.on appeal,we conclude that marbut has standing on account of economic injury and do not reach his alternative argument for standing.neither do we reach the issue of whether the montana shooting sports association and the second amendment foundation have organizational standing.
to have standing,a plaintiff must suffer an injury that is actual or imminent as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.because marbut asks for injunctive relief,he must show a very significant possibility of future harm.mortensen cnty.of sacramento,cir quoting bras cal.pub.utils.comm n,cir.
economic injury caused by a proscriptive statute is sufficient for standing to challenge that statute.see audubon soc y,davis,opinion amended in other respects on denial of reh g,cir.in davis,for example,plaintiff animal trappers challenged a law prohibiting the use of certain types of traps.at.the trappers alleged that they earned a living through trapping,had ceased trapping because of the law,would continue trapping if the law were declared invalid,and asked for declaratory and injunctive relief.id.at.the court concluded that the trappers had standing to challenge the law,noting that the trappers economic injury is directly traceable to the fact that the challenged law explicitly forbids the trapping they would otherwise do.id.at.
like the plaintiffs in davis,marbut alleges an economic injury resulting from laws explicitly prohibiting a business activity that he would otherwise engage in.the magistrate judge distinguished davis on the basis that the trappers,unlike marbut,had a preexisting business that came to a halt after the law at issue was enacted.it is true that the court in davis,in determining whether or not the trappers would suffer future economic injury on account of the challenged law,noted that the uncontested history of using the traps before the passage of the challenged law,and their statements that they would continue trapping if not constrained by that law,are enough to show they would resume trapping if the ban were declared invalid.id.at.but having operated a business enterprise in the past based on a activity is not a necessary condition for standing.
injunctive relief requires a showing of a significant likelihood of future injury.see mortensen,at.having engaged in a business activity in the past may make it less speculative that a plaintiff can and would do so again if the law were enjoined,but there is no bright line rule requiring past operation to establish standing.rather,determining injury for article iii standing purposes is a inquiry.lujan,at.
construing marbut allegations in the light most favorable to him,we conclude that he would manufacture and sell unlicensed firearms should we declare federal regulations inapplicable to the buckaroo.marbut has not merely alleged a vague desire to manufacture and sell unlicensed firearms if he wins this lawsuit,but has made specific allegations substantiating this claim.he has a background in running his own shooting range equipment manufacturing business,has identified suppliers for the component parts of the buckaroo,has design plans for the firearm ready to load into manufacturing equipment,and has identified hundreds of customers who have ordered the buckaroo at his asking price.marbut has alleged much more than the some day intentions without any description of concrete plans held insufficient for standing.lujan,at holding that a mere professed intent to visit a country was insufficient for standing,when plaintiffs had not purchased a plane ticket or even described when they would visit.
