we granted review to determine a limited issue when a plaintiff alleges in an underlying complaint that an insured defendant took a competitor customer list and solicited customers from it,was the defendant act a misappropriation of advertising ideas that gave rise to the insurer duty to defend defendant under the advertising injury provision of the commercial general liability cgl insurance policy on may,we filed the order specifically limiting the issue on review to coverage under the advertising injury provision.we conclude the term advertising injury as used in the cgl policy requires widespread promotion to the public such that solicitation of a few customers does not give rise to the insurer duty to defend the underlying lawsuit.for this reason,we reverse the court of appeal judgment,which concluded the allegations satisfied the advertising injury provision of the cgl insurance policy.
in november,plaintiff mohammed hameid opened salon,a beauty parlor.hameid purchased a business account package policy from national fire insurance of hartford national.the policy was effective from november,to november,and provided cgl insurance,including coverage for advertising injury arising out of the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.salon was located near a competitor,bellezza spa bellezza.shortly after salon opened,doreen howard and heather billington,two bellezza hairdressers,left bellezza to rent work stations from hameid,taking most of their customers with them.
in march,kwp,kwp,bellezza owner,sued hameid,howard,and billington for misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,civil conspiracy,and injunctive relief.kwp claimed that all three defendants possessed trade secrets,including bellezza customer list,price list and pricing policies,and that the defendants had misappropriated the trade secrets by committing certain acts,including,but not limited to utilizing the customer list in order to identify and solicit bellezza customers,and using bellezza confidential price list and pricing policies to undercut bellezza.as to hameid specifically,the kwp action alleged direct misappropriation and unfair competition,conspiratorial activity with the codefendants,and an agency relationship with them.
hameid own declaration established that he did no advertising,except to include a flyer in a valpak that was sent in a mass mailing to local residents.hameid declares defendants doreen howard and heather billington rent space at salon which has done no advertising or soliciting for them.what salon does for advertising is to include a flyer in valpak which is sent to local residents.kwp,however,did not sue hameid for mailing the valpak flyer.instead,kwp sued hameid for stealing its customer list and soliciting its customers.even the coupon on the flyer was not applicable to howard or billington services it was restricted to other stylists off any service.with coupon only.new clients only.discount with meno or heidi only.
hameid tendered defense of the kwp action to national under the cgl insurance policy advertising injury coverage provision,but the insurer refused to defend him.hameid prevailed against kwp at trial.he then timely filed the present bad faith action against national for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,seeking to recover defense expenses and punitive damages.the trial court struck the punitive damages claim.it also granted national motion for summary judgment on the ground that as a matter of law national owed hameid no duty to defend under the relevant policy provision because the underlying lawsuit claimed misappropriation of trade secrets,and not advertising injury.
the court of appeal reversed the judgment,concluding national owed hameid a duty to defend.the court relied on new hampshire ins.foxfire,foxfire,in holding that when we view hameid business as a community beauty salon,the relatively limited solicitation of customers through phone calls and valpak mailers served to call public attention to the salon beauty services.the court of appeal concluded that solicitation was therefore equivalent to the widespread promotional activities that foxfire found constituted advertising under the cgl insurance policy.see also sentex systems,hartford acc.indem,affd.cir advertising encompasses and group solicitations.having concluded the insured conduct fell within the national policy definition of advertising activity,the court considered whether the policy covered that conduct in its coverage of advertising injury arising out of the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.the court concluded that business marketing includes a variety of direct and indirect advertising activities,including misappropriating confidential customer lists to identify and solicit clients.we granted review.
discussion 
general principles 
insurance policy interpretation is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.an insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured.as with all contracts,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.aiu ins.superior court cal d.the parties intent is inferred from the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.id.at.
liability insurers owe a duty to defend their insureds for claims that potentially fall within the policy coverage provisions.the carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.gray zurich ins.cal d.however,in an action where no claim is even potentially covered,the insurer owes no duty to defend.buss superior court cal th,d.
the national insurance policy 
in order to determine whether national owed hameid a duty to defend,we must examine the cgl insurance policy at issue.as noted,the policy provides defense and indemnity coverage for advertising injuries if the injuries are caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising the insured goods and services.the coverage obligates national to defend an action against the insured if the underlying lawsuit alleges advertising by the insured,an advertising injury offense as defined in the policy,and a causal connection between the advertising injury and the third party claimant damages.the umbrella coverage endorsement in the same cgl insurance policy provides additional coverage for advertising injury under essentially identical terms.
although the cgl insurance policy here does not define advertising,it does define advertising injury to mean injury arising out of one or more offenses,including slander or libel violation of the right to privacy copyright,title or slogan infringement and,at issue here,m isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.thus in order for hameid to have a reasonable expectation of coverage under the national cgl policy for advertising injury he must show that he was engaged in advertising during the policy period when the alleged advertising injury occurred kwp allegations created a potential for liability under one of the covered offenses,misappropriation of advertising ideas and a causal connection existed between the alleged injury and the advertising.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,bank of the west peerless lighting am.motorists ins.th,tr d peerless.
did hameid activities constitute advertising under the national cgl insurance policy 
the parties do not dispute that kwp alleged injuries occurred during the time national policy was in effect.they do,however,disagree on whether hameid was involved in advertising,and whether kwp allegations gave rise to a potential for coverage under the advertising injury policy provision.if we assume that taking trade secrets in the form of a customer list is an offense that may inflict advertising injury,we must then decide whether the offense occurred in the course of hameid advertising his salon goods or services.in other words,does solicitation of customers from a customer list constitute advertising within the meaning of the cgl policy,and,if so,did the alleged advertising activity cause advertising injury 
the meaning of advertising in a cgl insurance policy has presented a problem for courts interpreting coverage.in bank of the west,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,we interpreted a version of the cgl insurance policy.it covered advertising injury arising out of an offense that occurred during the course of the insured advertising activities.id.at,d.we observed that,when interpreting cgl insurance policies,courts have disagreed on the question of what constitutes advertising most of the published decisions hold that advertising means widespread promotional activities directed to the public at large.ibid.although we did not decide the meaning of the term because the question was not before us,bank of the west acknowledged that only a sparse minority of federal district court cases hold that the term advertising can also encompass personal solicitations.id.at,d,see foxfire,supra.at american states ins.canyon creek.and john deere ins.shamrock industries.john deere.
here,the court of appeal questioned bank of the west statement that most courts have defined advertising to mean widespread promotional activities directed to the public at large.the court relied on foxfire,supra.at page,which opined that whether an insured activity is advertising under a cgl insurance policy hinges on the context of the overall universe of customers to whom a communication may be addressed.foxfire commented that w here the audience may be small,but nonetheless comprises all or a significant number of a competitor client base,the advertising activity requirement is met w here the business is one with a small customer base and that base,or a significant part of it,is the target audience,the reach is extensive enough to constitute advertising injury.accord,amway distribs.benefits ass federal ins,advertising comes in many forms and may differ in scope from business to business,depending on the product,the size of the company,the company marketing system,or the size of the target market new hampshire ins.chaides constr,chaides a dvertising activity must be examined in the context of the overall universe of customers to whom a communication may be addressed to hold otherwise would effectively preclude small businesses from ever invoking their rights to coverage for advertising injury liability.
the court of appeal also relied on peerless,supra,th at pages,d,which questioned whether widespread promotional activities in fact was the rule adopted by a majority of published opinions.ibid.peerless,however,does not support the court of appeal analysis.peerless actually held that an insured participation in a competitive bidding process on a single product involving a single customer did not constitute advertising under the cgl insurance policy and rejected a duty to defend.ibid.peerless discussed several cases interpreting the advertising injury coverage and suggested that a majority of other jurisdictions do require widespread advertising to the public.peerless also observed that only a few federal courts interpret advertising injury coverage to apply to personal solicitations to a limited number of individual customers.id.at,d citing several cases following the widespread promotion approach,including select design union mut.fire ins,select design.
contrary to foxfire,we prefer the majority approach as stated in bank of the west,supra,cal th at page,d,and interpret the term advertising as used in cgl policies to mean widespread promotional activities usually directed to the public at large the definition reflects the commonly understood meaning of the word as noted,a majority of the other jurisdictions that have considered the question have come to a similar conclusion.
in select design,supra,the insured sought a defense after being sued for allegedly using proprietary information,including a customer list that a competitor former employee provided,to solicit the competitor customers.the insured cgl insurance policy provided coverage for advertising injury.id.at.the vermont supreme court stated that the majority view defined advertising as widespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large partially because the majority read the policy provisions according to their plain,ordinary meaning.id.at.the court reasoned that defining advertising to include customer solicitations would stretch too far if the act of contacting potential customers is advertising for the purposes of the policy,then any dispute related to economic competition among businesses is covered by the policy provision for advertising injury.id.at.thus,the court held that solicitation of the competitor customers did not constitute advertising under the cgl insurance policy.id.at.
in monumental life ins.fidelity guaranty,the insured was accused of mailing recruiting letters to a competitor employees and courting a competitor customers with a personal solicitation that caused many of them to defect.when the insured sought a defense under the advertising injury coverage of its cgl insurance policy,the trial court determined the insured alleged activities were not advertising.the maryland court of special appeals affirmed.it distinguished between advertising and solicitation,stating that t he lower court clearly viewed advertising and solicitation as mutually exclusive,the difference being that advertising must be of a public nature.id.at.the court of appeals agreed with the lower court that there is no bona fide ambiguity in the language of the policies at issue,nor is there any legitimate doubt as to its application under the circumstances.advertising means advertising,widespread distribution or announcements to the public.consequently,monumental individual,solicitations were clearly not advertising within the normal meaning of the word and,accordingly,the lower court acted properly.id.at.
a federal district court applying virginia law similarly recognized that advertising means widespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large.solers,hartford cas.ins.d,solers.in solers,a subcontractor sought a defense under the advertising injury provision of its liability insurance policy after allegedly using proprietary information to submit bids on two government contracts.the insured claimed that w idespread public dissemination of solicitation material is not appropriate for its business,and that its only advertising mechanism is the submission of written business proposals.id.at.thus,the insured asserted that the c ourt must find that the proposals constitute advertising because to hold otherwise on the grounds that the proposals are not directed at the public at large would be to hold that companies with small,but markets can not,as a matter of law,engage in advertising.ibid.
the district court rejected the insured contention,holding that the subcontractor bids were not covered by the p olicy because such submissions were not widespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large.solers,supra,d at,quoting playboy enterprises,paul fire marine ins.cir at applying illinois law.the district court also pointed out that small businesses are not limited to insurance coverage for claims based in advertising injury for the protection of their profession.small businesses may obtain broad coverage by purchasing several forms of insurance,including coverage for errors and omissions liability,directors and officers liability,and completed operations and products liability.solers,supra,d at,fn.there is no evidence in this action that hameid obtained any such small business insurance coverage that may have assisted him in defending the kwp action.
massachusetts,missouri,illinois,and kansas have also defined advertising as widespread promotional activities directed to
