facts and proceedings below 
council of insurance agents brokers the council is a national trade association that represents more than of the nation largest commercial property and casualty insurance agencies and brokerage firms.the council members,which include corporations and partnerships rather than individuals,place over eighty billion dollars in insurance premiums annually,which constitutes more than percent of the commercial marketplace.the majority of the council members sell insurance in more than one state,and in many cases in all fifty states,to large,sophisticated,commercial that typically have exposures.included in the council members are insurance agencies and brokerage firms based outside of nevada that sell insurance in nevada.
in this case,the council challenges nevada countersignature statute,which provides that no authorized insurer may make,write,place,or renew any insurance policy on persons,property,or risks in nevada,except through its duly appointed and licensed agents resident in nevada,any one of whom shall countersign the policy.despite this limitation on insurers,section guarantees the free and unlimited right to negotiate insurance contracts by licensed nonresident agents or brokers outside nevada,if the policies,endorsements or evidence of those contracts covering properties or insurance interests in nevada are countersigned by a resident agent finally,section requires that the countersigning agent be paid a commission of at least five percent of any resulting premium.in its complaint,the council alleged that section violates the constitution commerce clause,privileges and immunities clause of article iv,and the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.
the commissioner promptly filed a motion for summary judgment and the council filed a for summary judgment.the district court denied both parties motions without prejudice and after expressing some doubt as to whether the council had standing to assert its constitutional claims during a hearing on the parties motions,the court granted the council leave to amend its complaint.the council did so,adding rebecca restrepo restrepo as in its first amended complaint,in which the council reasserts its equal protection and privileges and immunities claims.
restrepo is a resident of california,is licensed to sell insurance in california,and is the managing director of the sacramento office of abd insurance and financial services abd,a member of the council.restrepo is also licensed to produce and sell insurance in nevada as a nonresident agent.in nevada,the commissioner issues licenses to nonresidents as producers of insurance if four requirements are satisfied.the nonresident must be in good standing as a licensed resident in his home state,pay a prescribed fee,submit an application,and the nonresident home state must issue nonresident licenses to nevada residents pursuant to a substantially similar procedure in its first amended complaint,the council alleges that section causes restrepo to forfeit approximately annually,and that she is suffering immediate injury and being deprived of significant rights.
following discovery,the commissioner renewed and supplemented her initial motion for summary judgment,and the council renewed its motion for summary judgment and supplemented its initial motion with a motion for summary judgment on behalf of restrepo.this time,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion,concluding that restrepo has standing,that the council has representative standing to assert the underlying constitutional claims of its member firms and their officers,directors,principals,and employees,and that section plainly draws a distinction between resident agents and brokers,for which there is no legitimate rational basis.d at.therefore,the district court held,section violates the privileges and immunities clause and equal protection clause of the united states constitution because it denies to nonresident insurance agents the same rights and privileges that are afforded to resident agents.id.at.the district court enjoined the commissioner from enforcing section,but later stayed this injunction pending appeal.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
reviewing de novo the district court decision on for summary judgment,we must decide whether the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to the party,shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.pocatello educ.ass heideman,cir.we also review de novo whether the plaintiffs have standing,whether the plaintiffs claims are moot,and the constitutionality of section.see get outdoors ii,llc city of san diego,cir rosenbaum city and county of san francisco,cir.
iii.discussion 
the commissioner first argues that restrepo and the council lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of section.article iii of the constitution limits the judicial power of the united states to the resolution of cases and controversies.valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church and state,d.s tanding is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the doctrine of standing is based both on prudential concerns and on constitutional limitations on the jurisdiction of the federal courts.doran,cir.here,the plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing standing three constitutional requirements.lujan,at.first,they must establish that they suffered an injury in fact,an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at.citations,internal quotation marks,and footnote omitted.second,they must establish a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.id.third,they must establish that it is likely as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court concluded that restrepo has standing because she has suffered,and continues to suffer,economic and other forms of injury because of the requirements imposed upon nonresident insurance agents by nevada countersignature law.d at.the commissioner contends that restrepo provided no evidence of actual economic injury,and specifically notes restrepo inability to firmly connect the amount of her compensation with the sale of products insuring nevada risks.the council argues that while restrepo is a salaried employee,her overall compensation which includes a bonus based on the growth and profitability of her office is affected by section provision.in the end,we need not resolve the parties dispute over restrepo alleged economic injury because on appeal the council asserts an alternative injury,discriminatory administrative burdens placed on restrepo because of her nonresident status.while the commissioner argues that we should not consider this argument because the council raises it for the first time on appeal,we may affirm summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.doran,at.
it has long been clear that economic injury is not the only kind of injury that can support a plaintiff standing.vill.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.impairments to constitutional rights are generally deemed adequate to support a finding of injury for purposes of standing.doe sch.bd.of ouachita parish,cir.the relevant constitutional provision here is article iv,which provides that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.o ne of the privileges which the clause guarantees to citizens of state a is that of doing business in state b on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that state.toomer witsell.accordingly,here,the ability of a citizen in one state to act as an insurance agent or broker in another state must be considered a fundamental right or privilege protected by the privileges and immunities clause.silver garcia,cir council of ins.agents brokers viken,d,nonresident insurance agents and producers licensed in south dakota have a fundamental right or privilege to place insurance on terms of substantial equality with licensed resident agents.
section infringes on restrepo ability,as a licensed nonresident agent,to do business in nevada on substantially equal terms with resident agents.it is undisputed that restrepo is a resident of california,that she is licensed in nevada as a nonresident agent,and that section treats her differently than resident agents because of her residency.while section protects restrepo free and unlimited right to negotiate contracts if the policies,endorsements or evidence of those contracts covering properties or insurable interests in nevada are countersigned by a resident agent,it also requires that e very such policy or contract must be countersigned by a resident agent.section precludes restrepo from finalizing insurance contracts in nevada without the countersignature of a resident agent.in effect,section creates two classes of insurance agents in nevada,one class of licensed resident agents that can finalize insurance contracts,and a second class of licensed nonresident agents that can not.
unfortunately for restrepo,her california residency places her squarely within nevada second class of insurance agents.despite her free and unlimited right to negotiate contracts,restrepo can not do business on substantially equal terms with resident agents because she can not finalize an insurance contract without the countersignature of a resident agent.the commissioner argues that the impact on restrepo,if she is impacted at all,is only minor,as restrepo has no personal contact with the countersigning resident agents and that the only additional burden placed on her is having her staff mail the policies to obtain the resident agents signatures.however,the commissioner argument misses the mark restrepo lack of personal contact with the countersigning agent does nothing to diminish the fact that section prevents her from doing business in nevada on substantially equal terms with resident agents.even if the commissioner were right that the degree of restrepo injury should factor into our analysis,as noted in united states students challenging regulatory agency scrap,d,the court has 
allowed important interests to be vindicated by plaintiffs with no more at stake in the outcome of an action than a fraction of a vote,a fine and costs,and a poll tax the basic idea that comes out in numerous cases is that an identifiable trifle is enough to fight out a question of principle the trifle is the basis for standing and the principle provides the motivation.
id.at.internal citations omitted.here,because section precludes restrepo from doing business in nevada on substantially equal terms with resident agents,a right guaranteed to her by the privileges and immunities clause,she suffers an injury which is concrete,actual,and amounts to more than an identifiable trifle,thereby satisfying standing injury in fact requirement.
we similarly conclude that restrepo satisfies standing causation and redressability requirements.lujan,at.section causes restrepo injury by precluding her from participating in nevada insurance market on substantially equal terms with resident agents,and a favorable decision invalidating the statute redresses that injury.therefore,restrepo has standing to challenge the constitutionality of section,and having found standing,we do not consider whether the council also has standing.leonard clark,cir the general rule applicable to federal court suits with multiple plaintiffs is that once the court determines that one of the plaintiffs has standing,it need not decide the standing of the others.
the commissioner also argues on appeal that restrepo claims are moot because they no longer present a live controversy.while we generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal,internet solutions for,cir,we have an independent obligation to address whether a case is moot because it goes to the article iii jurisdiction of this court.arizonans for official english arizona,d clark city of lakewood,cir.
to qualify as a case fit for adjudication,an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a claim is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.the basic question is whether there exists a present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted.outdoor media group,city of beaumont,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.t he party moving for dismissal on mootness grounds bears a heavy burden.jacobus alaska,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.d ismissal of a case on grounds of mootness would be justified only if it were absolutely clear that the litigant no longer had any need of the judicial protection that it sought.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the commissioner argues that restrepo claims are moot because in may of,her employer,abd,acquired a insurance agency.this acquisition,the commissioner contends,provides restrepo with countersignature services,thereby eliminating the possibility of any further injury to either restrepo or abd.however,d espite superseding events,an issue is not moot if there are present effects that are legally significant.id.at.assuming,without deciding,that abd acquisition of a insurance company eliminates the possibility of economic harm to restrepo and abd,section still precludes restrepo from participating in nevada insurance market on substantially equal terms with its resident agents.restrepo remains unable to finalize an insurance contract without the countersignature of a resident agent.therefore,despite the availability of an resident agent that is willing and able to countersign policies negotiated by restrepo,section effects remain legally significant and her claims are not moot.
privileges and immunities clause of article iv 
as noted,the privileges and immunities clause of article iv provides that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.while the privileges and immunities clause cites the term citizens,for analytic purposes citizenship and residency are essentially interchangeable.supreme court of virginia friedman,d.the primary purpose of the privileges and immunities clause was to help fuse into one nation a collection of independent,sovereign states.toomer,at.the clause was intended to create a national economic union,supreme court of new hampshire piper,d,and was designed to place the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states,so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those states are concerned.friedman,at.internal quotations omitted toomer,at.
like many other constitutional provisions,the privileges and immunities clause is not an absolute.id.at.while it bars discrimination against citizens of other states where there is no substantial reason for the discrimination beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other states it does not preclude disparity of treatment in the many situations where there are perfectly valid independent reasons for it.id.therefore,we examine claims that a residency classification offends the privileges and immunities clause using a inquiry.first,we decide whether the activity in question is sufficiently basic to the livelihood of the nation as to fall within the purview of the privileges and immunities clause.friedman,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.second,if the challenged restriction deprives nonresidents of a protected privilege,we will invalidate it only if we conclude th
