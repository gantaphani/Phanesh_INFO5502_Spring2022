desert outdoor advertising,wants to display three billboards,each of which would be primarily viewed from a freeway,in oakland,california.the city of oakland has refused to permit the signs,citing specific city ordinances.desert filed this action to challenge those ordinances on first amendment grounds,seeking injunctive relief and money damages.in particular,desert argues that oakland municipal code,which generally prohibits advertising signs designed to be seen from a freeway,favors commercial over noncommercial speech and imposes restrictions on noncommercial speech.desert also contends that oakland planning code a,which limits advertising signs more generally,provides city officials with unbridled discretion to permit or deny the display of signs.finally,desert challenges the specific application of these ordinances to the signs it erected or attempted to erect.
the district court concluded that one provision of was a regulation of noncommercial speech in violation of the first amendment.it severed this provision and held that the remainder of that ordinance,as well as a,was constitutional.desert appeals.we affirm.
background 
desert challenges two separate provisions.the first ordinance is contained in the oakland municipal code omc.the second ordinance is found in the oakland planning code opc.
omc seeks to prohibit signs adjacent to freeways,several of which pass through the city.it provides that n o sign shall be erected,constructed,relocated or maintained in the city of oakland if such sign is designed to have or has the advertising thereon maintained primarily to be viewed from a freeway.there are certain specified exceptions to this ban a signs limited to identifying the name of the person,firm or corporation occupying the premises and the type of business conducted by such person,firm or corporation b signs limited to the name of the product manufactured on the premises c signs not exceeding six square feet in area and appertaining only to the lease,hire,sale,or display of the building premises and d time and temperature units.in addition,the ordinance permits signs in the heavy industrial zone as part of a billboard relocation agreement authorized by the city,subject to limitations.this freeway sign ordinance does not permit variances.
since,opc chapter,et,has banned the construction of new advertising signs anywhere within the city unlike the freeway sign ordinance described above,however,the opc provision allows for variances.originally,opc a allowed city officials to grant a variance only if four conditions were met.first,strict compliance would have to result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the purposes of the zoning restrictions,due to unique physical or topographic circumstances or conditions of design.second,strict compliance would have to deprive the applicant of the privileges enjoyed by owners of similarly zoned property.third,a variance could not adversely affect the character,livability,or appropriate development of abutting properties or the surrounding area,and could not be detrimental to the public welfare.fourth,a variance could not constitute a grant of special privilege.as described below,this ordinance was amended while this lawsuit was pending to delete the third condition.
desert erected or attempted to erect signs at three locations in oakland.at two of the locations,the company erected signs with commercial advertising unrelated to the premises.at the third location,desert applied for a variance to erect a tall,permanent structure displaying the messages volunteer to be a big brother and pray at first baptist church.this proposed sign would also be visible from a freeway.
the city concluded that desert commercial advertising violated omc and demanded the removal of those signs.the city denied desert variance application for its noncommercial signs under opc a,concluding that the proposed structure failed to meet any of the four conditions required to grant a variance.
desert sued the city,challenging the omc and the opc sign regulations under the first amendment.it argued that the ordinances lacked a sufficient statement of legislative purpose,imposed restrictions on noncommercial speech,favored commercial speech over noncommercial speech,and created a variance procedure vesting city officials with unbridled discretion to permit or deny the display of signs.in addition,desert argued that the ordinances were unconstitutional as applied to its signs.it sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the city from enforcing the ordinances and money damages under.
the city filed a motion to dismiss desert complaint,which the district court denied.both desert and the city filed motions for summary judgment.after both parties had argued their motions before the district court,the city amended the variance procedure in opc a to address the constitutional issues and to remove moot the issue.by an emergency ordinance,the city deleted the prior a requirement that a variance not adversely affect the character,livability,or appropriate development of abutting properties or the surrounding area or be detrimental to the public welfare.this was the only amendment made 
after taking judicial notice of the amended a,the district court granted in part and denied in part both parties motions.with regard to the claims on appeal,the district court held that omc did not favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech and granted the city motion for summary judgment on this claim.the court held one provision of exception for time and temperature severed that provision and left the remainder of intact.the court ruled against desert challenge of the opc a variance procedure because the city amendment eliminated any potentially impermissible criteria.finally,the court denied desert challenges.
both parties filed motions for reconsideration.the district court denied the motions,and desert filed a timely notice of appeal.

omc signs visible from freeways 
the facial challenge 
sign ordinances are unconstitutional if they impose greater restrictions on noncommercial speech than on commercial speech or if they regulate noncommercial speech based on content.metromedia,city of san diego,d plurality.travel city of lake oswego,cir.desert contends that omc is unconstitutional on its face because it violates both of these limitations.the premise of desert argument is that applies to signs with noncommercial messages.the city disputes that premise,contending that does not limit noncommercial speech at all.the district court agreed with the city interpretation of the ordinance,and so do we.
to begin with,we note,as did the district court,that we are obligated to interpret a statute,if it is fairly possible,in a manner that renders it constitutionally valid.see office of senator mark dayton hanson,d the ecology center castaneda,cir.the city interpretation of is plausible.
section provides that n o sign shall be erected,constructed,relocated or maintained in the city of oakland if such sign is designed to have or has the advertising thereon maintained primarily to be viewed from a freeway.emphasis added.thus,bans only signs bearing advertising.
though the omc does not define the term advertising by itself,it does define advertising sign in omc any sign,poster,placard,device,graphic display,or any other form of advertising promoting the sale of a commodity which is not sold,produced,conducted,or offered by any activity on the same lot.speech promoting the sale of a commodity is commercial speech.bolger youngs drug prods,d.the definition of advertising sign does not appear to cover noncommercial speech at all.
it is appropriate for the city to apply the same the reference to advertising does not encompass noncommercial that word as it is used in.see freeman gonzales,cir holding that we should interpret statutes to be coherent and internally consistent.
the notion that advertising as used in the omc refers only to commercial speech is supported by the city implementation and interpretation of.see forsyth county,nationalist movement,d in evaluating respondent facial challenge,we must consider the county authoritative constructions of the ordinance,including its own implementation and interpretation of it.evidence provided by the city indicates that it does not construe,nor has it ever construed advertising as set forth in the omc,to apply to noncommercial speech.
desert argues that prevents a variety of noncommercial messages,including pray on sunday for your soul,give to our blood drive here on tuesday,register to vote here or elect jane doe.this argument regarding hypothetical signs is not supported by the record,however.the city did not in fact apply to turn down desert application to erect signs bearing the noncommercial messages volunteer to be a big brother and pray at first baptist church.the city applied only the opc regulations,denying desert application without any reference to.the opc provides that an opc variance application can not be processed until any issues relating to the omc have been resolved.thus,if regulated noncommercial speech,the city would presumably have applied that ordinance before reviewing desert opc variance application.it did not.
desert also argues that contains exceptions for some noncommercial speech,which would be unnecessary if did not regulate noncommercial speech in the first instance.a similar argument was made by the plaintiff in national advertising city of orange,cir.in that case,a municipality billboard ordinance was challenged on the ground that the ordinance,while allegedly aimed only at commercial speech,allowed exceptions for some noncommercial speech.id.at.the contested ordinance banned all general or billboard advertising signs in the city but exempted governmental signs and flags,memorial tablets,recreational signs,and temporary political,real estate,construction,and advertising signs.id.while the city argued that the ordinance prohibition was limited to commercial speech,we held that the ban many noncommercial exceptions would be rendered meaningless by the city interpretation.id.at.
desert argues that is analogous to the unconstitutional ordinance in national advertising in light of its allegedly noncommercial exceptions.but does not contain any exceptions resembling the national advertising exceptions for obviously noncommercial signs,like governmental signs and flags or memorial tablets.the only arguably exceptions to are those allowing the name of the person,firm or corporation occupying the premises and the type of business conducted by such person,firm or corporation the name of the product manufactured on the premises signs of a certain size that appertain only to the lease,hire,sale,or display of the building or premises and time and temperature units.placing the exception for time and temperature units aside for the moment,none of the other exceptions compels a finding that the use of advertising in covers noncommercial speech.all of them could apply to signs that are commercial in nature,so these exceptions do not render meaningless the city position that only applies to commercial speech.id.at.
the severed exception for time and temperature displays is somewhat different,since time and temperature information is not itself advertising and is inherently noncommercial.we do not conclude,however,that by providing an exception for time and temperature units,the city of oakland necessarily expressed an intent that the ordinance should apply to noncommercial speech or contradicted its interpretation of the ordinance as applying only to commercial advertising.time and temperature displays are commonly used to attract attention to commercial messages contained on the same sign.often,time and temperature information is included on signs displaying the name of the business located at the location of the sign,such as a bank.that display of the name of the commercial business could fall within the exception under.the city may have provided an exception for time and temperature units in simply to make clear that it was permissible to include time and temperature displays as part of commercial signs.though it could be argued that the exception for time and temperature was unnecessary if the ordinance only applies to commercial speech,the redundancy was both understandable and insignificant.the time and temperature exception is not enough to demonstrate that the city intended to apply to noncommercial speech.
because can be fairly read to regulate only commercial speech,and because it can function effectively if so limited,we conclude that the ordinance does not impose any restrictions on noncommercial speech.this forecloses desert claim that impermissibly favors commercial over noncommercial speech and regulates noncommercial speech based upon content.
severance of time and temperature exception 
the district court severed exception for time and temperature displays after holding that it imposed an unconstitutional,restriction on noncommercial speech by favoring one form of noncommercial speech,time and temperature,over other forms of noncommercial speech.the city does not appeal that decision desert contends this severance was an improper solution to the identified problem with the time and temperature exception,because severing the provision resulted in more speech being restricted than if the time and temperature exception remained in place.
desert argument relies on rappa new castle county,cir.in rappa,the third circuit refused to sever an unconstitutional exception to a sign ordinance when doing so would subject more speech to regulation than was formerly permissible under the statute.id.at eliminating the offending exception would mean that we would be requiring the state to restrict more speech than it currently does.we do not need to decide whether we would adopt the holding of rappa,because the situations are not the same.severing the exception for time and temperature displays did not cause to restrict more speech.since noncommercial speech is not covered under at all,eliminating the exception had no actual impact on the legality of time and temperature displays under that ordinance.
desert challenge 
an challenge contends that a law is unconstitutional as applied to a litigant particular speech activity,even though the law may be capable of valid application to others.foti city of menlo park,cir.desert purports to raise an challenge to omc,but it misunderstands the nature of such challenges.challenges are not based solely on the application of an allegedly unconstitutional law to a particular litigant.rather,they separately argue that discriminatory enforcement of a speech restriction amounts to viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment.id.emphasis added.it is for this reason that a successful challenge does not render the law itself invalid but only the particular application of the law.id.an challenge goes to the nature of the application rather than the nature of the law itself.
desert does not argue that the city refusal to let it maintain its commercial advertising resulted from discriminatory enforcement nor could it.omc provides a flat ban on such advertising and does not allow for variances.city officials thus had no discretion when applying to desert signs,and desert can not show that the city particular application of the law evidenced any degree of subjectivity or undue discretion.foti,at.we thus reject desert purported challenge of and affirm the finding of the district court with regard to that challenge.
opc a restrictions on advertising signs generally 
the amended ordinance 
as described above,while this case was before the district court,the city amended the variance procedure to address the constitutional issues and to remove moot the issue.the city later extended the duration of the amendment until days after a final decision from the court of appeals,when the city council will adopt permanent amendments to the planning code municipal code regarding the subject matter of this ordinance for codification.
