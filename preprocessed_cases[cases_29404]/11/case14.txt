under georgia hospital authorities law law,political subdivisions may create public entities called hospital authorities to provide for the operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the several counties and municipalities of th e state.the law permits authorities to exercise public and essential governmental functions and delegates to them numerous general powers,including the ability to acquire and lease hospitals and other public health facilities.code ann.
the hospital authority of county authority owns phoebe putney memorial hospital memorial,one of two hospitals in the county.the authority formed two private nonprofit corporations to manage memorial phoebe putney health system,pphs and phoebe putney memorial hospital,ppmh.after the authority decided to purchase the second hospital in the county and lease it to a subsidiary of pphs,the federal trade commission ftc issued an administrative complaint alleging that the transaction would substantially reduce competition in the market for hospital services,in violation of of the federal trade commission act and of the clayton act.the ftc and georgia subsequently sued the authority,pphs,ppmh,and others collectively respondents,seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative proceedings.the district court denied the request for a preliminary injunction and granted respondents motion to dismiss,holding that respondents are immune from antitrust liability under the doctrine.the eleventh circuit affirmed.it concluded that the authority,as a local governmental entity,was entitled to immunity because the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a foreseeable result of the law.the court reasoned that the state legislature could have readily anticipated an anticompetitive effect,given the breadth of the powers delegated to hospital authorities,particularly leasing and acquisition powers that could lead to consolidation of hospital ownership.

that principle controls here.grants of general corporate power allowing substate governmental entities to participate in a competitive marketplace are typically used without raising federal antitrust concerns,so a state can not be said to have contemplated that such powers will be used anticompetitively.here,though the law allows the authority to acquire hospitals,it does not clearly articulate and affirmatively express a state policy empowering the authority to make acquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially lessen competition.
c in concluding otherwise,the eleventh circuit applied the concept of foreseeability too loosely.this court,recognizing that no legislature can be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects of a statute delegating authority to a substate governmental entity,hallie,at,has approached the inquiry practically,but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the state must have affirmatively contemplated the displacement of competition such that the challenged anticompetitive effects can be attributed to the state itself,parker,at.thus,the court has found a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the inherent,logical,or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature.in that scenario,the state must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.see hallie,at omni,at.by contrast,when a state grants an entity a general power to act,it does so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law.entities might transgress antitrust requirements by exercising their powers anticompetitively,but a reasonable legislature ability to anticipate that possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an affirmative state policy to displace competition.the eleventh circuit argument,echoed by respondents,that the case falls within the foreseeability standard used in hallie and omni is rejected.
d respondents additional arguments are also unpersuasive.they contend that because hospital authorities are granted unique powers and responsibilities to fulfill georgia objective of providing access to adequate and affordable health care,it was foreseeable that they would decide that the best way to serve their communities was to acquire an existing local hospital,instead of incurring the additional expense and regulatory burden of expanding,or constructing,a facility.but even though the authorities may differ from private corporations offering hospital services,neither the law nor any other provision clearly articulates a state policy allowing authorities to exercise their general corporate powers without regard to anticompetitive effects.respondents also contend that when there is doubt about whether the test is satisfied,federal courts should err on the side of recognizing immunity to avoid improper interference with state policy choices.but the law here is not ambiguous,and respondents suggestion is inconsistent with the principle that immunity is disfavored,ticor title,at.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
under this court immunity doctrine,when a local governmental entity acts pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition,it is exempt from scrutiny under the federal antitrust laws.in this case,we must decide whether a georgia law that creates public entities called hospital authorities and gives those entities general corporate powers,including the power to acquire hospitals,clearly articulates and affirmatively expresses a state policy to permit acquisitions that substantially lessen competition.because georgia grant of general corporate powers to hospital authorities does not include permission to use those powers anticompetitively,we hold that the test is not satisfied and immunity does not apply.
in,the state of georgia amended its constitution to allow political subdivisions to provide health care services.laws.the state concurrently enacted the hospital authorities law law,at.code ann.et,to provide a mechanism for the operation and maintenance of needed health care facilities in the several counties and municipalities of th e state.a.the purpose of the constitutional provision and the statute based thereon was to create an organization which could carry out and make more workable the duty which the state owed to its indigent sick.dejarnette hospital auth.of albany,citations omitted.as amended,the law authorizes each county and municipality,and certain combinations of counties or municipalities,to create a public body corporate and politic called a hospital authority.a,d.hospital authorities are governed by to boards that are appointed by the governing body of the county or municipality in their area of operation.a.
under the law,a hospital authority exercise s public and essential governmental functions and is delegated all the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the law purposes.giving more content to that general delegation,the law enumerates powers conferred upon hospital authorities,including the power t o acquire by purchase,lease,or otherwise and to operate projects,which are defined to include hospitals and other public health facilities,t o construct,reconstruct,improve,alter,and repair projects,t o lease for operation by others any project provided certain conditions are satisfied,and t o establish rates and charges for the services and use of the facilities of the authority,hospital authorities may not operate or construct any project for profit,and accordingly they must set rates so as only to cover operating expenses and create reasonable reserves.
in the same year that the law was adopted,the city of albany and dougherty county established the hospital authority of county authority and the authority promptly acquired phoebe putney memorial hospital memorial,which has been in operation in albany since.in,the authority restructured its operations by forming two private nonprofit corporations to manage memorial phoebe putney health system,pphs,and its subsidiary,phoebe putney memorial hospital,ppmh.the authority leased memorial to ppmh for per year for years.under the lease,ppmh has exclusive authority over the operation of memorial,including the ability to set rates for services.consistent with,ppmh is subject to lease conditions that require provision of care to the indigent sick and limit its rate of return.
memorial is one of two hospitals in dougherty county.the second,palmyra medical center palmyra,was established in albany in and is located just two miles from memorial.at the time suit was brought in this case,palmyra was operated by a national hospital network,hca,hca.together,memorial and palmyra account for percent of the market for hospital services provided to commercial health care plans and their customers in the six counties surrounding albany.memorial accounts for percent of that market on its own.
in,pphs began discussions with hca about acquiring palmyra.following negotiations,pphs presented the authority with a plan under which the authority would purchase palmyra with pphs controlled funds and then lease palmyra to a pphs subsidiary for per year under the memorial lease agreement.the authority unanimously approved the transaction.
the federal trade commission ftc shortly thereafter issued an administrative complaint alleging that the proposed transaction would create a virtual monopoly and would substantially reduce competition in the market for hospital services,in violation of of the federal trade commission act,stat,and of the clayton act,stat.the ftc,along with the state of georgia subsequently filed suit against the authority,hca,palmyra,pphs,ppmh,and the new pphs subsidiary created to manage palmyra collectively respondents,seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative proceedings.see,b.
the united states district court for the middle district of georgia denied the request for a preliminary injunction and granted respondents motion to dismiss.supp.the district court held that respondents are immune from antitrust liability under the doctrine.see,at.
the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed.as an initial matter,the court agree d with the ftc that,on the facts alleged,the joint operation of memorial and palmyra would substantially lessen competition or tend to create,if not create,a monopoly.at.but the court that the transaction was immune from antitrust liability.see,at.the court of appeals explained that as a local governmental entity,the authority was entitled to immunity if the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a foreseeable result of georgia legislation,at.according to the court,anticompetitive conduct is foreseeable if it could have been reasonably anticipated by the state legislature it is not necessary,the court reasoned,for an anticompetitive effect to be one that ordinarily occurs,routinely occurs,or is inherently likely to occur as a result of the empowering legislation.at quoting ftc hospital bd.of directors of lee.applying that standard,the court of appeals concluded that the law contemplated the anticompetitive conduct challenged by the ftc.the court noted the impressive breadth of the powers given to hospital authorities,which include traditional powers of private corporations and a few additional capabilities,such as the power to exercise eminent domain.see,at.more specifically,the court reasoned that the georgia legislature must have anticipated that the grant of power to hospital authorities to acquire and lease projects would produce anticompetitive effects because f oreseeably,acquisitions could consolidate ownership of competing hospitals,eliminating competition between them.at 
the court of appeals also rejected the ftc alternative argument that immunity did not apply because the transaction in substance involved a transfer of control over palmyra from one private entity to another,with the authority acting as a mere conduit for the sale to evade antitrust liability.see,at.
we granted certiorari on two questions whether the georgia legislature,through the powers it vested in hospital authorities,clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed a state policy to displace competition in the market for hospital services and if so,whether immunity is nonetheless inapplicable as a result of the authority minimal participation in negotiating the terms of the sale of palymra and the authority limited supervision of the two hospitals operations.see.concluding that the answer to the first question is no,we reverse without reaching the second question 
in parker brown,this court held that because nothing in the language of the sherman act et or in its history suggested that congress intended to restrict the sovereign capacity of the states to regulate their economies,the act should not be read to bar states from imposing market restraints as an act of government.at.following parker,we have held that under certain circumstances,immunity from the federal antitrust laws may extend to nonstate actors carrying out the state regulatory program.see patrick burget,southern motor carriers rate conference,united states.
but given the fundamental national values of free enterprise and economic competition that are embodied in the federal antitrust laws,immunity is disfavored,much as are repeals by implication.ftc ticor title ins.consistent with this preference,we recognize immunity only when it is clear that the challenged anticompetitive conduct is undertaken pursuant to a regulatory scheme that is the state own.at.accordingly,c loser analysis is required when the activity at issue is not directly that of the state itself,but rather is carried out by others pursuant to state authorization.hoover ronwin.when determining whether the anticompetitive acts of private parties are entitled to immunity,we employ a test,requiring first that the challenged restraint be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,and second that the policy be actively supervised by the state.california retail liquor dealers midcal aluminum,internal quotation marks omitted.
this case involves allegedly anticompetitive conduct undertaken by a substate governmental entity.because municipalities and other political subdivisions are not themselves sovereign,immunity under parker does not apply to them directly.see columbia omni outdoor advertising,lafay ette louisiana power light,plurality opinion.at the same time,however,substate governmental entities do receive immunity from antitrust scrutiny when they act pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service.at this rule preserves to the states their freedom to use their municipalities to administer state regulatory policies free of the inhibitions of the federal antitrust laws without at the same time permitting purely parochial interests to disrupt the nation goals.at.
as with private parties,immunity will only attach to the activities of local governmental entities if they are undertaken pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition.community communications boulder.but unlike private parties,such entities are not subject to the active state supervision requirement because they have less of an incentive to pursue their own under the guise of implementing state policies.hallie eau claire,
t o pass the clear articulation test,a state legislature need not expressly state in a statute or its legislative history that the legislature intends for the delegated action to have anticompetitive effects.at.rather,we explained in hallie that immunity applies if the anticompetitive effect was the foreseeable result of what the state authorized,at.we applied that principle in omni,where we concluded that the test was satisfied because the suppression of competition in the billboard market was the foreseeable result of a state statute authorizing municipalities to adopt zoning ordinances regulating the construction of buildings and other structures,at.
applying the test to the law before us,we conclude that respondents claim for immunity fails because there is no evidence the state affirmatively contemplated that hospital authorities would displace competition by consolidating hospital ownership.the acquisition and leasing powers exercised by the authority in the challenged transaction,which were the principal powers relied upon by the court of appeals in finding immunity,see,at,mirror general powers routinely conferred by state law upon private corporations other powers possessed by hospital authorities that the court of appeals characterized as having impressive breadth,at,also fit this pattern,including the ability to make and execute contracts,to set rates for services,to sue and be sued,to borrow money,and the residual authority to exercise any or all powers possessed by private corporations.
our case law makes clear that authority to act is insufficient to establish immunity the substate governmental entity must also show that it has been delegated authority to act or regulate anticompetitively.see omni,at.in boulder,we held that colorado home rule amendment allowing municipalities to govern local affairs did not satisfy the test,at.there was no doubt in that case that the city had authority as a matter of state law to pass an ordinance imposing a moratorium on a cable provider expansion of service,at.but we rejected the proposition that the general grant of power to enact ordinances necessarily implies state authorization to enact specific anticompetitive ordinances because such an approach would wholly eviscerate the concepts of clear articulation and affirmative expression that our precedents require.at.we explained that when a state position is one of mere neutrality respecting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive,the state can not be said to have contemplated those anticompetitive actions,at.
the principle articulated in boulder controls this case.grants of general corporate power that allow substate governmental entities to participate in a competitive marketplace should be,can be,and typically are used in ways that raise no federal antitrust concerns.as a result,a state that has delegated such general powers can hardly be said to have contemplated that they will be used anticompetitively.ibid.see also areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,ed.hereinafter areeda hovenkamp when a state grants power to an inferior entity,it presumably grants the power to do the thing contemplated,but not to do so anticompetitively thus,while the law does allow the authority to acquire hospitals,it does not clearly articulate and affirmatively express a state policy empowering the authority to make acquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially lessen competition.
in concluding otherwise,and specifically in reasoning that the georgia legislature must have anticipated that acquisitions by hospital authorities would produce anticompetitive effects,at,the court of appeals applied the concept of foreseeability from our test too loosely.
in hallie,we recognized that it would embod y an unrealistic view of how legislatures work and of how statutes are written to require state legislatures to explicitly authorize specific anticompetitive effects before immunity could apply,at.no legislature,we explained,can be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects of a statute delegating authority to a substate governmental entity.ibid.instead,we have approached the inquiry more practically,but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the state must have affirmatively contemplated the displacement of competition such that the challenged anticompetitive effects can be attributed to the state itself.parker,at.thus,we have concluded that a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the inherent,logical,or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature.in that scenario,the state must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.
for example,in hallie,wisconsin statutory law regulating the municipal provision of sewage services expressly permitted cities to limit their service to surrounding unincorporated areas.see,at.while unincorporated towns alleged that the city exercise of that power constituted an unlawful tying arrangement,an unlawful refusal to deal,and an abuse of monopoly power,we had no trouble concluding that these alleged anticompetitive effects were affirmatively contemplated by the state because it was clear that they logically would result from the grant of authority,at.as described by the wisconsin supreme court,the state legislature viewed annexation by the city of a surrounding unincorporated area as a reasonable quid pro quo that a city could require before extending sewer services to the area.at,quoting hallie chippewa falls.without immunity,federal antitrust law could have undermined that arrangement and taken completely off the table the policy option that the state clearly intended for cities to have.
similarly,in omni,where the respondents alleged that the city had used its zoning power to protect an incumbent billboard provider against competition,we found that the test was easily satisfied even though the state statutes delegating zoning authority to the city did not explicitly permit the suppression of competition.we explained that t he very purpose of zoning regulation is to displace unfettered business freedom in a manner that regularly has the effect of preventing normal acts of competition and that a zoning ordinance regulating the size,location,and spacing of billboards necessarily protects exist
