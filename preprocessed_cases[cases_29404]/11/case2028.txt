auctioneers are usually neither buyers nor sellers,but agents for both while they are obviously engaged in sales,the only thing they sell for their own account is their services the items they auction are generally sold for others.in this case,the court of appeals held an auto auctioneer could be liable in both strict liability and negligence for auctioning a defective car.but law requires those who place products in the stream of commerce to stand behind them it does not require everyone who facilitates the stream to do the same.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
the ford explorer at issue here was repossessed by a finance company,who consigned it for sale in houston by big h auto auction big h sold the car at auction for on october,receiving a fee of from the seller and from the buyer.when the buyer discovered a discrepancy in the car odometer a quick arbitration was held and an arbitrator found big h had made a clerical error,rescinded the sale,and ordered big h to buy the car back.big h took title to the car and sold it again at auction on october,for to houston auto auction,which auctioned the car a week later to progresso motors which sold it three days later to jose angel hernandez gonzalez in progresso,texas.about a year later,gonzalez was killed in a rollover accident in mexico.
twelve plaintiffs gonzalez wife,parents,children,and six others whose relationship to him is unclear filed suit in hidalgo county against the car manufacturer ford motor,tire manufacturer,progresso motors,and the two auto auctioneers.the trial court granted summary judgment for big h and severed that claim.the court of appeals reversed,finding big h was not entitled to summary judgment on either the plaintiffs strict liability or negligence claims we address each claim in turn.
ii.strict liability 
modern american law is derived primarily from section of the second restatement of torts the most influential section of any restatement of the law on any topic,and perhaps in all of tort jurisprudence this court adopted section in in mckisson sales affiliates,holding those who sell defective products strictly liable for physical harm they cause to consumers 
from the beginning,section did not apply to everyone.by its own terms,section limits strict liability to those engaged in the business of selling a product 
one who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer,or to his property,if 
a the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product,and 
b it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold 
like many other short statements of legal doctrine,this one has been construed through the years to mean both more and less than what the plain words appear to say.for example,although section appears to limit recovery to users or consumers of a defective product,we long ago extended it to innocent bystanders as well similarly,section explicitly applies only to those whose business is selling a product,but from the outset we have applied it more broadly.thus,in mckisson itself we held strictly liable a distributor who handed out free samples,reasoning that the samples were distributed with the expectation of profiting therefrom through future sales.since then,we have applied strict liability to manufacturers distributors lessors bailors and dealers 
on the other hand,we have limited the scope of those engaged in the business of selling to those who actually placed a product in the stream of commerce imposition of strict liability demands more than an incidental role in the overall marketing program of the product.an advertising agency that provides copy,a newspaper that distributes circulars,an internet provider that lists store locations,and a trucking business that makes deliveries all might be engaged in product sales,but they do not themselves sell the products.since mckisson,we have applied strict liability only to businesses that are in the same position as one who sells the product.
the reason for this limitation arises from the justifications for strict liability itself,namely compensating injured consumers,spreading potential losses,and deterring future injuries businesses that play only an incidental role in a product placement are rarely in a position to deter future injuries by changing a product design or warnings.if required to spread risks,they must do so across far more products than the one that was defective.and while many businesses may be able to pay compensation,consumers normally expect a product manufacturer to be the one who stands behind it.
the third restatement of torts adopted in recognized these developments in products law,expanding strict liability to those engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing products,and defining those terms as a business that either transfers ownership or provides the product.in a comment,the third restatement specifically excluded auctioneers 
persons assisting or providing services to product distributors,while indirectly facilitating the commercial distribution of products,are not subject to liability under the rules of this restatement.thus,commercial firms engaged in advertising products are outside the rules of this restatement,as are firms engaged exclusively in the financing of product sale or lease transactions.sales personnel and commercial auctioneers are also outside the rules of this restatement 
nevertheless,the court of appeals held section applied to auctioneers because texas law requires only that the defendant be responsible for introducing the product into the stream of commerce.it is true we have sometimes referred to strictly liable defendants as introducing products into the stream of commerce although more often we have referred to them as placing them in that current as has the legislature but both concepts were intended to describe producers,not mere announcers like an auctioneer or an emcee at a trade show who introduces a product to a crowd but has nothing to do with making it 
the court of appeals also pointed to chapter of the civil practices and remedies code to support its conclusion.but that chapter was not intended to replace section or the common law except in limited circumstances moreover,its broad definitions were drafted to provide indemnity for all retailers,even if they are not proper defendants in an underlying products claim to the extent chapter addresses product claims generally,it reflects a legislative intent to restrict liability for defective products to those who manufacture them 
the plaintiffs counsel concedes that auctioneers are generally not sellers under section,but distinguished this case because big h actually held title to the explorer when it was finally sold at auction.but it was undisputed that big h normally never took title to the cars it auctioned,and did so here only because an arbitrator ordered it to do so.section applies to those whose business is selling,not everyone who makes an occasional sale 
courts in other jurisdictions have consistently held that auctioneers are not subject to section we agree,and hold that because big h was not in the business of selling automobiles for its own account,it can not be held strictly liable.
iii.negligence 
the plaintiffs alleged big h was negligent in failing to replace the tires on this explorer pursuant to a recall issued a few weeks before the auction took place.we agree with the trial court that big h had no such duty on the facts here.
the existence of a legal duty is a question of law for the court in determining whether a duty should be recognized,we consider a number of factors including the risk of injury compared to the burden on the defendant and social utility of the conduct involved we have also considered whether one party has superior knowledge of the risk,or a right to control the actor whose conduct precipitated the harm 
unquestionably,ignoring a recall may run the risk of severe injury.but there are a huge number of recalls and the risks they involve varies widely federal law generally places the duty on manufacturers of products to report potential defects,notify the public,and make necessary repairs 
by contrast,imposing a duty on auto auctioneers to discover and repair defects would require them to go into a side business other than their own.the evidence establishes that big h auctions about vehicles each week,with many of them moving on and off the premises in a matter of hours.it does not inspect or repair vehicles unless a customer specifically requests and pays for such services.many of the cars sold at its auctions need repairs,and some have to be towed on and off the auction block.
moreover,big h does not sell to the public.only licensed,bonded,commercial dealers are permitted to buy or sell vehicles at big h auctions.accordingly,whatever access to recall information big h may have,the dealers who buy at the auction,prepare the cars for display,and sell them to the public would have at least the same access.moreover,big h knowledge is clearly inferior to that of the car and tire manufacturers the plaintiffs sued for these same defects,and there is no indication that big h had any control over how those manufacturers made their products.
additionally,big h made no warranties of its own at the auction,serving merely as a conduit for warranties made by sellers.the car here was sold under a red light,indicating the car was being sold as is.generally,those who buy a product as is accept the risk of potential defects,and thus can not claim a seller negligence caused their injuries imposing a different duty here would effectively prohibit car dealers from selling cars as is.and as one federal court has pointed out,imposing such a duty on auctioneers would seem to require imposing it on every person who ever sold a used car,as there is no sensible or just stopping point.we decline to impose so sweeping a duty.
the plaintiffs summary judgment response included deposition testimony from a representative of houston auto auction the buyer from big h that had he possessed actual knowledge of the defect here which he denied,he would have done something to at least give notice to the buyer that there are firestone tires,do drive on them,or take them off.but houston auto auction was more than a mere auctioneer its business included buying and selling cars for its own account,and it made sales to the general public as well as dealers.moreover,one moral duty to warn of known dangers does not impose a legal duty to discover and remedy unknown dangers too 
accordingly,the court of appeals erred in concluding big h owed the plaintiffs a duty under either section or in negligence.we reverse the court of appeals judgment and reinstate the trial court judgment for big
