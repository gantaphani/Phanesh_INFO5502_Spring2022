background 
the general store is an aptly named retailer in spokane,washington.the general store maintains a federal firearms dealers license in order to sell,among its many wares,and ammunition.
the gun control act of and related regulations impose certain requirements on federal firearms licensees.two provisions are pertinent to this appeal.first,the gun control act specifies record keeping requirements,including maintaining such records of importation,production,shipment,receipt,sale,or other disposition of firearms at the place of business for such period,and in such form,as the attorney general may by regulations prescribe.g a.the regulations,in turn,prescribe that licensed firearms dealers must enter into a record each receipt and disposition of firearms.e.the regulations include a form for the called an acquisition and disposition requires specific information be gathered and recorded.see id.second,licensed firearms dealers may not conduct transactions that violate state law.b.for example,washington law requires that firearms dealers send a copy of all handgun applications to the chief of police of the municipality or the sheriff of the county of which the purchaser is a resident.under the licensing provisions of the gun control act,the attorney general has the authority to revoke any license issued under this section if the holder of such license has willfully violated any provision of the act or the related regulations.e.
the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf,as well as state officials,periodically sends letters to all firearms dealers with information about federal and state laws and instructions for compliance.two such letters preceded the violations at issue here.in november,the atf issued an open letter to all washington federal firearms licensees regarding compliance with the permanent provisions of the brady law,t.the letter instructed licensees to contact the chief law enforcement officer in the jurisdiction of the purchaser residence,in accordance with state law requirements to conduct background checks for handgun transactions.an undated letter,labeled a correction notice,clarified a point about concealed pistol licenses and reaffirmed the brady act requirement that l icensees should continue to contact the chief law enforcement officer in the jurisdiction of the purchaser residence to request a background check for handgun purchasers who do not have any concealed pistol license.
in,the atf inspected the general store and issued a report of violations.the atf cited the general store for three separate record keeping violations and,most notably,one violation of the receipt and disposition requirement,e the subsection e violation was because o ne firearm acquisition and dispositions were not recorded l icensee used sale date,not actual transfer date for dispositions recording some dispositions prior to actual transfer and l icensee failed to record actual date of receipt of firearms.the atf instructed the general store to establish controls to ensure all future entries are correct no later than may.following the inspection,the atf held a warning conference on june,in which representatives met with william barany,the general store president,to discuss the manner in which the general store plan s to prevent these violations from.
the atf next inspected the general store in and issued a report of violations on october.the atf cited the general store for violations of,and e.significantly,there was a repeat violation of e for one unlogged firearm that was leaning against the general store counter it was a customer gun obtained for repair.the atf required the following corrective action 
immediately record all acquisition information on firearms that have remained on premises overnight.implement internal controls as was discussed during the june,warning conference.firearms acquired for gunsmithing,repairs,sights,or any other reason should be recorded by some one sic or in some way so that firearms returned or otherwise disposed on a different business day can be recorded,as required by the gun control act.
after the inspection,the general store began using a firearms repair log to track firearms acquired for repair.the instruction to be sure to log in all firearms received for repair and log them out on delivery is written in large font diagonally across the front cover of the firearms repair log.in smaller font,at the bottom of the front cover,is another written instruction 
important delivery information 
if any firearm logged into this gunsmith firearms repair log is delivered to anyone other than the person who brought it in for repair,an entry must be made in your permanent firearms acquisition and disposition book bound book,and a form filled out and filed just as though the gun had been sold.note in the date returned column of this book for the gun being delivered to see the entry in the acquisition and disposition book for the person delivered to.see the example on the back cover of this repair log.
the atf inspected the general store yet again in january.finding more violations,richard van loan van loan,director of industry operations for the seattle field division of the atf,issued a notice of revocation of the general store federal firearms license on august.the general store received an administrative hearing in early.van loan issued the final notice of revocation of firearms license,with his findings and conclusions,on february.van loan based the final revocation on the following five violations

the general store filed a timely petition for de novo judicial review in district court as provided by f.the general store requested that van loan stay the revocation pending judicial review pursuant to f and van loan denied the request.on for summary judgment,the district court upheld the first and fifth violations,and the revocation of the general store license.
definition of willfully under the gun control act 
in evaluating the general store admitted violations,the district court looked to the definition of willfully set out in perri department of the treasury,bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms when a dealer understands the requirements of the law,but knowingly fails to follow them or was indifferent to them,cir.the general store argues that this interpretation is inconsistent with the definition of willfully recently articulated by the supreme court in safeco.at.
