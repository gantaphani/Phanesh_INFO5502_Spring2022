plaintiffs reyn pasta bella,llc jeffrey ledon deweese barry leonard,dba critter fritters and,dba eddie rickenbacker appeal from the dismissal of their complaint seeking damages and injunctive relief for defendants alleged antitrust violations.they claim that defendants visa usa,visa mastercard international,mastercard bank of america,usa wells fargo bank na and bank,a subsidiary of bancorp fixed prices on credit and transactions in violation of section of the sherman act,the district court found that plaintiffs claims were released by the class action settlement in in re visa antitrust,d i,aff sub,stores,visa usa,cir ii.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.we hold that issue preclusion bars plaintiffs from the courts determination that plaintiffs claims were properly released.we also hold,in the alternative,that plaintiffs claims are extinguished by the settlement because the two actions share an identical factual predicate.since plaintiffs chose not to file an amended complaint based on acts occurring after the time period covered by the release,the district court correctly dismissed their action.
facts and procedural history 
plaintiffs here purport to represent all merchants nationwide who currently have a contract with one or more of visa and mastercard member banks for credit and debit transactions.to understand plaintiffs claims,it is necessary to describe how a consumer pays for goods with a credit card or debit card 
visa and mastercard do not issue credit cards and debit cards directly.rather,they coordinate the issuance of credit and debit cards by their members,which include many of the nation largest banks,under common card brands and rules.
their member banks play two roles in a sale of goods to a visa or mastercard user.first,one of their members the issuing bank issues the consumer his or her credit or debit card.second,it or another visa or mastercard member bank the acquiring bank contracts with the merchant to accept payment through visa or mastercard 
as described in the footnoted hypothetical,the typical transaction involves more than a consumer buying goods from a merchant.the transaction is actually a chain of transactions among the merchant,who sells the goods to the acquiring bank,who sells the goods to the issuing bank,who sells the goods to the consumer.at each step,the buyer must purchase the goods at a price lower than its selling make no profit.
allege that by defendants and their member banks of the interchange rate at results in the merchant upstream receiving less for its goods from the acquiring bank.less,that is,than the merchant would receive were there to be competition at the level and the rate were to be driven down to or less by such competition.the lower the cost of the interchange rate,the less would have to be taken discounted from the merchant.plaintiffs thus claim to have stated a cause of action for under section of the sherman act.
defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim.the court granted in part,and denied in part,defendants motions.pertinent here,the court held that plaintiffs had stated a claim for on the theory described above.see reyn pasta bella,d.the court dismissed or struck each of plaintiffs other substantive allegations.see id.at.
meanwhile,in the eastern district of new york,the lead plaintiffs in the class action had negotiated a global settlement of that class claims.see i,d at.there,the court had certified a nationwide class of plaintiffs under rule b.see in re visa check,at.the class consisted of all merchants who were forced to accept visa and mastercard debit cards as a condition of accepting their credit cards from october,to june.see,notice of settlement of class action june.the class thus included every member of the putative class action that plaintiffs bring here in,the plaintiffs alleged that visa and mastercard obtained excessive discount fees in the hypothetical above by tying their debit cards to their credit cards and conspiring to monopolize the market.see i,d at.on the eve of trial,the class action settled for more than three billion dollars and significant injunctive relief.see id.at.the settlement agreements include releases that purport to absolve visa,mastercard,and the banks of all antitrust liability arising out of conduct,prior to january,that is related to the claims asserted in the class action.
plaintiffs were class members.rather than opt out of the class,they appeared through counsel at the settlement fairness hearing and raised several objections.on december,the i court approved the settlement over their objections.see i,d at,aff,at.in approving the settlement,the i court expressly determined that plaintiffs claims were released.see id.at.
in june,defendants renewed their motions to dismiss and asserted that the release in the proposed settlement would bar plaintiffs claims once it was approved.on october,the district court heard argument on the effect of the release.then,on january,the court ordered plaintiffs to show cause why their action should not be dismissed.after further briefing,the court dismissed plaintiffs complaint with prejudice on march.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
the application of issue preclusion and claim preclusion is reviewed de novo.frank united airlines,cir.while the court order of dismissal does not explicitly state that it is applying issue preclusion,we may affirm on any ground that is supported by the record.see,mcclure life ins.of no,cir.
first,we hold that plaintiffs may not collaterally attack the settlement.a class member who is represented by counsel during a class action settlement hearing can not attack the settlement collaterally dosier miami valley broadcasting,cir citing hansberry lee.here,plaintiffs appearance through counsel at the fairness hearing binds them to the settlement and all of its preclusive effects.
the district court correctly dismissed plaintiffs action as barred by the settlement.issue preclusion bars relitigation of issues adjudicated in an earlier proceeding if three requirements are met 
the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated the first proceeding ended with a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the first proceeding.

first,the courts decision that the settlement covered,and thereby released,plaintiffs claims in the northern district of california was necessary to their final judgment that approved the settlement.the issues plaintiffs raised all relate to the settlement,its scope,and its substantive and procedural fairness in approving the settlement as fair,reasonable,and adequate under federal rule of civil procedure e,the courts necessarily had to adjudicate the objections plaintiffs raised,including whether the settlement released plaintiffs claims.
second,the courts approval of the settlement constituted a final judgment on the merits.see green,cir.
third,plaintiffs were parties to the proceeding by virtue of their membership in the class and appearance through counsel at the fairness hearing.see dosier,at.thus,we find all three elements of issue preclusion to be satisfied.
plaintiffs argue against application of issue preclusion solely from the maxim that a court rendering a judgment can not predetermine its res judicata effects.see phillips petroleum shutts,d referring to this maxim in dicta in re domestic air transp.antitrust,reciting this maxim in opinion on the fairness of a settlement,but nonetheless opining that certain claims were not released.however,plaintiffs brought about the courts predetermination of their judgments preclusive effects by raising the issue in the litigation as opposed to waiting to attack collaterally those judgments in the northern district of california.we have rejected arguments like that of plaintiffs here in class plaintiffs city of seattle,cir,where we reasoned
