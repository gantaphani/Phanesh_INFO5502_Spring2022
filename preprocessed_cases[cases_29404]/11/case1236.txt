this case arises from a dispute over whether cornhusker casualty insurance company cornhusker insured rockeries,rockeries,a washington landscaping company,on october,the day leanne samples was fatally injured in an automobile accident with an employee of rockeries.brooks samples,leanne husband and the administrator of her estate,brought a wrongful death action against rockeries and its owners in washington state court.cornhusker then brought suit in federal district court against rockeries and samples seeking a declaratory judgment that,prior to the accident,it had effectively cancelled its policy insuring rockeries because of nonpayment of premiums.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of cornhusker and denied samples for summary judgment.samples appealed the district court decision.we had jurisdiction pursuant to.in an opinion filed concurrently with this order,we rejected cornhusker waiver argument and samples equitable estoppel claim.this order certifies to the washington state supreme court the remaining and dispositive question of state law before,whether notice sent by certified mail satisfies the mailed requirement of the revised code of washington rcw such that a cancellation letter sent via certified mail gives sufficient notice under rcw,even if the letter is never received by the insured.
before addressing the question to be certified,we summarize the material facts beginning on june,cornhusker,a nebraska company,provided commercial auto insurance for rockeries.the policy renewed annually with a quarterly payment plan under which,after the first year,the total annual premium was billed in four equal installments throughout the year as specified on each installment notice.on eleven separate occasions during the more than four years that cornhusker insured rockeries,rockeries did not pay a premium installment on time.after each payment deadline passed,cornhusker sent a letter notifying rockeries of the date the policy would be cancelled if cornhusker did not receive rockeries payment.on all but two of these occasions,rockeries paid the amount due before the cancellation date and cornhusker sent rockeries a notice that rockeries policy would be reinstated with no lapse in coverage.rockeries did not pay by the cancellation date in january of,but cornhusker did not cancel rockeries policy because the envelope containing the payment was postmarked before the cancellation date and the payment was received within five days of the cancellation date.
after rockeries did not pay the premium installment due on september,cornhusker,on september,sent via certified mail a letter notifying rockeries that the policy would be cancelled if the payment was not received by october.rockeries did not pay by the cancellation date for the second time and cornhusker cancelled rockeries policy on october.on october,leanne samples was fatally injured in an automobile accident with a rockeries employee.rockeries notified its insurance broker of the accident on october,and cornhusker received a check from rockeries for the premium installment on october.rockeries never received the cancellation letter that cornhusker sent by certified mail on september,and the letter was returned to cornhusker on november.
brooks samples,leanne husband and the administrator of her estate,brought a wrongful death action against rockeries and its owners in washington state court.cornhusker then filed suit in federal district court against rockeries and samples seeking a declaratory judgment that it had effectively cancelled its policy insuring rockeries before the accident because of nonpayment of premiums and that it therefore had no obligation to provide rockeries with a defense or to assume any liability in the wrongful death action.
the district court granted cornhusker motion for summary judgment and denied samples for summary judgment,holding that as a matter of law certified mail satisfies the mailed requirement established in rcw and that a letter of cancellation sent via certified mail gives sufficient notice of cancellation to comply with the statute even if,as in this case,the cancellation letter was never actually received by the insured.samples appealed the district court judgment.
in an opinion accompanying this order,we have disposed of the two other issues on appeal.we have rejected cornhusker argument that samples waived his right to argue that certified mail,unlike regular mail,must actually be received in order to satisfy the statutory notice requirement of rcw,concluding that samples sufficiently raised this issue before the district court.in the same opinion,we have rejected samples equitable estoppel argument,determining that cornhusker requirement that rockeries pay a premium installment on september,was consistent with the installment notices sent to rockeries and the payment schedule of the three previous years it collected payments from rockeries.
we now turn to the issue that is the basis of our certification order whether notice of cancellation sent by certified mail is mailed for purposes of rcw.specifically,the issue is whether a letter of cancellation sent via certified mail gives sufficient notice of cancellation to comply with rcw,even if the cancellation letter is never received by the insured.
the relevant subsections of rcw,as it existed in include 
subsection cancellation by the insurer of any policy may be effected as to any interest only upon compliance with the following 
subsection a written notice of such cancellation,accompanied by the actual reason therefor,must be actually delivered or mailed to the named insured 
subsection the mailing of any such notice shall be effected by depositing it in a sealed envelope,directed to the addressee at his or her last address as known to the insurer or as shown by the insurer records,with proper prepaid postage affixed,in a letter depository of the united states post office.the insurer shall retain in its records any such item so mailed,together with its envelope,which was returned by the post office upon failure to find,or deliver the mailing to,the addressee.
we certify this question because we conclude that neither the washington state supreme court nor the state court of appeals has yet answered definitively whether a letter of cancellation sent by an insurer via certified mail but never received by the insured satisfies the notice requirements imposed by rcw to cancel an insurance policy 
on the one hand,and arguing against treating notice sent by certified mail as mailed for purposes of rcw,although mailed is not defined in rcw,in five other sections of the revised code of washington rcw mail is defined to mean only regular mail,and no section of the rcw defines the term to include certified mail.see,rcw.moreover,the washington state legislature has explicitly authorized the use of certified mail or registered mail as a form of mailing on numerous occasions,see,rcw,including at least six provisions in title,which governs insurance practices and procedures and includes rcw,see,rcw.the silence of rcw with respect to certified mail in light of the other washington statutes that explicitly authorize its use might possibly indicate a deliberate choice by the washington state legislature,and w here the legislature omits language from a statute,intentionally or inadvertently,a reviewing court will not read into the statute the language that it believes was omitted.state moses,
if sending notice of cancellation by certified mail does not qualify as mailed under rcw,then samples argues that it falls under the actually delivered prong of rcw,requiring that certified mail be received by the addressee in order to be effective under the statute.under this approach,certified mail would be treated like courier delivery or federal express,which are similar in form to certified mail.although the washington state supreme court has refused to classify as mail anything other than postal matter carried by the united states postal service,cont l sports dep t of labor and,we do not view this decision as precluding samples argument because it does not hold that all matter carried by the united s
