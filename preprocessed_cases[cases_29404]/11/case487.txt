partitions plus of wilmington,the debtor filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on september.the case was subsequently converted to a chapter proceeding.prior to its bankruptcy filing,the debtor had subcontracted in several construction projects,and united had subcontracted with the debtor to supply rental equipment.the debtor executed payment and performance bonds with united states fire insurance company the surety,for the construction of several of these projects.
in the period prior to the debtor bankruptcy filing,the debtor made three payments to united totaling for amounts owed for united prior provision of rental equipment and parts the transfers,of which was for bonded projects.the bankruptcy trustee the trustee filed this action seeking to avoid and recover the transfers as preferential payments.see b west supp.united denied that the transfers were avoidable and asserted defenses under c,and west supp.
the bankruptcy code preference section serves two goals.first,it prevents companies from racing to the to dismember the debtor during his slide into bankruptcy.harmon first am.bank of in re jeffrey bigelow design group,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and second,it protects equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor.id.internal quotation marks omitted.except as specified in the bankruptcy code,a bankruptcy trustee may avoid as a preference a transfer made by an insolvent debtor to a creditor on account of an antecedent debt within days before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition if a certain condition is satisfied see b.that condition is that the transfer to be avoided must have enabled the creditor to receive more than it would have received from the debtor chapter bankruptcy on the debt the transfer extinguished if the payment sought to be avoided had never been made.see b.
section c provides exceptions for certain preferential transfers,the avoidance of which would not further the purposes of b.section c provides that a transfer can not be avoided to the extent it was intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit it was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor and it in fact was a substantially contemporaneous exchange.c.the purpose of the c exception is to encourage creditors to continue to deal with troubled debtors without fear that they will have to disgorge payments received for value given.collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.as its legislative history demonstrates,c was designed to address the generic problem that those on the verge of bankruptcy still need to buy things and the fact that checks are used with a brief gap between purchase and payment ought not render the payment avoidable as one made for an antecedent debt.collins greater atl.mortgage in re lazarus,cir citing,at see batlan transamerica commercial fin.in re smith home furnishings,cir explaining that c was designed to prevent trustees from avoiding payments that were clearly intended to support a new transaction,instead of an antecedent debt,even though the actual payment was not recorded until after the transaction.protecting contemporaneous exchanges for new value from avoidance does not harm the preference section goal of protecting the equality of distribution among the debtors because such exchanges do not diminish the size of the debtor estate.see jones truck lines,cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund in re jones truck lines,cir.
the trustee moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the transfers satisfied the b requirements,and united moved for summary judgment.the trustee argued that it had established all of the b elements as a matter of law.as is relevant here,united responded that the trustee could not establish that the transfers were preferences under b because the transferred funds were not property of the estate.united also argued that the trustee could not satisfy b with regard to the transfers because united would have received full payment from the surety by enforcing its bond rights had the debtor not made the transfers.
united further contended that the c defense applied because the transfers had the effect of discharging united right to file and enforce a mechanic lien.united finally maintained that certain payments from the debtor to united were in exchange for new value in the form of credit extended to the debtor after the transferred funds were received.
considering the parties,the bankruptcy court ruled as a matter of law that the trustee met its burden of establishing that the transfers were preferences under b.regarding united argument that had the challenged transfers not been made,united still would have received full payment from the bond,the court reasoned that the critical question with regard to b was not whether the creditor would have received payment from another source had the challenged transfer not been made,but rather,whether it would have received payment from the chapter bankruptcy estate.as for united defense,the bankruptcy court noted that the trustee did not dispute united assertion that some payments made to the debtor were in exchange for credit that united extended to the debtor after the transferred funds were received.the bankruptcy court thus ruled that united was entitled to a minimum credit of based on new value,and it has the right to try to increase that amount upon an appropriate showing at trial.
the case then proceeded to trial regarding united c defense.united sought to prove that the transfers were substantially contemporaneous exchanges for new value because they extinguished united rights to file and enforce a lien as well as its rights to obtain payment through the bond.the bankruptcy court found that the c defense was not established because the discharge of united inchoate lien rights and bond rights did not constitute new value.the court noted that united had not perfected any lien or security interest in property to secure the debtor debt and thus had no interest to release in exchange for the transfers.the court ruled that to establish the c defense with regard to its inchoate lien and bond rights,united would have to prove that it would have timely enforced these rights and been paid in full had the challenged transfers not been made,and that at that time the debtor was still owed funds by the general contractor on which the surety could have asserted a lien.concluding that united failed to establish the former point,the court ruled that the trustee was entitled to recover the remainder of the challenged transfers the benefit of the bankruptcy estate.united then appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment.
united argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting partial summary judgment against it regarding whether the transfers were preferences under b.we find no reversible error.
