material facts 
in this case,the respondent,costco wholesale corporation costco,constructed two membership warehouse clubs in unincorporated orange county,florida.it then sought to transfer two of its package store liquor licenses to these new locations,both of which are located less than feet from existing package stores however,section b of the orange county code which applies to properties located in unincorporated orange county,clearly prohibits any new or relocated package liquor sale vendor from opening or starting a package liquor sales business within feet of an established,licensed package liquor sale vendor place of business indeed,except for a hiatus which occurred sometime between and,this foot distance requirement has been in effect in orange county since.section was first adopted by the orange county board of county commissioners the board or the bcc in,at which time the zoning commission amended its regulations by designating county beverage zones,and prohibiting any new package good vendor from opening a new establishment within such zones.the preamble to the resolution stated its purpose was to prevent the further scattering of business,trade and industrial uses within the unincorporated portions of the county to the detriment of homes and uses of higher character.this continued in effect until sometime after,when the foot separation distance for package sales vendors was repealed.subsequently,in,the board adopted a resolution to once again impose the foot separation distance on february,which provision was eventually codified as section b.in and,the bcc amended section b by adopting ordinance and ordinance,respectively,resulting in section b of the orange county code as it currently exists.
to implement the license transfers despite this restriction,costco applied for a variance from orange county,which application was denied after denial of the variance requests,costco filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,asserting that because the distance separation ordinance was arbitrary and capricious,it should be declared unconstitutional.the parties stipulated that the only issue of law to be determined was whether the county imposition of a foot separation distance between package goods stores is a constitutional exercise of the police powers.so d at.
at trial,edward john williams,who had been the director of the orange county planning department at the time all of the county ordinances had been readopted and consolidated into one code,testified that the purpose of the ordinance was to provide a balance between the desired use and the desirability of protecting residential districts.williams noted that the distance separation requirement represents approximately a radius,which is typically the distance for a primary market for a store or facility of this nature.he observed that this distance provides residents enough opportunity to use such facilities without allowing such businesses to become so dense that they,along with activities they generate,become a problem.he noted that orange county is far different from other jurisdictions in that it has more commercial acreage per thousand population than just about any other jurisdiction in the country.at the time the ordinance was reenacted in,the county had over acres zoned commercial where package liquor stores could be located,with an additional acres projected by the year.according to williams,there were more than enough opportunities to accommodate and provide reasonable use for package liquor stores.for that reason,in williams experience,the ordinance was not overly restrictive.
according to williams,the purpose of section was not to protect the economic interests of package liquor store owners,but to have a reasonable buffer and distance between their businesses,and to respect both residential and business considerations.he had observed that the problem with aggregating such businesses was not necessarily an evil inherent in the stores themselves,but primarily rested in the secondary effects associated with such business operations.he stated that allowing such stores in close proximity to each other lowers residential property values and creates an extraordinary amount of traffic in and about those residential areas.he opined that,because there are certain problematic activities such as drinking in the parking lots,fights,and driving while intoxicated typically associated with package stores,s preading them out while allowing sufficient opportunity to accommodate the need for them was the county primary objective.the regulatory strategy reflected in the distance restriction seemed to minimize the adverse impacts associated with such uses,while allowing them to congregate seemed to create an impact greater than the number of uses.
the parties stipulated that there are currently licenses designated as specifically for package liquor stores issued in unincorporated orange county.there are currently businesses within the unincorporated areas which hold licenses designated as which permits the sale of package alcoholic beverages.of these businesses,only about twelve are unable to offer package sales because of the distance separation requirement.mitch gordon,acting zoning director of orange county,testified by affidavit at no time have i been told that there is an insufficient supply of package stores in orange county or that they are located in areas that inconvenienced the shopping public.
the trial court judicially noticed that alcohol is a harmful and heavily regulated product.it reasoned that because orange county could ban alcoholic sales completely,the county less restrictive regulation was substantially related to a legitimate government goal.id.at.
on appeal,the fifth district strongly disagreed with this rationale,stating 
while the county may have the power to ban alcoholic products completely,the ban,or any ban for that manner,must have a reasonable relationship to public health,morals and welfare.when the lesser regulation impacts rights,the government still carries the burden of demonstrating the reasonable relationship.in this case,the record below fails to meet that burden.
id.at.although stating that it recognized that a presumption of constitutionality applied in assessing costco facial challenge to the ordinance,the district court reasoned that the constitutional right of property owners to make legitimate use of the property may not be curtailed by unreasonable restrictions under the guise of police power.if the regulation exceeds the bounds of necessity for the public welfare,it must be stricken as an unconstitutional invasion of property rights.id.at quoting burritt harris,so d.after applying a substantial relationship analysis to the record evidence,the district court concluded while we generally agree with established case law that courts should not invade the authority of elected officials absent a paramount constitutional right and duty,we believe this case represents an exception and presents a situation in which there exists both a right and a duty for this court to hold the regulation unconstitutional.id.at.this timely petition for review followed.
in state ex rel.eichenbaum cochran,so d,this court specifically expressed the correct standard of review applicable in determining the validity of a county ordinance regulating the distance between holders of liquor licenses 
we should also retain in our thinking the proposition that the regulation and control of the alcoholic beverage business is peculiarly a legislative function.in this connection,as in all similar situations,when the legislative branch of the government exercises a legislative power in the form of a duly enacted statute or ordinance it is not the function of a court to explore the wisdom or advisability of the enactment in order to bring its enforceability into question.to this end the limit of the court authority is to measure the validity of the legislative enactment by the
