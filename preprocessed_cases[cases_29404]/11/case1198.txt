lucia munguia albarran albarran and her husband,antonio barboza barboza collectively appellants,were found liable after a jury trial in district court for willful infringement of new form,appellee copyright for certain spanish language films.the district court instructed the jury that willful infringement required a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that appellants knew that they were infringing the appellee copyrights or that they acted with reckless disregard as to whether they were doing so.after judgment was entered,appellants filed for bankruptcy and sought to discharge the judgment award.the bankruptcy judge held on summary judgment that the judgment award was nondischargeable under a as a willful and malicious injury based upon the jury finding of willful infringement and uncontroverted evidence of appellants knowledge of appellee copyright interest.
the bap affirmed and held that a statutory award of damages for willful copyright infringement is a debt for a categorically harmful activity,which is nondischargeable under a if the bankruptcy court determines that the infringer had the requisite subjective intent to injure another property interest.the bap held that the uncontroverted evidence of knowledge of the creditor copyright interest at the time of infringement was proof of their substantial certainty of resultant harm.
we now reverse and remand for further consideration because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the infringement was a willful injury within the meaning of a of the bankruptcy code and the malicious requirement was not addressed separately from the willfulness requirement as required by our precedent.
ii.facts and proceedings below 
appellants operated a business for the duplication,distribution,and sale of spanish language films.this case concerns ten films known as the india maria pictures.on may,appellee acquired the exclusive rights to manufacture,sell,and distribute the india maria pictures.before appellee acquired its exclusive rights,appellants purchased a large amount of inventory of india maria pictures from million dollar video million dollar video.
in late summer,appellee learned that appellants were selling the india maria pictures.appellee sent appellants a letter,dated september,advising them of appellee exclusive right to duplicate and sell the india maria pictures.after receiving this letter,appellants allegedly ordered vhs tape copies of the india maria pictures be made by reel picture productions,llc reel picture on or about september.
albarran responded to appellee by letter,on september,stating that appellants did not know about appellee exclusive rights prior to receiving the september letter were selling inventory of india maria pictures legally purchased from million dollar video and were willing to commence business negotiations with appellee.
appellee sent a final warning letter on december.appellants continued to sell the india maria pictures until march,when appellee filed a lawsuit against appellants in the district court for the central district of california for willful copyright infringement the district court action.the complaint in the district court action alleged that appellants willfully infringed appellee copyright in the india maria pictures beginning on or after may,and ending in.however,the evidence presented at the trial concerned only the september,duplication immediately following the appellee first warning letter to appellants.
a jury trial was held in april,on the infringement by duplication issue the jury was instructed on willful infringement as follows 
to prove willful infringement,the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants knew that they were infringing the plaintiff copyrights or that they acted with reckless disregard as to whether they were doing so.if you conclude that the defendants reasonably and in good faith believed that they were not infringing the plaintiff copyrights,then you may not find that they willfully infringed those copyrights.
the jury returned special verdicts finding that both albarran and barboza had willfully infringed appellee copyright in each of the india maria pictures,and that appellee should be awarded statutory damages of per video.judgment was entered on may,for,plus costs and attorney fees the final judgment amount was fixed at.
appellants filed a bankruptcy petition on may.appellee timely filed a complaint seeking to have the entire judgment debt declared nondischargeable as a debt resultant from a willful and malicious injury under a.appellee promptly moved for summary judgment,and requested that the bankruptcy court take judicial notice of the record and judgment in the district court action.in resolving the motion,the bankruptcy court held that the district court findings would be binding in the bankruptcy action.the bankruptcy court stated that albarran was bound by the fact that she ordered the duplication of the india maria pictures.however,because the jury instruction defined willful infringement as either knowing or reckless conduct,it was irreconcilably ambiguous as to whether the award fell within a meaning of willfulness.therefore,the bankruptcy court reserved for trial the issue of whether appellants had the subjective intent to injure appellee or its property,or subjective knowledge that injury was substantially certain to result.
appellee subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of subjective intent without presenting any new evidence to the bankruptcy court.appellants filed an opposition,supported by affidavits,stating that someone else ordered the duplication of the india maria pictures,and that someone else received and diverted the finished product.appellants did not dispute the date of duplication or their knowledge of appellee copyright on or after september.alternatively,they argued that the copyright violation was merely technical because there was no evidence that they sold the unlawfully duplicated copies rather than the inventory they had legally purchased from million dollar video.
at the august,hearing on the motion for partial summary judgment,the bankruptcy court concluded that there was uncontroverted evidence that appellants knew of appellee copyright,and in combination with the jury finding of willful infringement,that the infringement constituted a willful injury within the meaning of a.a judgment of nondischargeability was therefore entered in the sum of.appellants timely appealed the order and judgment to the bap.
the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court.the bap implied maliciousness from the bankruptcy court finding of willfulness.the bap reasoned that an award of statutory damages based on willful copyright infringement is a debt for an injury to the owner property interest.accordingly,the bap reasoned that t he only remaining proof required was that debtors were aware of appellee copyright at the time they infringed it.the bap also found that the september,letter gave appellants actual knowledge that their infringement was substantially certain to cause harm to appellee.

willful and malicious injury under a 
section a of the bankruptcy code provides that an individual debtor may not discharge a debt for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.emphasis added.the malicious injury requirement is separate from the willful injury requirement.carrillo su in re su,cir conflating the two requirements is grounds for reversal see also jett sicroff in re sicroff,cir we analyze the willful and malicious prongs of the dischargeability test separately.a willful injury is a deliberate or intentional injury,not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury.kawaauhau geiger,d emphasis in original.a malicious injury involves a wrongful act,done intentionally,which necessarily causes injury,and is done without just cause or excuse.in re su,at quoting petralia jercich in re jercich,cir.

summary judgment standard 
in adversary proceedings before the bankruptcy court,the familiar summary judgment standard established in federal rule of civil procedure applies.see fed.north slope borough rogstad in re rogstad,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.an issue is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable fact finder could find for the nonmoving party,and a dispute is material only if it could affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.the party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.id.at.the court must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.county of tuolumne sonora cmty,cir.
in response to a properly submitted summary judgment motion,the burden shifts to the opposing party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.henderson city of simi valley,cir.the nonmoving party may not rely on denials in the pleadings but must produce specific evidence,through affidavits or admissible discovery material,to show that the dispute exists.bhan nme,cir.
a court generally can not grant summary judgment based on its assessment of the credibility of the evidence presented.agosto ins,d.a t the summary judgment stage the judge function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson,at.
we find that in viewing all facts and drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the appellants,there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellants acted willfully within the meaning of a,and thus summary judgment was improper.therefore,we reverse and remand to the bankruptcy court to properly determine whether there was a willful injury within the meaning of a.
ii.analysis 
the term willful as used in copyright infringement cases is not equivalent to willful as used in determining whether a debt is nondischargeable under the bankruptcy code.the jury in the district court action found that the appellants willfully infringed appellee copyright.as our sister circuits have clearly recognized,a finding of willfulness in this context can be based on either intentional behavior,or merely reckless behavior.see in re seagate,llc,en banc island software computer,microsoft,cir superior form builders,dan chase taxidermy supply,cir wildlife express,carol wright sales,cir int l,thomas grayston,cir.accordingly,in the district court action,the jury was instructed that the infringement was willful if appellants knew that they were infringing the appellee copyrights or that they acted with reckless disregard as to whether they were doing so.the jury found that appellants willfully infringed appellee copyright by making unlawful copies of ten india maria pictures.however,the bankruptcy court had no way to determine whether the jury found the willful infringement based on a reckless disregard or a knowing violation of appellee copyright.
even though recklessness is sufficient for a finding of willful copyright infringement,the supreme court has clearly held that injuries resulting from recklessness are not sufficient to be considered willful injuries under a of the bankruptcy code and are therefore insufficient to merit an exemption to dischargeability.geiger,at.in geiger,the supreme court specifically limited willful injuries under a to deliberate or intentional injuries.id.at.therefore,if a finding of willful copyright infringement is based merely on reckless behavior,the resulting statutory award would not fit within the a exemption.
summary judgment in bankruptcy court 
appellee filed its first motion for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court first summary judgment motion on february,to determine whether the statutory award for willful copyright infringement,from the district court action,was nondischargeable.at the hearing on the first summary judgment motion,the bankruptcy judge recognized the potential question of fact that the jury verdict in the district court action presented,and therefore discussed with counsel how to prepare just the intent issue,for trial.in discussing why the issue of intent would be set for trial,rather than determined on the first summary judgment motion,counsel for the appellee asked the fact that through even her albarran testimony that she received this september letter,and thereafter on september,provided that response that,just for clarification,does provide you what is necessary with respect to her intent the court responded clearly and correctly not in the current context,no.
the september,letter referenced by appellee counsel informed appellants that appellee was asserting an exclusive right to duplicate and sell the films in question.appellants response letter dated september,acknowledged appellee assertion of exclusive rights to duplicate and sell the videos in question.however,the bankruptcy judge wisely found at the hearing on the first summary judgment motion that,given the facially ambiguous jury finding,a finding of the requisite intent could not be determined based on the knowledge of the letter alone.
thereafter,appellee filed a subsequent motion for partial summary judgment second summary judgment motion,which focused on the intent issue.at the hearing on that motion,the bankruptcy judge admitted the difficulty of coming to a decision concerning the matter well,i have wrestled with this and gone back and forth.as to whether the willfulness found by the jury was based on reckless disregard or intentional conduct the bankruptcy judge stated 
the jury verdict does tell me which one they looking at reckless disregard or intentional,but the evidence is uncontroverted that appellants knew,the april letter.sic and i have to take the jury finding that the copying occurred and combine that with the uncontroverted evidence of the knowledge.
now whether,as quinton says,they appellants ultimately never received them,the copies were diverted from r eel p ictures.whether it was miguel who really did it,i do know the answer to that.
but based upon all of this and my review,and although i think it got some interesting questions in it,i believe that summary judgment should be granted for the appellee and i sign an order to that effect 
question of fact remains as to willfulness 
the bankruptcy judge clearly erred by inferring from the jury finding of willful infringement that appellants had actually ordered the copying themselves.as principals in the company,appellants could be held liable for infringement simply for failing to prevent copyright infringement.see atl.recording chan in re chan.for that reason,the jury was instructed in the district court action that a person is liable for copyright infringement by another if the person has a financial interest and the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity whether or not the person knew of the infringement.
appellants asserted in the district court action that they did not order the copies but that the infringing videos were ordered by albarran brother,miguel,who made it appear that the videos were ordered by the appellants.as such,the jury in the district court action could have found that the appellants were liable for copyright infringement because they failed in their supervisory role,that their failure to supervise was reckless,and therefore that the infringement was willful.such a scenario would dictate that the injury was not a willful injury under a,even though it was willful for purposes of the copyright violation.given the possibility tha
