this is an antitrust action concerning the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures.flagship theatres of palm desert,llc flagship owns a movie theater called the cinemas palme the palme with screens.flagship owns no other theaters.century theatres,century owns a nearby movie theater called the century at the river the river with screens.century owns a large theater circuit of over screens,and in century was acquired by cinemark usa,cinemark,resulting in a combined circuit of several thousand screens.many of century theaters are in noncompetitive markets.
flagship filed this antitrust action against century and two film distributors,alleging that century has used the power deriving from both the size of its theater circuit and its many theaters in noncompetitive markets to undermine the competitive process through which theaters bid for and obtain licenses to exhibit films.according to flagship,under previous ownership the river and the palme obtained roughly equal numbers of films,but under century the river now obtains licenses for far more films than the palme,the few that are left to the palme are commercially inferior,and the imbalance is not based on the relative merits of the palme and the river bids.on the contrary,according to flagship,superior bids by the palme are often rejected in favor of inferior bids by the river as a result of century abuse of the power of its circuit.
after flagship voluntarily dismissed the distributors and amended its pleadings to add cinemark as a defendant,century and cinemark collectively defendants moved for summary judgment.they argued inter alia that flagship could not show antitrust injury and could not show that century had market power in the market in which the palme and the river compete.the trial court agreed and entered judgment against flagship.we reverse.
background 
flagship operates the palme,a screen movie theater in palm desert,california.century operates the river,a screen movie theater in the neighboring community of rancho mirage,california.the palme and the river are located less than two miles apart on highway,a major thoroughfare running through the coachella valley.previously,when the palme and the river were being operated by flagship and century predecessors,film distributors granted clearances to the river and the palme with respect to each other,meaning that a distributor licensing a film to the river would agree not to license the same film to play at the palme at the same time,and vice versa.
century began operating the river in approximately july and continued its predecessor practice of requesting clearances for the river with respect to the palme.before being acquired by cinemark in,century operated movie theaters at locations across states featuring a total of more than screens flagship introduced evidence that as of,only approximately to of century theaters were in competitive markets.
flagship only theater is the palme,which flagship acquired in.two of flagship founders previously formed another business entity,flagship theatre corporation,which operates only one theater,located in a noncompetitive market.
in july,flagship filed the instant lawsuit against century and two film distributors.the complaint alleged claims for restraint of trade in violation of the cartwright act bus,et unfair competition in violation of the unfair competition law,et hereafter ucl,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.flagship later filed a first amended complaint and a second amended complaint,alleging similar claims and adding cinemark as a defendant.flagship also eventually dismissed the distributor defendants.
flagship alleged that before century began to operate the river,film distributors licensed roughly equal numbers of films to the river and the palme,with the palme generally receiving the larger share.after century began operating the river,however,distributors licensed roughly three times as many films to the river as to the palme,and the films licensed to the palme were generally inferior films that were expected to generate far lower box office revenue than those licensed to century.flagship alleged that century obtained such favorable treatment for the river,to the detriment of the palme,by using the bargaining power deriving from both the size of century circuit and its operation of numerous theaters in noncompetitive markets.flagship alleged that century conduct constituted unlawful circuit dealing,which violates the longstanding antitrust law requirement that films be licensed on a theater by theater,film by film basis.
in,defendants moved for summary judgment.defendants argued that flagship antitrust claim under the cartwright act failed because the clearances century obtained for the river against the palme were lawful,century did not have sufficient market power in the geographic market in which the palme and the river compete which defendants contended was the entire coachella valley to cause competitive harm in that market,and flagship could not demonstrate antitrust injury.defendants further argued that because the cartwright act claim failed,flagship ucl and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claims failed as well.
flagship filed opposition and,in the alternative,requested a continuance in order to complete outstanding discovery.flagship argued that defendants motion was based on the false assumption that this is just a case about clearances and contended to the contrary that the case is based on century methods of negotiating with and licensing films from distributors,which deprived the palme of the opportunity to fairly compete to license any but a handful of films.
the trial court granted defendants motion and entered judgment against flagship.the court agreed with defendants that flagship failed to create a disputed issue of material fact regarding antitrust injury,the contention that the geographic market in which the palme and the river compete is the entire coachella valley,and the contention that century lacks market power in that market.flagship timely appealed.

discussion 
summary of principles of antitrust law and overview of claims 
the cartwright act states that e xcept as provided in this chapter,every trust is unlawful,against public policy and void.section defines the term trust as a combination of capital,skill or acts by two or more persons for certain enumerated anticompetitive purposes,including t o create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce,subd.a.that prohibition is analogous to the catchall language of section of the sherman act,which prohibits e very contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce.see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,hereafter aguilar.thus,although the cartwright act was not patterned after the sherman act state of california ex rel.van de kamp texaco,cal d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,federal case law interpreting the sherman act is often a useful aid in interpreting the cartwright act sc manufactured homes,liebert th.
under both cartwright act and sherman act case law,some restraints of trade are treated as per se unlawful,while others are analyzed under the rule of reason.in general,only unreasonable restraints of trade are prohibited.citation.however,there are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.citation.among these per se violations is the concerted refusal to deal with other traders,or,as it is often called,the group boycott.citations.marin county bd.of realtors,palsson cal d,hereafter marin county.under the rule of reason,the challenged conduct is unlawful only if its anticompetitive effects outweigh its procompetitive effects.see,e,exxon superior court th,hereafter exxon.
because the parties characterizations of flagship claims differ considerably,we briefly summarize them here before turning to analysis of the parties arguments on the merits.according to defendants,flagship claims are essentially challenges to century practice of obtaining clearances from film distributors.flagship is really complaining about century clearance requests.a clearance is an exclusive right that a film distributor grants to a theater in connection with the licensing of a film.it prohibits the distributor from licensing the film for exhibition at certain other theaters,either identified by name or located within a specified geographic region,while the film is being shown at the theater that obtained the clearance.see,soffer national amusements,civ.avc.lexis,at orson,miramax film,fn.federal case law applying the sherman act has treated clearances as vertical nonprice restraints that are evaluated under the rule of reason see theee movies of tarzana pacific theatres,cir,hereafter theee movies.there are no published california cases evaluating the legality of clearances under the cartwright act.
according to flagship,this is a circuit dealing case,not a case challenging clearances in the absence of circuit dealing.the case law contains no general definition of prohibited circuit dealing,but it is generally characterized as the pooling of the purchasing power of an entire circuit in bidding for films,which undermines the competitive process of bidding for film licenses theatre by theatre.united states paramount pictures,hereafter paramount pictures.
one type of prohibited circuit dealing is a form of monopoly leveraging,that is,a monopolist use of power in one market to gain an advantage in a related market.sullivan grimes,the law of antitrust an integrated handbook.for example,one of the united states supreme court cases concerning circuit dealing addressed certain master agreements between distributors and movie theater circuits that lumped together towns in which the circuits had no competition and towns in which there were competing theaters.united states griffith,hereafter griffith.the court explained the anticompetitive character of this kind of circuit dealing as follows a circuit with a monopoly of theatres in any one town commands the entrance for all films into that area.if the circuit uses that strategic position to acquire exclusive privileges in a city where it has competitors,it is employing its monopoly power as a trade weapon against the circuit competitors.it may be a feeble,ineffective weapon where the circuit has only one closed or monopoly town.but as those towns increase in number throughout a region,the circuit monopoly power in them may be used with crushing effect on competitors in other places.the circuit need not be as crass as the exhibitors in united states crescent amusement in order to make its monopoly power effective in its competitive situations.though the circuit makes no threat to withhold the business of its closed or monopoly towns unless the distributors give it the exclusive film rights in the towns where it has competitors,the effect is likely to be the same where the two are joined.when the buying power of the entire circuit is used to negotiate films for competitive as well as closed towns,the circuit is using monopoly power to expand its empire the consequence of such a use of monopoly power is that films are licensed on a basis in what would otherwise be competitive situations.griffith,supra,at.
another united states supreme court case,however,discerned a second and independent basis on which a film licensing agreement that covers multiple theaters within a circuit,a circuit deal can constitute an antitrust violation regardless of whether it involves monopoly leveraging.paramount pictures,supra,at.the case discussed certain formula deals namely,licensing agreement s with a circuit of theatres in which the license fee of a given feature is measured,for the theatres covered by the agreement,by a specified percentage of the feature national gross and master agreements namely,film licensing agreements that cover exhibition in two or more theatres in a particular circuit.id.at.the court explained that t he formula deals and master agreements are unlawful restraints of trade in two respects.id.at.first,the combination of closed towns with competitive situations constituted a misuse of monopoly power,unlawful monopoly leveraging.id.at.second,licensing agreements covering multiple theatres within a particular circuit are unlawful because they eliminate the possibility of bidding for films theatre by theatre.in that way they eliminate the opportunity for the small competitor to obtain the choice first runs,and put a premium on the size of the circuit.they are,therefore,devices for stifling competition and diverting the cream of the business to the large operators.id.at.
circuit dealing in either of these forms has been held per se unlawful under the sherman act paramount pictures,supra,u.at griffith,supra,at,but the most recent united states supreme court cases to so hold were decided in no california supreme court case addresses the legality of circuit dealing under the cartwright act.the sole california court of appeal case on the issue is redwood theatres,festival enterprises,d hereafter redwood theatres it acknowledged that the united states supreme court held circuit dealing per se unlawful under the sherman act but also recognized that both federal antitrust law and the structure of the film industry have undergone considerable development since the late.id.at.redwood theatres also recognized that the federal case law distinguishes two grounds for finding circuit dealing illegal,one that involves misuse of monopoly power and another that would apply even where all of the markets within a circuit were competitive.id.at.the court then observed that i n the present case,the issue of abuse of monopoly power is no longer raised.ibid.the court proceeded to survey antitrust law in several related areas,including boycotts and vertical restraints,and ultimately concluded that the plaintiff circuit dealing claim which was not a monopoly leveraging claim was subject to rule of reason analysis under the cartwright act.id.at.
ii.antitrust injury 
our analysis necessarily begins with the grounds on which the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment the trial court agreed with defendants argument that flagship could not show antitrust injury.on appeal,flagship argues that the trial court erred,and we agree.defendants argument is based on a legally erroneous conception of the antitrust injury requirement,so defendants failed to carry their initial burden on the issue.
the antitrust injury requirement originates in a case decided by the united states supreme court under federal antitrust law,brunswick pueblo bowl o mat,hereafter brunswick.in that case,the plaintiff bowling alleys challenged the defendant corporation acquisition of several competitor bowling alleys that otherwise would have gone out of business.the plaintiffs alleged damages were the profits they had lost by being forced to compete with the acquired bowling alleys.id.at.thus,the issue presented for review was whether antitrust damages are available where the sole injury alleged is that competitors were continued in business,thereby denying the plaintiffs an anticipated increase in market shares.id.at.
the supreme court concluded that antitrust damages are not available under those circumstances.the court described the plaintiffs case as complaining that by acquiring the failing bowling alleys,the defendant preserved competition,thereby depriving the plaintiffs of the benefits of increased concentration.brunswick,supra,at.thus,the damages the plaintiffs sought were designed to provide them with the profits they would have realized had competition been reduced.the antitrust laws,however,were enacted for the protection of competition,not competitors,citation.it is inimical to the purposes of these laws to award damages for the type of injury claimed here.ibid.accordingly,the court held that for plaintiffs to recover damages for antitrust violations,they must prove antitrust injury,which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.id.at.
brunswick was an antimerger case decided under the clayton act,but subsequent federal case law makes clear that the antitrust injury requirement also applies to other federal antitrust violations.see,metronet services qwest cir.california case law holds that the requirement applies to cartwright act claims as well.see,morrison viacom,th.
in addition,the antitrust injury requirement applies to cases alleging conduct that is per se unlawful as well as to cases governed by the rule of reason.in atlantic richfield usa petroleum hereafter atlantic richfield,the united states supreme court explained the point as follows actions per se unlawful under the antitrust laws may nonetheless have some procompetitive effects,and private parties might suffer losses therefrom.citations.conduct in violation of the antitrust laws may have three effects,often interwoven in some respects the conduct may reduce competition,in other respects it may increase competition,and in still other respects effects may be neutral as to competition.the antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a aspect or effect of the defendant behavior.the need for this showing is at least as great under the per se rule as under the rule of reason.id.at.
the antitrust injury requirement does not,however,require an antitrust plaintiff to show actual harm to competition.the united states supreme court made the point explicit in brunswick,supra,the very case in which the antitrust injury requirement originated.as the court stated,the antitrust injury requirement does not mean that an antitrust plaintiff must prove an actual lessening of competition in order to recover.brunswick,supra,at,fn.
that point was also a central holding of klor broadway hale stores hereafter klor.in that case,the plaintiff household appliance retailer alleged that a major department store chain had induced appliance manufacturers and their distributors not to sell to the plaintiff,or to sell to it only at discriminatory prices and highly unfavorable terms.id.at.the defendants submitted evidence that there were hundreds of other household appliance retailers,some within a few blocks of the plaintiff who sold many competing brands of appliances,including those the defendants refused to sell to the plaintiff.id.at.on that basis,the defendants argued that the plaintiff could not recover,because nothing they were alleged to have done could have injured competition the market was competitive and would remain so even if the plaintiff were entirely eliminated from it.the supreme court noted that the defense position would mean that unless opportunities for customers to buy in a competitive market are reduced,a group of powerful businessmen may act in concert to deprive a single merchant,like the owner of the plaintiff corporation,of the goods he needs to compete effectively.id.at.the court rejected the defense position,holding that conduct that is otherwise forbidden by the antitrust laws is not to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy.id.at.the court further observed that m onopoly can as surely thrive by the elimination of such small businessmen,one at a time,as it can by driving them out in large groups.in recognition of this fact the sherman act has consistently been read to forbid all contracts and combinations which tend to create monopoly,whether the tendency is a creeping one or one that proceeds at full gallop.citation.id.at.
klor has never been overruled on that point or any other,and the california supreme court has applied the klor rule to claims under the cartwright act.an anticompetitive practice is not to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy.marin county,supra,cal d at,quoting klor,supra,at.
in sum,the antitrust injury requirement means that an antitrust plaintiff must show that it was injured by the anticompetitive aspects or effects of the defendant conduct,as opposed to being injured by the conduct neutral or even procompetitive aspects as in brunswick.but to make that showing,the plaintiff need not show that the market has actually become less competitive than it would have been without the defendant conduct if the market contains numerous participants and is consequently competitive,and the plaintiff is a relatively small player whose injury or elimination would not materially affect market conditions,then the plaintiff is not thereby foreclosed from recovery 
both in the trial court and on appeal,defendants antitrust injury argument has relied on the reasoning that was rejected by the united states supreme court in klor and by the california supreme court in marin county.according to defendants,flagship must show that century conduct actually rendered the relevant market uncompetitive or less competitive,which might be evidenced by higher prices or lower supply.thus,according to defendants,if century conduct has not yet had an anticompetitive effect on consumers,then the market in which the palme and the river compete must still be at least as competitive as it would have been without century conduct,so flagship can not show antitrust injury.
the argument fails because,as a matter of law,flagship may be able to prevail without showing that the market has become less competitive.no other conclusion is possible under klor and marin county.
rather,the antitrust injury requirement means that in order to prevail on its antitrust claims,flagship must show that its loss stems from a competition reducing aspect or effect of the defendant behavior.atlantic richfield,supra,at.defendants have not introduced any evidence or even argued that flagship does not have,or can not reasonably obtain,sufficient evidence to make that showing,so defendants did not carry their initial burden in moving for summary judgment on this issue.aguilar,supra,cal th at.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the basis of the antitrust injury requirement.
iii.clearances and market power 
as noted earlier,a clearance is an exclusive right that a film distributor grants to a theater in connection with the licensing of a film,prohibiting the distributor from licensing the film for exhibition at certain other theaters while the film is being shown at the theater that obtained the clearance.see part i,ante.in their motion for summary judgment,defendants stated that the palme and the river have had a long history of clearances under prior ownership and that century has requested,and continues to request,clearances for the river.defendants asserted that flagship lawsuit is really complaining about century clearance requests,and defendants argued that century clearances are lawful under the standards articulated in antitrust case law.the trial court noted the argument but did not rule on its merits,instead granting summary judgment on the basis of defendants arguments concerning antitrust injury and market definition.defendants renew the argument concerning clearances in various forms on appeal,contending,for example,that the river clearances are vertical nonprice restraints with procompetitive effects that render the clearances lawful under the rule of reason.
we have reviewed flagship original,first amended,and second amended complaints,as well as its opposition to defendants summary judgment motion and its briefs on appeal,and we conclude that flagship has never contended that defendants clearances are unlawful independently of defendants alleged circuit dealing.we therefore do not discuss defendants argument except to note that clearances are vertical nonprice restraints governed by the rule of reason.continental,gte sylvania,vertical nonprice restraints are governed by the rule of reason hereafter continental theee movies,supra,at clearances are vertical nonprice restraints governed by the rule of reason.
for the same reasons,we do not discuss defendants arguments concerning market power and market definition.according to defendants,in order to show that the river clearances with respect to the palme are unlawful under the rule of reason,flagship must show that defendants have market power in the market in which the palme and the river compete.defendants contention that flagship must show that defendants have market power in the market in which the palme and the river compete and that flagship accordingly must define the boundaries of that market is thus based on defendants contention that flagship lawsuit is merely a challenge to defendants clearances.defendants have not argued that such a showing of market power is required in the context of a circuit dealing case as opposed to a clearance case,so we do not discuss the issue either.
iv.circuit dealing and related discovery 
flagship original,first amended,and second amended complaints all alleged that century has engaged in circuit dealing in violation of the cartwright act.defendants memorandum of points and authorities in support of their motion for summary judgment devoted a single paragraph to the issue,asserting that flagship has proffered no evidence of any kind to support the circuit dealing claim and citing evidence purporting to show that the two dismissed defendant distributors have licensed their films to the river rather than the palme because they were convinced the river was the higher grossing theater.
the trial court recognized that defendants motion only briefly discuss ed circuit dealing,even though flagship had from the initiation of the instant action,both in its papers and before the court,described this as a circuit dealing case.the court went on to conclude that defendants antitrust injury argument was fatal to flagship circuit dealing claim.that conclusion was erroneous because defendants antitrust injury argument was legally unsound,as we have already explained.see part ii,ante.but the trial court also ruled that flagship failed to introduce sufficient evidence to create any disputed issues of material fact concerning the circuit dealing claim.
on appeal,flagship argues that the court ruling on this issue must be overturned as well because the court abused its discretion by making discovery rulings that impermissibly curtailed flagship efforts to gather evidence of circuit dealing.we agree.
appellate courts must keep liberal policies of discovery statutes in mind when reviewing decisions denying or granting discovery.citation.absent a showing that substantial interests will be impaired by allowing discovery,liberal policies of discovery rules will generally counsel against overturning a trial court decision granting discovery citation and militate in favor of overturning a decision to deny discovery.citation.forthmann boyer th.discovery rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.costco wholesale superior court cal th.
the trial court granted defendants requests to limit discovery to the geographic area of the coachella valley,which defendants claim is the geographic market in which the palme and the river compete.because of the nature of flagship circuit dealing claim,those rulings constituted error.
flagship circuit dealing claim alleges that century theater circuit outside of the market in which the palme and the river compete is of such a size and nature as to give century considerable power,and century has used that power to flagship detriment in the market in which the palme and the river compete.thus,in order to gather evidence to support its circuit dealing claim,flagship must be permitted to engage in discovery concerning century theater circuit and film licensing practices outside the market in which the palme and the river compete.the essence of flagship claim is that century has used its power outside the market to influence competition within the market.flagship can not gather evidence in support of that claim if it is limited to collecting evidence within the market.the trial court imposition of such a geographical limitation on flagship discovery was consequently erroneous.
in so holding,we do not tie the trial court hands with respect to the management of discovery in this action.on remand,if the parties seek to limit or structure discovery in a particular manner such as by conducting it in phases or stages the court may grant any such requests as are reasonable.we hold only that the court limitation of discovery to the coachella valley was too narrow.
on appeal,defendants arguments in support of the trial court discovery rulings are based on defendants claim that flagship could not prevail on any of its claims without first showing that century possessed sufficient market power in a properly defined geographic market namely,the market in which the palme and the river compete to have caused actual anticompetitive effect injury to consumers in that market.thus,according to defendants,the limitations on discovery were proper because the trial court was merely streamlining discovery to allow for potentially case dispositive issues to be litigated at an early stage.defendants arguments fail for the reasons explained in parts ii and iii,ante.
because we conclude that the trial court ruling on the circuit dealing claim must be reversed on the basis of the court erroneous discovery rulings,we need not decide whether defendants carried their initial burden of either conclusively negating an element of the claim or showing that flagship lacked and could not obtain evidence of prohibited circuit dealing but because it will be relevant to the proceedings on remand,we wish to clarify one point of law raised by defendants arguments.on appeal,defendants contend that circuit deals are agreements whereby exhibitors use their monopoly power or near monopoly power in one or more areas to negotiate blanket exclusive agreements with distributors covering all of their theaters,including areas where they may have competition.quoting reading intern.oaktree capital management llc d,fn,italics added by defendants.on that basis,defendants argue that without evidence of at least one blanket licensing agreement that includes all of century theaters,flagship can not prove prohibited circuit dealing.
we disagree.the united states supreme court cases describe circuit dealing as,for example,a theater circuit use of monopoly power in certain locations to acquire exclusive privileges in a city where the circuit has competitors.griffith,supra,at.the court also condemned as unlawful circuit dealing certain master agreements that cover exhibition in two or more theatres in a particular circuit or covering the exhibition of features in a number of theatres.paramount pictures,supra,at.the sole california case concerning circuit dealing describes it in similar terms and on the basis of the same authorities.redwood theatres,supra,d at a prohibited master agreement covered exhibition in several theatres in a particular circuit.nothing in the discussion in any of those cases suggests that prohibited circuit dealing is limited to agreements that cover all of the theaters in a circuit.rather,they suggest that it is not so limited.
the case law explains that circuit dealing is prohibited because it enables a powerful circuit to gain advantages for itself and impose restrictions on its competitors which otherwise would not have been possible.schine theaters united states.it is both an abuse of monopoly power and a means for stifling competition by diverting the cream of the business to the large operators.redwood theatres,supra,d at,quoting paramount pictures,supra,at.given those reasons for the prohibition against circuit dealing,defendants proposed rule which would make a blanket licensing agreement lawful as long as it omitted at least one of the circuit theaters makes no sense.when a dominant theater circuit uses its overall size or its monopoly power in certain locations or both to obtain more favorable film licensing treatment in competitive locations than it otherwise could have obt
