appellants raise undecided but dispositive questions of connecticut law.these issues require the interpretation of connecticut insurance and contract law,and we certify,pursuant to.gen stat.and cir,several questions to the supreme court of connecticut.
background 
a the underlying lawsuits 
derma clinic is a business offering massage therapy to the public.at all pertinent times,brown was president of derma,and joseph burden was an employee of derma and brown.between august and september,three,doe,and lawsuits against derma,brown,and burden.each complaint alleged a physical and sexual assault that occurred during the course of a massage performed by burden.
the first count of the allen complaint alleged assault and battery against burden only.the second count alleged that burden intentionally inflicted emotional distress against allen.count three alleged that derma negligently breached its obligations to allen by failing to advise allen that derma had received complaints concerning burden improper behavior failing to investigate promptly these complaints failing to suspend burden pending an investigation of the complaints failing to terminate burden continuing to allow burden to perform massages after it knew or should have known burden was sexually abusing patrons and failing to report burden to the appropriate licensing organization.the fourth count made the same allegations as the third count but characterized derma acts and omissions as willful,wanton,reckless,intentional deliberate disregard for the safety and the well being of allen.count five asserted a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress by derma.id.
count one of the doe suit alleged physical and sexual assault by burden only.the second count alleged that derma and brown negligently caused the physical and sexual assault because they knew or should have known of burden propensity to assault clients but did nothing to protect doe failed to warn doe failed to adequately supervise burden and failed to monitor burden.count three alleged violations of the connecticut unfair trade practices act cutpa.to p,based on derma and brown failure to warn or protect doe from burden despite derma and brown awareness of burden propensity to assault clients.
count one of the roe complaint alleged physical and sexual assault.it charged that derma and brown failed to investigate roe claim and continued to employ burden after receiving a report that burden had sexually assaulted a previous patron.count one also claimed that brown sought to publicly discredit roe by making statements to the press of her disbelief of the allegations against burden.count two alleged negligence against derma and brown because they knew or should have known about burden propensity to have sexual contact with assault clients and failed to protect roe failed to provide adequate safeguards to clients receiving massages failed to adequately train,supervise,and monitor burden and retained burden despite his propensity to have sexual contact with assault his clients.count three alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress by derma,brown,and burden,whereas count four alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress by the same defendants.count five alleged an invasion of privacy,and count six alleged violations of cutpa based on derma and brown failure to warn or protect roe from burden despite derma and brown awareness of burden propensity to have sexual contact with assault clients.
b the insurance policies 
derma and brown rely on two insurance policies to cover their defense against the claims by allen,doe,and roe and,if necessary,to provide indemnification.the first policy,a professional liability policy pl policy,was issued by northfield and designates derma as the named insured.derma executive officers and directors are also insureds,but only with respect to their duties as derma officers and directors.the pl policy provides coverage for those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of a negligent act,error or omission in the rendering of or failure to render professional services of the type described in the declarations.the declarations page describes derma business as massage therapist.the pl policy further states that northfield has the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.the pl policy excludes coverage for a ny damages arising out of any dishonest,fraudulent,criminal or malicious act or omission of any insured or employee.
derma and brown also rely upon the commercial general liability cgl part of the policy underwritten by nic.derma is the named insured on the cgl part,and brown,in her capacity as president of derma,is also an insured.the cgl part obligates nic to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies and to defend any suit seeking those damages.bodily injury is defined under the cgl part as bodily injury,sickness or disease sustained by a person.this includes mental anguish,mental injury,shock,fright or death resulting from bodily injury,sickness or disease.the cgl part excludes coverage for bodily injury expected or intended by the insured,and b odily injury arising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional service,including but not limited to b massage.
c proceedings in the district court 
northfield and nic initiated declaratory judgment actions in the district of connecticut seeking a determination that their insurance policies do not obligate them to defend or indemnify derma or brown in connection with the allen,doe,and roe suits.the district court granted both northfield and nic motions for summary judgment.
with regard to the northfield policy,the district court refused to torture the meaning of professional services to include sexually assaulting a client in the guise of massaging her.reasoning that the natural meaning of the term professional services includes massaging clients only,the court found that the pl policy,which insures damages only against negligence in the rendering or omission of professional services,did not cover the acts alleged in the allen,doe,and roe complaints.
the district court also denied coverage to derma and brown under the pl policy because of the policy criminal acts exclusion,which disallows coverage for a ny damages arising out of any dishonest,fraudulent,criminal or malicious act or omission of any insured or employee.under the district court reading of the term arising out of,coverage could not exist for the negligence claims against derma and brown because these claims were derived from the same factual circumstances as the sexual assault.
finally,the district court held that burden nolo contendere plea and the resulting conviction triggered the criminal acts exclusion in the pl policy.w here a declaratory judgment action is brought seeking the enforcement of a contractual provision,a judgment of conviction is conclusive of the insured guilt.emphasis in original citation omitted.the court found that a conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere is admissible in disputes contesting coverage under a criminal acts exclusion,and noted that the conviction can not be disregarded as if it did not happen.quoting allstate ins.simansky.
the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of nic.adopting the reasoning of its decision for northfield,the district court granted nic motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the nic policy contains an exclusion for bodily injury arising out of the rendering or failure to render professional services,including massage and a criminal acts exclusion with language virtually identical to that of the pl policy.
discussion 
because this action is based solely on diversity jurisdiction,whether derma and brown are covered under the pl policy the nic policy is a question entirely dependent on the construction and interpretation of connecticut law.moore cont l cas,finding that construction of an insurance policy presents a question of law.
certification is a discretionary device,both for the certifying court and for the court requested to answer the certified question s.mccarthy olin,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.local rule permits certification to the highest court of a state an unsettled and significant question of state law that will control the outcome of a case pending before this court.cir.reciprocally,the supreme court of connecticut may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the united states if the answer may be determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and if there is no controlling appellate decision,constitutional provision or statute of this state.d.as permitted by.d and cir,we respectfully request that the supreme court of connecticut address the following questions 
in a policy with multiple coverage parts like the nic policy,does a criminal acts exclusion in the commercial crime coverage form apply to disputes arising under the commercial general liability form 
can burden plea of nolo contendere and the resulting conviction be used to trigger an insurance policy criminal acts exclusion 
when applied to the business of massage therapy,does the term professional services include acts ancillary to the business of massage therapist,the investigating,training,monitoring,supervising of masseurs 
under the language of the nic policy,do the negligence claims against derma and brown arise out of the rendering of professional services when the underlying acts involve physical and sexual assaults during the performance of a massage 
we address the need for answers to these questions seriatim.
in a policy with multiple coverage parts like the nic policy,does a criminal acts exclusion in the commercial crime coverage form apply to disputes arising under the commercial general liability form 
derma and brown are insured under nic policy,which is composed of five different sections and coverage parts.the first section is the common policy conditions,which includes declarations applicable to all coverage parts.next are the commercial property coverage part,the commercial general liability coverage part,the commercial umbrella coverage part,and the forms and endorsements applicable.
the dispute in this case has focused on the commercial general liability form cglf,which falls under the commercial general liability coverage part.nic contends that the criminal acts exclusion in the commercial crime coverage form cccf modifies the coverage provided under the cglf in support of that position,nic cites language in the cccf that states,various provisions in this policy restrict coverage.read the entire policy carefully to determine rights,duties and what is and is not covered.
derma and brown contend that the criminal acts exclusion in the cccf does not apply to the claims made by allen,doe,and roe because these claims involve coverage provided in the cglf,which,derma and brown argue,is distinct and independent from the cccf.derma notes in that regard that the cccf insures against l oss of,and direct loss from damage to,money,securities and property other than money and securities resulting directly from employee dishonesty,whereas the cglf covers damages resulting from bodily injury and property damage.the cccf further enumerates coverage for claims based on forgery,money orders,counterfeit currency,and unauthorized business card use.derma and brown argue that these kinds of claims are completely unrelated to the claims at issue in this suit.
the applicability of the cccf criminal acts exclusion to the cglf is extremely important to the resolution of this case.because the cglf contains no criminal acts exclusion in and of itself,whether the exclusion from the cccf applies to the cglf may be dispositive of the question of coverage under the nic policy.
can burden plea of nolo contendere and the resulting conviction be used to trigger an insurance policy criminal acts exclusion 
under connecticut law,a prior plea of nolo contendere and a conviction based thereon may not be admitted into evidence in a subsequent civil action or administrative proceeding to establish either an admission of guilt or the fact of criminal conduct.town of groton united steelworkers of.convictions following a plea of nolo contendere may not be used against the defendant as an admission in a subsequent criminal proceeding either.id.at citations omitted.furthermore,convictions based on nolo contendere pleas are not admissible as res judicata establishing that the plaintiff was engaged in a criminal act,id.at quoting lawrence kozlowski,to affect the plaintiff credibility,id.citing krowka colt patent fire arm,or as evidence of acknowledged tortious conduct.burrell united states,cir.
the court in town of groton noted,however,that there are some areas of law where public policy might require the consequences of a nolo contendere plea to be more severe.town of groton,at holding that t herefore,although our jurisprudence traditionally has imposed limitations on the collateral effects to be given,in the civil and administrative litigation contexts,to a conviction based on a nolo plea,the private nature of voluntary arbitration strongly counsels against extending those limitations to the employment sphere governed by a voluntary arbitration clause.see also state daniels,we recognize that the defendant conviction based on his alford plea would establish a violation of the conditions of the defendant probation,overruled in part on other grounds by state singleton,godin godin,wl,at,noting,for purposes of child custody order,that the fact that the father entered a lford pleas to these sexual assault charges does not alter the fact of conviction.
one connecticut case,allstate insurance co simansky,addressed the effect of a prior plea of nolo contendere on the operation of an insurance policy criminal acts exclusion.a judgment of conviction is conclusive evidence of the insured guilt although a conviction may or may not be conclusive evidence of the underlying facts,it is to be accorded preclusive effect with respect to the insured commission of the crime.id.at emphasis supplied quoting allstate ins.schmitt.simansky,therefore,allows nolo contendere pleas to serve as evidence of the commission of a crime in civil matters that involve the enforcement of a contractual provision in an insurance policy.id.at.thus,under simansky,when a criminal act exclusion is at issue,t he fact of the conviction has a collateral legal consequence on the enforcement of the policy exclusion.for purposes of the exclusion,the conviction can not be disregarded as if it did not happen.it did happen,and in so happening triggered the exclusion.id.at.however,simansky relied on sokoloff saxbe,cir,simansky,at,and the supreme court of connecticut has specifically noted that it does not wholly subscribe to the majority view expressed in sokoloff.town of groton,at 
given this state of the law,we think the supreme court of connecticut should decide whether a plea of nolo contendere and the resulting conviction can be used to trigger a criminal acts exclusion in an insurance policy.
when applied to the business of massage therapy,does the term professional services include acts ancillary to the business of massage therapist,the investigating,training,monitoring,supervising of masseurs 
the pl policy insures against claims of a negligent act,error or omission in the rendering of or failure to render professional services.the pl policy describes the business of derma as being that of a massage therapist.the pl policy,however,also contains a separation of insureds clause.t his insurance applies.as if each named insured were the only named insured and.separately to each insured against whom c
