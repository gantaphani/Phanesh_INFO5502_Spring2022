several state law questions arise in this appeal,and three federal law questions,whether expert testimony should have been excluded under,whether disallowance of a peremptory challenge was error and if so whether it was harmless,and whether alaska english rule attorneys fee may be awarded in a diversity action where alaska is the forum state but another state law governs the dispute.
alaska rent a car predecessor began doing business as an avis licensee in,three years before alaska attained statehood.most other avis licensees had a defined territory in a locality,not an entire state,within which they had the exclusive right to rent cars on behalf of avis.avis reasonably considered alaska different.
in its agreement,the alaska avis licensee was entitled to operate in the entire state of alaska,about of the entire united states,but a negligible percentage of the nation roads.the license was renewed in,this time giving alaska rent a car exclusive rights in specific locations within alaska.a amendment added additional locations to the license agreement,and gave alaska rent a car a right of first refusal for control of any license avis planned to grant anywhere in alaska.it also gave alaska rent a car the right to expand into new territory,such as temporary camps during the construction of the oil pipeline from prudhoe bay to valdez during the period.the amendment stated 
it is additionally agreed a that alaska conditions of terrain and weather as well as changing and cyclical economic conditions may result in customer demands for quick service in new and even temporary locations or camps.it is understood that licensee may utilize his floating fleet to meet such demands,with full reporting of such circumstances to avis.
avis bought a company called agency rent a car in.some of avis licensees claimed that avis was breaching their license agreements by operating another rental car company in their territories.to protect itself against these claims,avis sued thirteen of its licensees,and sought class certification,to obtain a judgment that its purchase of agency rent a car and its changed operations did not violate licensee rights.avis and named defendants settled in,without ever litigating to class certification or judgment.our case arises out of that settlement,which allows avis to purchase additional rental car companies,but requires that the sales,marketing and reservation activities,operations and personnel of and for the avis system will not be utilized to market,provide,make available car rental services for any additional rental car company purchased by avis the settlement agreement protected avis licensees from the risk of avis using its personnel to steer customers and potential customers towards another brand.licensees would typically only rent avis cars,but avis might own a competitor operating in the same locality under a different name.
avis bought budget rent a car out of bankruptcy in.it then restructured its central operations,putting the avis and budget marketing teams under unified management,creating a single team to answer calls to both avis and budget reservation lines,and combining the avis and budget national corporate sales forces.the obvious threat from these actions to avis licensees was that budget would bleed off some of their customers and potential customers.people typically rent cars online or by telephone from a national site or number,and governments and big corporations typically negotiate with the national entity,because they typically rent cars for use away from home.
alaska rent a car sued avis claiming that avis had indeed breached the settlement agreement,causing alaska business to be switched to budget rent a car,its local competitor.the district court granted a partial summary judgment,establishing that alaska rent a car was a party to the settlement agreement,and that avis had breached the agreement by using the same personnel to sell and market both avis and budget cars.damages were left for jury trial.the jury returned a verdict in favor of alaska rent a car for million.avis appeals.
was alaska rent a car a promisee under the settlement agreement 
the question whether the settlement agreement included alaska rent a car was decided by partial summary judgment,so we review de novo avis argues on appeal that alaska rent a car was not a party.
first,avis argues that alaska rent a car could not be embraced by the settlement agreement,because the agreement protected only licensees with exclusive license agreements,that is,with exclusive territories within which avis could not promote competitors to the licensee except to the extent the settlement agreement allowed.this argument is entirely without merit.one reason why is that alaska rent a car plainly did have exclusive territories,the designated and permitted locations within the state of alaska.were alaska rent a car to use the avis brand to open a counter at the seattle airport,it would violate its licensing agreement,just as any other avis licensee would if it opened a counter at the anchorage airport.the other reason is that we can find no language limiting permission to join in the settlement agreement to licensees with exclusive licensing agreements.the settlement agreement was offered to all avis system,which alaska rent a car indisputably was.
avis also makes the more substantial argument that alaska rent a car joinder was untimely.what color this argument has arises from the fact that alaska rent a car did not send in a signed joinder to the settlement agreement until july,almost four years after the settlement and three and a half years after avis had sent its licensees a letter inviting them to join in the settlement.
avis letter was an offer,and alaska rent a car response was an acceptance.the parties do not dispute that new york law controls on the timeliness of acceptance,and new york law establishes the usual rule,that acceptance must be within a reasonable time under new york law,reasonableness is normally a question for a jury.however,a court may decide it as a matter of law when rational jurors could reach only one conclusion 
three or four years might well be unreasonable in many circumstances,but not in this one.first,the offer stated no time limit on acceptance,though avis could easily have expressly limited the duration of its offer.the reasonable inference from avis failure to impose a time limit is that it did not intend for there to be a time limit,because it saw advantage to joinders whenever they came in.second,four and a half years after alaska rent a car joined,eight years after the offer was made,avis asked the court overseeing the agency settlement to declare the offer terminated,implying that alaska rent a car joinder came in plenty of time.third,avis intent that no time limit should apply may be inferred from its written confirmation of acceptances by six other licensees who sent in their acceptances after alaska rent a car did.fourth,avis previous representations in this litigation that alaska rent a car had joined in the settlement imply that it too interpreted its own offer to be open to acceptance and timely accepted by alaska rent a car.avis has cited no new york case involving anything like parallel facts where an acceptance was deemed untimely,and a rational juror could only conclude from avis actions that alaska rent a car acceptance was made within a reasonable time.the district court was correct in ruling that alaska rent a car was a party to the settlement agreement by virtue of its sufficiently timely joinder.
during jury selection,avis made peremptory challenges of the only two alaska natives on the panel the district court accepted one but denied the other,applying batson kentucky avis argues that denial of its peremptory challenge of the second alaska native juror,who sat on the trial jury,was a batson error requiring reversal.we reject the argument on alternative grounds,that there was no error,and that even if there had been,it would be harmless.
since liability was established by summary judgment,the only issue for the jury was whether alaska rent a car had proved damages,and if so,how much.avis had to start off on the wrong foot,that it had made a promise to alaska rent a car and broken it.faced with the problem of justifying a zero or low damages award despite having broken its promise,avis needed a jury willing to deny an award to the victim of a broken promise.avis attorney used voir dire to try to avoid jurors who would punish the broken promise even if no damages were proved.
avis asked prospective jurors whether any of them had a strong belief or hold a strong opinion that if someone breaks a promise that they should be punished for that by having to pay damages the first of the two native veniremen,number,said she agreed that someone who breaks a promise should be punished by having to pay damages,even if there was no proof of any loss.but at a sidebar,number said she would nevertheless follow the judge instructions if they were to the contrary.avis exercised a peremptory challenge against her.despite a batson challenge from alaska rent a car,the judge allowed avis to use that peremptory challenge.the judge accepted avis lawyer representation that he was not satisfied that her feelings,about how damages ought to be awarded for breach of contract regardless of whether actual loss was proved,would not affect her verdict.no issue has been raised in this appeal about allowing that challenge.
the issue goes to the challenge of the other native venireman,number.when informed that he was almost out of time to question prospective jurors,avis counsel chose to question number,who said that whether she would punish someone who broke a promise without harming anyone would depend on how the promises were made and what been broken.two jurors said substantially the same thing.but both of the unchallenged jurors assured counsel they would obey the court instructions regardless of their feelings.number did not say she would obey the instructions despite her personal views,but because the court time limit ran out,she was not asked.
responding to alaska rent a car batson challenge,avis lawyer said his gut feeling was that number viewed punishment as appropriate for breach of contract regardless of whether there was any harm.he pointed out that there were no racial issues in this commercial dispute,and said his challenge was not based on race.alaska rent a car lawyer and the judge both expressed their confidence that avis lawyer was not racially motivated the trial was in alaska,where the lawyers and judges often have substantial professional experience with,against,and before each other.but the judge disallowed the challenge.the court acknowledged that avis lawyer had not had sufficient time for a dialogue on voir dire with number,to see whether she would follow instructions about damages despite her views to the contrary,but the court was not satisfied with striking both native jurors on the record before him.
this batson issue is difficult because of the explicit finding that avis lawyer did not act with a racial motivation.the court did not expressly find the evil to which batson is directed,purposeful racial discrimination.the judge merely indicated that he was uncomfortable in this case with a jury from which all natives had been excluded by peremptory challenges.
batson applies to civil as well as criminal cases avis was entitled to its peremptory challenge unless it exercised it in a manner violative of batson.the troubling issue here is step three of the batson test prima facie case,explanation,finding of pretext were it not for the express agreement by the judge and counsel that avis lawyer,whom they likely all knew,was not personally motivated by ethnic discrimination,pretext would strongly suggest itself.venireman said just what two unchallenged jurors said,so comparative juror analysis would support an inference of purposeful racial discrimination.and when avis lawyer saw that time was running out,he chose to question number instead of another venireman.
we are nevertheless not persuaded that the district court erred.we review application of batson law to facts and note that part three of the batson test asks judges to engage in the awkward,sometimes hopeless,task of a lawyer instinctive judgment the underlying basis for which may be invisible even to the lawyer exercising the challenge.it seems evident that although the district judge believed that avis lawyer had no subjective purpose of racial discrimination,he was concerned that an objective observer would infer from the facts comparative analysis of the substantially similar responses from two unchallenged jurors,skipping over other veniremen to get to number that there was purposeful discrimination.such a concern is among the reasons for batson.the harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community.selection procedures that purposefully exclude minorities from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.
objective analysis is also more reliable than subjective analysis.a judge,like any person,is to see into peoples hearts trial judges are generally very reluctant to call a lawyer a liar,by finding that the justification for a peremptory challenge is not credible.but a trial judge is in a very good position to evaluate objectively and impartially what the record would establish,from the point of view of a reasonable observer.in this case,the trial judge found the absence of subjective racial bias,but the presence of an appearance of purposeful discrimination.that suffices to justify denial of a peremptory challenge,at least in a civil case.
even if there were error,we held in united states that an erroneous denial of a peremptory challenge does not require automatic reversal.we held that rivera overruled our holding in united states that denial of a peremptory challenge required reversal,and stated that the rivera court directly undercuts our precedent by determining that the erroneous denial of a peremptory challenge may indeed be subject to review.we concluded that rivera allowed us to apply the standard of review that is appropriate under the circumstances of the district court error.in lindsey,we applied plain error review,as lindsey failed to object to the district court error depriving him of a peremptory challenge.here,avis did object.
the right to peremptory challenges in civil cases exists by virtue of federal rule of civil procedure b and,three challenges per party or side,not by virtue of the constitution.erroneous denial of a challenge is therefore subject to federal rule of civil procedure on harmless error,requiring us to disregard error not affecting substantial rights.
this case involved nothing bearing on race or ethnicity.number was not challenged for cause,and the feelings she expressed about damages were substantially identical to at least two other jurors feelings.the district court allowed avis attorney to use his third peremptory challenge on another juror if he wished,but counsel waived the opportunity,thereby allowing three people with the same uneasiness about breach without damages to stay on the jury instead of two.the verdict was unanimous.we are unable to see any way that substantial rights,that is,rights affecting the substance of the case as opposed to the procedural right to three peremptory challenges,could have been affected by erroneous denial of this challenge.
iii.daubert.
each side put on testimony of an expert witness on damages.avis objected under federal rule of evidence and daubert merrell dow and its progeny to allowing alaska rent a car expert to testify.
before it allowed alaska rent a car expert to testify about his opinion on damages,the court gave avis the opportunity to conduct a lengthy voir dire to inquire into the facts and data underlying the expert conclusions.after that voir dire,the court made a daubert gateway determination.it concluded that there enough underlying data and a sufficient causal connection to allow the expert testimony i think he qualified to give the testimony.i think his testimony will assist the trier of fact and i think his opinion is the result of reliable principles and methods c learly,avis has areas for cross examination,and that what it going to be subject to.
the task,for both sides,was to figure out how much business and how much profit alaska rent a car had lost on account of avis breach of the settlement agreement.avis had breached when it bought budget rent a car out of bankruptcy in and then merged much of the two companies national sales and marketing staffs into one.
as in any damages case,the calculation had to address a hypothetical world that never existed,one in which other things remained the same but the breach had not occurred.to calculate damages from the breach,as opposed to damages from competition,alaska rent a car expert witness compared avis and budget experience with alamo national alamo experience after cerberus bought alamo out of bankruptcy at around the same time.his theory was that alamo and budget both got infusions of capital and management enabling them to compete,but differed in that cerberus did not rent cars through any other company,and avis did,through budget.thus alamo could not benefit from merging sales and marketing activities because cerberus had no other car rental company,but budget could.his assumption was that budget would have performed much like alamo but for the benefit of a unified avis budget sales and marketing effort.
budget rebounded much faster than alamo.the witness in effect treated the faster rebound of budget as attributable to the breach of the settlement agreement.he used alamo national rate of rebound as a rough approximation of how budget,had it not had the benefit of the breach,would have performed in alaska.he then projected how much market share budget gained each year due to the breach.he testified that he used alamo national rate of rebound as an approximation for how budget in alaska would have performed.he reasoned that the rental car market is a national market,and that national rebound rates would not be skewed by idiosyncratic local factors.
according to alaska rent a car witness,alamo national market share dropped after it went into bankruptcy,slowly recovering after cerberus bought it.budget was in bankruptcy a shorter time,and recovered faster after avis bought it.the witness,saying that he wanted to be conservative in his estimates,assumed that budget would have lost of its market share slightly less than alamo had avis bought it out of bankruptcy but not breached the settlement agreement.
because the revitalized budget would draw customers from other car rental companies too,not just avis,the witness picked the juneau airport to approximate how much of the bite would come out of alaska rent a car.juneau had the advantage of simplicity,because he could examine a market before budget entered and after budget entered,to approximate how much business it took from alaska rent a car.over the first three years of its entry into the juneau market,budget got an average of of the juneau rental car market.about of that market share gain came from alaska rent a car customers,from hertz and other competitors.so to get a statewide figure,the witness made the assumption that after the breach,budget got about half its customers from alaska rent a car statewide.he calculated budget market share after the bankruptcy,assumed that but for the breach budget rate of market share recovery would have been similar to alamo national rate of recovery,and assumed that about half of its faster recovery came at the expense of alaska rent a car.these assumptions and inferences generated lost profits calculations of million from to due to the breach,and future lost profits,discounted to present value,of million.
avis challenges the expert assumptions and comparisons.it argues that differences between alamo and budget,such as the much longer duration of alamo bankruptcy,and many other factors,made alamo an invalid comparison.avis also argues that applying a national market share comparison to alaska overlooked very significant differences in how the national and alaska markets worked.and it argues that alaska rent a car extrapolation from the juneau market experience ignored the differences between this small market,only of the statewide rental car market,and the market elsewhere in the state,where roads connected towns unlike juneau,and doing business more often required a rental car.of course,alaska rent a car expert gave reasons for his use of all these comparisons,such as by pointing out the clarity with which the juneau market could be examined.because budget entered juneau in,juneau could clearly show how much business budget took from avis there.
all of avis challenges to alaska rent a car expert are colorable,but none go to admissibility.they amount to impeachment.under federal rule of evidence the trial court may exercise discretion to allow expert testimony if the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue it is based upon sufficient facts or data it is the product of reliable principles and methods and the expert has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.this list of requirements makes the task of determining admissibility sound more mechanical and less judgmental than it really is.under daubert merrell dow and its progeny,
t he court must assess an expert reasoning or methodology,using as appropriate such criteria as testability,publication in peer reviewed literature,and general acceptance,but the inquiry is a flexible one.shaky but admissible evidence is to be attacked by cross examination,contrary evidence,and attention to the burden of proof,not exclusion.in sum,the trial court must assure that the expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.
expert opinion testimony is relevant if the knowledge underlying it has a valid connection to the pertinent inquiry.and it is reliable if the knowledge underlying it has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline.
the daubert reliability requirement is flexible and daubert list of specific factors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or in every case.the list of factors was meant to be helpful,not definitive and the trial court has discretion to decide how to test an expert reliability as well as whether the testimony is reliable,based on the particular circumstances of the particular case.
basically,the judge is supposed to screen the jury from unreliable nonsense opinions,but not exclude opinions merely because they are impeachable.the district court is not tasked with deciding whether the expert is right or wrong,just whether his testimony has substance such that it would be helpful to a jury.avis does not challenge alaska rent a car expert credentials and qualifications.nor does it challenge his general methodology,comparing the unknown to an analogous known experience.instead,avis challenges three aspects of the witnesses testimony using alamo as the comparator,using the national rather than the alaska market as a baseline,and extrapolating from the juneau market to the entire alaska market.none of these challenges make the district judge decision to admit the testimony an abuse of discretion.they all go to the weight of the testimony and its credibility,not its admissibility.avis gave the jury good arguments for rejecting the testimony,but the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the jury to listen to alaska rent a car expert as well as avis.given that the judge is a gatekeeper,not a fact finder,the gate could not be closed to this relevant opinion offered with sufficient foundation by one qualified to give it.
iv.certainty of damages.
the jury returned a unanimous million verdict for alaska rent a car,slightly more than the in damages that alaska rent a car expert witness calculated.avis expert witness offered no total number at all to the jury,just critiques of the other expert assumptions and calculations,with some numbers differing from his for component parts.avis thus presented the case to the jury as a million or nothing choice.avis argued in its close that the burden of proof on damages was on alaska
