b.the allegations of plaintiffs complaint for damages and injunctive relief 
the complaint alleges a total of seven common law tort causes of action against the beverage companies,namely fraud negligent misrepresentation strict products liability for defective design strict products liability for failure to warn breach of express warranty intentional interference with prospective economic relations and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.
plaintiffs seek special,general,punitive,and exemplary damages apportioned by the market share of each defendant.plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from selling distributing beverages within the s tate of california,until such time as said defendants discontinue the improper labeling of beverage containers.plaintiffs claims are based on their assertion that the beverage companies distribute sell beverages in beverage containers which are improperly and falsely labeled ca redemption value,california redemption value,ca cash refund,california cash refund,or ca crv in parts of the united states,other than california,including but not limited to arizona nevada plaintiffs allege the containers so labeled are false because some used beverage containers sold in states other than california,such as arizona and nevada where there is no beverage deposit or beverage redemption law are regularly transported to california to be illegally sold and redeemed at recycling centers such as plaintiffs recycling centers in the cities of chino and fontana.
plaintiffs further allege that the beverage companies mislabeled the containers they sold outside of california because they were aware that these beverage containers would be purchased by california residents crossing state lines with the intent to avoid the deposit and would be then transported across the border to the s tate of california,consumed and then redeemed at recycling facilities,such as alamo and chino.plaintiffs cite an alleged incident,on or about january of,when plaintiffs paid california redemption value for illegally imported beverage containers.plaintiffs do not name any of the individuals who transported or redeemed any containers in california,nor do they contend the beverage companies are among,or in conspiracy with,those who illegally attempted to redeem such containers.instead,plaintiffs allege the beverage companies knew or should have known that such illegal redemption activities would be undertaken by unnamed third party actors.
the complaint alleges that plaintiffs alamo and chino were the subject of recent enforcement actions by calrecycle alamo received an accusation from calrecycle alleging among other things,alamo receipt and payment of redemption value for used beverage containers originating from outside the state of california.according to calrecycle,in january,alamo facilitated the redemption of containers that originated in phoenix,arizona,which resulted in the arrest and criminal conviction of eight of the individuals involved in the recycling fraud.calrecycle also noted that,over a three week period that same month,there were at least occasions when alamo purchased more than pounds of aluminum beverage containers from an individual,operation or entity in a single day,in violation of department regulations.based on the volume and frequency of the loads being delivered,calrecycle charged,alamo knew,or should have known,that this material was far in excess of what could be anticipated from consumer transactions and that they were purchasing ineligible material.as a result,calrecycle revoked alamo certification to operate two recycling centers and also imposed civil penalties and restitution.
the complaint similarly alleges that plaintiff chino received from calrecycle a notice of revocation of chino probationary certification to pay redemption value for used beverage containers in california.calrecycle issued that notice on the ground that chino was receiving unusually large loads of aluminum beverage containers on a daily basis and was involved in one redemption in which nine suspects were arrested seven of whom pleaded guilty on violations of grand theft,conspiracy,and recycling fraud.the notice also alleged that chino paid and claimed refund values on ineligible beverage containers that chino knew,or should have known,came from noncertified recyclers or from outside the state paid refund values to a person,operation,or entity not certified by calrecycle that was delivering loads of aluminum beverage containers in excess of pounds in a single day,in violation of state regulations and on at least three occasions,failed to properly inspect each load of containers for eligibility prior to determining the basis for payment,in violation of state regulations.
at defendants request,the trial court took judicial notice that,in february,plaintiffs entered into separate settlement agreements with the department,resolving the department administrative charges against plaintiffs.under the terms of the settlement agreements,alamo recycling center certificate became probationary for a minimum of five years and chino revoked recycling center certificate was reinstated as probationary for a minimum of five years.as restitution,each plaintiff agreed to pay to the california beverage container recycling fund.
