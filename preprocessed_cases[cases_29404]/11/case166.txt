facts alleged in the amended complaint.
on december,the appellant entered a radio shack store in brunswick,maine,seeking to purchase a police scanner.for the duration of his stay,he was the only on the premises.three of whom were his movements,and at least one of them accompanied him throughout his visit.upon inquiry,a clerk told the appellant that the scanner he wished to buy was not in stock.the appellant did find a book,a telephone,and some batteries that were to his liking.at the checkout counter,he bought those items and asked whether the scanner might be available at another branch.after calling around,the store manager,steven richard,responded in the negative.at that juncture,richard requested the appellant name and address.the appellant obliged.
soon after the appellant left,richard discovered that a laptop computer worth approximately was missing.richard reported the purloined computer to the brunswick police,told them that he suspected the appellant of the theft,and supplied the officers with the appellant address.the appellant lived in the nearby town of bath,and the brunswick police contacted their counterparts in that community.a bath police officer thereafter went to the appellant home to investigate the reported theft.the appellant allowed the officer to search his dwelling and his car,but the officer found no trace of the stolen computer.
after the officer left,the appellant telephoned radio shack to complain about what he believed to be unjust and racially discriminatory treatment.richard told him that all the customers who were in the store during the same time frame had been reported as suspects in the theft.this statement was patently false richard did not provide information about any other persons including the three or four white customers who had purchased items at about the same time to the authorities.indeed,apart from transmitting the appellant identity to the police,radio shack made no effort to locate the wayward computer.
the appellant heard nothing further from the police.although he became dissatisfied with some of the products that he had purchased,he did not try to return them for fear that he would again be accused of shoplifting.
travel of the case.
on april,the appellant filed an administrative complaint with the maine human rights commission mhrc,charging radio shack with discrimination in a public accommodation.see.ann.tit.on january,the mhrc concluded that reasonable grounds existed to believe that unlawful discrimination had occurred and issued a letter.the appellant eschewed further state proceedings and brought suit in the federal district court.his complaint premised federal jurisdiction both on the existence of a federal question,see,and on diversity of citizenship,see id.a.as amended,the body of the complaint contained three statements of claim.the first asserted violations of and count.the second asserted a violation of the maine human rights act mhra.ann.tit,b count.the third asserted a claim for defamation count.
radio shack moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see.b.after briefing and argument,the district court granted the motion with respect to the first and third counts.garrett tandy,d.the court allowed the mhra claim to proceed,but later dismissed it without prejudice,presumably for failure to satisfy the amount in controversy required for the existence of diversity jurisdiction.see garrett tandy,unpublished order see also a establishing jurisdictional minimum of more than for diversity cases.ann.tit,b capping civil penalties under the mhra at for a first violation.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo,taking as true the facts contained in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff favor.rogan menino,cir lachapelle,at.in so doing,however,we eschew any reliance on bald assertions,unsupportable conclusions,and opprobrious epithets.chongris bd.of appeals,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.only if the complaint,read in this fashion,presents a scenario that precludes recovery on any viable theory may we affirm an order of dismissal.see conley gibson,d lachapelle,at.
in this venue,the appellant challenges the district court dismissal of counts and.we examine each count separately.
racial discrimination.
count of the amended complaint is predicated upon a federal statute that traces its origins to section of the civil rights act of,stat.this statute,now codified in,prohibits both public and private racial discrimination in certain specified activities including the making and enforcement of contracts.runyon mccrary,d.
to state a claim under this statute,a plaintiff must show that he is a member of a racial minority,that the defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his race,and that the discrimination implicated one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute.morris dillard dep t stores,cir.the appellant averments plainly satisfy the first and second of these requirements.the battleground,then,is the third.
the appellant attempts to fulfill this requirement by alleging that radio shack discriminatory acts interfered with his right to make and enforce contracts.that right is one that falls within the prophylaxis of section.see quoted infra note.the critical question,however,is whether the facts alleged in the appellant complaint,taken in the light most flattering to his theory of the case,show a sufficient nexus between the asserted discrimination and some contractual right or relationship.
the case law suggests the nature of the requisite nexus.the supreme court originally gave section a narrow focus,declaring that the statute does not apply to conduct which occurs after the formation of a contract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract obligations.patterson mclean credit union,d.but congress widened the interpretive lens when it enacted the civil rights act of,stat.that act amended section by expanding the phrase make and enforce contracts to include the making,performance,modification,and termination of contracts,and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship.b.the revised pertinent text of which is reproduced in the margin governs this case.
we mention this history because the appellant central thesis is that the amendment elongates the reach of the statute sufficiently to link the two types of racially discriminatory treatment alleged unwanted surveillance and the intrusion of the police into the appellant the appellant contract rights.the district court rejected both facets of this argument.it ruled that the surveillance was not actionable under section because the appellant purchased his supplies and went home,without any interference based upon his race.garrett,d at.it ruled that the later events were not actionable under section because t he objectionable conduct did not have anything to do with the purchase that the appellant made,and,thus,neither affected the making or enforcement of a contract nor implicated the appellant contractual rights.id.the appellant asseverates that these rulings rest on an overly grudging reading of the revised statute.
although the amendment broadened the scope of section,our own case law is unilluminating as to the extent of this expansion we turn,therefore,to our sister circuits for enlightenment.
the preeminent case is morris office max,cir.there,two black customers were browsing innocently in a retail store.the assistant manager became suspicious and called the police.id.at.the police arrived,hassled the two men one of whom had completed his purchase and the other of whom had purchased nothing,found no evidence of wrongdoing,and departed uttering racially derisive comments.id.the customers sued,accusing the store of violating section.the seventh circuit rejected the suit on the ground that the plaintiffs could not point to specific facts showing that office max deprived them of any of the enumerated rights in specifically,the right to make and enforce a contract.they were denied neither admittance nor service,nor were they asked to leave the store.id.at.
to like effect is hampton dillard dep t stores,cir,cert.denied,d.in that case,the tenth circuit ruled that a woman of descent who allegedly had been ejected from a store on the basis of her race could not pursue a section claim because she had neither attempted nor planned to make any specific purchase and,accordingly,could not prove any interference with a contractual relationship.id.the court made plain that the mere expectation of being treated without discrimination while shopping will not support a claim under section.id.at.in contrast,the court upheld a judgment for another woman,ejected at the same time,who was attempting to redeem a coupon that she had received incidental to a previous purchase.id.at.the court concluded that the coupon was tantamount to an option contract,and that the store could be held liable for its denial of the right to redeem it.id.at.the distinction drawn by the tenth circuit between the two plaintiffs aptly illustrates the need for a contractual nexus in a suit premised on.
another representative case is morris dillard dep t stores,supra.there,an woman had browsed in a department store without making any purchases.at.she was subsequently accused of shoplifting,arrested,and temporarily banned from returning to the store.id.at.the woman brought suit under section,claiming that the banishment amounted to a deprivation of a contractual interest.id.at.the fifth circuit rejected her section claim because she did not offer evidence of some tangible attempt to contract with the defendant store during the course of the ban,which could give rise to a contractual duty between her and the merchant,and which was in some way thwarted.id.at.in fine,the facts were too speculative to establish loss of any actual contract interest owed to her by the defendant.id.at.
in youngblood food stores,cir,cert.denied,d,the eighth circuit confronted a situation in which a store employee had accused an customer of shoplifting after the customer had consummated his purchase.id.at.charges were brought,but dismissed.id.at.the court of appeals held,albeit over a vigorous dissent,that the customer could not bring a claim against the store under section because o nce he paid the cashier and received the purchase from the cashier,neither party owed the other any duty under the contract.id.
we are not comfortable with all of these outcomes,nor do we make a wholesale endorsement of the reasoning employed by these courts.section,insofar as it is pertinent here,pivots on contractual relationships,and the contours of what constitutes a contract or a contractual relationship,for that matter are properly found in state law.see hampton,at.moreover,shopping in a retail store may involve multiple contracts.each time a customer takes an item off the shelf,a new contract looms,and each time the item is returned,the potential contract is extinguished the expansion of the definition of make and enforce contracts in section,then,extends the reach of the statute to situations beyond the four corners of a particular contract the extension applies to those situations in which a merchant,acting out of racial animus,impedes a customer ability to enter into,or enjoy the benefits of,a contractual relationship.see christian stores,cir explaining that,in a commercial establishment context,liability will attach when a plaintiff receive s services in a markedly hostile manner and in a manner which a reasonable person would find objectively discriminatory.so viewed,some of the precedents cited above seem problematic,morris,at denying liability when the store,allegedly acting out of racial animus,refused access to a prospective customer youngblood,at denying liability where the customer,allegedly because of racial animus,was arrested while still in the store and the purchased items were never returned to him.
in the last analysis,however,the doctrinal rule established in these cases seems sound,even if the application of the rule is questionable.the legislative history of the amendment makes it crystal clear that congress did not intend to convert section into a general prohibition against race discrimination.see.ii,at,reprinted in,the committee intends this provision to bar all racial discrimination in contracts.emphasis supplied.it follows,then,that in order to satisfy the foundational pleading requirements for a suit under section,a retail customer must allege that he was actually denied the ability either to make,perform,enforce,modify,or terminate a contract,or to enjoy the fruits of a contractual relationship,by reason of a animus.see morris,at hampton,at office max,at.the pivotal question in this case is whether the allegations of the amended complaint suffice to meet this benchmark.
of course,section,like many laws,is more easily interpreted at the polar extremes.the statute applies,for example,if a store refuses,on grounds,to permit a customer to purchase its wares.by the same token,it does not apply if no contractual relationship is ever contemplated by either party say,if a store manager makes a racially insensitive comment to a fireman who responds to a false alarm.the harder cases occupy the middle ground cases in which a contract was made and the alleged discrimination bears some relation to it.the case at bar falls into this middle category.particularly after the passage of the amendment,such situations call for careful,case by case.
as said,the appellant has advanced two theories of liability under section.the first theory posits that he was deprived of contractual rights when radio shack staff put him under surveillance while he was in the store.this theory fails because the appellant has not alleged that the surveillance entailed harassment or otherwise interfered with his ability to make desired purchases.to the contrary,his amended complaint leaves no doubt but that,during his visit to the store,radio shack employees were helpful and courteous they facilitated his purchase of the items he selected,and even reached out to other branches in an effort to locate an product that he wished to buy 
on this point,then,the appellant case boils down to the claim that he was watched carefully while on the premises.unadorned,that claim can not succeed.in a society in which shoplifting and vandalism are rife,merchants have a legitimate interest in observing customers movements.so long as watchfulness neither crosses the line into harassment nor impairs a shopper ability to make and complete purchases,it is not actionable under section.see office max,at rejecting claim when plaintiffs were denied neither admittance nor service,nor asked to leave the store.in other words,the challenged surveillance must have some negative effect on the shopper ability to contract with the store in order to engage the gears of section.see hampton,at noting that discriminatory surveillance on its own is not actionable under lewis penney,same.
the appellant second theory presents a closer call.he posits that richard branded him a potential thief and reported him to the police for no reason other than the color of his skin,and that,as a result,he was deprived of the enjoyment of his purchases when the police subsequently intruded on his sanctuary.the difficulty with this theory is that the appellant fully consummated the contract while he was in the store,he completed the purchase of a book,a telephone,and some batteries and thereafter retained the items that he acquired.his own complaint makes clear that he made these purchases without impedance and thenceforth enjoyed the use and ownership of the goods without interruption.the alleged appearance of the police on his not occur until long after he had left the radio shack outlet.moreover,that visit bore no real connection to the contractual relationship for aught that appears,it was the appellant presence in the store,not his purchase of goods,that provoked the manager suspicions.nor does the amended complaint allege facts indicating that the police officers attempted in any way to deprive the appellant of the items he had acquired.the short of the matter is that,taking as true the scenario presented by the amended complaint,the appellant contractual rights were not impaired and,therefore,no violation of section occurred 
the appellant attempts to parry this thrust by arguing that his contractual relationship with radio shack extended to a possible return of the purchased items,and that the visit from the police dampened his ardor for effectuating such a contract modification.the first part of this compound allegation is true the right to return merchandise is incident to,and,thus,part of,the prototypical retail contract.the second part of the allegation,however,is a.in order to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under section,a complaint must allege the actual loss of a contract interest,not simply the theoretical loss of a possible future opportunity to modify the contract.morris,at hampton,at office max,at.the possibility of returning some or all of the goods does not pass through this screen.
in the first place,the appellant has not alleged that he took any steps to modify the purchase contract,that is,he never notified radio shack of his desire to return the goods,nor did he attempt in any way to effectuate their return.we do not think that a customer can hold a merchant liable for denying the right to a refund that the customer never pursued.furthermore,the amended complaint alleges no facts from which it fairly can be inferred that the indignity of a visit from the police somehow hindered the appellant from seeking to return the purchased wares.the naked assertion that a party might have elected to return a previously purchased product had he believed the environment to be more welcoming is simply too ephemeral a hook from which to hang a cause of action under.see office max,at terming a similar allegation speculative and insufficient to state a claim under morris,at requiring plaintiffs to provide evidence of some tangible attempt to contract with the store hampton,at rejecting a claim that the mere receipt of a coupon ancillary to a purchase creates a contractual relationship under section.
for these reasons,we conclude that the amended complaint fails to state an actionable claim under.when the appellant was in the store,he faced no hostility from the staff.by the time that he returned home,his contract with radio shack had been fully performed,and he was not deprived of the benefit of the bargain by subsequent events.
there is one loose end that we must secure.count of the amended complaint also mentions,which prohibits racial discrimination in the purchase of property.like section,section has its roots in section of the civil rights act of.due to the statutes similar wording and common lineage,sections and are traditionally construed in pari materia.see runyon,at.with that in mind,we are confident that our reasoning section and,thus,our holding applies with equal force to any claim that the appellant might have under section.simply put,the facts set forth in the amended complaint fail to show a sufficient nexus between the alleged discrimination and the appellant purchase of goods,tangible personal property.
to say more with respect to this count would be supererogatory.for the reasons elucidated above,we affirm the district court decision to dismiss the appellant federal claims.
defamation.
this leaves the slander claim count.under maine law,a cause of action for defamation arises from the defendant unprivileged publication to a third party of a false statement pertaining to the plaintiff through fault amounting at least to negligence,as long as the statement either is defamatory per se or causes special harm.rippett bemis,me.false accusations of criminal wrongdoing comprise defamation per se.id.
speech is constitutionally protected,however,see const.amend.i,and not all false statements are actionable.in this regard,settled first amendment jurisprudence distinguishes,inter alia,between statements of fact and statements of opinion.levinsky,stores,cir.but framing the inquiry exclusively in those terms is a gross oversimplification even a statement that is couched as an opinion may be actionable if it reasonably could be understood by the ordinary listener as implying the existence of undisclosed facts that are false and defamatory.id.
the seminal case on the subject of first amendment protection for expressions of opinion is milkovich lorain journal,d.in milkovich,a newspaper had printed a column in which it called the plaintiff a wrestling coach a liar for what the columnist thought was deceitful testimony before a athletics council.id.at.the newspaper argued that the column merely stated the columnist opinion and therefore enjoyed an absolute first amendment protection.id.at.the court rejected this argument,declaring that t he dispositive question in the present case is whether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statements in the newspaper column imply an assertion that the coach perjured himself in a judicial proceeding.id.at.because the underlying facts mentioned in the column were susceptible of being proved true or false,the accusation was not a protected opinion.id.
against this backdrop,we return to the case at hand.the amended complaint alleges that,following radio shack discovery of the missing computer,the store manager,without having performed a reasonable investigation and in bad faith,singled out the appellant and informed the brunswick,maine police department that he suspected the appellant of the theft.taking this allegation to mean that richard actually used the phrase i suspect when he contacted the authorities,the district court ruled that the statement constituted a opinion.garrett,d at.the court reasoned 
to suspect is to surmise,based on little or no evidence.the statement very uncertainty stops it from implying anything defamatory for example,it does not imply that the manager actually saw the appellant stealing the computer.rather,if it implies any factual assertions at all,they are not defamatory for example,it might imply underlying assertions such as that the appellant was at the store before the computer was discovered missing,or,more seriously but still not defamatory,that the appellant had behaved in some way the manager deemed suspicious.
id.at footnote omitted.on this basis,the court dismissed count of the amended complaint id.
the appellant takes issue with this reasoning.an accusation that x suspects y of having committed a crime,he argues,is not necessarily a statement of opinion,but,rather,a statement that implies the existence of underlying facts that can be proven true or false and,thus,potentially actionable.building on this foundation,he posits that the district court acted prematurely in dismissing the defamation claim on the face of the pleadings.
we find this argument persuasive.words may sometimes be chameleons,possessing different shades of meaning in different contexts.united states nippon paper indus,cir.this description fits the verb suspect.a statement like i suspect that the patriots will win the super bowl next year,made by a football fan at a tailgate party,is plainly a guess and,indeed,may represent the triumph of hope over reason.in contrast,a statement like i suspect that your house is infested by termites,made by an exterminator after inspecting a dwelling,implies the existence of undisclosed seen or noted in the course of the have led the speaker to a reasoned conclusion.context makes the by c
