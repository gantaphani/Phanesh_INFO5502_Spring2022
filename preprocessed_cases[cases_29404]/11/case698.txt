christopher pagan filed the instant suit against the village of glendale,ohio glendale or the village and glendale police chief matt fruchey,alleging that section of the glendale traffic code constitutes an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech in violation of the first amendment.following the parties for summary judgment,the district court determined that glendale ordinance complied with the requirements of central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d,and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.because we conclude that the defendants have failed to produce evidence that justifies the restrictions on commercial speech imposed by the ordinance,we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
pagan is a resident of glendale and formerly the owner of a mercury cougar that he wanted to sell.after a classified advertisement elicited an inadequate response,pagan posted a for sale sign on the vehicle and left it parked on the public street in front of his residence.pagan elected to place the car on the street instead of his driveway because his driveway abuts an unimproved alley and not a public roadway.
an officer with the glendale police department noticed the sign,notified pagan that the sign was a violation of glendale traffic code,and asked him to remove it or face being cited for a municipal violation.section reads as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person to stand or park any vehicle,motorized or towed,upon any public or private street,road,or highway within the village or upon any unimproved privately owned area within the village for the purpose of 
a displaying it for sale,except that a homeowner may display a motor vehicle,motorized or towed,for sale only when owned and titled to said homeowner a member of said household,and only when parked upon an improved driveway or apron upon the owner private property 
b washing,maintaining or repairing such vehicle except repairs necessitated by an emergency.
c any advertising.
pagan corresponded with various glendale officials,including fruchey,but was ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining a satisfactory resolution of his dispute with the village.in order to avoid a citation,pagan removed the sign from his vehicle.
pagan subsequently filed this lawsuit against fruchey and glendale,alleging a violation of his constitutional rights and challenging subsections a and c of the ordinance.pagan original complaint contained requests both for injunctive relief and damages,but pagan voluntarily withdrew his request for an injunction.both before the district court and before us on appeal,pagan has argued that subsections a and c constitute impermissible restrictions on his right to engage in protected commercial speech following the parties for summary judgment,the district court determined that section was a constitutional regulation of commercial speech under the supreme court central hudson framework and granted summary judgment to the defendants.pagan subsequently appealed.

while other forms of expression are entitled to more protection under the first amendment than is commercial speech,see,republican party of white,d noting that restrictions on the political speech of candidates for office are subject to strict scrutiny,the protection provided to commercial speech is nevertheless considerable.the supreme court has outlined a test that subjects restrictions on commercial speech to a form of intermediate scrutiny.see cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,d under the first prong of the central hudson test,the commercial speech at issue must concern lawful activities and not be misleading,thus entitling it to first amendment protection.at.if the speech is entitled to protection,the remaining prongs of the central hudson test provide the framework for determining the validity of the restriction.more specifically,a restriction on protected commercial speech will be upheld if the government assert s a substantial interest in support of its regulation,demonstrate s that the restriction on commercial speech directly and materially advances that interest,and draws the regulation narrowly.bar went for it,d see also thompson states med,d.these requirements form the second,third,and fourth prongs of the central hudson test.on each point,the government bears the burden of establishing the constitutionality of its regulatory scheme.bd.of trustees of the state of fox,d noting that the state bears the burden of justifying its restrictions.
the parties agree that the speech at issue in this case,the posting of for sale signs on cars,is protected commercial speech.furthermore,pagan takes no issue with the substantiality of glendale asserted regulatory interests safety and aesthetic concerns.thus,the questions before us are whether glendale has established that the restriction directly and materially advances its regulatory interests and that it has drawn the restriction narrowly.
with respect to the third central hudson prong,whether the speech regulation advances the government asserted interests in a direct and material way,the supreme court has further explained 
under central hudson,the state must demonstrate that the challenged regulation advances the government interest in a direct and material way.that burden,we have explained,is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.
bar,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also lorillard tobacco reilly,d quoting edenfield fane,d.thus,the government must come forward with some quantum of evidence,beyond its own belief in the necessity for regulation,that the harms it seeks to remedy are concrete and that its regulatory regime advances the stated goals.see edenfield,at.
under the fourth central hudson prong,the relevant question is whether the speech restriction is narrowly tailored that is,we must determine whether the speech restriction at issue is more extensive than is necessary to serve the asserted interests.thompson,at.quoting cent.hudson,at.the tailoring inquiry does not require a least restrictive means analysis.lorillard tobacco,at.instead,there must be a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the tailoring prong allows the reviewing court to assure itself that the government has carefully calculated the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by regulation.cincinnati discovery network,d internal quotation marks omitted.
at the outset,we note appellees suggestion that subsection a of the ordinance does not implicate the first amendment because it prohibits the act of parking a vehicle on glendale roadways for the purpose of displaying it for sale.as a result,appellees contend,the ordinance regulates commercial activity and not speech.under appellees construction,a seller chosen means of advertising a desire to sell,posting a for sale sign,placing a classified ad,advertising online,is irrelevant.the act of placing a car on the street for the purpose of displaying it for sale purportedly violates subsection a.appellees argument on this point is not well taken.during argument,they conceded that glendale has no interest in enforcing subsection a,except in those instances where the potential seller has displayed a for sale sign.thus,even if we construed the literal language of subsection a as not implicating the first amendment,glendale concedes that it enforces the ordinance in a manner that does.in this case,subsections a and c reach the same conduct and we must determine whether or not glendale has constitutionally prohibited the posting of for sale signs on cars parked in its streets.
in arguing that appellees have not met their burden under the third central hudson prong,pagan relies heavily on the supreme court decision in edenfield fane,d.pagan argues that the affidavit of fruchey,the only evidence provided by the appellees in support of section,fails to discharge appellees burden under edenfield.we agree.
in edenfield,scott fane,a cpa,challenged a florida rule that prevented public accountants from engaging in direct,uninvited solicitation of potential clients.at.applying central hudson,the court first noted that the speech at issue was protected and that the government had articulated substantial interests to justify the speech restrictions at issue.id.at.
as to the third central hudson inquiry,the court held that the state failed to carry its burden.according to the court,while fraud prevention and professional ethics constitute substantial governmental interests,the absence of any,anecdotal,or suggest that the speech at issue posed any threat of concrete harm to those interests caused the regulation to fail.id.at.the court characterized the state evidence as follows 
the only suggestion that a ban on solicitation might help prevent fraud and overreaching or preserve cpa independence is the affidavit of louis dooner,which contains nothing more than a series of conclusory statements that add little if anything to the board original statement of its justifications.
id.at.in the absence of evidence of real harm,the state could not show that its speech restriction had any connection to furthering its asserted regulatory interests.see id.thus,central hudson requires more from the government than bald assertions that a particular speech restriction serves its articulated interests.
upon review of the record,it is clear that the evidence adduced by the appellees is insufficient to satisfy their burden under central hudson.the relevant portion of the fruchey affidavit reads in its entirety as follows 
the primary purpose of the ordinance is to promote the goal of traffic safety within the village of glendale.the objective of the ordinance is to prohibit attractions or activities which will induce people to come into the roadway who are not a part of normal vehicular or pedestrian traffic,such as individuals washing or repairing their cars which are parked on the street,or individuals who are looking over a motor vehicle which is displaying a for sale sign parked on the street.in addition,the ordinance also addresses aesthetic objectives of the village of glendale.
the fruchey affidavit amounts to nothing more that a conclusory articulation of governmental interests.while it suffices for the second part of the central hudson test by identifying two substantial government interests,it fails to address the third prong at all that is,how the particular restriction chosen by glendale directly and materially advances those interests.its reference to people in the roadway looking at cars displaying for sale signs is most accurately characterized as simple conjecture by the police chief about something that might occur.certainly,it is not evidence that for sale signs on cars in streets pose any concrete harm to traffic or aesthetics or that the ordinance has any connection to the interests glendale asserts.in fact,the fruchey affidavit is of exactly the type deemed insufficient by the supreme court in edenfield.
in addressing this issue,the district court incorrectly applied a deferential standard and ultimately held that pagan had not pointed to anything in the record that would suggest that glendale belief that section was needed to further its asserted interests was unreasonable or palpably false.the court,relying upon railway express agency,new york,improperly placed the burden on pagan to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the ordinance.railway express has no applicability in the present case.decided over years before the supreme court recognized that commercial speech is entitled to first amendment protection,railway express examines the constitutionality of a city of new york ordinance prohibiting operation of advertising vehicles on the streets under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment and applies a rational basis test.the case is simply irrelevant in the context of intermediate scrutiny,to which we subject restrictions on commercial speech.see,fox,at.
the issue before us is narrow in scope.this is not a question of the quality of the evidence supporting a speech regulation.it is the absence of any evidence of the need for regulation that is fatal to section.appellees suggest that it would be difficult,expensive,and to conduct studies and provide empirical evidence in support of section.however,the supreme court has made quite clear that the evidentiary requirement the state must meet under intermediate scrutiny does not prescribe the manner by which evidence must be gathered or the precise form that it must take 
instead of actual evidence of harm,appellees ask us to adopt a standard of obviousness or common sense,under which we uphold a speech regulation in the absence of evidence of concrete harm so long as common sense clearly indicates that a particular speech regulation will directly advance the government asserted interest.the difficulty with this proposition,however,is that the standard established by the supreme court depends neither on obviousness nor common sense.edenfield requires some evidence to establish that a speech regulation addresses actual harms with some basis in fact 
the thrust of appellees arguments is not that the fruchey affidavit is the type of evidence required by edenfield but rather that other supreme court authority relieves them from the obligation of meeting the edenfield requirements as to how a governmental entity must meet its burden under central hudson.they present three versions of this general argument.
first,appellees say that even in the absence of evidence of concrete harm,we should defer to legislative judgments on matters of traffic safety and aesthetics.appellees argue that metromedia city of san diego,d,demands deferential review of speech regulations promulgated in vindication of traffic safety and aesthetic interests.in their view,because the supreme court found that san diego rule banning offsite billboard by both traffic safety and aesthetic permissible under central hudson,the for sale sign ban addressing the same concerns must also be permissible.
but metromedia does not control the outcome of this case.after noting the difficulty of applying broad first amendment principles to unique forms of expression,id.at,the metromedia plurality stated,e ach method of communicating ideas is a law unto itself and that law must reflect the differing natures,values,abuses and dangers of each method.we deal here with the law of billboards.id.at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the plurality recited at some length the court many summary rulings upholding billboard restrictions,referred to the history of billboards,and generally emphasized the frequency with which governments had placed restrictions on billboards.the plurality ultimately concluded,w e likewise hesitate to disagree with the accumulated,judgments of local lawmakers and of the many reviewing courts that billboards are real and substantial hazards to traffic safety.id.at.thus,metromedia looked to its own substitute for the sort of evidence edenfield collective judgment of many legislative and judicial decisionmakers.no similar substitute exists here the record before us demonstrates no comparable legislative or judicial history supporting the conclusion that restrictions placed on for sale signs posted on vehicles address concrete harms or materially advance a governmental interest 
the position advocated by the appellees assumes,without discussion,that billboards and for sale signs posted on parked cars raise practically indistinguishable aesthetic and traffic safety issues.appellees analogy hardly strikes us as obvious.in fact,it appears to sidestep the ultimate issue namely,whether or not the speech glendale seeks to regulate poses the harms that all agree would justify regulation.if for sale signs are a threat to the physical safety of glendale citizens or implicate aesthetic concerns,it seems no great burden to require glendale to come forward with some evidence of the threat or the particular concerns.our research has revealed only one other case,that has ruled on this precise issue,and that court arrived at a result identical to ours on the issue of the evidence required by edenfield.see burkow city of los angeles,d.
second,appellees say that edenfield does not apply to all commercial speech cases but only to those dealing with advertising by professionals.this argument does not explicitly appear in appellees brief but was mentioned at oral argument and is perhaps best viewed as a variation of their first argument that traffic safety and aesthetics are entitled to greater deference than other interests in analyzing commercial speech cases.while edenfield involves advertising by accountants and has been applied in lawyer advertising cases,see.bar,at,nothing in edenfield or any other supreme court precedent suggests that edenfield applicability is limited in the manner suggested by appellees.moreover,the court continued reliance on edenfield and its requirement that the harms articulated by the state in support of a commercial speech not be merely conjectural or speculative belies any claim that edenfield is confined to advertising by professionals.see,lorillard tobacco,at.addressing state regulation of tobacco advertising greater new orleans broad.ass n,united states,d addressing fcc restrictions on advertising of legal gambling rubin coors brewing,d addressing restrictions on the advertising of beverage alcohol content.
third,appellees focus on the notion that less is required of a governmental entity when its interests are aesthetics.appellees suggest that the invocation of aesthetic objectives carries with it some talismanic quality that,under case precedents,legitimizes all signage regulation and relieves them from making the showing required in edenfield.appellees direct our attention to members of the city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d.they argue that vincent,when read in conjunction with metromedia,establishes that billboards and signs constitute visual blight and clutter that justify ameliorative regulation.see vincent,at.it is not speculative to recognize that billboards by their very nature,wherever located and however constructed,can be perceived as an esthetic harm.the same is true of posted signs.quoting metromedia,at.under appellees theory,they need not provide evidence that for sale signs create aesthetic harm because the court has accepted as a matter of course that signs and billboards may be considered a visual blight.
the appellees view of vincent overlooks several critical points.the court in vincent was not considering a restriction on commercial speech only and was not applying the central hudson test.rather,the restrictions on posting signs in vincent applied to all forms of speech and were truly,unlike the ordinance here which,as we discuss below,is not.in this context,the court recognized the legitimacy of aesthetics as a governmental interest,a point with which we agree and pagan does not contest.looking to metromedia,the court then noted that signs as well as billboards could pose aesthetic harm.this is another point with which we have no disagreement.we differ from appellees,however,in believing that recognition of aesthetics as a substantial governmental interest tells us nothing about how to resolve this case.vincent certainly does not suggest,either explicitly or implicitly,that,in examining restrictions on commercial speech,aesthetic interests are to be treated differently from other governmental interests.also,vincent gives us no instruction about application of the central hudson test,and it says nothing about the rule of edenfield,decided some nine years later.in fact,the court in vincent does not specifically tell us what evidence los angeles presented about its interests or the concerns that prompted enactment of the ordinance.vincent,then,to the extent that it is relevant,simply tells us that the court has recognized that proven aesthetic interests may prompt restrictions on signs,a point that leads nowhere in the resolution of this case.
appellees argument about the special nature of aesthetic concerns does not address the more fundamental problem with appellees aesthetic justification.as we have noted,as an abstract matter,aesthetic issues are appropriate considerations in developing speech regulations.the record before us does not,however,disclose what glendale aesthetic objectives are.perhaps glendale hopes to avoid unsightly signage cluttering neighborhood streets perhaps glendale seeks to avoid having its streets filled with vehicles that may often not be the sort of automobiles people would like to have parked on their neighborhood streets perhaps for sale signs posted on cars are simply not in keeping with the character of glendale neighborhoods.there are various possibilities,but it is not the place of the reviewing court to supply hypothetical justifications for speech regulation.edenfield,at.noting that with respect to the second central hudson prong regarding the existence of substantial government interests,u nlike review,the central hudson standard does not permit us to supplant the precise interests put forward by the state with other suppositions.citing fox,at.
even if appellees view of metromedia and vincent is closer to the mark than ours and whatever the evidentiary requirement may be to show that a particular medium of communication poses aesthetic harm,a reviewing court must,as a preliminary matter,be apprised of what the government aesthetic motivations are.glendale fails to supply even this rudimentary information,saying in the fruchey affidavit only that the ordinance addresses unspecified aesthetic objectives.this general assertion fails to identify glendale aesthetic concerns with for sale signs.certainly,it does not suffice to show concrete harms addressed by the ordinance or that the ordinance directly and materially advances the government interest,as required by the third prong of central hudson.while the dissent questions any requirement that would mandate a study before limiting speech in furtherance of undoubtedly subjective aesthetic aims,our decision imposes no such requirement.assuming that the subjective nature of aesthetics requires that we give regulators a freer hand when examining restrictions on commercial speech,it seems no great burden to require,as a threshold matter,that they offer something more specific than a bald assertion that the regulation reflects aesthetic considerations.
the dissent critiques our decision as read ing into the first amendment a requirement that governments go through pointless formalities before they enact commonsense rule s we have no interest in preventing the adoption of common sense rules or requiring legislative bodies to engage in pointless formalities.in contrast to those situations in which we apply rational basis review,the intermediate scrutiny we apply in the commercial speech context charges the government with the burden of justifying its chosen form of regulation.thus,even common sense decisions require some justification.otherwise,we have no basis for concluding that glendale legislative decision is animated by reasoned judgment and not hostility toward particular speech.moreover,if the need for the regulation is as obvious as glendale and the dissent believe it to be,it seems that glendale should be ideally positioned to provide some evidence of the need for its task that glendale has been entirely unwilling to undertake we do not hold glendale ordinance invalid because glendale has failed to produce sufficient evidence.rather,we simply can not uphold the ordinance without any evidence at all to support the need for its enactment and simultaneously follow what we view to be the clear command of the supreme court.
one aspect of our decision the dissent appears to find particularly troubling is its belief that it will impose a severe burden on municipalities seeking to regulate signage that they believe raises legitimate and undeniably important traffic safety and aesthetic concerns.while we disagree that the burden is severe and instead believe it fairly easily met,we note that the fact that the first amendment imposes a requirement of evidentiary justification upon a regulatory authority is not,in and of itself,a cause for dismay.
as previously stated,our decision today does not prescribe the manner by which municipalities must justify these sorts of ordinances.instead,we simply conclude that we can not discharge our obligation to scrutinize commercial speech restrictions if we deem sufficient the conjectural affidavit of glendale police chief that offers nothing more than a statement of what he believes to be glendale regulatory objectives.it is glendale obligation to provide something in support of its regulation,and we do not find ourselves free to hold that obligation has been discharged based on principles of common sense or obviousness,especially where,as here,all do not agree as to what is obvious or a matter of common sense.a judicial pronouncement that an ordinance is consistent with common sense hardly establishes that it is so.
the district court did not specifically address tailoring,but pagan argued before the trial court,as he does on appeal,that the regulatory means chosen by glendale lack a reasonable fit to the regulatory ends.the district court did,however,note that pagan claims along these lines were nothing more than conclusory assertions regarding his own notions of a more reasonable regulatory scheme and that it was not the place of the courts to glendale decision regarding appropriate traffic ordinances.
while we need not reach the issue of tailoring because our decision regarding the third central hudson prong is dispositive in this case,it is important to note that,contrary to the district court conclusion,the regulatory authority bears the burden of establishing a reasonable fit when regulating commercial speech.in the commercial speech context at least,our review will,to some extent,require examination of the means chosen by the government.the obligation rests with the government to establish that its regulation is narrowly tailored and that it has carefully calculated the costs and benefits of regulation.see discovery network,at.see also fox,at.
appellees also argue that we need not engage in an analysis under central hudson because the prohibition on parking a car on the streets of glendale for the purpose of advertising is a time,place,or manner regulation and should be analyzed under that framework.although their brief does not specify whether this argument refers to subsection a or c,or both,it is most naturally understood as relating to subsection c,because subsection a contains its own implicit reference to content.if appellees were successful in characterizing the ordinance as,our inquiry here would still be a form of intermediate scrutiny,focusing on whether the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve substantial government interests and leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.see,ward rock against racism,d.
the glendale ordinance can not be evaluated as a restriction,however,because,as appellees conceded during oral argument,the restriction on advertising does depend on the content of the speech namely,the ordinance,as construed by glendale,draws a distinction between promotional speech and speech asserting belief or fact the supreme court has made clear that any regulation that requires reference to the content of speech to determine its applicability is inherently.discovery network,at.under the city newsrack policy,whether any particular newsrack falls within the ban is determined by the content of the publication resting inside thus,by any commonsense understanding of the term,the ban in this case is content based.characterization of the ordinance as a time,place,or manner restriction is simply inaccurate.
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the justification for forbidding the placement of automobiles on the public inspection by potential simply obvious people may be drawn to stand in the street for nontraffic purposes.the act of selling a car in a public street invites prospective buyers into the road to examine the car,and common sense supports a ban on such acts.to read into the first amendment a requirement that governments go through pointless formalities before they enact such a commonsense rule is,in my view,to cheapen the grandeur of the first amendment.to require a study,or testimony,or an affidavit,to demonstrate the obvious is to turn law into formalistic legalism.nothing in supreme court precedent requires such a step.
indeed,metromedia strongly supports upholding the ordinance without any artificial record evidence requirement.metromedia,city of san diego,d.in metromedia,the supreme court,in a split opinion,invalidated a city ban on billboard advertising because of the extent to which the ban affected noncommercial speech.id.at.plurality id.at.brennan,concurring in the judgment.under the reasoning of a strong majority of the court,however,the city ban on billboard advertising was determined to be constitutional to the extent that it regulated commercial speech.id.at.plurality ban complies with first amendment to extent it applies to commercial speech id.at.stevens,dissenting in part same id.at.burger,dissenting ban altogether constitutional id.at.rehnquist,dissenting same.while the reasoning of these various opinions differed,a majority of five justices adopted the reasoning of justice white plurality opinion with regard to the constitutionality of the billboard ban to the extent it dealt with commercial speech.since the instant case deals exclusively with commercial speech,the portion of justice white opinion for four justices parts,joined also by justice stevens,at.stevens,dissenting in part,is directly controlling for this court.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.
that analysis directly supports upholding the ordinance in this case.the metromedia court majority determined that the ban on commercial speech met each element of the central hudson test the speech did not involve unlawful activity and was not misleading,and thus was entitled to first amendment protection the ban sought to implement a substantial government interest it directly advanced that interest and it reached no further than necessary to accomplish the given objective.at.the same result follows in this case.first,the speech does not involve unlawful activity and is not misleading.second,the substantial government interests identified in metromedia,traffic safety and appearance of the city,are remarkably close to those identified in this case,and pagan concedes that the village asserted interests are substantial.
the more serious question in metromedia,as in this case,was the third the ordinance directly advanced the identified interests.the court majority rejected an argument that the record was insufficient to establish a connection between billboards and traffic safety.at.although the record was meager on this point,the california supreme court,taking into consideration the fact that billboards are intended to,and undoubtedly do,divert a driver attention from the roadway,had refused to strike down a reasonable legislative judgment regarding how to deal best with such distractions.id.at.the united states supreme court majority likewise held that san diego could constitutionally ban commercial speech billboards,hesitating to disagree with the accumulated,commonsense judgments of local lawmakers and of the many reviewing courts that billboards are real and substantial hazards to traffic safety.id.at.emphasis added.the majority concluded 
there is nothing here to suggest that these judgments are unreasonable.as we said in a different context 
we would be trespassing on one of the most intensely local and specialized of all municipal problems if we held that this regulation had no relation to the traffic problem of new york city.it is the judgment of the local authorities that it does have such a relation.and nothing has been advanced which shows that to be palpably false.
a closely parallel analysis is dispositive here.the commonsense judgment of glendale lawmakers is,if anything,far more compelling in this case.simply put,exhibiting cars for sale on the public roadway may interfere with the dedication of such roadways to traffic and its necessary incidents.the ban on placing cars in the roadway for sale undoubtedly directly advances the village interest in traffic safety.
noteworthy in the metromedia court majority analysis is the total absence of reliance on record evidence to support its direct advancement rationale.this despite the metromedia plaintiffs assertion that the record was inadequate to support the ban on billboard advertising and the court majority recognition that the california supreme court had noted the meagerness of the record.common sense prevailed in that case,and common sense even more strongly supports the conclusion that substantial interests are directly advanced in this case.indeed,the supreme court recognized in florida bar went for it,d,that even in a first amendment case applying strict scrutiny,restrictions may be justified based solely on history,consensus,and simple common sense.citing burson freeman,d.see also united states edge broadcasting,d upholding a ban on radio advertisements of lotteries in states where lotteries were illegal and,addressing central hudson third prong,stating that congress plainly made the commonsense judgment that each north carolina station would have an audience in that state and that enforcing the statutory restriction would insulate each station listeners and hence advance the governmental purpose of supporting north carolina laws against gambling.indeed,this court stated in jobe city of catlettsburg,cir,a case upholding against a first amendment challenge an ordinance against placing leaflets on vehicles,that i n view of the explanations for these types of laws,they do not invariably require proof that the problem has occurred in the past a daunting task in view of the vintage of this law and the understandable absence of information about why the law was passed or an elaborate study of their necessity an equally daunting task in view of the difficulty of showing the empirical necessity for a law that has been in place for more than years.although the ordinance at issue in jobe was analyzed as a time,place,and manner restriction,the analysis is substantially similar,lorillard tobacco reilly,d,and the same considerations the court highlighted in jobe are applicable here.metromedia thus compels the conclusion that the ban on selling cars in the street directly advances the traffic safety interest in this case.
the majority in metromedia relied in part on the large number of similar local laws throughout the country that had previously been upheld when subjected to constitutional attack.metromedia,at.similarly in this case,glendale is hardly alone in banning the placement of cars for sale in the public streets.just within the four states comprising the sixth circuit alone there are more than similar ordinances.see appendix see,flint,code of ordinances michigan uniform traffic code for cities,townships,and villages r,rule county,code of ordinances toledo,ohio,municipal code the ohio basic code memphis,code of ordinances.the large number of municipalities with similar ordinances suggests that the policy behind them is premised on legitimate rather than contrived concerns.jobe,at.
to be sure,the supreme court held in edenfield fane,d,that a state may not constitutionally ban cpas from direct contact with potential clients without demonstrating that harms may flow from such contact.therefore,it is argued,a city may not ban the exhibiting of automobiles for sale on the public streets without first demonstrating the unprotected harms that may flow from such conduct.with respect,such a legal inference falls of its own weight.the ban effect on the harm addressed in the cpa case was not clearly established in the present case it is compellingly obvious.the cases are flatly different on their face.
nothing in our ironclad obligation to follow the holdings of the supreme court requires us to read edenfield beyond the facts of the case to a set of facts that is meaningfully different.in edenfield,the court held that a single affidavit was insufficient to support a law banning solicitation by cpas.at.although the court determined in edenfield that an affidavit was not sufficient,the court also had before it a report contradicting the florida board of accountancy assertions regarding the supposed effects of cpa solicitation.id.at.it simply does not follow from edenfield that glendale is not free,without evidence or studies,to make a commonsense determination that allowing business to be conducted in the street presents certain hazards.edenfield did not declare that,henceforth,any regulation of commercial speech must be accompanied by studies regarding the harm to be prevented,no matter how obvious that harm may be.nor did edenfield mark the death of common sense as a useful tool in the lawmaker toolbox.edenfield can not be read to require a study or evidence of nonspeech harm any time a city wishes to remove from its roads distractions that are,by their nature,meant to draw pedestrians into the roadway.
other cases are even less applicable.
in florida bar went for it,d,the supreme court upheld a commercial speech ban prohibiting lawyers from sending solicitations to victims of recent accidents or disasters,on the ground that the requirements of edenfield were met given the existence of record evidence supporting the ban.id.at.the court reliance on the record evidence in florida bar,however,should not lead this court to mistake sufficiency for necessity,especially given that the court also emphasized that previous litigants were successful in justifying speech restrictions by reference to studies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether or even,in a case applying strict scrutiny,to justify restrictions based solely on history,consensus,and simple common sense.id.at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the judgment of the supreme court in florida bar is simply not a holding regarding what is required to meet the third prong of central hudson,but is rather a holding as to what is sufficient,and thus adds nothing to the requirements of edenfield.
the supreme court in thompson western states medical center,d,explicitly refrained from holding that the statutory provision at issue failed the third requirement of central hudson.the statutory provision at issue essentially provided that as long as pharmacists do not advertise particular compounded drugs,they may sell compounded drugs without first undergoing safety and efficacy testing and obtaining fda approval.at.regarding whether the advertising ban directly advanced the government asserted interests related to approved compounded drugs,the court reasoned that,a ssuming it is true that drugs can not be marketed on a large scale without advertising,the statutory prohibition on advertising compounded drugs might indeed directly advanc e the government interests.id.at.emphasis added.the court proceeded to the final central hudson prong on the assumption that the third prong was met.id.under that final prong,the fact that the restrictions were more extensive than necessary invalidated the provision the court identified numerous ways in which manufacturing of compounded drugs might be identified without using the proxy of commercial speech.id.at.
in lorillard tobacco reilly,d,the supreme court held that a ban on advertising for smokeless tobacco or cigars within feet of a school did directly advance a substantial governmental interest under central hudson third step.as in florida bar,the government was able to point to record evidence in the form of studies to support its contention that the ban on commercial speech directly advanced its asserted interests.again,however,the presence of studies in lorillard merely establishes that such studies are sufficient,not that they are necessary,to pass muster under central hudson third prong.as in thompson,only lack of a reasonable fit,the fourth central hudson inquiry,rendered the provision unconstitutional the rule would constitute nearly a complete ban on the communication of truthful information about smokeless tobacco and cigars to adult consumers in some geographical areas.id.at.
in all of these cases,the only holding that the third step of central hudson was not met,in addition to edenfield,was one aspect of the tobacco sales practices regulated in lorillard certain tobacco advertising could not be placed lower than five feet from the floor of any retail establishment within feet of a school.this failed the central hudson third step,not for lack of empirical evidence but because the rule does not seem to advance th e goal of preventing minors from using tobacco products.lorillard,at.children under five feet tall,the court noted,can look up.in contrast,banning the placement of autos in the public streets for sales inspection more than seems to advance the goal of traffic safety,it obviously does so.
in short,the court holdings,and edenfield in particular,do not require the conclusion that without record evidence,a regulation that so obviously advances a substantial interest is invalid.it is true that,as the court majority stated in metromedia,e ach method of communicating ideas is a law unto itself and that law must reflect the differing natures,values,abuses and dangers of each method.at.quoting kovacs cooper.we can not however simply dismiss the supreme court decision in metromedia because the court pointed out that it was dealing only with billboards.indeed,the natures,values,abuses and dangers of selling cars in the streets are far closer to those of setting up billboards than they are to the direct solicitation of clients by cpas.the abuses and dangers of billboard advertising are indeed very similar to the abuses and dangers of selling cars in the streets traffic safety concerns and visual aesthetics.the abuses and dangers of direct solicitation by cpas are entirely distinct avoiding fraud and maintaining cpa ethics.thus any argument that a particular supreme court holding does not apply because of the differences in methods of communicating ideas would require us to disregard edenfield long before it would require us to disregard metromedia.we should disregard neither,but apply each to the extent its reasoning controls on facts meaningfully similar to those in this case.
of course if the two cases conflict,then edenfield would control on the theory that the supreme court has to that extent overruled metromedia.we should not rush to that conclusion,however,where there is a meaningful distinction between the two cases.with respect to the third prong of central hudson,the distinction between the ordinance in metromedia and the statute in edenfield is stark there is obvious direct advancement in metromedia and nothing of the sort in edenfield.accordingly,while the first amendment requires record evidence in edenfield,it does not in metromedia.the distinction cuts squarely in favor of glendale in this case.it is not up to us to overrule metromedia,and edenfield did not do so,either explicitly or sub silentio.
finally,glendale ordinance also clearly passes central hudson fourth prong.the ordinance is not more extensive than necessary to serve glendale asserted interests in traffic safety.the least restrictive means test has no role in the commercial speech context.florida bar,at.internal quotation marks omitted.glendale need only demonstrate that there is a fit between its ordinance and the ends it seeks to achieve.id.
the ordinance exactly serves glendale purposes.although it is true that cars parked in a private driveway fronting a public street may also prove distracting,it is not true that such activity invites people into the roadway for purposes of inspecting the car that has been advertised for sale.glendale has properly limited the reach of the ordinance to public property glendale could reasonably conclude that the dangers attendant to placing a car for sale in a public street outweigh any harm that may occur when a property owner decides to place an automobile for sale on his own property.metromedia,at.t he city may believe that offsite advertising presents a more acute problem than does onsite advertising.indeed,given glendale interests in ensuring that individuals remain out of the roadway,it makes eminent sense to limit the reach of the ordinance to cars parked on public streets.while it is true that numerous and obvious alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech is certainly a relevant consideration in determining whether the fit between ends and means is reasonable,cincinnati discovery network,d,the only apparent alternative for glendale is to outlaw pedestrians presence in a roadway to inspect a vehicle.of course,this does nothing to eliminate the very enticement that may lead prospective buyers into the roadway in the first place and does nothing to prevent driver distraction.
because glendale has crafted an ordinance that goes no further than necessary to address a substantial public concern,the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.
it is accordingly not necessary to rely in addition on glendale asserted aesthetic interests,and i treat them only briefly here.those interests appear independently sufficient to support the restriction on commercial speech in this case.a majority of seven justices in metromedia concluded that san diego aesthetic interests were sufficient to support san diego ordinance to the extent that it regulated commercial speech.metromedia,at.plurality id.at.stevens,dissenting in part id.at.burger,dissenting id.at.rehnquist,dissenting.as with respect to san diego regulation of commercial billboards,glendale should not be required to come forward with studies to support its conclusion that city aesthetics would be improved by avoiding the transformation of public streets into used car lots or markets.in a less obvious case,the supreme court,relying on metromedia treatment of an aesthetics interest,upheld a los angeles ban on posting signs on public property such as utility poles.members of the city coun.of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d.it is well settled that the state may legitimately exercise its police powers to advance esthetic values.id.at.without reliance on empirical evidence in the record,the court reasoned that 
the problem addressed by this visual assault on the citizens of los angeles presented by an accumulation of signs posted on public a significant substantive evil within the city power to prohibit.the city interest in attempting to preserve or improve the quality of urban life is one that must be accorded high respect.
id.at.citations omitted.a similar conclusion without record evidence is warranted here with respect to cars placed for sale on city streets.indeed,insisting on a study regarding aesthetics would be particularly pointless given the essentially subjective nature of the topic.the vincent court also held that the los angeles posting ban was not unconstitutionally broad 
by banning these signs,the city did no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy.the plurality wrote in metromedia it is not speculative to recognize that billboards by their very nature,wherever located and however constructed,can be perceived as an esthetic harm,at.the same is true of posted signs.
id.at.the same can be said of cars placed for sale on city streets.
finally,i do not address the constitutionality of subsection c of the glendale ordinance.pagan initially challenged this
