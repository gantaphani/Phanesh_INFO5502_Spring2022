in,tyrree corporation agreed to purchase a tire pyrolysis system a series of machines that shred,heat,and convert old tires into commercially viable from shred pax corporation.tyrree allegedly paid shred pax more than million for the assembly and storage of the machinery but ultimately did not accept delivery,concluding that it had not gotten what it had paid for.in,following tyrree dissolution,eugene horbach,tyrree majority shareholder and assignee,filed suit against shred pax which by then had changed its name to one three six,but for the sake of convenience we will ignore the name change,and its majority shareholder and president,alvis kaczmarek in pertinent part,horbach complaint sought relief on theories of contractual breach,fraud,rescission,constructive trust unjust enrichment,and conversion.the district court dismissed these claims,finding that the allegations did not support a claim for conversion and that the other claims were untimely.we affirm.
because the district court dismissed this case at the pleading stage,we accept the allegations in horbach complaint as true,johnson rivera,cir.
horbach and aaron gellman formed tyrree,an illinois corporation,in august of with the goal of owning and operating tire pyrolysis plants.horbach,a citizen of the state of washington,subscribed to percent of tyrree stock.gellman later assigned to horbach his percent interest in tyrree,making horbach the owner of approximately percent of tyrree outstanding shares.
on september,tyrree entered into a preliminary letter agreement with shred pax for the purchase of a tire pyrolysis system.that agreement contemplated the subsequent execution of a formal purchase order for the equipment,which the parties completed and signed on september.the purchase order provided that shred pax would design and manufacture the equipment in accordance with specifications attached to the order and have it ready for delivery and testing on or before february.the order gave tyrree the right to inspect,test,and approve the equipment before it accepted delivery.the testing envisioned by the purchase order involved full and continuous operation of the equipment over a period of seven days.ex.
at a meeting which took place on or about february,shred pax informed tyrree that the equipment was ready for testing and installation.tyrree had not yet located a suitable site at which it could engage in testing of the system,however,so the parties agreed that shred pax would continue to hold the equipment in exchange for a monthly storage fee until tyrree was able to locate such a site.tyrree also wanted shred pax to make certain modifications to the pyrolysis system that would take additional time to complete.
on april,shred pax sent a letter to tyrree confirming that the pyrolysis system,as modified,was ready for testing.this letter purported to constitute the formal equipment notice contemplated by the purchase agreement,entitling shred pax to a specified installment payment from tyrree.tyrree subsequently advised shred pax that it would not be able to conduct acceptance testing of the equipment prior to july and suggested that shred pax should conduct the testing itself at a place and time of its own choosing.apparently,however,shred pax opted to wait for tyrree and continue collecting a storage fee while it did so.further modifications to the equipment were ordered in september.
tyrree dissolved on september.all of the company rights under the initial letter agreement and purchase order were assigned to horbach.
on or about february,an agent for horbach visited the facility in portland,oregon,where the pyrolysis equipment was being stored.instead of a completed system,however,the agent discovered only scattered components that did not appear to have been manufactured in compliance with the purchase order.shred pax subsequently explained to horbach that not all of the equipment was,in fact,located in portland,and that it would take days to assemble the pyrolysis system for acceptance testing.that testing never took place.
on april,horbach attorney notified shred pax that the purchase order was cancelled because shred pax had failed to manufacture and deliver the equipment in accordance with the terms of the order.by this time,horbach had already paid more than million toward the purchase and storage of the equipment and related items.horbach demanded the return of his money,but shred pax refused.
horbach filed suit against shred pax and kaczmarek in.as we noted at the outset,the district court subsequently dismissed each of the claims that arose from the purchase order.horbach kaczmarek.horbach kaczmarek.
the court found the breach of contract claim untimely.at.the court noted at the outset that the illinois commercial code specifies a limitations period for such a claim.see ilcs.the defendants argued that the limitations had begun to run on february,the date that the purchase order had specified for delivery of the equipment.at the latest,the period began to run on february,when horbach agent inspected the equipment and realized that it had not been completed in conformance with the terms of the purchase order.horbach,however,had waited until september,to bring long under even the most generous calculation of the limitations period.horbach asserted that shred pax had fraudulently concealed its breach of the purchase order and that he should therefore have the benefit of the longer,limitations period applicable to cases of fraudulent concealment.see ilcs.but,as the district court pointed out,the illinois supreme court has held that this limitations period governs only when the defendant concealment has left the plaintiff with less than a reasonable time to sue under the statute of limitations.see anderson wagner,appeal dismissed sub nom.woodward burnham city,d see also,morris margulis,barratt goldberg,d.here,horbach had at least three years left in which to bring suit as of february,when the inspection of the equipment revealed that it was not ready for delivery.the district court found three years to constitute a reasonable period of time in which to bring suit and for that reason found the limitations period for claims of fraudulent concealment not to apply.at.horbach suggested that anderson and its progeny were inconsistent with the express language of the fraudulent concealment statute,but the district court observed that it was not at liberty to ignore clear state law authority.id.
the court dismissed the equitable claims for rescission and constructive trust pursuant to the doctrine of laches.id.at.that doctrine applies when the plaintiff has waited for an unreasonable length of time to assert his claim and the defendant has been prejudiced by the delay.people wells,van milligan board of fire police commissioners of village of glenview.the doctrine is grounded in the equitable notion that courts are reluctant to come to the aid of a party who has knowingly slept on his rights to the detriment of the opposing party.tully state.illinois courts follow the general rule that where the limitations period governing claims at law has expired,laches will bar the equitable claims,even if the defendant has not shown prejudice.see meyers kissner,see also,golden mcdermott,will emery,d.thus,because horbach had waited to file suit until the statute of limitations on his breach of contract claim had already run,laches demanded the dismissal of the accompanying equitable claims.at.
although the fraud claim was subject to a longer,period of limitations,see ilcs,the court found that claim to be untimely as well.pursuant to the discovery rule,commencement of the pertinent limitations period may be delayed until such time as the plaintiff knew or should have known that he was wrongfully injured.see generally hermitage contractors adjustment.illinois courts have applied this rule to torts arising out of contractual relationships.see id.at collecting cases.horbach argued that the limitations period began to run no sooner than february,relying on the complaint allegation that he remained ignorant of shred pax wrongdoing until his agent inspected the equipment on that date.however,the complaint also revealed that shred pax had informed tyrree in april of that the equipment was ready for delivery and testing and notwithstanding shred pax efforts to schedule inspection and testing of the system,tyrree and horbach had waited for more than ten months to look at the equipment.horbach had alleged no reason for this delay.had horbach inspected the equipment promptly after shred pax had announced that it was ready,the court observed,he would have discovered his injury.the court therefore concluded that the statute of limitations began to run sometime before september of and that horbach fraud claim,filed in september,was too late.at.
following the dismissal of these claims,horbach obtained the court permission to file a second amended complaint which set forth additional allegations that horbach believed would resuscitate the fraud claim and which also asserted a new claim for conversion in the district court eyes,however,the second amended complaint fared no better than the first.
with respect to the fraud claim,the court found the new allegations insufficient to justify horbach delay in discovering the alleged fraud.at.horbach alleged that the pyrolysis equipment was highly complex and that he lacked the technical knowledge and skill to assess the quality of that equipment himself.the only way to determine whether the system met the requirements of the purchase order,horbach asserted,was to test it,which he could not reasonably have done before september of.but the court noted that when horbach agent finally inspected the equipment in february,its shortcomings and thus shred pax alleged fraud were readily apparent.in fact,the complaint revealed that there was no integrated system at all,but only scattered components.this was something that any qualified not a lay person like horbach have readily determined upon examining the equipment.the court again found no plausible basis for inferring that the injury could not have been discovered prior to september of.id.at.horbach also suggested that it was not unreasonable for him to postpone inspection of the system until february of because he had requested modifications to the system after february.however,the court pointed out that shred pax had completed these modifications by the time it announced in april that the equipment was ready for testing and delivery,and tyrree did not request additional changes until late september.for that period,then,tyrree believed the equipment was ready for testing.horbach offered no reasonable excuse for not having inspected the equipment during that time.id.finally,horbach asserted that his inspection of the equipment was delayed by his ongoing search for a site where the equipment could not only be tested but permanently installed.however,as the district court pointed out,the complaint indicated that on april,in its letter announcing the readiness of the equipment,shred pax informed tyrree that it would proceed with testing of the equipment at a site of its own choosing in the event tyrree was unable to locate a site within fourteen days.the parties understood,then,that inspection and testing of the equipment was not to be postponed any longer based on horbach search for a permanent installation site.in fact,as we noted earlier,shred pax did not test the fact,the district court added,that might have tipped off tyrree that something was amiss.even so,horbach postponed his inspection for ten delay that the court believed was not justifiable.id.at.accordingly,the court dismissed the fraud claim for a second time.
the court found no basis in the allegations of the complaint for a conversion claim.id.the theory underlying this claim was that shred pax and kaczmarek had improperly converted horbach money to their own use by accepting his periodic payments for the completion and storage of the pyrolysis system all the while knowing that they were not entitled to those payments due to the inadequate state of the equipment.the court found this rationale defective for two reasons.first,because the purchase order entitled the defendants to periodic advance payments,horbach could not show that the money he had paid belonged at all times to him.horbach remedy,upon discovery that the equipment had not been completed,was to sue for breach of contract rather than conversion.id.second,in order to establish the conversion of money under illinois law,a plaintiff must show that he had a right to a specific fund or specific money in coin or bills.sutherland,cir,quoting fire marine ins.middleton,d.horbach,however,was not claiming entitlement to a specific fund or account let alone specific coins or bills,but rather a particular amount of money.his claim thus did not meet this particular criterion of a conversion claim.at.
horbach challenges four aspects of the district court judgment.first,he contends that the longer limitations period for fraudulent concealment should apply to his breach of contract claim.second,assuming that his breach of contract claim is timely,horbach contends that his equitable claims are timely as well,and that the court erred in invoking laches to dispose of them.third,horbach maintains that one can not say as a matter of law that he should have known of the defendants alleged fraud earlier,and that,consequently,the district court should not have dismissed his fraud claim as untimely.finally,horbach asserts that his complaint states a valid claim for conversion.as this case was dismissed at the pleading stage,our review is of course de novo,vorhees naper aero club,cir.
timeliness of the breach of contract claim 
horbach contends that the district court erred in applying the limitations period to his claim for breach of contract rather than the longer period that the illinois legislature has specified for cases in which the defendant has fraudulently concealed a cause of action from the person to whom that cause belongs.see ilcs.as we noted above,the district court applied the period based on the illinois supreme court opinion in anderson.anderson construed the fraudulent concealment statute to apply only when the defendant concealment has deprived the plaintiff of a reasonable amount of time in which to bring suit under the statute of limitations that would ordinarily apply.id.at.in this case,when horbach discovered in february that the pyrolysis system was not complete as shred pax had represented,horbach still had three years in which to bring suit before the limitations period specified for contractual claims expired.the district court thought that three years was more than enough time in which to bring suit and so,pursuant to anderson and its progeny,declined to apply the longer limitations period for cases of fraudulent concealment.see,id.at seven to sixteen months following discovery of fraudulent concealment is a reasonable amount of time in which to bring suit.horbach does not suggest that the district court misinterpreted anderson but argues instead that anderson holding is inconsistent with the language of the fraudulent concealment statute.horbach br.horbach believes that given the opportunity,the illinois supreme court would reconsider and overrule its holding in anderson,and on that basis he contends that this court should not consider itself bound by this precedent.see west american.when state highest court has spoken,its pronouncement is to be accepted by federal courts as defining state law unless it has later given clear and persuasive indication that its pronouncement will be modified,limited or restricted.emphasis supplied.
we discern no basis for ignoring the illinois supreme court opinion in anderson,however.sitting in diversity,this court must look to state law on matters of substance,erie tompkins,including the relevant statute of limitations,doe roe,cir.the parties agree that in this case,the law of illinois governs.anderson embodies the illinois supreme court interpretation of the fraudulent concealment statute and leaves no doubt that the statute does not apply where,as here,the plaintiff discovers his injury in plenty of time to file suit within the limitations period that would otherwise apply.
horbach suggests that the il
