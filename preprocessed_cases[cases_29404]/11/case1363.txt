fax law center,and consumer crusade,collectively plaintiffs filed six separate lawsuits in federal district court seeking damages for unsolicited faxes under the telephone consumer protection act tcpa.in different orders issued by different judges,all six suits were dismissed based on lack of jurisdiction,lack of standing,or both.the plaintiffs now challenge the underlying judgments,asserting that there is diversity jurisdiction over the tcpa claims and that they have representational standing.we consolidated the cases for oral argument and now resolve them in this opinion.our jurisdiction arises under,and we affirm the various judgments of dismissal based on the plaintiffs lack of standing while rejecting the rationale that diversity jurisdiction is unavailable for these claims.
background 
plaintiffs aggregate claims from individuals and businesses that receive junk faxes in violation of b c,a subsection of the tcpa.they take assignments of claimants rights under the tcpa and pursue those claims in federal and state court.in these federal cases,plaintiffs allege that the various violated the tcpa by knowingly and willfully sending unsolicited advertisements by fax to the assignors,who are colorado residents.plaintiffs seek a statutory award for each unsolicited fax,along with a statutory award for each fax sent knowingly and willfully.see id.b 
as previously stated,we consider six judgments on appeal.all six are based on orders containing similar rationales.in the first order dismissing one of the suits,us fax law center,ihire,d,the district court determined that fax law center lacked representational standing to assert tcpa claims because such claims are unassignable under colorado law.id.at.specifically,the court held that the claims are unassignable because they are privacy claims and penal in nature.id.at.in another order dismissing one of the suits,consumer crusade,fairon,d,the district court found it lacked diversity jurisdiction over tcpa claims.id.at.the other orders of dismissal rely on the grounds enumerated in these first two orders.
discussion 
diversity jurisdiction 
we review a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo.johnson rodrigues,cir.in fairon,the district court below held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the tcpa claims because six federal circuit courts have concluded,based on b of the tcpa,that congress intended to preclude federal question jurisdiction over tcpa claims d at.the district court extended the reasoning from the federal question cases to find that congress also intended to preclude diversity jurisdiction.id.at.
section b states 
a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate state court of that state 
a an action based on violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
b an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation,or to receive in damages for each such violation,whichever is greater,or 
c both such actions.
if the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection,the court may,in its discretion,increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than times the amount available under subparagraph b of this paragraph.
absent precedent from this circuit,the fairon court relied on the federal question cases to conclude that the exclusive forum for enforcement of the tcpa is the state courts and original jurisdiction in a federal court would appear to be precluded.id.at emphasis added.specifically,the court gave five reasons why the tcpa divests federal courts of diversity jurisdiction.first,it noted the exclusive references to the state courts as the forums for adjudicating private tcpa actions in b and c.id.at.second,it noted the complete deference given to the laws or rules of court of a state for bringing in an appropriate court of that state a private tcpa action.id.third,it pointed to explicit recognition in congressional findings that telemarketers can evade state prohibitions through interstate operations without recognizing a federal forum for obtaining private relief in such circumstances id.citation omitted.fourth,it pointed to the tcpa exclusive grant of federal jurisdiction accorded parens patriae cases brought by a state under f.id.moreover,the court noted,congress could have clarified the tcpa in its amendments to explicitly confer diversity jurisdiction,rectifying the holdings of the federal question cases which suggested that tcpa claims could be brought only in state court.id.these facts,said the court,lead to the conclusion that federal diversity jurisdiction was not extended to private claims by such legislation.id.
the district court decided fairon on july.since that time,two circuit courts have addressed whether federal courts have jurisdiction over tcpa claims based on diversity.see gottlieb carnival,cir brill countrywide home loans,cir.prior to gottlieb and brill,the six circuit cases relied upon by the fairon court all involved tcpa claims based on federal question jurisdiction.see murphey lanier,cir foxhall realty law offices,telecomm.premium,cir erienet,velocity net,cir nicholson hooters of augusta,cir int l science tech,inacom commc ns,cir chair king,houston cellular,cir.
gottlieb and brill rejected extension of the reasoning from the tcpa federal question cases to tcpa diversity cases.both gottlieb and brill held that plaintiffs can prosecute tcpa claims in federal court based on diversity,despite the unanimous circuit decisions holding that no such suit may be maintained based on federal question jurisdiction.see gottlieb,at congress failure to provide explicitly for concurrent jurisdiction in b has no bearing on its intent with respect to diversity jurisdiction.brill,at rejecting the reasoning of the six circuits and holding that tcpa suits can be brought under either federal question jurisdiction or under the minimal diversity requirements of the class action fairness act.a number of district court cases also conclude that tcpa claims may be brought under diversity jurisdiction.see klein vision lab telecomm,d,collecting and analyzing tcpa diversity cases.
diversity jurisdiction is based on a grant of jurisdictional authority from congress.neirbo bethlehem shipbuilding.furthermore,it constitutes an independent basis for jurisdiction,regardless of whether the underlying claim is federal in nature.see a conferring jurisdiction based only on complete diversity of the parties and a minimum amount in controversy.thus,where some other basis for federal jurisdiction is proscribed,diversity jurisdiction may still exist.see horton liberty mut.ins,d noting that eliminating removal jurisdiction does not preclude diversity jurisdiction.accordingly,absent an explicit indication that congress intended to create an exception to diversity jurisdiction,one may not be created by implication.ankenbrandt richards,d.this is different from general federal question jurisdiction,which gives district courts original jurisdiction unless a specific statute places jurisdiction elsewhere.inacom commc n,at.
as the second circuit noted in gottlieb,n othing in b,or in any other provision of the statute,expressly divests federal courts of diversity jurisdiction over private actions under the tcpa.gottlieb,at.this fact alone is probably sufficient to demonstrate the presence of diversity jurisdiction because diversity jurisdiction is an independent grant of federal jurisdiction that is presumed to exist for all causes of action so long as the statutory requirements are satisfied.id.at.thus,diversity jurisdiction must be explicitly abrogated by congress,unless the diversity jurisdiction statute and the tcpa are irreconcilable,see.river water conserv.dist.united states,d.
the diversity statute and the tcpa are not irreconcilable.in fact,eliminating diversity jurisdiction over tcpa claims would produce odd results.for example,holding that the tcpa vests exclusive and total jurisdiction in state courts would create the anomalous result that state law claims b
