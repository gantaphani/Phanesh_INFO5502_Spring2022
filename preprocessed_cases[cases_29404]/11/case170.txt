this case raises the issue of the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal district court over an international corporation that has been allocated certain responsibilities within a complex corporate family.jet wine spirits,a broker of alcoholic beverages in new hampshire,appeals the dismissal,for lack of personal jurisdiction,of its action based on state contract and tort law against bacardi company baco,an owner of various trademarks and intellectual property related to internationally sold alcoholic beverages.
baco owns several brands of dewar scotch and bombay gin,which it acquired from diageo,which had a relationship with jet wine.jet wine had previously distributed dewar in several new england states,including new hampshire,and bombay in maine.as distributor,jet wine had been party to a contract with subsidiaries of the companies that merged to form diageo.after baco acquisition of the brands,a corporate cousin of baco terminated jet wine as distributor.jet wine then sued a number of members of the bacardi corporate family on several theories.in this appeal,only its claims against baco are at issue.jet wine says that baco assumed diageo contractual obligations to jet wine and then reached into new hampshire among other states to violate the contract terms and disrupt jet wine various protected interests.baco says it has nothing to do with new hampshire,and,for that matter,nothing to do with jet wine contract.we conclude that whatever the ultimate merits of jet wine substantive claims,there is enough of a prima facie showing to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction,and reverse.
we first describe the facts as we take them for the purpose of this appeal.as we discuss in more detail in part iii,the facts of the case are at present merely jet wine allegations so far as evidence supports them after preliminary jurisdictional discovery,supplemented by baco uncontested allegations.
jet wine is a new hampshire corporation that does business in new hampshire and is owned by the martignetti corporation,itself a massachusetts corporation.new hampshire directly controls all sales of alcohol in the state through its state liquor commission,and jet wine is licensed to sell to the commission.in and,jet wine signed several contracts with schieffelin somerset by which it became schieffelin exclusive distributor in new hampshire,vermont,and maine for various alcoholic beverages,including the white label and ancestor brands of dewar scotch.the arrangements were to last until the end of,and after that could be terminated by either party on thirty days notice.each contained a clause stating that t he parties hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of the united states district courts within the state of new york.jet wine also alleges an agreement with carillon importers,by which it became carillon representative in maine for bombay gin for an indefinite period.
baco is a liechtenstein corporation with its primary place of business in the bahamas.it is wholly owned by bacardi international limited bil.bil is in turn almost wholly owned by bacardi limited bl,a bermuda corporation with its primary place of business in bermuda.bl also wholly owns bacardi busa a delaware corporation with its primary place of business in florida.bl serves as a holding company for the various other bacardi corporations.baco owns various trademarks and other intellectual property related to the sale of alcoholic beverages.busa imports alcoholic beverages into,and distributes them in,the united states.there is some overlap of officers and directors among the corporations baco president is among bl directors,the chairman of bil board of directors is a senior vice president of bl,one of baco vice presidents is also a vice president of bl,and the chairman of busa board was among bl alternate directors when the complaint was filed.
baco does no business directly in new hampshire,except possibly through its web site,as described below.the parties dispute whether baco does business there through an agent,as discussed in part iii of this opinion.baco owns an internet domain name,that corresponds to a site on the world wide web at.it also owns,for which no web site presently exists.from november to september,sold some bacardi promotional items clothing and keychains,not alcohol,including two sales to new hampshire addresses for a total of.this money went to national corporate services unlimited,an unrelated company that buys merchandise from busa and sells it over the web site.baco also owns,and,each of which corresponds to a web site.jet wine has shown no sales from those web sites in new hampshire.baco owns one trademark,havana club,that is registered in new hampshire.
schieffelin,jet wine former source for dewar,was a subsidiary of guinness.carrillon,jet wine former source for bombay,was a subsidiary of grand metropolitan.in,guinness and grand metropolitan began negotiating a merger that eventually produced diageo.the merger encountered opposition from the federal trade commission,which demanded that diageo sell some of its operations to preserve competition that the merger would otherwise eliminate.among those operations were dewar and bombay.on march,bl ceo,acting for baco and for william lawson distillers another subsidiary of bl,signed two asset purchase agreements with diageo for assets related to the dewar and bombay brands.baco agreed o n the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreements to assume and discharge or perform when due all assumed liabilities.assumed liabilities as defined in the dewar agreement include 
all liabilities and obligations that arise out of or relate to the transferred assets including under any contract or the dewar business to the extent attributable to occurrences and circumstances arising on or following the closing,including any obligations to deliver finished case goods following the closing under purchase orders of,or commitments to,persons other than affiliates of seller.
contract is defined by reference to a schedule attached to the agreement,which does not mention jet wine or new hampshire,and in addition to include comparable agreements with respect to any markets other than the major markets that are solely related to dewar.the united states is among the major markets,and jet wine agreement with schieffelin was not solely related to dewar.another schedule,listing distributors for dewar,does mention jet wine as the relevant new hampshire distributor.the dewar business is defined in the preamble to the dewar agreement,to which the body of the agreement refers,as the marketing,sales and distribution of scotch whisky under trade names or trademarks that include one or more of the terms dewar,ancestor,ne plus ultra,and white label.the bombay agreement contains identical language regarding assumption of liabilities,except that it refers instead to the bombay business,which it defines as the marketing,sales and distribution of gin under trade names or trademarks that include one or more of the terms bombay and sapphire.
on june,baco gave bil a worldwide exclusive license to use the dewar and bombay brands.bil then appointed busa as the united states distributor of those brands.on the same day,busa sent letters to jet wine that terminated jet wine as the broker for dewar in new hampshire,vermont and maine.on june,it provided a letter for busa legal department addressed to whom it may concern.the june letter said that busa was the exclusive brand agent and distributor and primary american source of supply for the dewar and bombay brands in the united states.it also authorized busa to take all legal steps necessary to effectuate the sale of our products in the united states of america,including but not limited to,making any and all filings for the registration and sale of our products which may be required under state or federal laws and regulations.the letter was signed by linda,baco assistant vice president,legal and trademark no evidence in the record indicates directly who,if anyone,received this letter other than busa.
as a result of the june terminations,jet wine filed this lawsuit on december,in the district of new hampshire,naming bl,baco,and busa as defendants.it alleged in its complaint four claims breach of contract against baco alone,intentional interference with contractual relations against all three defendants,intentional interference with advantageous business relations against all three defendants,and violation of new hampshire consumer protection statute against all three defendants.on march,bl and baco moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction busa did not.
after limited jurisdictional discovery,the district court granted the motions to dismiss in an unpublished order.the court applied the prima facie standard discussed in this circuit case of boit products,cir.under that standard it concluded,first,that baco havana club trademark,its national revenues from other trademarks,and its web site did not amount to minimum contacts necessary to support general personal jurisdiction by a new hampshire court second,that the june letter did not support an inference that busa acted as baco agent so as to permit the court to impute busa contacts with new hampshire to baco and,third,that the two agreements were unrelated to new hampshire and so indicated no direct contact with new hampshire by baco.the court also rejected jet wine arguments for personal jurisdiction over bl.on september,it granted judgment on the pleadings for busa on jet wine state consumer protection claim,and on september,summary judgment for busa on jet wine remaining claims.
in this appeal,jet wine has challenged only the district court decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction its claims against baco.it argues that baco contacts with new hampshire support both specific jurisdiction as to both the tort and contract claims and general jurisdiction over baco.in response,baco defends the district court judgment on the grounds given,and also argues that even if the contacts might suffice for jurisdiction,the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable because of that set of considerations this circuit has called the gestalt factors.see,babcock wilcox canada,cir.
applicable law 
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction when the court held no evidentiary hearing but instead conducted only a prima facie review of the jurisdictional facts.boit,at.no party objected then or now to the prima facie standard,and so we inquire only whether the magistrate judge reached the correct decision under the standard he chose.id.
in determining personal jurisdiction,we first ask whether that jurisdiction was authorized by statute.this circuit has held that under the applicable new hampshire statute,the courts of new hampshire and therefore the federal district court in new hampshire may exercise personal jurisdiction over any unregistered foreign corporation if the constitution permits.sawtelle farrell,cir.the question presented by this appeal is therefore whether the constitution,specifically the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,permits the courts of new hampshire to exercise personal jurisdiction over baco.jet wine presents a number of theories on which it argues due process does permit that exercise.we address only one of those theories that the two agreements and the june letter,viewed under the generous prima facie standard and in light of the other facts of the case,demonstrate sufficient contacts with new hampshire,out of which jet wine claims arose,that specific jurisdiction is consistent with due process we agree,and agree moreover that the considerations of fairness and policy embodied by the gestalt factors do not require a different result in this case.
this circuit recently decided daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson poole,cir,which discusses the relevant law.indeed,the legal issues of that case are somewhat analogous to those before us today.we will restate the law only briefly.as the plaintiff,jet wine bears the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction.to do that,it must show that baco has had certain minimum contacts with new hampshire such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.for its contract claim,the type of claim discussed in daynard,jet wine may ask the court to draw inferences from the parties prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,along with the terms of the contract and the parties actual course of dealing.daynard,at quoting burger king rudzewicz,d.it could show,for example,that the defendant contacts with the forum were instrumental either in the formation of the contract or in its breach.phillips exeter acad.howard phillips fund,cir.for its tort claims,jet wine must show a sufficient causal nexus between baco contacts with new hampshire and jet wine causes of action.id.
the contacts need not be actions directly taken by baco.instead,jet wine may rely in whole or in part on actions imputed to baco through its indeed it must,because any action legally attributed to a corporation is that of one agent or another.the exact type of agency relationship used to impute contacts is not crucial to our inquiry regarding traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,nor are the technical differences between the states different rules of agency vital.daynard,at t he question before us is whether a sufficient relationship exists under the due process clause to permit the exercise of jurisdiction,not whether a partnership,joint venture,or other particular agency relationship between the two defendants exists.
application to the facts 
direct and imputed contacts 
the most important contact that jet wine alleges between baco and new hampshire is baco alleged assumption of schieffelin obligations under the dewar contract when baco and diageo signed the dewar agreement as in daynard,the question we face is not primarily whether baco assumption of the obligations constitutes a contact with the state of new hampshire,or whether jet wine claims arise out of that contact,but whether jet wine has made a prima facie showing that baco did assume those obligations.
although the burden of proof is light,jet wine may not rely on the mere allegations of its complaint,but must point to specific facts in the record that support those allegations.daynard,at.the primary fact produced is the provision in the dewar agreement by which baco assumed all liabilities and obligations that arise out of or relate to the transferred assets including under any contract or the dewar business.jet wine argues that its contract with schieffelin creates an obligation that arises out of,and relates to,the dewar business,defined as the marketing,sales and distribution of scotch whisky under the trade names here at issue we agree that is a quite plausible interpretation,sufficient for a prima facie showing of jurisdiction.the merits of the interpretation may be resolved later.
baco objects that this language does not include schieffelin obligations to jet wine because the agreement enumerates the assumed contracts in the major markets,and jet wine,although in a major market,is not on the list.baco also points out that the language limits assumed obligations to those arising on or following the closing of the transaction.further,it relies on the testimony of several representatives of bl,some of whom were present at the negotiation,that baco did not intend to assume schieffelin obligations to distributors such as jet wine.as to baco first argument about the definition of contracts,first,the reference to contracts uses the word including,indicating that baco may have assumed obligations other than contracts as defined second,the reference to contracts can be read to qualify only baco assumption of liabilities and obligations that arise out of or relate to the transferred assets,and not those that arise out of or relate to the dewar business.if it can be read otherwise,baco can attempt to prove that other reading as part of its defense on the merits.
as to baco second argument about the timing of the obligation,we find sufficient for a jurisdictional showing jet wine answer that,beca
