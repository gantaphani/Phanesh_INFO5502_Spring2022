the public disclosure bar of the false claims act fca generally forecloses private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media.e a.respondent kirk brought such a suit,alleging that his former employer,petitioner schindler elevator,had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its federal contracts.to support his allegations,kirk pointed to information his wife received from the labor department dol in response to three requests for records she filed under the freedom of information act foia.granting schindler motion to dismiss,the district court concluded,inter alia,that the fca public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdiction over kirk allegations that were based on information disclosed in a government report or investigation.the second circuit vacated and remanded,holding,in effect,that an agency response to a foia request is neither a report nor an investigation.
held a federal agency written response to a foia request for records constitutes a report within the meaning of the fca public disclosure bar.
a r eport in this context carries its ordinary meaning.
because the fca does not define report,the court looks first to the word ordinary meaning.see,gross fbl financial services.dictionaries define report as,for example,something that gives information.this ordinary meaning is consistent with the public disclosure bar generally broad scope,see,graham county soil and water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,as is evidenced by the other sources of public disclosure in e a,especially news media.
nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower definition of report.the second circuit committed the very error this court reversed in graham county.in applying the noscitur a sociis canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for report was mandated,the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclosure listed in the statute in particular,the reference to news media.see,at.applying the ordinary meaning of report also does not render superfluous the other sources of public disclosure in e a.
b the dol three written foia responses in this case,along with the accompanying records produced to kirk,are reports within the public disclosure bar ordinary meaning.foia requires each agency receiving a request to notify the person making such request of its determination and the reasons therefor.a a i.like other federal agencies,the dol has adopted foia regulations mandating a written response.such agency responses plainly fall within the broad,ordinary meaning of report as,something that gives information.moreover,any records produced along with such responses are part of the responses,just as if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report.
c this court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written foia responses.
the court holding is not inconsistent with the public disclosure bar drafting history.if anything,the drafting history supports this court holding.kirk case seems a classic example of the opportunistic litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage,at.anyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certification requirements,submit foia requests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of compliance,and potentially reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the fca.
nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written foia responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.kirk argues that the court ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator possessing records whose release was required by foia even absent a request,but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents by way of a foia request.even assuming,as kirk does,that unrequested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar,the court is not troubled by the different treatment.by its plain terms,the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to others.see graham county,at.it would not be anomalous if some methods of foia disclosure fell within the bar scope and some did not.moreover,kirk assertion that potential defendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a foia request for incriminating documents is pure speculation,at.there is no suggestion that this has occurred in those circuits that have long held that foia responses are reports within the public disclosure bar meaning.
even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted,kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define report to exclude foia responses without excluding other documents,the justice department annual report of foia statistics that are indisputably reports.
d whether kirk suit is based upon allegations or transactions disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on remand.
reversed and remanded.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the false claims act fca,prohibits submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the united states,a,and authorizes qui tam suits,in which private parties bring civil actions in the government name,b.this case concerns the fca public disclosure bar,which generally forecloses qui tam suits that are based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation.e a footnote omitted we must decide whether a federal agency written response to a request for records under the freedom of information act foia,constitutes a report within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.we hold that it does.
petitioner schindler elevator corporation manufactures,installs,and services elevators and escalators in,schindler acquired millar elevator industries,and the two companies merged in.
since,schindler and the united states have entered into hundreds of contracts that are subject to the vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act of vevraa.that act requires contractors like schindler to report certain information to the secretary of labor,including how many of its employees are qualified covered veterans under the statute.d.vevraa regulations required schindler to agree in each of its contracts that it would submit reports no later than september of each year.cfr c see also b.
respondent daniel kirk,a united states army veteran who served in vietnam,was employed by millar and schindler from until.in august,kirk resigned from schindler in response to what he saw as schindler efforts to force him out 
in march,kirk filed this action against schindler under the false claims act,which imposes civil penalties and treble damages on persons who submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the united states.a.the fca authorizes both civil actions by the attorney general and private qui tam actions to enforce its provisions.when,as here,the government chooses not to intervene in a qui tam action,the private relator stands to receive between and of the proceeds of the action.d.
in an amended complaint filed in june,kirk alleged that schindler had submitted hundreds of false claims for payment under its government contracts.according to kirk,schindler had violated vevraa reporting requirements by failing to file certain required reports and including false information in those it did file.the company claims for payment were false,kirk alleged,because schindler had falsely certified its compliance with vevraa.kirk did not specify the amount of damages he sought on behalf of the united states,but he asserted that the value of schindler contracts exceeded million.
to support his allegations,kirk pointed to information his wife,linda kirk,received from the department of labor dol in response to three foia requests.kirk had sought all reports filed by schindler for the years through.the dol responded by letter or to each request with information about the records found for each year,including years for which no responsive records were located.the dol informed kirk that it found no reports filed by schindler in,or.for the other years,the dol provided kirk with copies of the reports filed by schindler,in all.
schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds,including that the fca public disclosure bar deprived the district court of jurisdiction.see e a.the district court granted the motion,concluding that most of kirk allegations failed to state a claim and that the remainder were based upon the public disclosure of or transactions in an administrative report or investigation.supp.sdny.
the court of appeals for the second circuit vacated and remanded.the court effectively held that an agency response to a foia request is neither a report nor an investigation within the meaning of the fca public disclosure bar.see,at agreeing with united states ex rel.haight catholic healthcare west,and disagreeing with united states ex rel.mistick pbt housing auth.of pittsburgh.we granted certiorari,and now reverse and remand.
schindler argues that report in the fca public disclosure bar carries its ordinary meaning and that the dol written responses to kirk foia requests are therefore reports.we agree 
adopted in,the fca public disclosure bar provides 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.e a footnote omitted.
because the statute does not define report,we look first to the word ordinary meaning.see gross fbl financial services,slip,at statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose internal quotation marks omitted asgrow seed winterboer,when terms used in a statute are undefined,we give them their ordinary meaning a report is something that gives information or a notification,webster third new international dictionary,or a n official or formal statement of facts or proceedings,black law dictionary ed.see also oxford english dictionary ed.a n account brought by one person to another american heritage dictionary a n account or announcement that is prepared,presented,or delivered,usually in formal or organized form random house dictionary ed.an account or statement describing in detail an event,situation,or the like 
this broad ordinary meaning of report is consistent with the generally broad scope of the fca public disclosure bar.as we explained last term,to determine the meaning of one word in the public disclosure bar,we must consider the provision entire text,read as an integrated whole.graham county soil and water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,slip,at,see also tyler cain,we do not construe the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum the other sources of public disclosure in e a,especially news media,suggest that the public disclosure bar provides a broa d sweep.graham county,supra,at slip,at.the statute also mentions administrative hearings twice,reflecting intent to avoid underinclusiveness even at the risk of redundancy.
the phrase allegations or transactions in e a additionally suggests a public disclosure bar.congress covered not only the disclosure of allegations but also transactions,a term that courts have recognized as having a broad meaning.see,moore new york cotton exchange,transaction is a word of flexible meaning hamilton united healthcare of,t he ordinary meaning of the term transaction is a broad reference to many different types of business dealings between parties 
nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower definition of report.the court of appeals,in holding that foia responses were not reports,looked to the words hearing,audit,or investigation,and the phrase criminal,civil,and administrative hearings.it concluded that all of these sources connote the synthesis of information in an investigatory context to serve some end of the government.at brief for respondent,each is part of the government ongoing effort to fight fraud applying the noscitur a sociis canon,the court of appeals then determined that these neighboring words mandated a narrower meaning for report than its ordinary meaning,at.
the court of appeals committed the very error we reversed in graham county.like the fourth circuit in that case,the second circuit here applied the noscitur a sociis canon only to the immediately surrounding words,to the exclusion of the rest of the statute.see,at.we emphasized in graham county that all of the sources of public disclosure listed in e a provide interpretive guidance.at slip,at.when all of the sources are considered,the reference to news media which the court of appeals did not consider suggests a much broader scope.ibid.
the government similarly errs by focusing only on the adjectives congressional,administrative,or gao,which precede report.brief for united states as amicus curiae.it contends that these adjectives suggest that the public disclosure bar applies only to agency reports analogous to those that congress and the gao would issue or conduct.ibid.as we explained in graham county,however,those three adjectives tell us nothing more than that a report must be governmental.see,at,slip,at.the governmental nature of the foia responses at issue is not disputed.
finally,applying the ordinary meaning of report does not render superfluous the other sources of public disclosure in e a.kirk argues that reading report to mean something that gives information would subsume the other words in the phrase report,hearing,audit,or investigation.brief for respondent.but kirk admits that hearings,audits,and investigations are processes to obtain information.ibid.emphasis added.those processes are thus clearly different from something that gives information.moreover,the statute contemplates some redundancy an audit,for example,will often be a type of investigation.
we are not persuaded that we should adopt a different,somewhat special meaning of report over the word primary meaning.muscarello united states.indeed,we have cautioned recently against interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way inconsistent with a plain reading of its text.in graham county,we rejected several arguments for construing the statute narrowly,twice emphasizing that the sole touchstone in the statutory text is public disclosure.at,slip,at.we chose in that case simply to give the text its most natura l read ing,at slip,at,and we do so again here.
a written agency response to a foia request falls within the ordinary meaning of report.foia requires each agency receiving a request to notify the person making such request of its determination and the reasons therefor.a a i.when an agency denies a request in whole or in part,it must additionally set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial,make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any denied matter,and provide any such estimate to the person making the request.a c i,f.the dol has adopted more detailed regulations implementing foia and mandating a response in writing.see cfr a requiring written notice of the grant of a foia request and a description of the manner in which records will be disclosed b c requiring a brief statement of the reason or reasons for a denial,as well as written notification if a record can not be located or has been destroyed italics deleted.so,too,have other federal agencies.see,cfr of justice cfr of interior cfr of agriculture.such an agency response plainly is something that gives information,a notification,and an official or formal statement of facts.
any records the agency produces along with its written foia response are part of that response,just as if they had been reproduced as an appendix to a printed report.mistick,at.nothing in the public disclosure bar suggests that a document and its attachments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.if an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record attached to a foia response,it is disclosed in that foia response and,therefore,disclosed in a report for the purposes of the public disclosure bar 
the dol three written foia responses to kirk,along with their attached records,are thus reports within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.each response was an official or formal statement that gave information and notif ied kirk of the agency resolution of her foia request.
in interpreting a statute,o ur inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous,as we have found,and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.robinson shell oil,quoting united states ron pair enterprises.we are not persuaded by assertions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written foia responses.
the drafting history of the public disclosure bar does not contradict our holding.as originally enacted in,the fca placed no restriction on the sources from which a qui tam relator could acquire information on which to base a lawsuit.see graham county,at slip,at.accordingly,this court upheld the recovery of a relator,even though the government claimed that he had discovered the basis for his lawsuit by reading a federal criminal indictment.see united states ex rel.marcus hess.in response,congress amended the statute to preclude such parasitic qui tam actions based on evidence or information in the possession of the united states at the time such suit was brought.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.then,in,congress replaced the government knowledge bar with the narrower public disclosure bar,at slip,at.
the court of appeals concluded that it would be inconsistent with this drafting history to hold that written foia responses are reports.the court reasoned that doing so would essentially resurrect,in a significant subset of cases,the government possession standard repudiated in.at.
we disagree with the court of appeals conclusion.as a threshold matter,the drafting history of the public disclosure bar raises more questions than it answers.graham county,supra,at slip,at.in any event,it is hardly inconsistent with the drafting history to read the public disclosure bar as operating similarly to the government knowledge bar in a subset of cases.at.as we have observed,r ather than simply repeal the government knowledge bar,the public disclosure bar was an effort to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits.at slip,at emphasis added.
if anything,the drafting history supports our holding.the sort of case that kirk has brought seems to us a classic example of the opportunistic litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to discourage.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.although kirk alleges that he became suspicious from his own experiences as a veteran working at schindler,anyone could have filed the same foia requests and then filed the same suit.similarly,anyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certification requirements,submit foia requests until he discovers a federal contractor who is out of compliance,and potentially reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the fca.see brief for chamber of commerce of the united states of america et as amici curiae government contractors are required to submit certifications related to everything from how they dispose of hazardous materials to their affirmative action plans citing and 
nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written foia responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.foia requires agencies to release some records even absent a request.see a.kirk argues that it would be strange that two relators could obtain copies of the same document but that only the relator who got the document in response to a foia request would find his case barred.
this argument assumes that records released under foia,but not attached to a written foia response,do not fall within the public disclosure bar.we do not decide that question.but even assuming,as kirk does,that such records are not covered by the public disclosure bar,we are not troubled by the different treatment.by its plain terms,the public disclosure bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to others.see graham county,supra,at slip,at t he fca public disclosure bar deprives courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits when the relevant information has already entered the public domain through certain channels emphasis added.it would not be anomalous if some methods of foia disclosure fell within the scope of the public disclosure bar and some did not.
we also are not concerned that potential defendants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a foia request for incriminating documents.this argument assumes that the public disclosure of information in a written foia response forever taints that information for purposes of the public disclosure bar.but it may be that a relator who comes by that information from a different source has a legitimate argument that his lawsuit is not based upon the initial public disclosure.e a.that question has divided the courts of appeals,and we do not resolve it here.see glaser wound care consultants,describing the split in authority.it may also be that such a relator qualifies for the original source exception 
in any event,the notion that potential defendants will make foia requests to insulate themselves from liability is pure speculation.graham county,at slip,at rejecting as strained speculation an argument that local governments will manipulate the public disclosure bar to escape liability.there is no suggestion that this has occurred in those circuits that have long held that foia responses are reports within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.
even if we accepted these extratextual arguments,kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define report to exclude foia responses without excluding other documents that are indisputably reports.the government,for example,struggled to settle on a single definition.compare brief for united states as amicus curiae report must be read to reflect a focus on situations in which the government is conducting,or has completed,some focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant facts with,at a foia response is not a report because the federal agency is not charged with uncovering the truth of any matter and tr.of oral arg.t he way to think about it is whether or not the agency is engaging in a substantive inquiry into and a substantive analysis of information it is difficult to see how the department of justice annual report of foia statistics something that is indisputably a government report would qualify under the latter two definitions.see of justice,freedom of information act annual report,fiscal year,as visited may,and available in clerk of court case file see also tr.of oral arg.kirk conceding that the doj annual report is a report.and even if the first definition arguably encompasses that report,it would seem also to include foia responses,which convey the results of a government agency focused inquiry.
kirk also was unable to articulate a workable definition.his various proposed definitions suffer the same deficiencies as the government.compare brief for respondent and tr.of oral arg.with brief for respondent and tr.of oral arg.kirk first suggestion would exclude a lot of things that are labeled report,at,and the second the definition advanced by the court of appeals would seem to include written foia responses,at.in the end,it appears that the only argument is that foia is a different kind of mission a special case.
