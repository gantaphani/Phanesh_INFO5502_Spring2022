to provide durango,colorado,residents and southern ute indian tribe members with greater access to kidney dialysis and other nephrology services,mercy medical center,a hospital,together with the tribe,sought to entice mark bevan to join the hospital active staff.when bevan declined,the hospital hired somebody else.to convince that physician and others to settle in durango,and aware that starting a nephrology practice was likely to prove unprofitable for the foreseeable future,the hospital and tribe agreed to underwrite up to million in losses they expected the practice to incur.to protect its investment,mercy made its new practice the exclusive provider of nephrology services at the hospital.
in response,bevan sued.he contended that mercy refusal to deal with other nephrologists,including himself,amounted to the monopolization,or attempted monopolization,of the market for physician nephrology services in the durango area.the district court granted summary judgment to the hospital,and we affirm for two reasons.first,the hospital has no antitrust duty to share its facilities with bevan at the expense of its own nephrology practice.second,in demanding access to mercy facilities,bevan seeks to to hospital putative monopoly.that,of course,is not what the antitrust laws are about they seek to advance competition,not advantage competitors.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to bevan as the summary judgment,they reveal that bevan and his associates at four corners nephrology associates,enjoy a thriving practice based in farmington,new mexico.for years,patients throughout the four corners area where colorado,utah,new mexico,and arizona meet have traveled to bevan office to receive kidney dialysis and other outpatient nephrology services.these include patients from durango,colorado,and its nearby southern ute indian reservation,many of whom require dialysis three times per week.each drive between durango and farmington can take these patients an or more.
in part because of the distance to farmington and the prevalence of kidney disease in the durango area,most acutely among members of the southern ute tribe,the tribe,mercy hospital,and the durango rotary club all sought for many years to convince bevan to provide kidney dialysis and other nephrology services in durango.bevan consistently declined these invitations.while bevan held consulting medical privileges at mercy,and occasionally took inquiries by phone from doctors there,the last time he entered the durango hospital to treat patients was in.
unable to lure bevan to town,mercy and the tribe decided to undertake a joint effort to recruit another nephrologist.after extensive interviews,the tribe selected mark saddler,who agreed to come to durango in on a condition.concerned that patient numbers in durango would not provide him with the income he previously enjoyed,saddler insisted that the hospital employ him on a salaried basis.the hospital agreed.anticipating that its new nephrology practice would lose money for many years,the hospital also agreed to underwrite losses of up to over seven years,while the tribe agreed to backstop certain additional losses,depositing million into a trust fund for that purpose.in addition,saddler was permitted to serve as the director of a new,independently owned outpatient dialysis center in durango.
under mercy preexisting bylaws,the employment of saddler as a active nephrologist automatically terminated bevan consulting privileges.the point of consulting staff members,the bylaws make clear,is limited to filling gaps in the expertise of the hospital active staff consulting staff consist of providers who offer services required or desired but not otherwise provided by an active medical staff member.mercy medical staff bylaws,at.while no longer eligible to serve as a consulting staff member,bevan was able,consistent with the hospital bylaws,to remain a member of its courtesy staff,a position that allowed him to consult and write orders with the permission of an attending physician.
unsatisfied with these developments,bevan,along with one of his associates at four corners nephrology,filed an application to become a member of the hospital active staff,on par with saddler and competing with the hospital nephrology practice.mercy bylaws did not forbid the hospital from having two active staff members with the same expertise,but they did present at least one significant hurdle for bevan.unlike members of the consulting staff,members of the hospital active staff were obliged by the bylaws to reside within minutes of the hospital in order to be available to provide emergency care.to meet this mandate,bevan,who continued to live in farmington,first suggested that he resided in durango office space.when that gambit failed to persuade hospital authorities,he told mercy he had leased a residence near durango,which,on investigation,turned out to be a plot of vacant land.
as these events unfolded,mercy decided to preempt any future application from bevan and his colleagues by designating its nephrology including saddler and a the sole provider of nephrology services to the hospital.mercy cited several factors contributing to its decision.first,hospital administrators expressed concern that granting active staff membership to bevan and other four corners nephrology doctors would reduce the volume of patients for saddler and his partner to the point where they would lose technical proficiency or leave for better jobs.second,while mercy and the tribe anticipated that the hospital new nephrology practice would operate at a loss,they feared that granting staff privileges to other nephrologists would exacerbate those losses,causing the hospital to draw down the southern ute and hospital subsidies more rapidly.ultimately,the hospital feared that money would run out before its practice could become.finally,mercy administrators expressed concern that bevan would offer a repeat performance of his actions in page,arizona.according to them though disputed by bevan,when a competing group of nephrologists opened a dialysis center in page,about four hours west of farmington,bevan responded by opening his own dialysis center in page.the town apparently could support two competing clinics,however,and the competitor clinic soon closed.shortly after that,bevan closed his clinic in page,leaving the town with no nephrology practice and many of its kidney dialysis patients once again with a trek to farmington.in light of its understanding of this episode,the hospital worried that bevan true intentions were to destroy durango nephrology practice,rather than to increase the quality and quantity of nephrology services in durango.
in response to the hospital decision,bevan filed this lawsuit.while his complaint outlined various causes of action,for purposes of this appeal bevan pursues only his claims that mercy decision to exclude him and other nephrologists from admitting patients amounted to the unlawful monopolization,or attempted monopolization,of the market for nephrology physician services in the durango area,in violation of section of the sherman act,and the colorado antitrust act of,et he now stands ready,he says,to reside in durango and practice nephrology there,but can not do so without some assurance he might be considered for active staff privileges at mercy.in due course,mercy moved for summary judgment.with respect to the antitrust claims remaining in play before us,mercy raised many arguments,including that bevan proposed market definition was fatally flawed,that mercy possessed no monopoly power,that bevan suffered no antitrust injury,and that the hospital engaged in no anticompetitive conduct.
among these various arguments,the district court focused on one,granting summary judgment to the hospital on the basis that it lacked monopoly power or the dangerous probability of achieving it.monopoly power,of course,consists of the power to control prices or exclude competition in the relevant product and geographic markets.see united states grinnell,d quotation marks omitted.the district court emphasized that approximately of payments for mercy nephrology services come from federal or state government payers over whom mercy holds no sway when it comes to setting the prices or terms of its services.see four corners nephrology,mercy med.ctr.of durango,wl,at.approximately of mercy nephrology patients are self payers that is,they pay their own bills without intercession from any governmental or commercial health plan.with respect to these patients,the district court assumed,mercy may have the power to control price and output.mercy remaining nephrology patients participate in commercial health plans.the district court held that,while mercy could suggest higher prices with respect to these patients,there was no evidence it has any particular ability to force on these plans higher prices for nephrology services,let alone that the hospital has succeeded in doing so.id.at.
we review the question whether to grant summary judgment de novo,and will affirm a district court decision to do so only if,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the,we discern no genuine issue as to any material fact and conclude that movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.undertaking this analysis,we first examine the rationale the district court offered for its grant of summary judgment to mercy,before then turning to consider two alternative bases the hospital has proffered for affirmance.
bevan argues that the district court erred in its monopoly power analysis.while the district court focused on the hospital lack of control over prices for the segment of the market,bevan emphasizes that at least of mercy patients self pay and so are subject to unilateral price increases by the hospital.as for the approximately of patients whose bills are paid by commercial health plans,bevan asserts that mercy has requested and obtained general rate increases from commercial payers at least six times in the past three years.he also notes that mercy has the ability to balance bill these is,the hospital can seek from individual patients any difference between the hospital stated charges and the payments it receives from the patients health plans.given these facts,bevan submits,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that mercy holds market power even with respect to patients covered by commercial health plans.
in reply,mercy stresses that it negotiates reimbursement rates with commercial health plans across a full spectrum of hospital services,and does not negotiate reimbursement rates for nephrology physician services separately from those for other physician services.the hospital also argues that commercial health plans are too powerful to allow it to single out and raise prices significantly on any particular service,and that there is little or no evidence in the record of it balance billing patients covered by such plans.the hospital does not dispute that approximately of its patients are,but submits that it has no history of gouging them either.
the parties monopoly power arguments raise interesting questions,including the pertinence,if any,of a firm control over discrete,if limited,market segments,such as.indeed,how best to analyze market power over submarkets has recently divided able judges in an analogous,albeit different,context.see ftc whole foods.the briefs before us also artfully address whether and to what degree the existence of often large commercial health plans may preclude a relatively small regional hospital from exercising price control over particular physician services.jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d,abrogated by.tool works indep.ink,d insurance companies are the principal source of price restraint in the hospital industry they place some limitations on the ability of hospitals to exploit their market power.but fortunately,this case does require us to address,let alone resolve,these questions.we may affirm the district court on any basis that finds adequate support in the record,and before us mercy has pressed at least two legal arguments that offer straightforward,and amply persuasive bases for doing just that.
mercy argues that its refusal to deal with bevan does not constitute anticompetitive conduct within the meaning of section of the sherman act or its state law analog.see,answer br.at.we agree.the supreme court has recently emphasized the general rule that a business,even a putative monopolist,has no antitrust duty to deal with its rivals at all.pac.bell.linkline commc ns,d see also id.at as a general rule,businesses are free to choose the parties with whom they will deal,as well as the prices,terms,and conditions of that dealing.verizon commc ns law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d a s a general matter,the sherman act does not restrict the long recognized right of a trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business,freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.quoting united states colgate.second alteration in original.
this presumption should hardly surprise.allowing a business to reap the fruits of its investments is an important element of the system it is what induces risk taking that produces innovation and economic growth.see also christy sports,llc deer valley resort,cir the supreme court has recognized the economic value of allowing businesses to decide with whom they will deal.without some confidence that they can control access to their own property,real or intellectual,how many firms would be deterred from undertaking the risks associated with,say,a significant new endeavor or facility in trinko,for example,the plaintiff sought access to verizon local telephone network in order to sell its own,competing services.finding that verizon had no antitrust duty to share its network infrastructure,the supreme court explained that forcing firms to share the source of their advantage is in some tension with the underlying purpose of antitrust law,since it may lessen the incentive to invest in those economically beneficial facilities.trinko,at.see also id.at.the opportunity to charge monopoly least for a short what attracts business acumen in the first place.put another way,it is the investor potential that breeds investment.to deny the payoff is to deter the investment.
while mercy refusal to share its facilities with bevan does not constitute anticompetitive conduct sufficient to sustain a claim for monopolization or attempted monopolization,we acknowledge that the parties disagree about how best exactly to label bevan claim.at oral argument,though not in his briefs,bevan described his claim as one for monopoly leveraging,with the hospital allegedly using its monopoly over inpatient nephrology services in the durango area to inhibit competition in outpatient dialysis services in the same geographic area.whether embracing the monopoly leveraging label does anything to help bevan cause,though,is questionable.before trinko,some courts of appeals held that a monopolist could violate section by using monopoly power in one market merely to achieve a competitive advantage in a second market.but trinko undid that,explaining that there must at least be a dangerous probability of success in monopolizing a second market.at.quoting spectrum sports,mcquillan,d.see also aba section of antitrust law,antitrust law developments ed.trinko further emphasized that,i n any event,leveraging like,we might add,any other section claim presupposes anticompetitive conduct,rather than providing an excuse for establishing such conduct.at.where,as here,the only possible candidate for anticompetitive conduct could be the claim we have rejected,denominating one claim as sounding in monopoly leveraging wo do anything to save it.id 
at the same time,bevan has disclaimed any interest in describing his suit as involving an essential facilities claim.while the label seems in some ways to capture the essence of his expressly contends that active staff membership at the hospital is critical for nephrologists to be able to compete in the durango can hardly blame bevan for his disinterest in the label,given the supreme court skepticism about the essential facilities doctrine.see trinko,at.noting that the court has never recognized such a doctrine and t o the extent respondent essential facilit
