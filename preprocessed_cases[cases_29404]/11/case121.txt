this appeal calls upon us to assess maine decision to allow small wineries to operate partially outside the usual strictures of the state alcohol control laws.the plaintiffs challenge this decision on the ground that it constitutes impermissible favoritism in violation of the dormant commerce clause.the district court found the challenge wanting.
while the central principles on which the dormant commerce clause operates are,gray areas exist around the edges.we believe that maine exception for small wineries falls within one of these gray in those precincts,courts must proceed case by case.here,after careful perscrutation of maine statutory scheme and its constitutional implications,we find no substantial evidence that the exception for small wineries actually discriminates against interstate commerce.consequently,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
this case has been submitted on a stipulated record.those stipulations limn the statutory scheme by means of which maine regulates the sale of wine.to any extent that the statutes themselves are ambiguous,we assume that they operate and are enforced in the manner agreed upon by the parties.
a.the statutory scheme.
as a general matter maine,like many states,has chosen to regulate the distribution of alcoholic beverages by requiring that producers sell exclusively to licensed wholesalers who,in turn,may sell only to licensed retailers.consumers may purchase alcoholic beverages for consumption only from licensed retailers and may do so only in transactions.this system has been justified on multiple grounds as an efficient means of controlling the distribution of alcoholic beverages,as an effective means of promoting temperance,and as a facilitating means of collecting excise taxes.see,north dakota united states,d recognizing these as legitimate grounds wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir recognizing promotion of temperance and control of alcohol distribution as legitimate legislative purposes.its legitimacy has been vouchsafed by no less an authority than the supreme court.see granholm heald,d north dakota,at.
consistent with this system,maine wineries may,for the most part,sell their wares only to wholesalers.see.tit.but this edict admits of an exception for small vintners that obtain special farm winery licenses.see id.to qualify for a farm winery license,a vineyard must produce no more than gallons of wine annually,see id.a,and must pay a modest license fee per year,see id.f.there are no geographic restrictions applicable to farm wineries,and licenses are available on the same terms to wineries located throughout the united states.despite this equal footing,no winery outside of maine has yet applied for a farm winery license.
farm wineries enjoy a number of special prerogatives.for one thing,they may bypass wholesalers and sell directly to retailers and restaurants.id.d.for another thing,they may sell directly to consumers provided,however,that the transactions take place on the winery premises or at one of up to two locations established by the winery.id.b c.wineries may establish sales outlets on the same basis as wineries.
sales made by farm wineries directly to consumers,wherever consummated,must be face to face.id.this means,of course,that wine can not be from a winery to a consumer.indeed,maine law expressly forbids the furnishing of alcoholic beverages via mail order services,see id,and farm wineries are not exempt from that prohibition.were a winery to obtain a farm winery license,it too would be subject to this prohibition and could sell its products to maine consumers only on the winery premises or at a designated location.
an additional provision of the statutory regime impinges indirectly upon the ability of wineries to sell directly to maine consumers.see id.that provision prohibits a maine resident from bringing more than four quarts of wine typically five bottles into the state.id.individuals may obtain relief from this import limitation only by special request.id.a.such requests are evaluated on a basis by a state agency.id.the parties have stipulated that,when requested,such permission is generally granted.in the absence of such a dispensation,a maine resident visiting an winery and purchasing wine in person would be statutorily forbidden from bringing more than four quarts home with her,and the winery would be statutorily forbidden from shipping purchased wine to consumers in maine.
travel of the case.
we turn now from the statutory scheme to the particulars of this case.on september,two.philip brooks,a maine resident and oenophile,and cherry hill vineyard,llc,an oregon winery that produces fewer than gallons of wine a a civil action in maine federal district court against a number of state hierarchs in their complaint,they alleged that maine farm winery program,in conjunction with the prohibition on direct shipping,has the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause they prayed for a declaration that the statutory scheme is unconstitutional insofar as it prevents wineries from selling their merchandise directly to maine consumers.relatedly,they sought injunctive relief barring enforcement of sections,and against wineries that choose to sell or ship their wares directly to maine consumers.
the state defended the transactional requirement and the related restriction on direct shipping as necessary to prevent underage persons from gaining access to alcoholic beverages.wholesalers and retailers have a vested interest in the system and,by leave of court,a trade maine beer and wine wholesalers as an amicus curiae in support of the statutory scheme.
the parties compiled a stipulated record and for summary judgment.the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge,who concluded that the transactional requirement and the related ban on direct shipping,as memorialized in maine statutory scheme,did not discriminate against interstate commerce but,instead,comprised a reasonable exercise in regulation designed to forestall the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors.cherry hill vineyard,llc baldacci,civ,wl,at.july.the district court summarily adopted the magistrate judge recommended decision and granted summary judgment for the defendants.cherry hill vineyard,llc baldacci,civ,unpublished.this timely appeal followed.
we note,with appreciation,that five separate sets of amici have filed helpful briefs all of them urging affirmance of the judgment below.there is an interesting wrinkle concerning the arguments advanced by the amici.the plaintiffs,citing our decisions in united states sturm,ruger,cir,and rhode island narragansett indian tribe,cir,argue that amici can not raise new arguments.in both of the cited cases,however,amici wished to advance novel arguments on behalf of appellants.here,the amici have appeared in support of the appellees.given our settled rule that an appellate court may affirm the entry of summary judgment on any ground made manifest by the record,see,iverson city of boston,cir,this is quite probably a material difference.in any event,the point is of mainly academic interest,as we affirm on the basis of a line of argument consistently propounded by the state.
ii.analysis 
because the district court acted under the aegis of federal rule of civil procedure,our review is de novo.see auburn police union carpenter,cir.here,our de novo review begins with first principles.the constitution grants congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.this affirmative grant of power to the federal sovereign has long been understood,by necessary implication,to strip state governments of any authority to impede the flow of goods between states.see alliance of auto.mfrs.gwadosky,cir.
the doctrine that surrounds this principle,sometimes referred to as the dormant commerce clause,holds that a state regulation that discriminates against interstate commerce on its face,in purpose,or in effect is highly suspect and will be sustained only when it promotes a legitimate state interest that can not be achieved through any reasonable nondiscriminatory alternative.id.laws that regulate evenhandedly and only incidentally burden commerce are subjected to less searching scrutiny under a balancing test,which operates to validate a challenged regulation unless it burdens commerce in a way that is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits to be derived therefrom.wine spirits retailers,at citing pike bruce church,d.
a.the plaintiffs argument.
this is a appeal.the plaintiffs do not advance any argument under the pike balancing test.they must,therefore,avail themselves of the strict scrutiny reserved for statutes that frankly discriminate against interstate commerce.even within that taxonomy,the plaintiffs objection is narrow they forgo any argument that the challenged portions of maine statutory scheme are discriminatory either on their face or in their conceived purpose.
winnowing out these possibilities,the plaintiffs pin their hopes on the isthmian claim that the challenged portions of the maine regime are discriminatory in effect,that is,that by allowing direct sales to consumers only in transactions,the statutory scheme has the practical effect of benefitting maine wineries at the expense of their competitors.in advancing this argument,the plaintiffs remind us that,for this purpose,discrimination has been broadly defined as differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.or.waste dep t of envtl.quality,d.
challenges of this type have a theoretical basis in the case law.even facially neutral laws enacted without discriminatory motive and in furtherance of legitimate local objectives may be discriminatory in effect and,thus,engender strict scrutiny under the jurisprudence of the dormant commerce clause.see,hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d trailer marine transp.rivera vazquez,cir.
when such a challenge is mounted,the initial burden of establishing discrimination rests with the challenger.see hughes oklahoma,d.once discrimination is established,however,the devoir of persuasion shifts and the affected state must demonstrate that no reasonable nondiscriminatory regulation could achieve its objectives.see new energy limbach,d.
with this background in place,we frame the issue.the plaintiffs argue that the requirement that direct sales take place on winery premises effectively prevents wineries,many of which are geographically distant,from enjoying any real opportunity of selling directly to consumers.wineries,the plaintiffs say,are not similarly disadvantaged because consumers can much more readily travel to their premises.so,the plaintiffs thesis runs,the regime effect is to raise the cost of,say,west coast wines as compared to maine wines since the former will,as a practical matter,be available to consumers only after the addition of hefty middleman see generally granholm,at.calling the retailer and wholesaler two extra layers of overhead that increase cost.moreover,wines produced by small wineries that are unable to attract the attention of a retailer or wholesaler may be unavailable in maine altogether.indeed,the plaintiffs argue,in order to reach maine consumers for transactions,wineries would necessarily be burdened with opening locations within the maine market.establishing that kind of presence would further escalate costs 
the plaintiffs conclude by asserting that the discriminatory burden imposed by the sales requirement and the related ban on direct shipping can not be justified as necessary to any legitimate governmental interest.they insist that the state can fulfill its goal of restricting access to alcoholic beverages on the part of underage youths by,say,mandating that carriers delivering wine to direct purchasers confirm that recipients are at least years of age.see.comp.laws taking this approach.on this basis,the plaintiffs asseverate that the requirement and the related ban on direct shipping can not withstand strict scrutiny.
b.the rejoinder.
although vigorously asserted by able counsel,this argument lacks force.when all is said and done,the plaintiffs have not satisfied their initial burden of showing that maine statutory scheme is discriminatory in effect.without such evidence,we must defer to the state legislature,which has virtually complete control over the importation and sale of liquor and the structure of the liquor distribution system.north dakota,at.quoting cal.retail liquor dealers ass midcal,d.
to be sure,the plaintiffs cite a plethora of cases in endeavoring to demonstrate that the expense added by the restriction on direct shipment offends the dormant commerce clause.but these decisions are not capable of carrying the weight that the plaintiffs load upon them.
the plaintiffs most loudly bruited authority is granholm,in which the supreme court invalidated michigan and new york restrictions on the direct shipping of alcohol by wineries.despite some superficial similarities,the fit between granholm and this case is not exact and,thus,the decision is of limited utility here the novel aspect of granholm was the court holding that the constitutional provision dealing with the regulatory power of the several states in regard to the manufacture,distribution,and sale of alcoholic salvage explicitly discriminatory regimes even though the regulated product is an alcoholic beverage.see granholm,at.the amendment is only peripherally involved in this case,and does not require discussion.on the issue before us,granholm does not dictate the result.that opinion provides less than complete guidance,and virtually no new elaboration,with respect to what does discrimination against interstate commerce.
both the michigan and new york schemes invalidated in granholm discriminated against did so in ways that long have been understood to be unconstitutional.see id.at.terming the discrimination explicit see also id.at.the michigan scheme was discriminatory on its allowed producers to ship wines directly to michigan consumers while banning producers from doing so.see id.at.thus,the finding of unconstitutionality does not assist the present plaintiffs.
the new york scheme was closer,but still different it allowed wineries to only if they first established a physical presence in new york.see id.at.the scheme was found to allow wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that state but to prohibit wineries from doing so,or,at the least,to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.id.at.the plaintiffs insist that the maine scheme operates much the same as the new york scheme because,in practical effect,it gives producers preferential access to consumers.while one district court,drawing heavily on granholm,has found discriminatory a requirement that direct wine sales be made face to face,see cherry hill vineyard,llc hudgins,d,other courts disagree,see,baude heath,civ.wl,at,jelovsek bresden,d,hurley minner,civ,wl,at.
we concur with the latter courts.the plaintiffs in this case overlook a key distinction between the new york and maine statutes.new york created an additional barrier to the entry of wineries into the barrier that maine has not erected.to elaborate,new york created a market for wine it allowed direct shipping on particular conditions,and those conditions were rigged to favor wineries which,unlike wineries,would not have to set up separate sales outlets within new york boundaries.see granholm,at.maine flatly outlaws any and all direct shipping of wine.consequently,there is no market neither nor wineries may.hence,while legal rules demanded the invalidation of both the michigan and new york schemes,see,or.waste,at,those rules do not demand any such ukase here.
by the same token,most of the other cases chronicled by the plaintiffs involve statutes the maine regime at issue discriminate against goods or products.see,id.at.chem.waste,hunt,d city of philadelphia new jersey,d.these cases are distinguishable because maine statutory scheme farm wineries does not explicitly discriminate against interstate commerce.farm winery licenses are available on equal terms to and vineyards alike,and maine ban on the direct shipping of wine applies evenhandedly across the board.
we are,then,on terra incognita.in the absence of any explicit,fac
