while fleeing from the coast guard aboard a vessel,the claimant robert hovito van bommel duyzing van bommel and his crew tossed approximately million into the caribbean sea.the money was recovered by the coast guard and the government filed this action seeking to have the currency,along with some additional money found on the crew members persons,forfeited to the united states.van bommel tried to put a stop to this,claiming that the money was his.the district court dismissed his claim on summary judgment and van bommel now appeals.after careful review,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
a.the interdiction 
in the late evening hours of june,the united states coast guard cutter harriet lane was conducting a routine patrol in the waters off of panama when the crew began tracking a nearby small,vessel.a helicopter was launched from the harriet lane to initiate visual and radar contact.it was determined that the boat was a vessel of approximately forty feet in length that had four persons on board,four engines,and no masthead,stern light or sidelights visible as required by maritime regulations.the coast guard crew suspicions were aroused and so the helicopter approached the vessel,which was located in international waters,and fired three warning shots as an order to stop.the vessel did not heed the warning and it took a round of disabling fire from the helicopter to bring the vessel to a halt.the helicopter crew witnessed the individuals aboard the vessel throwing numerous bales overboard.
an inflatable boat was launched from the harriet lane and coast guard crew members headed to the disabled boat.they boarded to find four men,one of whom is the claimant in this case,van bommel the boat,which contained none of the indicators of a vessel nationality,was determined to be stateless after contact was made with panamanian authorities surface samples were taken from the boat,revealing that certain areas had been in recent contact with cocaine.
the jettisoned bales,which had been marked by the helicopter crew with strobe lights and a data marking buoy,were found floating in the sea six bales were never found it seems they may have sunk or drifted away.the coast guard scooped them up.there were approximately bales total,all of similar shape and size,as well as a plastic package containing a loaded handgun and ammunition.aboard the harriet lane,thirteen of the bales were opened.each contained roughly putting the preliminary estimate of recovered currency at million.
van bommel and his three companions,who had also been transferred to the harriet lane,were advised of their rights and interviewed.van bommel stated that he was offered to transport the bales of money and was paid of it up front.consistent with his story,van bommel had cash on his person as did each of his associates.van bommel also told coast guard officers that he and his crew had tossed the bales overboard when they saw the helicopter 
van bommel talks with law enforcement 
about a week later,on june,van bommel was again interviewed by law enforcement officials and he continued talking.van bommel said that while drinking at a bar on san andres island,he and his three crew members met a man named tomas last name unknown.after the group hung out a few times,tomas cut to the chase.he wanted the four men to participate in a smuggling venture that would involve them moving bales of money from one area of panama to another.van bommel said tomas then made arrangements for all four men to be transported from san andres island to boca de toro,panama to board the vessel.
also on the day of his interview,june,van bommel signed immigration and customs enforcement ice forms titled notice of abandonment of all rights and interest in property the notices of abandonment.one form pertained to the bales and the other to in currency indubitably the found on van bommel person the forms contained an acknowledgment and abandonment of claim that stated 
i understand that i have a right to assert a claim in the seized property described above and to seek return of the property.with full knowledge of those rights,i hereby abandon any and all claims i may have to that property.i waive my right to receive notice of future administrative or judicial proceedings involving the property.i also waive any further right to contest the administrative or judicial forfeiture of the property described above.
van bommel signed the notices of abandonment,both for the bales and the,and an ice agent and drug enforcement administration dea agent signed as witnesses.
criminal charges 
the same day he met with law enforcement,a criminal complaint was filed against van bommel and his three cohorts.it alleged that van bommel,by failing to stop his boat when ordered to do so by the coast guard,had violated,which makes it unlawful for an operator of a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,to knowingly fail to obey a federal law enforcement officer order to heave to that vessel in layman terms,failing to slow down or stop.see a,e.van bommel was ultimately indicted and pled guilty on december.van bommel was sentenced on february,to time already served and a three year term of supervised release was imposed.
d.the forfeiture action 
we backtrack a little.a few months earlier,on november,the united states filed this action,a verified complaint for forfeiture in rem as to.relying on an affidavit completed by ice agent antonio rivera,who participated in the investigation of van bommel,the government alleged that the in currency was seized from van bommel and his accomplices,and the vessel that they were traveling on.the complaint indicated that the currency,which represented the found in the bales and the found on each crew member person,was currently in the custody of the dea,ice,department of homeland security dhs,customs and border protection cbp,and the federal bureau of investigation fbi.the complaint asserted that the currency should be forfeited to the united states,see,because it was involved in a violation of the law,specifically the manufacture,distribution,or possession of a controlled substance on a vessel,see id.on december,the district court ordered that a warrant of arrest in rem be issued for the seized currency.on that same day,the court granted the government motion to seal the case.
once van bommel and the others criminal convictions were all wrapped up,the court ordered the forfeiture case unsealed.a week or so later,on march,van bommel filed a verified claim of ownership with the district court for of the all the money in the bales plus the found on van bommel person.the claim,after detailing the amount of money and where it was presently being held simply indicated that van bommel was the owner of the currency.he signed the document under the pain of perjury.that same day,van bommel filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.in essence,van bommel argued that the government had not established that he was involved in a drug smuggling venture and he also took issue with the timing of the complaint and the fact that it was sealed.attached to the motion to dismiss were three more verified claims of ownership one each pertaining to the,and that again simply averred that van bommel was the owner.
the government then filed an amended complaint,which van bommel moved to dismiss.he also filed an answer.motion practice continued with the government moving for summary judgment.it argued that van bommel did not have article iii standing under the united states constitution to challenge the forfeiture because he had no colorable interest in the seized currency.the government said van bommel claim for the money should be stricken.van bommel objected,arguing among other things that he did have standing and that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the in rem action.van bommel reiterated his lack of jurisdiction argument in a motion to quash the arrest warrant in rem.
given the various filings going back and forth,the district court decided that an evidentiary hearing was needed to flesh out the standing issue.the hearing took place on august.though billed as an evidentiary hearing,neither side ended up offering factual evidence or testimony.van bommel,for his part,had by then been deported to colombia the government had two agents at the ready to ones who interviewed van bommel and witnessed his signing the notices of abandonment however they were never ultimately called.the attorneys did make their pitches though.van bommel argued that his client never intended to abandon the property supposedly he planned to retrieve it from the sea later and that van bommel sworn claims of ownership were sufficient to establish standing.the government persisted that van bommel abandoned the property,pointing not only to the fact that he tossed it into the sea but also that he signed notices of abandonment.van bommel attorney countered he intended to go back for the bales and he only signed because he was not fully advised of his rights and was threatened with prosecution for drug smuggling.after a little more back and forth,the hearing came to a close.
a few months later on march,the district court issued its decision.it found that the claims of ownership filed by van bommel,which were unsupported by any evidence other than his affidavit,were inadequate.van bommel,it held,had also given up any right he might have had to the loot by signing the notices of abandonment.because van bommel had not shown a colorable interest in the seized currency,the court concluded that he had failed to establish article iii standing to challenge the forfeiture.the government motion for summary judgment was granted,and van bommel claim of ownership and pleadings were dismissed with prejudice the court also dismissed van bommel various motions to dismiss and motion to quash as moot.
e.this appeal 
van bommel now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment.he advances two grounds the district court did not have jurisdiction over a portion of the defendant currency,and the court erred in finding that he has no standing.
jurisdiction 
van bommel,though he never argued this below,contends that the warrant for arrest in rem pertaining to just the in the custody of cbp was never executed to support this theory he claims that no return of service was filed for that portion of the money.according to van bommel,the failure of the government to execute a warrant for that part of the defendant currency results in the district court having no in rem jurisdiction over it.the government offers no response to this argument because it was not addressed by the district court.the government suggests that if we find standing we should remand to the district court to address this issue.we will not take the government proffered approach.van bommel challenges the district court jurisdiction and this court has an obligation to satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction.see steel citizens for a better env t,sindicato puertorriqueño de trabajadores fortuño,cir.and so we take up van bommel argument,although it does not get him far.
though van bommel says that the warrant was never executed for the held by the cbp,we do not see any record support for this contention.while van bommel is not specific about what portion of the record he is relying on in his brief he simply says the docket sheet reveals that the warrant was never executed,we think it safe to assume that he is focusing on the process receipt and return the process receipt and so we take a close look at that.the process receipt,which is the same document that van bommel relied on to say that the warrant was not executed in a timely manner,indicates that the warrant of arrest in rem was served on the united states marshals on may.we assume that van bommel is honing in on a section of the process receipt called special instructions or other information that will assist in executing service.this section contains the following language ten thousand dollars in currency fbi and four million two hundred thousand dollars and zero cents in currency dea.there is no reference to the held by the cbp.this omission,however,is not sufficient to establish that the warrant was never executed on the.
the defendant listed at the top of the process receipt is in currency,in other words,the entire amount of the defendant currency.there is nothing to indicate that the special instructions section alters or in any way limits this amount.the type of process to be served is listed as the complaint,amended complaint,the warrant of arrest in rem,and an unspecified order the most likely candidate being the court order granting the government motion to issue the warrant.all of these documents speak in terms of the entire.none of them excludes the.indeed none of the documents even distinguish between,or parse out,the different amounts being held by the different government agencies,other than to say that the defendant currency is being held by various agencies.
the warrant of arrest in rem,in particular,provides that a complaint has been filed in this court praying for the forfeiture of the above captioned defendant property and that we do hereby command that you seize said defendant property,which is described in the caption of the complaint,and to detain the same in your custody until further order of the court.the caption on the warrant,and on the complaint,reads in currency,defendant.the warrant of arrest in rem clearly calls for the arrest of the entire property.and there is nothing on the face of the process receipt to indicate that the warrant was not executed for all of the money.the fact that the special instructions,which are simply meant to assist in expediting service,do not reference the held by the cbp does not clearly indicate that the warrant for that portion of the money was never executed.
that is all we need to say on this point.because the record does not support the underlying premise that the warrant for arrest in rem for the was never executed,we need not get into the merits of van bommel claim that the alleged failure to execute the warrant divests the district court of jurisdiction 
we move on to the main question on appeal whether van bommel has constitutional standing under article iii to challenge the forfeiture van bommel thinks the answer is yes,alleging that his verified claims of ownership are sufficient to give him standing to contest the entire and that it is a disputed issue of fact whether he voluntarily abandoned the money or waived his right to it.the government continues to contend that van bommel has not shown any possessory or ownership interest in any of the confiscated money.
our review,since this case comes to us on a grant of summary judgment,is de novo.kenney floyd,cir.facts are viewed in a light most favorable to van bommel,the all reasonable inferences are also drawn in his favor.rared manchester nh,llc rite aid of,cir.ultimately,summary judgment is called for when the movant,here the government,demonstrates that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.genuine issues are those capable of being resolved in favor of either party and material facts have the potential to impact the case outcome.vera mchugh,cir.
after careful review,we conclude that the answer to the standing question is different depending on which amount of money one is talking approximately million in the bales versus the on van bommel person.we take the two groups of currency separately.
i.the million in the bales 
in general,there are three components that must be satisfied for article iii standing a concrete and particularized injury,a causal connection between that injury and the wrongdoer conduct,and the likelihood that prevailing in the action will rectify the injury in some way.antilles cement fortuño,cir united states currency,cir.standing is a threshold consideration in all cases,including civil forfeiture cases.united states one sixth share of james bulger in all present future proceeds of mass millions lottery ticket no,cir.
in forfeiture cases,the property is the defendant and therefore defenses against forfeiture can only be brought by a intervenor,here van bommel,who generally must have independent standing.see id.when faced with a motion seeking to strike a claim,as van bommel is here,the burden is on the party contesting the forfeiture the claimant to establish standing by a preponderance of the evidence.supplemental rule for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions g c ii b.to have such standing,the claimant must start by demonstrating an ownership or possessory interest in the seized property.one sixth share,at.at the initial stages of intervention,the requirements are not arduous and typically any colorable claim on the defendant property suffices.id.addressing the claimants standing at the motion to to set aside a judgement phase see also currency,at considering standing at the motion to dismiss stage united states v.one parcel of real prop.with,appurtenances improvements known as emerson,cir deciding the claimant standing at the motion to intervene stage.an allegation of ownership,coupled with some evidence of ownership,is sufficient to establish constitutional standing to contest a forfeiture.currency,at.
this case comes to us not at the early stages of intervention but following a hearing that the district court ordered specifically to address the issue of standing this was a hearing that the court had every right to order as the burden is on the claimant to prove standing,see one sixth share,at explaining that the onus is on the party seeking to challenge the forfeiture to demonstrate the necessary ownership or possessory interest to establish standing,and the court was entitled to flesh out what evidence van bommel had,see,united states union bank for sav.inv.jordan,cir the district court held an extended summary judgment hearing to consider whether the claimant bank was the owner of the seized currency for standing purposes currency,at the district court sifted through evidence,including grand jury testimony of the claimant,to address whether he had an ownership interest for standing purposes.in short,van bommel evidence was minimal.
in fact,the only evidence van bommel offered,in support of his verified claim for the money,was his own affidavit proffered in connection with his summary judgment opposition in which he referred to the bales as my bales and indicated that he concealed my ownership of the defendant currency.this evidence of ownership,minimal in its own right,was contradicted by the other evidence on the record.namely,the uncontradicted evidence,which came in the form of the affidavit from the ice agent,that van bommel tossed the bales into the sea and told law enforcement that he was paid to move the bales for someone else as part of a smuggling venture.van bommel does not disagree that he did these things.
to be more specific,it is undisputed that van bommel twice affirmatively indicated to law enforcement that he was simply a paid courier,transporting someone else money for them.van bommel went so far as to give specifics about how he came to transport this money recall his story about tomas and the bar on san andres island.the found on van bommel person,along with the each of his cohorts had,fit into the story he gave law enforcement.in fact,not one thing in the record suggests that the million was really van bommel except his own affidavit in which he made vague references to owning the bale money.even crediting the conclusory,statements made in the affidavit,see sms.maint,digital equip,cir noting that conclusory,testimony need not be credited on summary judgment,the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in favor of the nonmoving party is insufficient to defeat summary judgment,barreto rosa varona mendez,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby.we do not have any more than that here.
furthermore,van bommel abandoned the property by tossing it into the middle of open ocean.his affidavit claim that he intended to go back and retrieve the bales defies common sense.not only did van bommel toss the bales out in plain sight of a coast guard helicopter,but there is no indication in the record that the bales had any feature that would keep them floating in place as opposed to sinking or drifting away.in fact,six of the bales disappeared,presumably sinking or floating away themselves.again,more than a scintilla of evidence is called for here.see barreto rosa,at.and though van bommel persists that there is a factual dispute about whether he intended to abandon the money to the sea,this dispute is of his own making based solely on an affidavit that is uncorroborated by any evidence and,like we said,contradicted by common sense.even viewing the facts in a light most favorable to van bommel,we do not see a genuine dispute of material fact.see webb lawrence,cir holding that a can not simply create a factual dispute rather,there must be a genuine dispute over those facts that could actually affect the outcome of the lawsuit.
the common theme here is that not until after the forfeiture action was filed did van bommel try to reverse course.he alleged through verified claims and his affidavit that the money was really his all along and that he did not mean to give up his right to it.but when the district court ordered an evidentiary hearing specifically for the purpose of evaluating van bommel standing and clearing up any factual discrepancies,van bommel offered no evidence.not only did he not submit to a deposition beforehand but at the hearing,van bommel did not and did not offer an additional affidavit to firm up his claim of ownership.for instance,it strikes us that evidence about how he came to own the million and why he was racing across the sea with it in the dark of night would have helped buttress his claim.there was none of this.
for the reasons detailed above,van bommel did not have the requisite ownership interest in the million needed to establish standing in a forfeiture action.as we said,standing requires an injury that is caused by the wrongdoer and likely to be redressed by the relief sought.see antilles cement,at currency,at.with no ownership interest in the,there is no possible way that van bommel can be injured by the forfeiture of the money.dismissal of van bommel claim as to the approximately million contained in the bales was appropriate.
ii.the van bommel was carrying 
the van bommel was carrying is a different story.not only did van bommel assert in his verified claims and affidavit that he was the owner,but other evidence corroborated this.specifically,van bommel was found with the on his person he did not toss this into the ocean and,at the time of his capture,he told law enforcement that he was paid as the first part of a payment to transport the bales.consistent with his story,all three of his crew members were found with on their persons.the tale continued to jibe when van bommel later told law enforcement that he and his crew were hired by tomas for a smuggling venture.given all of this evidence,we find that van bommel demonstrated the requisite ownership interest in the to have standing to contest its forfeiture.see one sixth share,at.at this stage in the proceedings,van bommel need not prove the full merits of his claim,just that he has a colorable interest in the proceedings such that he satisfies prudential standing requirements.see currency,at.he has done that.
the fact that van bommel signed a notice of is the fact that the district court harped on with respect to the does not change things.in his affidavit,van bommel indicated that he involuntarily and unintelligently signed the notice after he was threatened to be prosecuted for drug smuggling if he did not abandon the currency.he added that law enforcement did not advise him of his due process rights and that the notice of abandonment did not advise him of the full panoply of rights counsel later explained to me,such as the right to present evidence and to have a jury determine whether forfeiture was warranted.
the dissent would have us disregard this affidavit on the grounds that it is hearsay.we are not convinced such an approach makes sense.first,the government did not raise any hearsay objection to the affidavit,nor is it making such an argument on appeal.indeed it would be surprising if it was since the government,in support of its motion for summary judgment,relied heavily on its own affidavit completed by ice agent antonio rivera,which detailed what happened the night the money was seized and van bommel conversations with law enforcement.the district court also raised no hearsay concerns.
second,in analysis section b,i of this decision,which the dissent agrees with and has signed on to,we utilize not only van bommel affidavit to explain why he has not proffered enough evidence to establish standing to contest forfeiture of the bale money,but we also rely on the government affidavit.given our reliance on these affidavits to decide van bommel standing to contest the forfeiture of the bale money again,the dissent does not disagree with that analysis it seems inconsistent to now say that van bommel affidavit should not be considered on the issue of whether he waived his right to contest the because it is hearsay.
finally,and perhaps more fundamentally,we disagree that van bommel affidavit should be treated as inadmissable hearsay.while the district court called the parties in for an evidentiary hearing,no evidence was in fact taken at the hearing.the judge stated well,i think that takes care of what we intended today,which was basically i wanted to receive additional information on certain issues,more so concerning the issue of standing.but as it stands today it will have to be a determination made on the record.van bommel affidavit was never offered into evidence its admissibility was not at issue.affidavits are of course typically relied on to support or defend against motions for summary judgment.see.c a.while it is true that such affidavits must be made on personal knowledge and set out facts that would be admissible in evidence.c,and it is law that hearsay evidence can not be considered on summary judgment for the truth of the matter asserted,kenney,at internal quotation marks omitted,such hearsay concerns are not present here.
furthermore,the case that the dissent cites for the proposition that claimants can not establish article iii standing through hearsay,united states all funds in the account of prop.futures,d,is not on all fours with this case.the affiant in that case,who was the attorney for the claimant company,attested to a company vote taking place even though he was not present at it.id.at.the court disregarded the evidence as inadmissable hearsay because the facts attested to by the affiant were not within his personal knowledge instead the facts were only known to him because the claimants told him about them.id.at.this is not the situation here.everything in van bommel affidavit,including the facts relating to his signing the notices of abandonment,were within his personal knowledge.we see no reason why we should not consider van bommel affidavit.
thus,on the issue of van bommel knowing and voluntary waiver of his interest in the we are left with his affidavit an affidavit,which despite the dissent characterization,is not conclusory or cursory.rather,van bommel clearly explained the threats that the law enforcement agents allegedly made and what rights he was not advised of.and no evidence on record contradicts his claims.the notice of abandonment,signed and dated by van bommel and witnessed by two government agents,indicated that van bommel understood his right to assert a claim in the seized property and to seek its return and that with full knowledge of those rights,he was giving them up.indeed the notice of abandonment does not go into detail though we are not saying it necessarily had to about van bommel specific rights.and,more importantly,there is nothing in the record to contradict van bommel claim that law enforcement did not advise him of certain rights and bullied him into signing the notice by dangling the threat of drug smuggling prosecution over his head.the government offered no affidavit evidence on this point,and the law enforcement officers ready to testify at the evidentiary hearing never testified.furthermore,though the burden is on van bommel to convince us of his standing,it is important to remember that this case comes to us on the government motion for summary judgment.thus,facts are viewed in a light most favorable to van bommel and all reasonable inferences go in his favor.see rared manchester nh,llc,at.
the dissent focus,on what it perceives as van bommel gamesmanship in avoiding having his deposition taken and not appearing at the hearing,is misplaced.we are reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment,of course making our review de novo.see kenney,at.this review centers on the record evidence,not the parties tactics or course of conduct.the attention the dissent devotes to the latter two things strikes us as a tack more appropriately taken when we are operating under an abuse of discretion standard and giving the district court a wide berth to make discretionary calls about the parties demeanor and behavior.but that is not the state of affairs here.
given all this,we conclude that van bommel presented enough evidence to demonstrate constitutional standing to contest the forfeiture of the found on his person.while the dissent disagrees with us on this point,we think the dissent approach gets close to collapsing the issue of van bommel standing with the merits of his forfeiture claim,something courts should not do.see one sixth share,at courts should not,however,conflate the constitutional standing inquiry with the merits determination that comes later.on this narrow issue of standing,we find that van bommel established the necessary ownership interest and has alleged an injury at the hands of the government that can be remedied by forfeiture of the not going forward.see currency,at.to be clear,we are saying nothing more than van bommel has the right to contest the forfeiture.whether he will ultimately prevail on his assertion that the property should not be forfeited is up to the district court to decide.
conclusion 
to sum things up,there is no merit to van bommel contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction over a portion of the defendant currency.as for van bommel standing,he does not have constitutional standing to contest the forfeiture of the found in the bales.he does,however,have standing to contest the forfeiture of the found on his person.the district court grant of summary judgment resulting in the dismissal of van bommel claim for the is affirmed.the court grant of summary judgment as to the is reversed and van bommel claim for the is reinstated 
each side shall bear its own costs.
i concur in the majority opinion,except for its conclusion that van bommel demonstrated constitutional standing to contest the forfeiture of the found on his person.van bommel did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a colorable interest in that money he therefore lacks standing to contest its forfeiture.
as the majority explains,there is every reason to believe that van bommel was paid to transport the bales of currency that he later threw into the sea.thus,at one point van bommel had a colorable claim of ownership of that.but he signed a waiver that stated,in spanish,
i understand that i have a right to assert a claim in the seized property described above,the and to seek return of the property.with full knowledge of those rights,i hereby abandon any and all claims i may have to that property.i waive my right to receive notice of future administrative or judicial proceedings involving the property.i also waive any further right to contest the administrative or judicial forfeiture of the property described above.
i think the majority would agree that if this waiver is valid,van bommel has no claim to the and no standing to participate in this action.van bommel argues,however,that his waiver is void because it was involuntary and unintelligent.the majority believes that van bommel has produced sufficient evidence in support of this argument.for the reasons below,i disagree.
background 
throughout this case,van bommel has worked tirelessly to prevent discovery of facts relating to his standing.i recount the relevant procedural history.
the government began this action by filing a complaint for forfeiture in rem on november.on december,van bommel pleaded guilty to conspiring to fail to heave to a helicopter,and on february,he was sentenced to time served.on february,van bommel counsel advised the government that van bommel was scheduled for a final removal hearing before an immigration judge just four days later,on march.van bommel counsel stated that the immigration judge had previously rejected a request for van bommel to remain in the united states pending the outcome of the forfeiture proceedings,so he encourage d the government to complete any matters pertaining to any intended discovery,that would require van bommel presence in this district,before he is removed from the united states.it appears that at the hearing,the immigration judge ordered that van bommel be removed on march.on march,the government responded to van bommel counsel that it was trying to stay van bommel removal so that he could be deposed,and it asked for dates on which van bommel counsel would be available for the deposition.van bommel counsel did not respond,and the government contacted him again on march to arrange a deposition on march.van bommel counsel told the government that he would check his schedule to confirm the date.instead of doing so,the next day he filed a claim in the forfeiture action for the seized bales of currency and the found on his person.on the same day,he also filed a motion to dismiss the government complaint and unilaterally canceled the deposition,considering it unnecesary sic based on the arguments raised in our motion.the motion to dismiss featured van bommel bare,unexplained claims of ownership of the and the bales of currency,but it nowhere mentioned that van bommel waiver of ownership was involuntary or unintelligent.when the government informed van bommel counsel that it intended to conduct the deposition with or without van bommel,he filed an emergency motion for a protective order staying the deposition,which the court granted without a response from the government.
for reasons that are not clear from the record,van bommel removal was postponed.he was still in the united states on april,when the government moved for summary judgment,asking the court to strike van bommel claim for lack of standing.the government argued that van bommel had waived his ownership of the seized currency,and it attached to its motion van bommel signed waivers of ownership of the bales of currency and the.as the government pointed out,a motion to strike a claim must be decided before any motion by the claimant to dismiss the action.rule g c ii a,supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions supplemental rules.
van bommel was removed from the united states a week later,on april on may,he filed an opposition to the government motion for summary judgment.attached to that motion was a declaration,dated april,which stated that his waiver of ownership was involuntary and unintelligent 
during law enforcement interviews i involuntary sic and unintelligently signed a notice of abandonment of all rights and interest in property.i signed the papers after i was threatened to be prosecuted for drug smuggling if i did not abandon the currency.the law enforcement agents never advised me of any of my fifth amendment rights and i was completely unfamiliar with law.the notice of abandonment did not advise me of the full panoply of rights counsel later explained to me,the standards of proof under the civil asset forfeiture reform act of,right to witnesses,present evidence,right to be assisted by counsel,and the right to have a jury determine the forfeitability of the defendant currency,so as to establish that i made a knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights and my due process right to contest the forfeiture of the defendant currency.once advised by counsel of these rights,i asserted my ownership interest in the currency and categorically pursued my right to contest the forfeiture of my currency.
on july,the district court entered an order scheduling an evidentiary hearing to evaluate disputed issues of fact regarding claimant standing.van bommel counsel did not notify the court that van bommel had left the united states and would be unavailable to testify,nor did he seek assistance from the court or the government with van bommel application to enter the united states on parole for the purpose of testifying.see b describing authority to parole a liens who will be witnesses in proceedings conducted by judicial,administrative,or legislative bodies in the united states.instead,he sprang this information on the court at the evidentiary hearing,which took place on august.
at the hearing,the government was prepared to refute van bommel declaration by calling two agents who had secured van bommel signature on the waiver,but the court informed the government that they need not testify on march,the court entered an order stating,
claimant provides no specific facts or details of the alleged coercion in his opposition to the motion for summary judgment,in claimant opposing statement of uncontested fact s,or in his verified declaration under penalty of perjury.in fact,aside from a single paragraph of allegations in his own sworn statement,claimant provides no evidence of law enforcement coercion in obtaining his waiver of rights and signature on the notice.nor was claimant able to testify to provide further details in support of his claim.thus,claimant has failed to establish that his signature on the notice was both unintelligent and involuntary.
citations omitted.therefore,the court held that van bommel has failed to establish standing or raise a material issue of fact as to his article iii standing and dismissed his claims.
ii.analysis 
in a forfeiture proceeding,a claimant burden to establish standing depends on the stage of the litigation.at the pleading stage,standing is not difficult to establish.see united states in currency,cir united states one sixth share of james bulger in all present and future proceeds of mass millions lottery ticket no,cir at the initial stage of intervention,the requirements for a claimant to demonstrate constitutional standing are very forgiving.in general,any colorable claim on the defendant property suffices.but when he court holds an evidentiary hearing,as the district court did here,the burden of proof rises a claimant carr ies the burden of establishing standing by a preponderance of the evidence.supplemental rule g c ii b supplemental rule g c ii advisory committee note.thus,van bommel must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has a facially colorable interest in the res.united states in currency,cir.
to establish standing at an evidentiary hearing,a party must present admissible evidence supporting its claims.united states in currency,d,stefan cassella,asset forfeiture law in the united states ed see also lujan defenders of wildlife,holding that each element of standing must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.the federal rules of evidence determine whether evidence is admissible in a civil forfeiture action.see.a,united states in currency,cir.therefore,van bommel had the burden to produce admissible evidence that his waiver was unintelligent or involuntary.
van bommel declaration the linchpin of his claim to inadmissible hearsay,not admissible evidence.hearsay,of course,is a statement made outside of a trial or hearing,which a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.van bommel declaration is textbook hearsay it was not made at a trial or hearing,and it was offered to prove that van bommel was coerced into signing the waiver.generally,hearsay is inadmissible id.while there are several exceptions to the rule against hearsay,see generally id,none applies here.as a result,van bommel produced no admissible evidence whatsoever that his waiver was unintelligent or involuntary see united states all funds in the account of prop.futures,d,holding that claimants could not establish article iii standing through hearsay.this alone requires us to affirm the district court decision 
even assuming that van bommel declaration could have been considered at the evidentiary hearing,it was not enough to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he had a colorable interest in the.j udges simply can not decide whether a witness is telling the truth on the basis of a paper record and must observe the witnesses demeanor to best ascertain their lack thereof.united states bmw i convertible,cir citing goldberg kelly.as the district court noted,van bommel offered a single paragraph with no specific facts or details of the alleged coercion.in determining whether van bommel had established his standing by a preponderance of the evidence,the court gave this lone paragraph the short shrift it deserved.see in u.currency,at as we have explained,a conclusory,affidavit,lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence,is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.internal quotation marks omitted.courts routinely demand more facts and evidence from claimants than van bommel was willing to provide.see stefan cassella,asset forfeiture law in the united states ed collecting cases.van bommel declaration falls far short of proving his standing by a preponderance of the evidence.
finally,even if the district court had erred which it did not,i believe that the majority has chosen the wrong disposition by reversing the grant of summary judgment,rather than vacating it.the government came to the evidentiary hearing with two witnesses prepared to testify about the circumstances under which van bommel signed his waiver.given van bommel failure to offer any evidence at the hearing,the court told the government that the witnesses testimony would be unnecessary.by reversing the grant of summary judgment and reinstating van bommel claim,the majority punishes the government for complying with the district court guidance.the more prudent course would be to vacate the grant of summary judgment and give the parties another opportunity to present their evidence on standing.
iii.conclusion 
by letting this case proceed to the merits,the majority rewards van bommel gamesmanship van bommel counsel unilaterally canceled van bommel deposition,fought to have him removed from the united states,failed to make a serious effort to secure his attendance at the evidentiary hearing,and kept from the court that he had been removed months before that hearing.it is difficult to imagine a party trying harder not to meet its burden of proof.nevertheless,the district court must now expend judicial resources on an abandoned claim to.on this point,i respectfully dissent.
the other crew members were arnaldo henao serna,manuel carrascal reales,and abraham carrascal carrascal.all,including van bommel,were from colombia.
it is unclear whether the panamanian authorities were contacted simply because the boat was found near the panama coast or because the crew reported it as being panamanian.
the government claims that van bommel indicated that he threw the bales overboard to sink them van bommel says he made no such admission.another point of disagreement the government alleges that van bommel made other incriminating statements,tying himself and the others to illegal endeavors such as drug and weapons trafficking.van bommel denies this.this dispute is not material for our purposes.
the form we have pertaining to the bales is in english and the form pertaining to the is in spanish.the forms,apart from being in different languages,look identical and appear to provide for the same thing.no party claims otherwise.we therefore treat both forms as containing the same terms.
it indicated that was being held by the fbi,by the dea,and by the cbp.
van bommel attorney,who also participated in van bommel deportation proceeding,never filed a motion with the court or approached the prosecutor seeking to keep his client in the country for this evidentiary hearing.in fact,when the government sought to stay the deportation so that van bommel could be deposed,van bommel counsel opposed it.
van bommel,in between the hearing taking place and the decision issuing,filed yet another motion to dismiss.
to be clear,this was a grant of partial judgment.full judgment in favor of the government on its forfeiture complaint was not granted at this time.one of the other members of van bommel crew,henao serna,also had a claim pending that had to be sorted out.when henao serna ultimately failed to prosecute this claim,the court dismissed it.with no claims left pending,the court over a year after partial judgment was entered against van bommel entered final judgment in favor of the united states and closed the case.
van bommel raised a somewhat related argument below in his motion to quash,which the district court twice denied once without explanation,and then again as moot based on its award of summary judgment to the government.van bommel argued that the warrant of arrest in rem for the entire defendant currency,which was issued on december,was not timely executed because,according to the process receipt and return,it was executed on may,and days later.van bommel averred that the plus days did not satisfy the requirement of rule g of the supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions,which requires that warrants in forfeiture in rem actions must be executed as soon as practicable.rule g c ii.however,as the government correctly noted in its opposition,this argument is without merit because rule g specifically provides that the as soon as practicable requirement does not apply when the property is in the government possession,custody,or control which the defendant currency was here.rule g c ii a.when van bommel made this argument below he made no mention of his current assertion that the warrant was never executed as to the.
van bommel had a argument too.he contended that if the government were to now attempt to fix its alleged failure to execute the warrant,it would be too late because the suit would be untimely.since we find no merit in his claim that the warrant was not executed,we do not need to get into this claim.
standing in forfeiture actions has both constitutional and statutory aspects.united states one sixth share of james bulger in all present future proceeds of mass millions lottery ticket no,cir.the government only challenged article iii standing before the district court and the court deemed it uncontested that van bommel had statutory standing.the government does not challenge that finding on appeal.therefore only article iii standing is at issue here.
we do not go so far as to say that a distinct test should be applied to civil forfeiture actions at the summary judgment phase.in fact,in united states union bank for sav.inv.jordan,cir,this court,in deciding whether summary judgment was properly granted,decided that a claimant had standing using the forgiving colorable claim requirement that is typically applied at the early stages of intervention.however,that case was very different from this one in that the court did not need to delve into the factual underpinnings of the claimant ownership because it was undisputed that the money the government was seeking forfeiture of was seized from the claimant bank account.see id.as we said,the court here actually ordered an evidentiary hearing to flesh out the standing considerations.
as we said earlier,van bommel was deported before the hearing but the record indicates that his counsel did not seek any relief from the district court to stay the deportation and even opposed the government efforts to keep van bommel here.
the dissent suggests that,even assuming the district court erred,reversal with reinstatement is not the proper disposition.rather it would have us vacate the grant of summary judgment and give the parties a chance to have a full evidentiary hearing.we disagree.we are asked to decide this appeal on the record at hand.here the court scheduled an evidentiary hearing but ended up deciding the government motion for summary judgment on the record.the question we are faced with is whether,based on the evidence that was considered by
