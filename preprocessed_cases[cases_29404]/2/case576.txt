plaintiff filed suit against defendants in clair county for injuries suffered while working as a seaman aboard a harbor boat.he claimed negligence under the jones act app.et,unseaworthiness,and maintenance and cure.defendants filed a timely request for a jury trial,which was stricken by the trial court on plaintiff motion,citing the fifth district opinion in allen norman brothers,d,for the proposition that only plaintiffs in jones act cases can demand a jury trial.following a bench trial in which defendants stipulated to liability,the trial court awarded certain damages to plaintiff,including a judgment for pain,suffering,disability and disfigurement.defendants appealed,and the appellate court affirmed in part,finding,inter alia,that the trial court did not err in its refusal to recognize defendant right to trial by jury or in its award of pain and suffering damages.unpublished order under supreme court rule.we granted defendants leave to appeal.
plaintiff complaint specifically included claims under the jones act,an in personam action for seamen who suffer injury in the course of employment due to the negligence of their employer,the vessel owner,or crew members for unseaworthiness under general maritime law based on the vessel owner duty to ensure that the vessel is reasonably fit to be at sea and for maintenance and cure under general maritime law,based on the vessel owner obligation to provide food,lodging and medical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.see lewis lewis clark marine,d.the evidence presented at trial established,inter alia,the following.plaintiff worked for defendant american river transportation company artco as a deckhand.while laboring aboard a harbor boat on may,a defective cable broke apart,struck plaintiff leg,and broke his right tibia,the bone extending from the knee to the ankle.plaintiff underwent surgery which consisted of inserting a rod inside the broken bone to serve as an internal splint to maintain alignment of the bone while it healed.the rod was held in place with one screw below the knee and two above the ankle.the surgery was completed successfully,without any complications,and within six months,plaintiff doctor released him to return to heavy manual labor.plaintiff then began working,and has since continued to work,in the drywall trade.
as to the issue of plaintiff pain,suffering,disability and disfigurement,the evidence showed that the injury involved a significant amount of force and was incredibly painful.however,there was no dispute that,at the time of trial,plaintiff was no longer experiencing excruciating or constant pain.rather,plaintiff can now work and engage in whatever recreational activities he performed before his injury,including running,biking and swimming.plaintiff did testify that sometimes his leg is sore after a full day of work or after playing sports,and thus he does experience moderate pain at times.
after the trial concluded,the court issued its judgment,awarding plaintiff in past lost wages in pain,suffering,disability and disfigurement in maintenance and cure and in attorney fees.on appeal,the panel diminished the maintenance award from to,and vacated the award of attorney fees in its entirety.however,as mentioned,the appellate court affirmed the remainder of the trial court findings,specifically the pain and suffering award and the striking of defendants jury demand.the panel rejected defendants reliance on an opinion recently filed in the fourth district,hutton consolidated grain barge,d,which directly conflicts with allen and holds that both parties in a jones act case are entitled to demand trial by jury.
thus,the appeal before us raises two issues whether the trial court erred in striking defendants jury demand in this state court jones act case and whether the judgment for pain,suffering,disability and disfigurement is supported by the evidence.we find the dispositive issue to be whether,pursuant to the jones act,a defendant may demand a jury trial in a case filed in this state,or whether that right is reserved solely for the plaintiff.as this issue involves the construction of a statute,it is a question of law,and our standard of review is de novo.progressive universal insurance of illinois liberty mutual fire insurance,people robinson.we further note that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the true intent and meaning of the legislature.progressive universal insurance,at,people ex rel.birkett city of chicago.thus,before determining the proper construction of the jones act provision at issue,we believe it helpful to understand the historical background of this federal legislation and its place in maritime law.
article iii,of the united states constitution vests federal courts with jurisdiction over all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.section of the judiciary act of codified this grant of exclusive original jurisdiction,but sav ed to suitors,in all cases,the right of a common law remedy,where the common law is competent to give it.ch,stat.lewis,at.at,d at.that jurisdictional statute now states,with its substance largely unchanged,that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.emphasis added.lewis,at.at,d at.thus,the federal saving to suitors clause preserves remedies and the concurrent jurisdiction of state courts over some admiralty and maritime claims.lewis,at.at,d at.
in,the united states supreme court issued its opinion in the osceola,which halted negligence suits by seamen,and allowed only claims based on maintenance and cure,and unseaworthiness of the vessel to proceed.in,congress,believing that seamen needed a negligence remedy,responded to the osceola decision by enacting section of the act to promote the welfare of american seamen ch,stat.however,the language of the statute did not have the intended effect,and in congress enacted the present jones act,which provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may,at his election,maintain an action for damages at law,with the right of trial by jury,and in such action all statutes of the united states modifying or extending the right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply.app.a.
the railway employees statutes referred to above comprise the federal employer liability act fela through,which offers,inter alia,a negligence remedy for certain railway workers against their employers.fela was incorporated by reference into the jones act.see through.
in panama johnson,the united states supreme court rejected a claim that the jones act was unconstitutional,and held that its essential features are as follows an injured seaman can pursue the negligence remedy in admiralty court alternatively,he can choose to sue on the law side of federal court on the basis of the jones act language and the general grant of federal question jurisdiction when the seaman chooses the federal side route,he is deemed to have invoked the permission granted by the general saving to suitors clause to bring a maritime case in a common law court the applicability of the saving to suitors clause to jones act federal side suits entails the conclusion that jones act suits can also be maintained in state courts,and in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction and jones act cases are characterized as admiralty cases when they are maintained in federal court on the basis of admiralty jurisdiction.johnson,at.at.at,robertson sturley,the right to a jury trial in jones act cases choosing the forum versus choosing the procedure.com.when jones act cases are brought on any other jurisdictional basis,whether in state court or on the law side of federal court,they,like other cases,are deemed to be cases at common law.johnson,at.at.at.with this background in mind,we now examine the jones act language for assistance in deciding the issue before us.
as stated earlier,the primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.progressive universal insurance,at,people ex rel.birkett,at.we determine legislative intent by examining the language of the statute,which is the most reliable indicator of the legislature objectives in enacting a particular law.in re detention of lieberman,quoting michigan avenue national bank county of cook,see also hutton,d at.further,when undertaking the interpretation of a statute,we must presume that,when the legislature enacted a law,it did not intend to produce absurd,inconvenient or unjust results.progressive universal insurance,at.
the key sentence of the jones act at issue here states any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may,at his election,maintain an action for damages at law,with the right of trial by jury.a.we believe that anyone well versed in statutory construction,or even english grammar,would find the plain language of that sentence clearly states that the election to be made by the seaman pertains to his choice to maintain an action at law,and not his election of a right of trial by jury.under the principle of statutory construction known as the last antecedent doctrine,relative or qualifying words or phrases in a statute serve only to modify words or phrases which are immediately preceding and do not modify those which are more remote.people davis,mcmahan industrial comm n,in re application for judgment sale of delinquent properties for the tax year,hutton,d at.
in davis,this court explained that in addition to the last antecedent doctrine,the doctrine of ejusdem generis is used to interpret statutes by providing that when a statutory clause specifically describes several classes of persons or things and then includes other persons or things,the word other is interpreted as meaning other such like.davis,at,quoting farley marion power shovel.thus,in determining whether a gun was a dangerous weapon within the meaning of the armed violence statute,the davis court reasoned as follows 
w hen defining category i weapons,the armed violence statute begins by specifically listing weapons by various commonly recognized names,followed by the clause,any other firearm.the definition then goes on to specifically include shotgun,a stun gun or taser as defined in paragraph a of section of this code,knife with a blade of at least inches in length,dagger,dirk,switchblade knife,stiletto.the concluding phrase,any other deadly or dangerous weapon or instrument of like nature,comes at the end of the list of weapons.applying the doctrine of ejusdem generis in conjunction with the last antecedent rule,we find that the phrase any other deadly or dangerous weapon or instrument of like nature was intended to refer only to weapons or instruments such like the class of weapons which immediately preceded the clause in the provision,weapons or instrument that are sharp and have the ability to cut or stab.we do not believe that the clause any other deadly or dangerous weapon or instrument of like nature was intended to modify all of the named weapons and,thus,was not intended to include bb guns,pellet guns,paint ball guns or any other weapons,which are not firearms,but are of like nature to firearms.emphasis in original.davis,at,quoting ilcs west.
in the case before us,the language of the jones act is more straightforward and thus more easily interpreted than in davis.the jones act does not explicitly state only the plaintiff may elect a trial by jury.this construction would be true if the election referred to in the statute was the election of trial by jury.hutton,d at,quoting app.a.rather,under the last antecedent doctrine,the phrase at his election modifies may maintain an action for damages at law,because the phrase with the right of trial by jury,is separated from the modifying phrase at his election by maintain an action for damages at law.hutton,d at,quoting app.a.therefore,the rules of statutory construction clearly establish that the election referred to in the jones act is not the seaman election of a trial by jury,but his election to proceed at law rather than in admiralty.see hutton,d at.
plaintiff argues that the fifth district herein and in allen,and not the fourth district in hutton,correctly interpret the plain meaning of this section of the jones act,which is to provide only the plaintiff with a right to elect between a bench trial and a trial by jury.unpublished order under supreme court rule,citing allen,d at.however,we find that,in addition to our reading of the plain language of the jones act,which is supported by the rules of statutory construction,a close inspection of the case law also leads to the conclusion that it is hutton which correctly interprets the statute meaning.
hutton relies in part on the united states supreme court decision in johnson,at.at.at,which held,inter alia,that the jones act gave seamen the substantive election between two alternatives accorded by the maritime law.the statute brings into general maritime law new rules,drawn from another system,and extends to injured seamen a right to invoke,at their election,either the relief accorded by the old rules,or that provided by the new rules.johnson,at.at.at.hutton further cites panama vasquez,wherein the united states supreme court stated that the procedural provisions of the jones act have been construed to mean that the new substantive rights may be asserted and enforced either in actions in personam against the employers in courts administering remedies,with a right of trial by jury,or in suits in admiralty without trial by jury.thus,we agree with the hutton court that vasquez and johnson hold these new substantive rights created by the jones act consist solely of a new maritime remedy whereby a seaman may choose to sue in negligence,and the right to file that suit either at law,with the attendant right to a trial by jury or in admiralty,where there is no right to trial by jury.see hutton,d at.
we note that plaintiff also cites the decision in johnson as supportive of his belief that the jones act provides a plaintiff with the sole right to demand a jury in an action at common law.however,instead of looking at johnson in its entirety,plaintiff concentrates on one paragraph of the opinion and interprets it completely out of context.the portion of johnson to which plaintiff points states 
a further objection urged against the statute is that it conflicts with the due process of law clause of the fifth amendment in that it permits injured seamen to elect between varying measures of redress and between different forms of action without according a corresponding right to their employers,and therefore is unreasonably discriminatory and purely arbitrary.of course the objection must fail.there are many instances in the law where a person entitled to sue may choose between alternative measures of redress and modes of enforcement and this has been true since before the constitution.but it never has been held,nor thought so far as we are advised,that to permit such a choice between alternatives otherwise admissible is a violation of due process of law.in the nature of things,the right to choose can not be accorded to both parties,and,if accorded to either,should rest with the one seeking redress rather than the one from whom redress is sought.johnson,at.at.at.
this paragraph in johnson includes,inter alia,the following propositions the jones act gives the plaintiff a choice between varying or alternative measures of redress,and the act gives the plaintiff a choice between different forms of action or alternative modes of enforcement.johnson,at.at.at robertson sturley,understanding panama johnson the supreme court interpretation of the seaman elections under the jones act.there appears to be no debate that the terms varying or alternative measures of redress refer to the osceola remedies of unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure,versus the new negligence action.see.at.however,the key disagreement between plaintiff and defendant herein relates to the second proposition.what did the court mean by saying that the jones act gives the plaintiff a choice between alternative forms of action modes of enforcement.at.plaintiff argues that these terms refer to a jury trial versus a nonjury trial,whereas defendants argue the terms refer instead to the plaintiff election between bringing a jones act suit in admiralty or on the law side.we agree with defendants.
as earlier noted,any search for the meaning of this paragraph in johnson,and particularly the meaning of the term forms of action and modes of enforcement as used therein,must begin by placing the paragraph in context with the rest of the court opinion.johnson,at.at.at.the johnson court primary objective was to determine the constitutionality of the jones act.in doing so,johnson clearly explained that the act purpose was not to remove the negligence right of action from admiralty jurisdiction and make it cognizable only on the common law side of the courts,which would indeed raise constitutionality questions,but rather the terms of the statute in this regard are not imperative but permissive.johnson,at.at.at.the jones act says may maintain an action at law with the right of trial by jury,the import of which is that the injured seaman is permitted,but not required,to proceed on the side of the court with a trial by jury as an incident.emphasis added.johnson,at.at.at,quoting app.a.the court further found that,under this view,the jones act leaves the injured seaman free under the general law of the judicial code to assert his right of action under the new rules on the admiralty side of the court,where the issues will be tried by the court,or on the side,where there will be a right of trial by jury.johnson,at.at.at.
thus,examining johnson in its entirety shows that the forms of action choice discussed in the paragraph cited by plaintiff refers to admiralty actions versus negligence actions.we can find nothing in the johnson opinion which suggests that the term forms of action could have been intended to refer to a choice between jury and nonjury trials in common law actions.indeed,the jury trial is explicitly referred to as an incident of the choice to proceed on the common law side of the court.johnson,at.at.at see.at.we therefore conclude that johnson does not support plaintiff view that the jones act gave to plaintiffs the unilateral right to elect the form of trial,jury or nonjury,in an action at law.
this conclusion,however,does not negate the fact that,under the jones act,a plaintiff does control the choice between a bench or jury trial by using his choice of the forum.that is,the plaintiff desiring a bench trial may bring his case in admiralty under,as there,neither party is entitled to a jury trial.see.com.at.on the other hand,the plaintiff desiring a jury trial may bring his case,pursuant to the clause,on the law side of federal court or in a state court whose law guarantees the right to a jury trial.see.com.at.thus,having the power to control the forum,the jones act plaintiff starts out with full control over whether the case will be tried to a jury.it is in this sense that statements to the effect that the jones act gives only the plaintiff the right to choose a jury trial are true.however,johnson and its predecessor in the second circuit make it clear that once the jones act plaintiff has made his forum choice,if defendants in that forum normally have a right to a jury,then so does the jones act defendant.see.com.at,citing johnson,at.at.at panama johnson,cir,aff.
given the foregoing,we agree with defendants that hutton correctly found the jones act did not express an intention by congress to dictate the method of trial in state court.based on our construction of the statute,we conclude the jones act does not limit the right to trial by jury to the plaintiff only.hutton,d at.however,plaintiff argues that the hutton court decision is contrary to the overwhelming weight of both federal and illinois case law.see allen norman brothers,d,see also hanks luhr brothers,d,hearn american river transportation,d,gibbs lewis clark marine,d,craig atlantic richfield,cir linton great lakes dredge dock,cir rachal ingram,cir.plaintiff further argues that because federal court decisions interpreting a federal act are binding upon illinois courts,it was improper for the appellate court in hutton to interpret a federal statute contrary to interpretations made by federal appellate courts.see hutton,d at,myerscough,dissenting,citing sundance homes,county of du page.
we acknowledge that in rachal,at,the federal district court held that the jones act gives only the the right to choose a jury trial,and in craig,at,the court found t he plain language of the jones act gives a plaintiff the option of maintaining an action at law with the accompanying right to a jury trial and makes no mention of a defendant.emphasis in original.further,in linton,at,the court held that the jones act allows the injured seaman to elect a trial at law in a state court.based upon these federal court decisions,the fifth district in allen and its progeny established the same precedent in illinois.however,this court has now stated its agreement with the hutton opinion and,in turn,its disagreement with rachal and the line of cases which has furthered its reasoning 
further,we reject plaintiff claim that we are bound by federal court decisions on this issue.while in wilson norfolk western ry,this court stated federal decisions are considered controlling on illinois state courts interpreting a federal statute because federal statutes must be given uniform application,six months later,in weiland telectronics pacing systems,this court held that it need not follow seventh circuit precedent for three united states supreme court had not ruled on the issue,there was a split of authority among the federal circuit courts of appeals,and this court believed that the seventh circuit case was wrongly decided.later,in sprietsma mercury marine,reversed on other grounds,d,this court attempted to reconcile the wilson and weiland decisions,stating 
a s we have repeatedly recognized,uniformity of decision is an important consideration when state courts interpret federal statutes.citations.in the absence of a decision of the united states supreme court,which would definitively answer the question presented by this case,we elect to give considerable weight to the decisions of federal courts of appeals and federal district courts that have addressed this issue.sprietsma,at.
accordingly,while a decision of the united states supreme court is binding on this court,federal circuit and district court decisions were recognized in sprietsma as merely being persuasive.see mekertichian,d.further,in bishop burgard,this court held that federal circuit courts of appeals exercise no appellate jurisdiction over the illinois supreme court,and that we need not follow their precedent where the united states supreme court has not yet answered the precise question.here,therefore,where the supreme court has not yet ruled upon the question presented,whether a defendant in a state common law jones act case is entitled to demand a trial by jury,we are not bound by the holding in rachal or any federal or circuit court rulings on this issue.rather,based on our own construction of the statute and cases such as johnson and hutton which have interpreted it,we hold that the jones act does not give an exclusive right to the plaintiff to elect a trial by jury in an action filed in state court.allen and its fifth district progeny,hanks,hearn,and gibbs,are therefore overruled on this point.
plaintiff next argument is that federal substantive law,rather than state procedural law,governs the right to a jury trial in a common law jones act case filed in state court.plaintiff relies mainly on dice akron,canton youngstown,wherein the supreme court asserted that the right to trial by jury is too substantial a part of the rights accorded by fela to permit it to be classified as a mere local rule of procedure for denial in the manner that ohio has here used.citation.it is true that because the jones act incorporates fela by reference,fela decisions are persuasive authority on the meaning of the jones act.see,kernan american dredging,d.we,nevertheless,do not believe
