joseph tracy appeals the benefits review board determination that injuries he incurred in part during his employment by global international offshore from to were not covered under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act referred to as lhwca,or the act because we hold that no portion of tracy employment during this period satisfied the act status and situs tests,we affirm.
the lhwca provides workers compensation coverage for maritime employees engaged in longshoring and harbor work and similar operations.the question in this case is whether tracy qualified for coverage under the act during the period in which he worked for global,his last employer.this question is crucial for global because of the last employer rule,which determines which employer is liable for compensating an employee covered under the act.under this rule,even if the claimant suffered an injury while working for a prior employer,if a subsequent injury aggravated,accelerated or combined with claimant prior injury,thus resulting in claimant disability,the subsequent employer is responsible for the full amount of the compensatory award.found.constructors,office of workers comp.programs,cir quoting kelaita,office of workers comp.programs,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
it is undisputed that tracy was covered by the act during his previous employment with keller foundation,and that tracy disability stemmed from cumulative trauma he experienced during his separate stints with keller and global.under the last employer rule,then,if tracy were covered by the act while working for global,global would be responsible for paying the full award owed to tracy under the act.if not,then keller would be responsible 
we now briefly review the act history and purposes,which provide essential insight to the tests we must apply in determining whether the act covers tracy employment with global.
the lhwca is best understood as a legislative effort to fill a narrow,albeit troublesome gap between two remedial schemes for injured workers the jones act,which covers seamen,and workers compensation programs,which cover,workers.although the jones act does not explicitly define seamen,the supreme court has made clear that this term refers to employees who are part of a ship crew,thus excluding harbor workers see chandris,latsis,d.likewise,the supreme court has held that states can not extend their workers compensation programs to cover harbor workers,either on their own initiative or under authorization from congress,due to paramount federal authority over all matters involving maritime law.see washington dawson dawson case.knickerbocker ice stewart.pac.jensen.it was thus left to congress to fill this remedial gap by federal statute,which it did in by passing the lhwca.see act of,ch,stat.
for nearly five decades after the lhwca enactment,however,courts struggled to define when an injured worker was entitled to relief.initially,the lhwca provided coverage on the basis of a situs test alone,allowing recovery for a injury as long as the injury occurred on navigable waters and the employer had at least one employee but not necessarily the injured employee who was engaged in maritime employment.ne.marine terminal caputo,d citing.thus construed,however,the situs test often produced arbitrarily restrictive outcomes.see,nacirema operating johnson,d holding that longshoremen killed or injured on a pier while loading or unloading a ship were not covered under the act,but would be if they had been thrown into the water or were on the deck of the ship when the accident happened.
to address this problem,congress in broadened the situs test,which now provides 
except as otherwise provided in this section,compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee,but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the united states including any adjoining pier,wharf,dry dock,terminal,building way,marine railway,or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading,unloading,repairing,dismantling,or building a vessel.
a.effectively,congress redefined navigable waters to include landward areas where maritime employees might be working,so they remained covered by the act even if they were on the landward side of the pier when the injury occurred,and to avoid making coverage dependent on where the body falls.nacirema,at douglas,dissenting.
but this broader situs test,if applied alone,could extend the lhwca coverage to workers who simply happened to be injured near the water edge.accordingly,the amendment included a new status test,which defines the word employee to mean any person engaged in maritime employment,including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations,and any including a ship repairman,shipbuilder,and shipbreaker.the status test also continues the act exclusion of seamen,excepting from coverage a master or member of a crew of any vessel,g,thus preserving the relationship between the jones act and the lhwca.
with this historical context in mind,we now turn to a brief discussion of tracy work for global before analyzing his claims.
tracy was hired by global in march as a barge foreman.although tracy was assigned to several vessels and locations during his employment by global,on appeal he points to only two assignments where he qualified for coverage under the act his assignment to the iroquois,and his assignment in the ports of indonesia and singapore.
tracy assignment to the iroquois,a derrick barge,commenced when he was first hired by global in march.for the first three weeks of tracy employment,the iroquois was floating in a shipyard in louisiana,and tracy was assigned to do repairs,maintenance,and modifications to the deck to ensure the iroquois seaworthiness and prepare it for its mission.he also assisted with work on some other barges during his time in louisiana,although he was assigned only to the iroquois.
after preparations were complete,the iroquois was towed from louisiana to tuxpan,mexico.tracy served as barge foreman on the iroquois and was third in command over a skeleton crew of about people during the voyage,which took about seven days.when the barge arrived in mexico,tracy first worked in the port,helping to check and load equipment,doing repairs,and performing general maintenance on the iroquois until the barge was ready to set out on its mission of laying pipe off the coast of del carmen,mexico.once the iroquois commenced this mission,tracy oversaw the barge general maintenance.while the iroquois was still laying pipe off del carmen,global reassigned tracy to the seminole,a barge located in malaysia.tracy served as the seminole anchor foreman for about four to six months.
the second assignment on which tracy relies occurred after his work on the seminole.beginning some time in,tracy was periodically assigned to assignments in the ports of singapore and a shipyard in indonesia.these assignments generally took place during the monsoon season from october through march,and were designed to keep tracy in global employ even when the barge to which he was assigned had been temporarily brought into port.this work in the ports of indonesia and singapore included organizing a yard and making major repairs and modifications to equipment.tracy also performed various other port duties,such as helping to load and unload trucks,barges,and other vessels to which he was not assigned.
at some point,tracy was reassigned to the seminole,on which he was working when he suffered a heart attack in that ended his employment.in february,tracy filed a claim for benefits under the act against global for his hearing loss,upper extremity trauma,and heart condition.global denied his claim,and tracy requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.
the alj granted two partial summary judgments in global favor before finally issuing a lengthy order that resolved the remaining eleven issues in the case.relevant here,the alj found that tracy disability resulted from cumulative trauma experienced during both his employment by keller and his employment by global the alj held,however,that tracy was not covered by the act when he was working for global because none of his assignments satisfied both the status and situs tests.the alj further rejected tracy argument that global should be estopped from denying coverage under the act based on the workers compensation clause of his employment contract,finding that tracy had not made the required factual showing to support application of estoppel.the brb affirmed the alj decision in all relevant respects.
on appeal,tracy disputes these conclusions,arguing that his assignments both to the louisiana shipyard and to the ports of indonesia and singapore satisfied the status and situs tests we now evaluate these issues in turn.
we review a decision of the brb for errors of law and adherence to the substantial evidence standard,and may affirm on any basis contained in the record.brady hamilton stevedore,office of workers comp.programs,cir quoting cretan bethlehem steel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on questions of law,we review the brb decision de novo and do not give it any special deference.stevedoring servs.of am.price,cir see also potomac power,office of workers comp.programs,d.
we first consider tracy arguments relating to his assignment to the iroquois.as discussed above,the brb affirmed the alj finding that the status requirement of the act was not satisfied during the entirety of tracy assignment to the iroquois,even when it was in dock in louisiana.the alj had ruled that tracy was a seaman and thus did not satisfy the act status test even while working in the louisiana shipyards because he was hired for service on and to the iroquois and all of his duties contributed to the function or mission of that vessel.
on appeal,tracy does not dispute that he qualified as a seaman when the iroquois set out for mexico and while it was laying pipe off the mexican shore because he was a member of the crew.nor does he contest that the iroquois was a vessel in navigation,even during the time it was in drydock.see chandris,at.rather,he argues that the first three weeks he was employed by global while the iroquois was being readied,during which time he also assisted with loading other vessels that were also in the yard,should be viewed as a different work assignment in which he had different essential duties.id.at.tracy argues that he was not a seaman during those three weeks and so this period satisfied the status test.
in order to analyze tracy argument,we turn to the supreme court test,as set forth in chandris,for determining whether an injured claimant is a seaman who is entitled to coverage under the jones act and therefore excluded from lhwca coverage.see id.at.
first,the employee duties must contribut e to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.id.at quoting mcdermott int l wilander,d alteration in original.t his threshold requirement is very broad all who work at sea in the service of a ship are eligible for seaman status.id.emphasis omitted quoting wilander,at internal quotation marks omitted.
second,the purported seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or to an identifiable group of such vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.id.the purpose of this requirement is to separate the maritime employees who are entitled to jones act protection from those workers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation.id.the court established an appropriate rule of thumb for the ordinary case,namely that a worker who spends less than about percent of his time in the service of a vessel in navigation should not qualify as a seaman under the jones act.id.at.moreover,the total circumstances of an individual employment must be weighed,rather than a mere snapshot of the moment of injury,to ensure that a worker does not oscillate back and forth between jones act coverage and other remedies depending on the activity in which the worker was engaged while injured.id.at.
chandris thus underscored that the jones act inquiry is fundamentally.by extension,it reinforces an earlier holding that the jones act does not cover probable or expectant seamen but seamen in being.see desper starved rock ferry.in desper,the court considered whether a worker who was injured while doing repair work on sightseeing boats that had been beached and were on blocks was a seaman for purposes of the jones act.id.at.even though desper had an expectation of being hired to operate the boats in the future,the court held that he was not a seaman at the time of his accident because the boats were not afloat,had neither captain nor crew,and were undergoing work of the sort typically done by workers.id.at.we followed desper in heise fishing of alaska,holding that the claimant,who had been hired to help repair and perform maintenance on a fishing vessel while it was laid up for the winter,was not a seaman for purposes of the jones act.see,cir.
we now apply the chandris framework to tracy argument that he did not qualify as a seaman while he was working in the louisiana shipyard for the first three weeks of his iroquois assignment.tracy easily meets the first essential requirement of seaman status that the employee duties contribut e to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.chandris,at.global hired tracy to be the barge foreman of the iroquois,and substantial evidence supported the alj finding that his various duties related to the iroquois,including during the period when he was engaged in various repairs,maintenance,and preparations while the iroquois was in dry dock,were in furtherance of accomplishing its mission of laying pipe.considering the total circumstances of tracy work in the louisiana shipyard,the alj did not err in determining that his duties contributed to the function of the iroquois and the accomplishment of its mission.
we consider next whether tracy satisfied the second prong of the chandris test,which requires a substantial connection to a vessel in both duration and nature.id.under the totality of the circumstances in this case,there is no basis for artificially separating tracy first three weeks of work on the iroquois from the rest of his iroquois assignment.we therefore conclude that the alj did not err in declining to do so.tracy was hired as barge foreman of the iroquois,his work in the shipyard was in service to the iroquois,and he set sail on the iroquois.in no sense could tracy be considered a worker who ha s only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation.id.
nor did tracy come close to spend ing less than about percent of his time in the service of a vessel in navigation.id.at.rather,almost all of his time in the louisiana shipyard,the gulf of mexico,the port of tuxpan,and off the coast of del carmen,was in the service of the iroquois as its barge foreman.although tracy performed some duties in connection with other vessels during the three weeks before the iroquois set sail,he testified that he was not assigned to those other vessels,and there was no evidence that the work he did in connection with any other vessel was substantial in either nature or duration.
tracy further argues that during this period he was merely an expectant sailor,as in desper and heise.again,we disagree.tracy was an experienced seaman whose connection to the iroquois as barge foreman was established from the beginning of his employment.
accordingly,we hold that tracy was not just an expectant or probable seaman,but a seaman in being for the entire time that he was employed as barge foreman of the iroquois,which was a vessel in navigation even during the time it was docked in the louisiana shipyard.because tracy was a member of a crew of a vessel in navigation,and thus a seaman for purposes of the jones act,he was not an employee as defined by the lhwca and did not satisfy the status test during his assignment to the iroquois.see g.
we next consider tracy arguments relating to his assignment to the ports of indonesia and singapore.tracy claims that his injury in these foreign ports constituted an injury upon the navigable waters of the united states within the meaning of the act,and that the brb therefore erred in holding that he did not meet the situs test of the act.tracy presents a argument to support his claim he asserts that navigable waters of the united states include the high seas the high seas include foreign territorial waters,and thus a makes the land areas adjoining foreign territorial waters part of the navigable waters of the united states 
tracy first premise,that the act applies to the high seas,is supported by our case law.we have previously asserted that congress intended the act coverage to extend to the high seas.see saipan stevedore,office of workers comp.programs,cir.in so stating,saipan drew on the analysis set forth in a second circuit case,kollias d g marine maintenance,cir.kollias based its conclusion that congress intended the act to apply to the high seas on three primary factors congress goal of providing consistent coverage a reference to the high seas in one section of the act,b and the director interpretation that the act applied to the high seas.id.at.
the second step in tracy syllogism is that the high seas includes foreign territorial waters.this would be an extension of the law we have not previously reached such a conclusion,nor are we aware of any other circuit doing so to support this point,tracy relies only on our decision in howard crystal cruises,in which we interpreted the scope of the death on the high seas act dohsa,as reaching to foreign territorial waters.see,cir.dohsa provides that w hen the death of an individual is caused by wrongful act occurring on the high seas beyond nautical miles from the shore of the united states,the representative of the decedent may file an action for damages.concluding that there was nothing inherently absurd with the notion of an american court applying american law to an action filed by an american plaintiff against an american defendant,particularly when the law in question was expressly designed to cover wrongful deaths occurring outside the territorial boundaries of the united states,we held that the wife of a cruise passenger who died as a result of an injury sustained when disembarking from the cruise vessel in mexican territorial waters could bring her claims under dohsa.howard,at.therefore,tracy concludes,we should likewise hold that an employee who is stationed in a foreign nation inland area is a covered worker under the act,so long as the inland area is adjacent to a foreign port and thus contiguous to foreign inland waters and foreign territorial seas.
regardless of the merits of tracy logic,his argument does not overcome the strong presumption that enactments of congress do not apply extraterritorially.see morrison austl.bank,d.
in morrison,the supreme court provided guidance on how federal courts should determine whether a statute has extraterritorial application unless there is the affirmative intention of the congress clearly expressed to give a statute extraterritorial effect,we must presume it is primarily concerned with domestic conditions.id.at quoting eeoc arabian american oil aramco,d internal quotation marks omitted.morrison thus rejected the widespread practice among circuit courts of trying to discern whether congress would have wanted a federal statute to apply extraterritorially,and it also rejected the courts development of complex tests that were difficult to apply.id.at.rather than guess anew in each case,federal courts must apply the presumption in all cases,preserving a stable background against which congress can legislate with predictable effects.id.when a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,it has none.id.
with those principles in mind,morrison reviewed the textual evidence of whether congress intended the principal antifraud provision of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,to apply extraterritorially.the exchange act referred generally to foreign commerce,a,mentioned dissemination of transaction prices in foreign countries,and conferred limited regulatory power over foreign activity to prevent evasion of the exchange act,b.but these uncertain indications were not enough,the court held,to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.at.rather,based on the numerous references to domestic securities activity throughout the statute,it was clear that transactions are the object of the statute solicitude.id.at.
the court further noted that a of the exchange act did contain a clear statement of extraterritorial effect which would be quite superfluous if the rest of the exchange act already applied to transactions on foreign exchanges.id.at.and in any event,when a statute provides for some extraterritorial application,the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that provision to its terms.id.that is,courts must find clear and independent textual support rather than relying on mere inference to justify the nature and extent of each statutory application abroad.
in applying morrison presumption against extraterritoriality to a of the lhwca,we begin with the plain text of the statute,which limits coverage to injuries that occur upon the navigable waters of the united states.a.there is no indication at all,much less a clear indication,that congress meant navigable waters of the united states to include territorial waters of foreign sovereigns.moreover,there is no hint that congress intended the landward reach of the term navigable waters to include the adjoining pier,wharf,dry dock,terminal,building way,marine railway,or other adjoining area of a foreign nation.as with the exchange act in morrison,the object of the statute solicitude here is fundamentally domestic congress passed the lhwca to provide workers compensation coverage for those employees who could not be covered by the jones act or state workers compensation schemes.
tracy nonetheless argues that b of the act,which refers to the high seas,should establish that congress intended the act to apply extraterritorially.this section directs the secretary of labor to establish compensation districts that include the high seas and the areas within the united states to which this chapter applies,while also addressing district court jurisdiction over injury or death occurring on the high seas.b.we need not decide here whether this single reference,under morrison,is enough to indicate that congress intended the act to cover maritime workers injured on the high seas.at.either way,the provision does not address,and therefore can not overcome,the presumption that the act does not apply to foreign territorial water or a foreign sovereign lands.see id.at w hen a statute provides for some extraterritorial application,the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that provision to its terms.
for similar reasons,tracy reliance on saipan is misplaced.a determination that the act applies to the high seas,where no single nation is sovereign,can not compel the conclusion that congress also intended the act to apply to the territorial sea,internal waters,and adjoining land of other nations,all areas in which those nations exercise sovereign control.see louisiana,at.nor does howard help tracy,as howard was interpreting a different act that is extraterritorial by its very nature,addressing injuries and deaths that occur in a context congress would have rightly understood to involve excursions into foreign territorial waters.see howard,at noting that the law in question was expressly designed to cover wrongful deaths occurring outside the territorial boundaries of the united states.
finally,we consider the effect of the director support for tracy interpretation we deem reasonable interpretations of the director to have at least some persuasive force if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue and the director interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.metro.stevedore rambo,d see also skidmore swift.price stevedoring servs.of,slip op.at cir,en banc holding that the director litigating position was not entitled to chevron deference,but did warrant skidmore respect on certain issues where the arguments were persuasive and the a
