this case raises the question whether a fight aboard a ship between a seaman and his former maritime employer over unpaid wages can give rise to federal admiralty jurisdiction.we find that it does and therefore reverse the district court dismissal of the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
jeff gruver worked as a deckhand for lesman fisheries,aboard the shrimp and crab boat sunset charge the sunset charge from may through june.robert lesman is the owner and captain of the sunset charge and was gruver direct supervisor during the time gruver worked on the boat.
gruver quit his job on the sunset charge in early june to begin working on a different fishing vessel,the adventurous the adventurous.at the time he left his job on the sunset charge,gruver was owed some wages.soon thereafter,gruver angrily confronted lesman at the dock,demanding his unpaid wages.lesman mailed gruver his final paycheck.while the check was in transit,gruver called and left a threatening message on lesman voicemail.in the message,gruver demanded the money and warned that he would hurt lesman and damage the sunset charge if he was not paid.lesman did not return the call,and gruver received the final paycheck in the mail the next day.unsatisfied with the amount of the check,gruver again called lesman and left a message threatening lesman and his property if the full amount of wages owed to him was not paid.
late in the night on june,gruver was lying in his bunk on the adventurous,waiting for the boat to leave for a trip to the fishing grounds lesman boarded the adventurous looking for gruver.lesman claims he was attempting to give gruver a check for the remainder of his wages and that gruver attacked him,resulting in a fight.gruver,by contrast,claims that lesman found gruver asleep in his bunk and,with the help of lesman nephew,beat gruver severely,attempting to break his legs and vowing to kill him for leaving the threatening messages.
gruver managed to escape to a neighbor house on land,where he rang the doorbell and asked the man who answered to call an ambulance.gruver suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung as a result of the fight.he had to be hospitalized for several days due to his injuries.gruver later reported the incident to the police,and lesman eventually was arrested.
on july,gruver filed a complaint for damages in federal district court against robert lesman,lesman fisheries,and the sunset charge pursuant to admiralty and maritime law,citing,and.the complaint charged lesman with negligence and unpaid wages.gruver thereafter filed an amended complaint on march,again predicated on admiralty jurisdiction,asserting causes of action for assault and unpaid wages.the parties later stipulated to the dismissal of the wage claims,leaving only gruver negligence claim under maritime law for lesman alleged assault.
shortly thereafter,lesman filed a motion to dismiss the case pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted the motion on august,holding that gruver suit must be dismissed because he had failed to establish federal admiralty jurisdiction.gruver timely appealed the order 
we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.campbell redding med,cir.federal district courts have original jurisdiction over a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.see also const.art.iii.historically,admiralty jurisdiction turned solely on the question of whether the tort occurred on navigable waters.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.over time,however,the test has been refined.today,a party seeking to invoke federal maritime jurisdiction over a tort claim must satisfy both a location test and a connection test id.at.
the location test focuses on whether the tort occurred on navigable water or whether injury suffered on land was caused by a vessel on navigable water.id.the connection test has two prongs,each of which must be met for admiralty jurisdiction to be proper a court,first,must assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether the incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the second prong of the connection test requires us to examine whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
neither the location test nor the first prong of the connection test are at issue in this appeal.the parties agree the location test is met because the alleged assault took place aboard the adventurous while the ship was floating on navigable waters.see id.holding location test may be satisfied by showing tort occurred on navigable water.
the parties also agree that,with respect to the first prong of the connection test,the general features of the incident in question have the potential to disrupt commercial maritime activity.see see also christensen,cir the commercial impact prong considers whether the general features of the incident could hypothetically have an effect on maritime commerce.it does not require that any impact actually occurred.the incident in question,when properly defined at an intermediate level of possible generality,grubart,at,involved an assault on a seaman by his former maritime employer aboard a vessel in navigable waters.id.at.describing damage done by barge crane to underwater freight tunnel as damage by a vessel in navigable water to an underwater structure sisson ruby,d characterizing a fire caused by a defective washer dryer on a pleasure boat docked at a marina as a fire on a vessel docked at a marina on navigable waters.
as lesman recognizes,resolving a disagreement with a crewmember through physical violence could render the crewmember unable to perform his fishing duties.grubart,at.describing commercial impact prong as asking whether the incident could be seen within a class of incidents that posed more than a fanciful risk to commercial shipping.such a loss could delay or cause cancellation of scheduled fishing trips because of decreased manpower.see coats penrod drilling,cir en banc without a doubt,worker injuries can have a disruptive impact on maritime commerce by stalling or delaying the primary activity of the vessel.further,if the ship had to fish with less crewmembers or with the loss of a key crewmember,it could decrease the number of fish the crewmen are able to catch.weaver hollywood,cir the city lights i was a commercial boat engaged in the transport of passengers for profit,and without doubt an injury to one of its crew disrupts its participation in maritime commerce.
indeed,the detrimental effect on maritime commerce in this case was more than speculative gruver was hospitalized for days after the attack,depriving the adventurous of its deckhand during scheduled fishing trips.accordingly,the first prong of the connection test is met.
the jurisdictional dispute in this case,then,focuses on the second prong of the connection test whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.grubart,at.internal quotation marks omitted.to warrant jurisdiction,the tortfeasor activity must be so closely related to activity traditionally subject to admiralty law that the reasons for applying special admiralty rules would apply.id.at.
as a first step,we must define what constitutes the activity giving rise to the incident.id.at.the analysis is complicated by the fact that the tort at issue in the case at bar does not comport with the typical maritime tort scenario,in which the tortfeasors are vessel owners engaging in some sort of maritime activity and where the vessel itself is directly implicated in the incident.see,id.at.concerning vessel that damaged underwater freight tunnel resulting in flooding to chicago buildings sisson,at.pertaining to marina fire caused by docked vessel defective foremost ins.richardson,d dealing with collision of passenger boats on navigable water.in such prototypical cases,the relevant act
