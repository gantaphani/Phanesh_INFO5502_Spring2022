this case arises out of the sinking of the charles holman holman,a tugboat operated by the appellee,ingram barge company ingram.ingram and the appellant,fitzgerald marine repair,fitzgerald,have a longstanding contractual relationship,pursuant to which fitzgerald performs repair and maintenance of ingram boats and barges.fitzgerald employee,mike jenkins,was a crewmember aboard fitzgerald vessel,the,that responded to the holman distress call.while aiding the holman,jenkins was injured,and he subsequently brought suit against both fitzgerald and ingram.
ingram filed a against fitzgerald for contractual indemnity.fitzgerald filed a against ingram,asserting common law contribution and indemnity.ingram and fitzgerald filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for ingram and denied fitzgerald motion,holding that fitzgerald was contractually obligated to indemnify ingram.jenkins claims against both fitzgerald and ingram were settled.ingram sought,and was awarded,attorney fees and costs of,the entire amount of its fees and expenses related to all parts of this litigation.fitzgerald appeals the grant of summary judgment to ingram on its for contractual indemnity,the denial of summary judgment to fitzgerald on its common law indemnity and contribution claims,and the award of attorney fees and costs to ingram.we affirm.
fitzgerald business is repairing barges and boats.its office is in charleston,missouri.fitzgerald works almost exclusively for ingram.ingram operates boats and barges on inland rivers,including on the mississippi river near columbus,kentucky the columbus fleets.ingram tugboats,including the holman,watch over the columbus fleets and move barges in and out of them.fitzgerald works almost exclusively on ingram columbus fleets,mainly ingram barges.fitzgerald repair crews work shifts,from to.at the beginning of each fitzgerald shift,ingram dispatches fitzgerald crews to various repair projects.
the contractual agreement in effect between the parties on july,the date the holman sank,was the service agreement entered into on june,the service agreement.the service agreement was set to expire,by its own terms,on june,with an option to renew for another five years.the service agreement was extended,by oral agreement,and was in effect on july,pursuant to the service agreement,
fitzgerald shall provide ingram the following services upon request 
a repair of barges,towboats,and other vessels and any appurtenances,tackle,gear,or appliances of such vessels and 
b such other services as may be agreed upon by the parties.
all of such services shall be performed at the ingram facility in the vicinity of columbus,kentucky,including barge fleets operated in conjunction with the ingram operation on both sides of the river.ingram shall give fitzgerald at least hours advance notice of its service requirements.
appellant add.the agreement contained an indemnity provision.
the crew utilized the,a small boat,and its welding flat,a small barge,primarily to perform welding repairs on barges in ingram columbus fleets.on july,the had a crew,consisting of craig poore,craig poore,laborer and jenkins,welder.the crew spent the day performing repairs on two ingram barges.at about the crew had finished their repair work for the day and were heading back to the dock when a distress call was issued by the holman 
the came to the aid of the holman,arriving at the holman at about the holman was taking on water and was in danger of sinking.poore,described the situation as follows the holman was listed to the starboard side.half of the stern was underwater.the deckhands and the pilot was sic standing on an adjacent barge.appellant app.jenkins described the situation as an emergency and stated that none of the crewmembers had ever handled a situation like it before.id.at.jenkins testified that it was an emergency because the whole stern of the holman was underwater and there was approximately five and a half to six feet of water in the engine room,and it was pretty inevitable that the boat was going to turn.id.jenkins stated that he had witnessed a tugboat sinking probably three times over the years and that it is an unusual occurrence.id.
ingram did not provide the crew with any specific instructions.poore,testified to the following 
q.but you are a repair crew,right 
yes,sir,i am.
and that why you were sent over there 
no.i was sent over there to set up pumps.
id.at.poore,later stated,the only thing i was asked by tommy mcbride,the captain of the holman,was craig,can you save it and poore,replied,i do know.i try.id.at.
the crew boarded the holman,taking along with it one of the pumps for the purpose of removing water from the holman.the crew was able to start the pump.poore,remained on the holman,and poore,and jenkins went back to the to get more pumps.according to jenkins,he injured his back throwing a pump from the to the holman.before the crew was able to start the second pump,poore,ordered his crew off the holman because he determined that the holman was going to sink.poore,explained,i looked in the engine room and there was about foot of water,and the door from the galley area,whatever it was,water was just pouring in.it scared me.it was time to get off.i was ready to get off that boat.id.at.according to jenkins,he aggravated his injury by cutting a wire securing the holman to a loaded tank barge,after it became apparent that the holman could not be saved.the holman sank within about minutes of the arrival on the scene.ingram determined the holman sank because an ingram employee had not closed a manhole cover on the holman starboard stern buoyancy compartment,causing the boat to swamp itself.
fitzgerald billed ingram for a shift for the on july.there is no record reflecting that fitzgerald specifically billed ingram for its time spent aiding the holman.the incident occurred during the time period that is allotted to fitzgerald vessels to return to the dock and still bill ingram for a complete hours of work.
jenkins sued both fitzgerald and ingram for the injuries he sustained in the holman incident,alleging five counts.in count i,jenkins alleged that fitzgerald had violated the jones act.et counts ii and iv alleged claims against both fitzgerald and ingram for unseaworthiness in count iii,jenkins alleged a claim for maintenance and cure against fitzgerald count v alleged a common law negligence claim against ingram.
ingram filed a against fitzgerald,alleging that fitzgerald was contractually obligated to indemnify ingram for jenkins claims.fitzgerald filed a against ingram,alleging that,in the event jenkins obtained a judgment against fitzgerald,fitzgerald was entitled to contribution and indemnification from ingram under common law.both parties sought summary judgment on their.
on october,the district court granted summary judgment to ingram on both its and fitzgerald,concluding that under the contract between the two companies,fitzgerald agreed to indemnify ingram for injuries to its employees such as that alleged by jenkins here,jenkins fitzgerald marine repair,cv cdp,wl,at,unpublished.following the district court summary judgment ruling,the parties settled jenkins claims which were then dismissed by stipulation on february.
ingram then filed a request for attorney fees,the only expense it incurred in defending jenkins claims,and prejudgment interest.ingram sought a judgment in the amount of,consisting of attorney fees and expenses of and prejudgment interest of.this request covered all fees and expenses that ingram had incurred in all parts of the litigation.ingram segregated the amount of attorney fees and expenses,representing that it expended in defending against jenkins claims and in defending against fitzgerald and prosecuting its own for contractual indemnity.the court determined that the first category of attorney fees and expenses were recoverable as expenses covered by the indemnification clause of the parties contractual agreement.the court further concluded that ingram was entitled to recover all of the fees and expenses in the second category because the time and effort spent defending against fitzgerald recoverable for the same reason as the first category of fees and expenses could not reasonably be segregated from that spent to prove ingram own.the court also found that the amount of fees claimed by ingram was reasonable.fitzgerald appeals.
fitzgerald appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on ingram for contractual indemnity,as well as the court denial of summary judgment to fitzgerald on its claim for common law indemnity and contribution.fitzgerald also appeals the court award to ingram of attorney fees and costs.we address each issue in turn.
first,fitzgerald argues the district court erred in determining that,as a matter of law,fitzgerald was contractually obligated to indemnify ingram for jenkins claims.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.this court views the evidence and the inferences which may be reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

contract interpretation,including construction of indemnity clauses and whether a contract is ambiguous,is a matter of law which we review de novo.see med.protective bubenik,cir gander mountain cabela,cir.generally,disputes with regard to contract interpretation are governed by state law.see myers richland county,cir larken,wray,cir.however,because the service agreement is a contract for,among other things,repairs to marine vessels,it is a maritime contract.see new bedford dry dock purdy.sw.marine,danzig,cir.thus,our interpretation of the service agreement,including the indemnity clause,is a matter governed by maritime law,a body of federal jurisprudence,that is largely uncodified.sander alexander richardson,cir because the subject matter of the contract at slip rental maritime,we apply admiralty law.see also thomas schoenbaum,admiralty.law ed.the interpretation of an admiralty indemnity contract is governed by federal maritime law.
at the outset,we consider fitzgerald claim that we should consider extrinsic evidence in ascertaining the meaning of the service agreement because it is ambiguous.fontenot mesa petroleum,cir holding that,under federal maritime law,a court should not look beyond the written language of the contract to determine the intent of the parties unless the disputed language is ambiguous emphasis added see corbitt diamond drilling,cir although shell insists that under louisiana law the intent of contracting parties may always be shown by extrinsic evidence,federal maritime law is different a court may not look beyond the written language of the document to determine the intent of the parties unless the disputed contract provision is ambiguous.fitzgerald premises its ambiguity argument on two bases the district court conclusion that the service agreement required fitzgerald to respond to emergencies is inconsistent with the agreement notice provision,and the indemnity provision contains a latent ambiguity because,when the contract is read in reference to a particular claim,it is unclear whether it applies.
first,although the first ground is disguised as an ambiguity argument,fitzgerald is,in actuality,attacking the district court conclusion that jenkins claims fell within the indemnity provision,that emergency rescue was included in the services fitzgerald agreed to provide to ingram.thus,fitzgerald argument actually goes to the ultimate issue in this case,whether jenkins claims fall within the scope of the indemnity provision of the service agreement.we,therefore,decline to find the contract ambiguous for the reason offered by fitzgerald.
second,in support of its latent ambiguity contention,fitzgerald cites a nonmaritime case,global network technologies,reg l airport,cir,for the proposition that a latent ambiguity occurs where a writing on its face appears clear and unambiguous,but some collateral matter makes the meaning uncertain.id.at see,stark sandberg,phoenix von gontard,cir holding that a latent ambiguity existed in exclusionary language in an arbitration clause w hen viewed in the context of missouri law governing exculpatory clauses because the clause attempt ed to effect a prospective waiver of rights which missouri law holds may not be waived.here,fitzgerald is essentially arguing that the indemnity provision is so broadly worded that a court can not discern when it applies,rendering it ambiguous.however,the sweeping nature of the indemnity clause,in and of itself,does not establish ambiguity.under federal maritime law,
disagreement as to the meaning of a contract does not make it ambiguous,nor does uncertainty or lack of clarity in the language chosen by the parties.where the written instrument is so worded that it can be given a certain definite legal meaning or interpretation,then it is not ambiguous,and this court will construe the contract as a matter of law.
breaux halliburton energy,cir quotations and citations omitted.we conclude that,although broad in scope,the language of the indemnity provision can be interpreted and applied to a given set of facts,here the holman incident,in order to determine whether,as a matter of law,the event triggered fitzgerald indemnity obligation.accordingly,the indemnity provision is not ambiguous 
whether the service agreement requires fitzgerald to indemnify ingram for jenkins claims is controlled by the language of the indemnity provision,which provides 
indemnity.fitzgerald shall indemnify,hold harmless,and defend ingram and its affiliated companies and its and their employees,agents,and vessels,from and against a any and all claims,liabilities,penalties,and expenses based upon or arising in connection with injury to or death of the employees or agents of fitzgerald,regardless of any negligence on the part of the party to be indemnified or the unseaworthiness of any vessel owned,chartered,operated,or controlled by such party,and b any other claims,liabilities,penalties,and expenses arising in connection with fitzgerald operations unless caused by the sole negligence of ingram or its affiliates,or its or their employees,agents,or other contractors or subcontractors.
appellant add.
pursuant to federal maritime law,we are to construe the indemnity provision broadly.see fontenot,at.the provision contains two clauses.clause a relates to the injuries to fitzgerald employees,and clause b applies to third parties.because jenkins was undisputedly a fitzgerald employee at the time of the holman incident,clause a is,at least,potentially applicable to jenkins claims arising out of that event.we do not construe clause a in isolation,but rather in the context of the service agreement as a whole.see breaux,at a maritime contract containing an indemnity agreement should be read as a whole and its words given their plain meaning unless the provision is ambiguous.alteration in original quoting weathersby conoco oil,cir.viewing clause a through this lens,we conclude that it requires fitzgerald to indemnify ingram for all injuries to fitzgerald employees that arise in connection with the service agreement 
as we have already noted,it is undisputed that jenkins was a fitzgerald employee on the day of the holman incident.next,we must consider whether jenkins injuries arose in connection with the service agreement.in resolving this question,the parties rely heavily on the fifth circuit decision in corbitt.corbitt provides 
a contract of indemnity should be construed to cover all losses,damages,or liabilities which reasonably appear to have been within the contemplation of the parties,but it should not be read to impose liability for those losses or liabilities which are neither expressly within its terms nor of such a character that it can be reasonably inferred that the parties intended to include them within the indemnity coverage.
id.at.the parties debate corbitt meaning,with fitzgerald arguing that it imposes a test for indemnity and ingram arguing that it provides two alternative bases for indemnity.corbitt use of the terms neither nor confirms that it was meant to read in the disjunctive,and not the conjunctive,such that ingram interpretation prevails.
another instructive case is fontenot.fontenot is a maritime case involving a drilling rig,the,owned by rowandrill,and chartered by mesa petroleum company mesa.at.the contract contained an indemnity provision,providing 
mesa agrees to protect,defend,indemnify and save rowandrill from and against all claims,demands and causes of action of every kind and character,without limit and without regard to the cause or causes thereof or the negligence of any party,arising in connection herewith in favor of mesa s employees,mesa contractors or their employees other than rowandrill employees or its subcontractors or their employees on account of bodily injury,death or damage to property.
id.at alterations in original.in addition,rowandrill agreed to indemnify mesa for injuries sustained by rowandrill personnel,contractors,and property.id.at.
bristow offshore helicopters,bristow provided helicopter transportation services to mesa.id.at.andrew fontenot,an employee of an engineering company,was onboard a bristow helicopter en route to his company rig that was under contract to mesa.id.fontenot suffered injuries in a fall on the slippery heliport surface of the,when a bristow helicopter stopped to refuel.id.fontenot brought claims against rowandrill and mesa,which were settled,and rowandrill and mesa for indemnity remained before the district court.id.the district court determined that rowandrill was not entitled to contractual indemnity from mesa,holding that fontenot claim was not one arising in connection herewith because the use of the heliport was only incidental to the business of drilling a well or wells,the stated purpose of the contract.id.at.
the fifth circuit reversed,determining that mesa owed rowandrill a duty of indemnification for its share of fontenot settlement.id.at.in so holding,the court observed that the phrase arising in connecting herewith is to be broadly construed to unambiguously encompass all activities reasonably incident or anticipated by the principal activity of the contract.id.at see schoenbaum,supra,providing that an indemnity provision in a maritime contract stating that indemnity extends to all activities arising out of or in connection with the work under the contract will be give n broad effect.the court further explained 
w here the presence of the injured person at the scene of the injury is attributable to or might reasonably be anticipated by his employment responsibilities,then his injuries occur in connection with those responsibilities.it is irrelevant that the person is not at that moment performing services or that the injury results from an activity not encompassed by the employer contractual undertakings.
fontenot,at.applying corbitt and fontenot here,we hold that jenkins act of throwing a pump to the sinking holman was covered by clause a because,even if it was not expressly within clause a terms,the activity is of such a character that it can be reasonably inferred that the parties intended to include it within the indemnity coverage.see fontenot,at corbitt,at.
fitzgerald argues that our interpretation of the indemnity provision violates the absurdity doctrine articulated by the missouri court of appeals in tumlinson norfolk ry.there,the court determined that the agreement at issue was ambiguous because the words taken literally le d to absurd results.id.at.similarly,maritime law provides that construction of a maritime contract should not lead to absurd consequences.chembulk trading llc chemex,cir.fitzgerald asserts that enforcement of the indemnity provision,according to its literal terms,would produce an absurd liability to fitzgerald for accidents having nothing to do with the subject of the service agreement and for situations over which fitzgerald had no control.however,our conclusion that clause a of the indemnity provision of the service agreement covers jenkins claims arising out of the holman incident is not an absurd result.pursuant to fitzgerald and ingram contractual relationship,fitzgerald repaired ingram vessels and agreed to indemnify ingram for all injuries incurred by fitzgerald employees pursuant to their work for ingram.that fitzgerald is now bound to indemnify ingram for a fitzgerald employee claims arising out of his aid to an ingram tugboat in distress is reasonable.
fitzgerald next argues that jenkins injuries could not have occurred in connection with the service agreement because the contract contains a notice provision.the contract states that ingram shall give fitzgerald at least hours advance notice of its service requirements.appellant add.it is undisputed that,despite this stated requirement,the and its crew responded to the holman distress call.furthermore,under federal maritime law,whether jenkins presence at the holman incident was encompassed by fitzgerald contractual undertakings is not relevant because his presence was attributable to or might reasonably be anticipated by his employment responsibilities fontenot,at.therefore,any noncompliance with the service agreement notice provision does not alter our conclusion that jenkins claims are covered by the contract indemnity provision.
finally,fitzgerald argues that it should not be required to indemnify ingram for jenkins injuries because the and its crew were acting as good samaritans.technically,a good samaritan is one who compassionately renders personal assistance to the unfortunate bart lounsbury,digging out of the holes we made hardrock mining,good samaritans,and the need for comprehensive action,harv.envtl,citing webster third new international dictionary see luke.in light of the longstanding contractual relationship of the parties,fitzgerald is not simply a good samaritan.furthermore,we have already determined that jenkins claims arose in connection to the service agreement.therefore,there is no basis for exempting fitzgerald from its indemnity obligation as a good samaritan.see pac.indem.whaley,d,denying dismissal of roofing contractor indemnity and contribution claims against roofing subcontractor on the basis that the subcontractor acted as a good samaritan in tarping the roof because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the roofing subcontractor had a contractual duty to tarp roof urban acadian contractors,d,holding that indemnitor,which agreed to defend oil company and its contractors for any and all liability or damages whether directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with personal or bodily injury,owed a duty to defend the claims against the contractor for injury sustained by indemnitor employee while acting as a good samaritan in seeking to extinguish a fire caused by alleged gross negligent of contractor.
in sum,we hold that fitzgerald is contractually bound to indemnify ingram for jenkins claims arising out of the holman incident.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to ingram on its for contractual indemnity.
next,we review de novo fitzgerald appeal of the district court grant of summary judgment to ingram on fitzgerald for contribution and indemnity under common law.see lackawanna,at standard of review.
in its opening brief,fitzgerald relies on the same arguments we rejected in part a as also demonstrating that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to ingram on fitzgerald for contribution and indemnity we first note that admiralty law recognizes the common law doctrines of contribution and indemnity and that fitzgerald is determined by federal maritime law,not state law.see schoenbaum,supra.
contribution is a cause of action that arises when a tortfeasor pays more than his pro rata share of a judgment.although contribution is an inchoate right when the underlying tort giving rise to common liability occurs,the remedy is not available until the tortfeasor pays more than his share of the judgment.in admiralty the amount of contribution is determined according to principles of comparative fault one who has paid more than his allocable share of the judgment has an action against any other tortfeasor who has paid less than h
