this case is based on a dispute between a company incorporated in india and a company incorporated in singapore over an accident that occurred in india while one company was shipping products to china the dispute was to be arbitrated in england.because the parties banks had accounts in new york banks,electronic fund transfers efts between one party involved in the dispute and third parties passed through new york electronically for an instant.under winter storm shipping,tpi,cir,this momentary passage was sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the united states district court of the southern district of new york.
we are now presented with the question of whether the rule of winter storm should be reconsidered and,upon reconsideration,overruled.specifically,this appeal raises the issue of whether efts of which defendants are the beneficiary are attachable property of the defendant pursuant to rule b of the supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions of the federal rules of civil procedure rule b of the admiralty rules under our decisions in winter storm,at,aqua stoli shipping gardner smith pty,cir,and consub delaware llc schahin engenharia limitada,cir.we now conclude,with the consent of all of the judges of the court in active service,that winter storm was erroneously decided and therefore should no longer be binding precedent in our circuit 
our decision in winter storm produced a substantial body of critical commentary.indeed,within four years of our decision,we ourselves had begun to question the correctness of winter storm,see aqua stoli,at the correctness of our decision in winter storm seems open to question,as have,more recently,some judges of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,see,hannah osk mktg.commc ns,the discussion above also underscores a point that has become conventional wisdom in this district that winter storm and aqua stoli may merit reconsideration emphasis added.various commentators and courts have suggested that winter storm directly led to strains on federal courts and international banks operating within our circuit.see,permanent editorial bd.for the uniform commercial code,peb commentary sections d and,at july,peb commentary t he winter storm approach is proving to be practically unworkable.and some have even suggested that winter storm has threatened the usefulness of the dollar in international transactions.see generally id.t his explosion of writs creates an additional threat to the dollar as the world primary reserve currency and new york standing as a center of international banking and finance.see also lawrence newman david zaslowsky,is there finally a backlash against rule b attachments,w hen lawyers are advising their clients that the best way to avoid rule b attachments is to conduct maritime and perhaps other transactions in a currency other than dollars,there are emerging risks of a significant reduction in the use of the dollar as the dominant currency of international commerce.
the unforeseen consequences of winter storm have been significant.according to amicus curiae the clearing house association whose members are abn amro bank bank of america,national association the bank of new york mellon citibank,national association deutsche bank trust company americas hsbc bank usa,national association jpmorgan chase bank,national association ubs ag bank national association and wells fargo bank,national association from october,to january,alone maritime plaintiffs filed lawsuits seeking to attach a total of billion.these lawsuits constituted of all lawsuits filed in the southern district,and the resulting maritime writs only add to the burden of to writs already served daily on the district banks.amicus br.judge scheindlin recently outlined the effect of winter storm on international banks located in new york 
this court was recently informed that,currently,leading new york banks receive numerous new attachment orders and over supplemental services of existing orders each day.this is confirmed by the striking surge in maritime attachment requests in this district,which now comprise approximately one third of all cases filed in the southern district of new york.as a consequence,new york banks have hired additional staff,and suffer considerable expenses,to process the attachments.the sheer volume leads to many false hits of funds subject to attachment,which has allegedly introduced significant uncertainty into the international funds transfer process.

our holding in winter storm not only introduced uncertainty into the international funds transfer process,but also undermined the efficiency of new york international funds transfer business.as the federal reserve bank of new york noted in its amicus curiae brief in support of the motion for rehearing en banc by the defendant in winter storm,efficiency is fostered by protecting the intermediary banks justice is fostered by expressly telling litigants where the process should be served winter storm disrupt ed this balance and threaten ed the efficiency of funds transfer systems,perhaps including fedwire.amicus br.of federal reserve bank of new york,winter storm.undermining the efficiency and certainty of fund transfers in new york could,if left uncorrected,discourage transactions and damage new york standing as an international financial center.see,peb commentary winter storm and its progeny have had a far greater,and damaging,potential impact on and foreign banks located in new york than might have been anticipated.newman zaslowsky,at.
overturning winter storm will dramatically affect the law of maritime attachments in our circuit,but we must not overstate the practical effect of our holding in this case.since we decided winter storm,decisions in both our court and in the southern district of new york have cabined winter storm to minimize its effects on the courts and banks of new york without overturning winter storm directly.see,stx panocean uk glory wealth shipping pte,cir cala rosa,d at marco polo shipping.pte supakit prods,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.although these cases have further complicated the law of rule b attachments,they have also limited the reach of winter storm and thus necessarily limited the effect of our decision in the instant case.
in stx panocean,we recently held that by merely registering as a domestic corporation with the new york secretary of state,a defendant is found within the district for the purposes of rule b attachment.at.because rule b provides for attachment of defendant property that is found within the district only if the defendant itself is not found within the district,our ruling in stx panocean allows an international firm to avoid having its property including property other than efts attached simply by registering as a domestic corporation in new york state.although the implications of stx panocean are unknown,it would not be surprising if many international firms that engage in transactions register in new york state to avoid attachment of their property.
in cala rosa,judge scheindlin denied a maritime plaintiff request for continuous service of an attachment on banks a decision that,if upheld on appeal,would likely further limit the usefulness of attachments of efts.d at.in light of our decision in reibor international cargo carriers,cir,which held that an attachment is void unless a garnishee actually possesses defendant property when the attachment is served,and the instantaneous nature of most efts,judge scheindlin decision renders many maritime attachments effectively unenforceable.as judge scheindlin explained 
many courts,including this one,have noted that in light of reibor a continuous service provision is necessary,in practice,to allow attachment of efts.that is no doubt true.but reibor provides the proper response to this concern the new york rule works,to be sure,to the detriment of an attaching creditor,but that is simply the way the law was intended to operate.
many courts have also expressed concern that in the absence of a continuing service provision,plaintiffs will post process servers at bank offices around the clock in an attempt to capture efts at the precise moment of their arrival.i agree that this is likely and that this would be highly disruptive to new york banks.accordingly,i decline to specially appoint any process servers.as a result,pursuant to rule b d ii,i authorize only the united states marshals to serve the process and any supplemental process.
plaintiff expresses concern that this will impose an undue burden on the united states marshals.plaintiff concern,though appreciated,is overstated nothing requires the marshals to repetitively serve the banks with attachment orders around the clock.further,plaintiff duty to bear the costs of processes will help limit the marshals workload.
cala rosa,d at footnotes omitted quoting reibor,at.a decision rejecting a continuous service provision in the case of the attachment of efts would arguably limit the reach of winter storm.
finally,in marco polo,judge koeltl recently required a plausible showing that defendant funds were actually passing through southern district of new york,as opposed to hypothetically passing through the southern district.see wl,at,dist.lexis,at.judge koeltl noted that t he fact that the defendant is still actively doing business and at some point in the past has conducted its business in united states dollars may mean that the defendant could transfer funds through a new york bank in the future,but it hardly makes it plausible that it actually will,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.by requiring more than a hunch to obtain an attachment,judge koeltl further limited the usefulness of attachment of efts sanctioned by winter storm.
taken together,these cases may have limited the practical usefulness of our holding in winter storm to plaintiffs and thus may also have reduced the practical effects of overturning that decision.this is not to say that we take our decision to overturn winter storm lightly but,rather,that we seek to allay any concerns that the decision in this case is wholly unanticipated,surprising,or disruptive to ongoing financial practices.in doing so,we recognize a trend toward limiting maritime attachments of efts in our circuit and take this opportunity to definitively untangle the doctrinal knot created by winter storm and its progeny.
background 
in this action,plaintiff the shipping corporation of india,sci or plaintiff appeals from a june,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,judge insofar as it vacated portions of an order of maritime attachment and garnishment the attachment entered by the district court on may,pursuant to rule specifically,the june order vacated the attachment of efts sent from third parties not involved in this litigation to defendant jaldhi overseas pte jaldhi or defendant in the amount of.
jaldhi from the same june,order insofar as it denied jaldhi motion for for various counterclaims to be arbitrated in london on the ground that sci,as an alleged instrumentality of the government of india,was entitled to immunity from attachment under the foreign sovereign immunity act,fsia.
on appeal,the parties raise the following issues whether efts of which a defendant is the beneficiary are attachable property of that defendant under our decisions in winter storm,aqua stoli,and consub delaware,and whether sci is entitled to immunity under the fsia from attachment of security for jaldhi counterclaims to be arbitrated in london.
the relevant factual and procedural history is as follows.in march,sci chartered its vessel rishikesh the vessel to defendant to transport iron ore from india to china specifically,the charter provided that sci was to deliver the vessel to jaldhi on march,with hull,machinery,and equipment in a thoroughly efficient state.the vessel was delivered to jaldhi on march,in compliance with the terms of the charter.while in port in kolkata,india the next day,a crane on board the vessel collapsed,killing the crane operator,halting cargo operations,and causing jaldhi to place the vessel off hire,to suspend the charter.
on may,sci issued an invoice to jaldhi seeking payment of jaldhi unpaid balance of.after not receiving payment,sci filed a complaint in the district court seeking an ex parte maritime attachment pursuant to rule b of the admiralty rules on may,for the balance,interest,and attorneys fees for a total of.according to sci,the vessel came back on hire on april,when its cranes passed safety inspections,and therefore jaldhi owes payments under the charter from that date forward.on may,the district court entered an ex parte order of maritime attachment and garnishment in the amount of and noted in its order that the attachment applied 
against all tangible or intangible property belonging to,claimed by or being held for the defendant by any garnishees within this district,including but not limited to electronic fund transfers originated by,payable to,or otherwise for the benefit of defendant,whether to or from the garnishee banks or any other electronic funds transfers 
sci then filed an amended complaint on may,to adjust the amount attached to reflect additional fees and a payment from jaldhi to sci,bringing the total attachment to.on may,jaldhi filed a motion to vacate the attachment pursuant to rule e of the admiralty rules and sought against sci to cover any damages resulting from the crane accident.by that date,sci had attached efts in the amount of.efts where defendant was the beneficiary comprised of the total amount attached,with the remainder consisting of efts where defendant was the originator the parties then worked together to release any funds attached in excess of the amount provided in the attachment order.
in a memorandum order dated june,judge rakoff vacated his may,attachment order insofar as it applied to efts of which defendant was the beneficiary.see shipping of india,jaldhi overseas pte,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at june.judge rakoff based his decision to vacate the attachment order on his own prior decision in seamar shipping kremikovtzi trade,d,in which he had concluded that efts en route to a defendant were not attachable under rule see shipping of india,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.he also concluded that sci was entitled to sovereign immunity under the fsia,although he did not make any specific findings regarding sci sovereign status,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.noting,however,that there were differing opinions among judges of the southern district of new york regarding the attachment of efts where the defendant is the beneficiary of the transfer,judge rakoff certified the matter for appellate review pursuant to b,wl,at,dist.lexis,at because the determination to vacate the attachment clearly involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,and because an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,the court hereby certifies the vacatur for interlocutory appeal internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
discussion 
standard of review 
we generally review a district court decision to vacate a maritime attachment for abuse of discretion.see,consub,at sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal quotation marks,citation,and alterations omitted emphasis added.because the district court made a threshold ruling of law before exercising its discretion,our review is de novo.see aqua stoli,at.
efts as attachable property 
rule b of the admiralty rules permits attachment of the defendant tangible or intangible personal property.supp.b a from a plain reading of the text,it is clear that to attach an eft under rule b,the eft must both be tangible or intangible property and be the defendant.id.
before we can reach the question presented squarely in this appeal whether an eft is defendant property when defendant is the beneficiary of that eft we must first consider the threshold issue of whether efts are indeed defendant property subject at all to attachment under the admiralty rules.we first held that efts were in fact attachable property under rule b seven years ago in winter storm.although we have subsequently applied winter storm in numerous cases,see,consub,aqua stoli,we now conclude,as noted earlier,that winter storm was erroneously decided and should no longer be binding precedent in this circuit.
we readily acknowledge that a panel of our court is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court,united states wilkerson,cir,and thus that it would ordinarily be neither appropriate nor possible for us to reverse an existing circuit precedent.in this case,however,we have circulated this opinion to all active members of this court prior to filing and have received no objection.see,united states crosby,cir jacobson fireman fund ins,cir 
our reasons for reversing a relatively recent case are twofold.first,and most importantly,we conclude that the holding in winter storm erroneously relied on daccarett,to conclude that efts are attachable property.winter storm,at.second,as noted above,the effects of winter storm on the federal courts and international banks in new york are too significant to let this error go uncorrected simply to avoid overturning a recent precedent.
beginning in winter storm,we have held that eft funds in the hands of an intermediary bank are subject to admiralty rule b attachment.id.at.in that case,plaintiff sought to attach an eft that originated in defendant account with the bank of ayudhya based in bangkok,thailand while it was en route to a third party who maintained an account with the royal bank of scotland in london.id.at.the eft passed through the bank of new york the intermediary bank which is headquartered in manhattan.id.the district court vacated the attachment of the eft because,in its view,the eft was not property within the meaning of rule id.at.specifically,she concluded that there was no federal law on point and that state law new york version of the uniform commercial code forbade courts from attaching funds in an intermediary bank.see see also a.
on appeal,a panel of our court concluded that relevant federal law indicated that efts were indeed property that could be attached in a rule b proceeding and therefore recourse to state law was unnecessary.winter storm,at.in a comprehensive opinion,judge haight,sitting by designation,offered three reasons to support this decision.
first,the panel observed that rule b itself which covers defendant tangible or intangible personal property.supp.b a is written in very broad language.it is difficult to imagine words more broadly inclusive than tangible or intangible.the phrase is the secular equivalent of the creed reference to the maker of all there is,seen and unseen.winter storm,at.this broad language,the panel reasoned,sweeps sufficiently far to encompass even ephemeral efts.
second,the panel stated that t here is no question that federal admiralty law regards a defendant bank account as property subject to maritime attachment under rule id.emphasis added.by extension,the panel reasoned,we are un able to discern in admiralty law or elsewhere a basis for regarding the defendant funds in the intermediary bank hands prior to their electronic transfer to the beneficiary as anything other than the funds held by the intermediary bank for the account of the defendant.id.since a defendant bank account was attachable property,the panel reasoned,the effectively equivalent efts should also be attachable property of the defendant.
third,the panel observed that in daccarett we had upheld the seizure of efts that passed through intermediary banks in new york city,where the efts were used by a colombian criminal cartel to transfer funds from accounts in luxembourg to accounts in panama and colombia.at,see also id.at holding that an eft while it takes the form of a bank credit at an intermediary bank is clearly a seizable res under the forfeiture statutes.the seizures in that criminal case were made pursuant to,a penal statute which borrows the procedures for asserting maritime liens under admiralty rule the panel reasoned that there was no principled basis for applying the procedures outlined in admiralty rule c to a seizure of an eft in a forfeiture action,but not to a maritime attachment under rule winter storm,at.
relying on these three reasons each of which was based on federal law the winter storm panel concluded that eft funds in the hands of an intermediary bank may be attached pursuant to admiralty rule b a.id.accordingly,the panel had no occasion to look to state law,as judge scheindlin had done,to determine whether efts were attachable id.
upon further consideration,we find winter storm reasons unpersuasive and its consequences untenable.most importantly,we find that winter storm reliance on daccarett was misplaced.daccarett did not decide that the originator or beneficiary of an eft had a property interest in the eft it held only that funds traceable to an illegal activity were subject to forfeiture under.see aqua stoli,at because daccarett was a forfeiture case,its holding that efts are attachable assets does not answer the more salient question of whose assets they are while in transit.under the forfeiture laws,funds can be seized even if they do not constitute property of the defendant because no property right shall exist in all moneys traceable to a violation of title,chapter,subchapter i of the united states code.a.to be eligible for forfeiture,the efts needed only to be traceable to the illegal activities,and thus the court in daccarett was required only to assess whether the efts in that case were in fact traceable to illegal activities.no further inquiry into the identity of the owner of the efts was necessary indeed,that question was wholly irrelevant.
for maritime attachments under rule b,however,the question of ownership is critical.as a remedy quasi in rem,the validity of a rule b attachment depends entirely on the determination that the res at issue is the property of the defendant at the moment the res is attached.see,transportes navieros y terrestres de fairmount heavy transp,cir.because a requirement of rule b attachments is that the defendant is not found within the district,the res is the only means by which a court can obtain jurisdiction over the defendant if the res is not the property of the defendant,then the court lacks jurisdiction.in contrast,civil forfeiture is a remedy in rem.in rem jurisdiction is based on the theory that the thing is itself treated as the offender and made the defendant by name or description.california deep sea research,d.thus,for in rem remedies such as forfeitures,ownership of the res is irrelevant,as the court has personal jurisdiction regardless of who owns the res at issue.although not considered by the winter storm panel,this distinction provides,in our view,a principled basis for allowing efts to be subject to forfeiture but not attachment.in sum,daccarett provides no persuasive guidance on the validity of rule b attachments of efts and should not serve as the foundation for a rule that allows the attachment of efts under rule 
without the support of daccarett,we are unpersuaded that either the text of rule b or our past maritime holdings relating to defendants bank accounts compel us to conclude as a matter of federal law that an eft is defendant personal property.supp.b a emphasis added.moreover,we are unaware of any historical rationale that justifies the extension of federal maritime common law to support the rule b practices that have taken place under the rule of winter storm.one of the primary grounds for the historical development of rule b attachments was that a ship may be here today and gone tomorrow.polar shipping oriental shipping,cir see also schiffahartsgesellschaft leonhardt bottacchi de navegacion,cir noting that a relevant commercial consideration relating to rule b practices is that a ship ability to dock,unload cargo,and fill its hold with goods intended for another destination all within twenty four hours imposes tremendo
