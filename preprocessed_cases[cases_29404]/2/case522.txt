in this admiralty case,plaintiff charles desmond tucker seeks to recover for the death of his minor son,charles justin tucker,who was killed in a boating collision.plaintiff tucker appeals from the district court order precluding him from recovering loss of society damages in his wrongful death action under general maritime law.after review and oral argument,we affirm.
background 
charles justin tucker was traveling on a wellcraft power boat when his boat collided with a pearson sailboat operated by defendants frank and judy fearn the fearns in alabama territorial waters.charles justin tucker died as a result of injuries received in this boating collision.
because the collision occurred in territorial waters,plaintiff charles desmond tucker tucker brought this wrongful death action against the fearns under general maritime law.tucker sought to recover nonpecuniary damages,in the form of loss of society damages,under general maritime law tucker also brought state law claims under alabama wrongful death statute.
the fearns moved to strike tucker general maritime claim for nonpecuniary damages because he was not financially dependent on his deceased minor son.the district court entered an order granting the fearns motion to strike tucker claim for nonpecuniary damages and thereby limiting tucker potential recovery under general maritime law to pecuniary damages for the loss of his minor son.subsequently,the district court certified that this order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.on september,this court granted tucker petition for interlocutory review under b.
in this interlocutory appeal,the only issue is whether tucker,as a nondependent parent,may recover loss of society damages for the wrongful death of his minor child under general maritime law for the reasons outlined below,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that loss of society damages are not recoverable by tucker in a wrongful death action under general maritime law.
ii.discussion 
to guide our analysis of this issue,we first consider the fundamental principles of admiralty law set forth by the supreme court in moragne states marine lines,d,and then in mobil oil higginbotham,d,and miles apex marine,d.
moragne wrongful death under general maritime law 
in moragne,the supreme court overruled its earlier decision in the harrisburg and created a wrongful death action under general maritime law for deaths occurring in state territorial waters in doing so,the supreme court noted that congress had enacted legislation to cover some but not all types of maritime wrongful deaths.id.at.specifically,the death on the high seas act dohsa had created a wrongful death action but only for all persons killed on the high seas.et.similarly,the jones act provided only seamen a right of recovery against their employers for negligence resulting in injury or death.moragne,at.the supreme court observed,however,that congress had not yet provided a statutory right of action for wrongful deaths occurring in state territorial waters moragne,at.the supreme court reasoned that this was because congress saw no need for such a federal statute because the states historically provided remedies for deaths occurring in their territorial waters.id.at.thus,the supreme court concluded that congress failure to extend dohsa to cover such deaths primarily reflected the lack of necessity for coverage by a federal statute.id.at.see also miles,at.
the supreme court in moragne then discussed at length how a transformation in maritime law had begun in and that the emergence of the strict liability claim of unseaworthiness in federal maritime law had created inconsistencies in recovery for deaths on the high seas versus recovery for deaths on territorial waters under state statutes.see moragne,at.thus,the supreme court in moragne sought to eliminate these inconsistencies and render maritime wrongful death law uniform by creating a general maritime wrongful death action applicable in all waters,including state territorial waters.see id.at.
in doing so in moragne,the supreme court relied to a large extent on its determination that congress enacted the jones act and dohsa to further the constitutionally based principle that federal admiralty law should be a system of law coextensive with,and operating uniformly in,the whole country.id.at.citation omitted.the supreme court further reasoned that o ur recognition of a right to recover for wrongful death under general maritime law will assure uniform vindication of federal policies.id.at.
the supreme court conclusion in moragne also was motivated,in part,by the maritime principle that special solicitude be given for the welfare of those men who undertook to venture upon hazardous and unpredictable sea voyages.id.at.the supreme court observed that federal maritime law,as it,actually disadvantaged jones act seamen.moragne,at.because the jones act preempts state law remedies for the death or injury of a seaman,the supreme court remarked that the strangest anomaly in maritime law was that a jones act seamen is provided no remedy for death caused by unseaworthiness within territorial waters,while a nonseaman does have such a remedy when allowed by a state statute.id.at.emphasis added.thus,the supreme court recognition of a wrongful death action under general maritime law served to remedy a disparity for seamen that had existed prior to moragne.see miles,at.in moragne,the supreme court did not set forth the scope of the remedies available in a wrongful death action under general maritime law but left such development for future litigation.moragne,at.
higginbotham no loss of society damages under dohsa 
since moragne,the supreme court has held that loss of society damages are not recoverable under dohsa.see higginbotham,d.
when the supreme court decided higginbotham,dohsa provided that recovery shall be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is brought.emphasis added the issue in higginbotham was whether the explicit use of the term pecuniary loss implied that nonpecuniary damages were not available under dohsa.higginbotham,at.although the supreme court recognized that dohsa does not address every issue of law,when it does speak directly to a question,the courts are not free to supplement congress answer so thoroughly that dohsa becomes meaningless.id.at.the supreme court thus concluded that congress had limited survivors to recovery of their pecuniary losses.id.at.
miles no loss of society damages for seamen under jones act or general maritime law 
in miles,a unanimous supreme court also addressed whether recovery for loss of society damages was available for seamen under the jones act based on negligence and in a general maritime action based on unseaworthiness.to aid its analysis of these issues,the supreme court described moragne at length because it exemplifies the fundamental principles that guide d the court decision.miles,at.drawing from moragne,the supreme court in miles emphasized the need to look to legislative enactments for policy guidance and achieve the uniform vindication of such policies,stating as follows 
we no longer live in an area when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death congress and the states have legislated extensively in these areas.in this era,an admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.we may supplement these statutory remedies where doing so would achieve the uniform vindication of such policies consistent with our constitutional mandate,but we must also keep strictly within the limits imposed by congress.
miles,at.emphasis added.
in miles,the supreme court first considered whether loss of society damages were recoverable under the jones act.after analyzing the legislative history of the jones act,the supreme court determined that congress must have intended to incorporate the pecuniary limitation on damages.id.at.thus,the supreme court held that t here is no recovery fo
