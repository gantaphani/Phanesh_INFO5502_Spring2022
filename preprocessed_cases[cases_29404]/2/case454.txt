we consider the apportionment of a salvage award that was given to participating crew members but not to the owner of the salving vessel.the right to a salvage award for saving a ship dates back for centuries.some have traced the right back to the ancient rhodians,whose maritime accomplishments began to reach their height in the late fourth century and who are thought by some to be the earliest culture to have devised a system of maritime law the manuscript known as the rhodian,which in its extant form has been dated to about includes provisions awarding the fifth part of what he saves to one who saves a ship or its cargo,and awarding to the finder of sunken gold or silver one half,one third,or one tenth of its value,depending on the depth from which it was brought up.the rhodian walter ashburner ed,whatever its origin,the doctrine of the salvor right to be rewarded for voluntary rescue service found its way into roman law and thence into the laws of oleron,the french precursor of english maritime law benedict on admiralty,martin norris,ed.the doctrine of salvage has been part of our admiralty law since early in our nation history.see,story strettel,dall.dannery,dall.
in expounding this doctrine,the supreme court has said that s alvage is the compensation allowed to persons by whose assistance a ship or her cargo has been saved,in whole or in part,from impending peril on the sea.the blackwall,wall.a salvor is a person who,without any particular relation to the ship in distress,proffers useful service and gives it as a volunteer adventurer without any contract that connected him with the duty of employing himself for the preservation of the vessel.the clarita,wall.
the reasons for giving a salvage award are straightforward salvage is a reward for perilous services,and an inducement to seamen and others to readily engage in such undertakings and assist in saving life and property.the flottbek,cir.that incentive structure is preserved by giving an award only where salvage is successful,and by denying one where the salvors would have been paid in any case.and just as the salvors should be rewarded for putting themselves in harm way to save a ship,it has been held that the owner of the salving vessel should also be rewarded for putting an expensive ship at risk.see,the blackwall,at.beyond doubt remuneration for salvage service is awarded to the owners of vessels on account of the danger to which the service exposes their property,and the risk which they run of loss in suffering their vessels to engage in such perilous undertakings.
luther bartholomew,zeljiko brcic,jim haithcock,and james kristovich appellees were employed by crowley marine services,cms and were crew members on cms tug sea voyager when it was called to the aid of another cms tug,the sea vixen,on january,in the gulf of alaska.the sea vixen,pulling a barge with short tons of urea fertilizer owned by unocal,had caught fire,and the tug master and crew had been evacuated.the sea voyager arrived about fourteen hours after being summoned by cms,and in about an hour,the appellees,acting by direction of their vessel master,attached the endangered tug to theirs by a tow line.during this operation,bartholomew and kristovich jumped from their tug to the sea vixen and back,at what the district court called grave risk of harm.the sea voyager pulled the sea vixen towards valdez,and a day and a half later,the sea vixen was transferred to another cms tug.during the journey,the fire on the sea vixen burned out.
cms is a marine transportation company that lists salvage work among the services it offers to its clients.in performing this salvage of the sea vixen,the appellee crewmen used an emergency tow package that was included in the sea voyager gear precisely because cms outfits its ships to do salvage work.cms billed unocal for routine towing services,but not for salvage work,and neither cms nor unocal gave any salvage award to the appellees.a clause in the appellees employment contract provided that w henever the tug or those acting on its behalf waive the rights to claim salvage,such waiver shall be construed as a waiver made on behalf of the crew and shall be binding upon all of its members.
the appellees sued cms for salvage in district court.the appellees asserted a right to a salvage award for their successful efforts to secure,and bring to safety,the sea vixen and its barge loaded with unocal fertilizer.cms defended on an array of grounds,including that the appellees had done no more than perform their duties as employees of cms,which was engaged in salvage business,and also that cms failure to bill unocal for salvage was an effective waiver that applied,through the clause in the employment contract,to the appellees.the district court found to the contrary that the appellees had performed salvage work of a moderate order,for which they were entitled to an award,and that cms failure to bill unocal for salvage did not effect a waiver of the appellees salvage rights.the district court calculated the value of the sea vixen,the barge,the fertilizer,and the fuel at,and awarded of that sum to the appellees and to richard swain,the master of the sea voyager.the district court award allowed no compensation to cms as owner of the salving vessel.
cms appealed,arguing that the appellees were not entitled to a salvage award because they were required under the terms of their employment contract to perform salvage work that the failure to bill unocal waived any salvage claim and that if a salvage award were due,then cms,as owner of the tug that performed the salvage operation,should have a share of the award,and also that all crew members of the salving vessel were entitled to a share of the award,with any unclaimed share accruing to the benefit of cms as owner of the salvaged vessel.
the crew of the sea voyager were employed under a collective bargaining agreement cba between cms and the inlandboatmen union.the cba included a provision setting out the tasks of vessels stationed at or regularly assigned to valdez,alaska,as was the sea voyager.the provision stated that such v essels will be utilized to assist tankers and other vessels into and away from the docks,escort vessels and perform all other activities involved in docking and undocking of vessels.they may also be called upon to perform work,oil spill cleanup work,boom deployment and retrieval,and salvage work.the cba did not otherwise address the appellees responsibility for salvage work,nor did it specify any particular basis for determining how the appellees would be paid for such work.
as the district court explained,this provision in the cba,by itself,did not bar the appellees from receiving a salvage award.although the cba listed salvage work among the many activities that cms vessels could be called upon to perform,the cba made no express provision for cms employees to perform salvage work.such a provision is the only way to substitute a seaman wages for a salvage award.an employer may not bar such an award simply by including salvage work among the ship services,without more.
the situation would not differ if the provision quoted above had provided that the seamen,rather than the vessel,could be called upon to perform salvage work.a salvage award would have been barred if the agreement had specified a wage rate that applies whether the salvage operation succeeds or fails.but under our admiralty law,a successful salvage operation will justify an award to the salvors,unless they would have been paid regardless of their success.see evanow neptune,cir a no cure,no pay contract is generally presumed unless the one asserting that the contract displaces a pure salvage claim proves that the contract was payable at any event.citations omitted.if an employer intends that employees will be paid their normal hourly wage for such work,the employment contract must say so expressly.absent a special provision on remuneration for salvage,the contract can not negate the policy of giving an award.see the camanche,wall.n othing short of a contract to pay a given sum for the services to be rendered,or a binding engagement to pay at all events,whether succ
