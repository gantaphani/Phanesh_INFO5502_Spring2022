memorandum order 
in june,plaintiff richard harrell was tubing on the missouri river near atchison,kansas when he alided with a submerged buoy placed in the river by the united states coast guard,resulting in serious injury to harrell.thereafter,plaintiffs filed suit under the suits in admiralty act saa.et,alleging that the united states negligently failed to maintain the buoy in proper condition and failed to warn mariners that the buoy had become a hazard to navigation.this matter is presently before the court on defendant motion to dismiss plaintiffs action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction doc.and plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to liability doc.as explained in more detail below,the court concludes that the actions of the coast guard were discretionary functions exempt from saa liability and,thus,grants defendants motion to dismiss.plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,then,is rendered moot.
the united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit unless it waives its sovereign immunity and consents to be sued.see,united states thompson.absent express waiver of sovereign immunity,federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over suits against the united states.united states sherwood.in the suits in admiralty act saa,the united states waives its sovereign immunity from suit for maritime torts committed by its agents.see.tew united states,cir.the saa contains no express exceptions to the waiver of sovereign immunity.in contrast,the federal tort claims act ftca,b,which waives sovereign immunity for tort claims against the united states,contains an express exception with respect to claims based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government.tew,at quoting a.the tenth circuit has held that a similar discretionary function exception is to be implied into the saa.see id.
the supreme court has set forth a test to determine whether conduct is encompassed by the discretionary function exception and thereby immunized from saa liability.see berkovitz united states,d ftca context thames shipyard repair united states,cir applying berkovitz test in saa context.the court must first consider whether the challenged conduct was discretionary,meaning whether it was a matter of judgment or choice for the acting employee.see lopez united states,cir citing berkovitz,at.if the court finds that it was,the court must then consider whether it was the type of decision the discretionary function exception was designed to protect,namely one requiring the exercise of judgment based on considerations of public policy.see id.citing berkovitz,at.
plaintiffs negligent claim 
to prevail on the first prong of the berkovitz test,plaintiffs must demonstrate that the challenged conduct involved no element of judgment or choice.see elder united states,cir.in that regard,plaintiffs must show that the coast guard violated a federal statute,regulation,or policy that is both specific and mandatory.see id.citing aragon united states,cir.plaintiffs direct the court to no statute,regulation or policy mandating that the coast guard maintain buoys or any other aids to navigation in any particular manner.in fact,federal statutes make the maintenance of aids to navigation entirely discretionary.see in order to aid navigation and to prevent disasters,collisions,and wrecks of vessels and aircraft,the coast guard may establish,maintain,and operate aids to maritime navigation.emphasis added.congress,then,has not imposed on the coast guard a mandatory duty to maintain buoys.similarly,applicable coast guard regulations reserve to the agency considerable discretion in maintaining aids to navigation 
although aids to navigation are maintained to a reasonable degree of reliability,the rigors of the marine environment and various equipment failures do cause discrepancies on occasion.
the coast guard makes reasonable efforts to inform the navigator of known discrepancies,and to correct them within a reasonable period of time,depending upon resources available.
f g.certainly,nothing in the regulations requires the coast guard to service a buoy within a specific period of time.finally,nothing in the coast guard internal aid to navigation manual limits the coast guard discretion with respect to the maintenance of buoys because no statute,regulation or policy specifically prescribed a course of action for the coast guard to follow with respect to servicing the buoy,the challenged conduct is discretionary under the first prong of the berkovitz test.see elder,at see also smith united states,d,coast guard conduct regarding maintenance of an aid to navigation involves an element of judgment or choice.
having concluded that decisions regarding the service and maintenance of the buoy involved discretionary judgment,the court turns to the second prong of the berkovitz test and considers whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.see elder,at.the supreme court clarified the second prong of the berkovitz test in united states gaubert,d.see lopez,at citing gaubert,at.when making the second inquiry,the court is not to consider the subjective intent of the particular actor or whether he or she was animated by a concern for public policy.id.citing gaubert,at.rather,the court must consider whether the nature of the actions taken implicate public policy concerns,or are susceptible to policy analysis.id.citing gaubert,at.the court need not find that a government employee made a conscious decision regarding policy considerations in order to satisfy the second prong of the berkovitz test.see id.citing kiehn united states,cir.the pertinent inquiry is whether the decision implicates the exercise of a policy judgment of a social,economic,or political nature.see elder,at citing duke dep t of agriculture,cir.
the court readily concludes that the coast guard decisions concerning whether and when to service the buoy at issue in this case were.as suggested in the pertinent regulation,and as reflected in the record before the court,decisions about whether and when to service the buoy with which harrell allided turn on the availability and allocation of agency resources
