background 
yii shipping,a bahamian cargo shipping company,contracted with merrill stevens for repairs of its ship,yeocomico ii.the ship traveled between port dania,florida and various ports in the bahamas.the repairs were necessary in order to bring the ship into compliance with united states coast guard regulations,without which the ship could not enter the united states.yii shipping,by and through its president lisbon higgs,retained the services of roy mackeen of bahamas marine international.higgs instructed mackeen to do what it takes to bring the ship into compliance with the coast guard regulations.
some time after merrill stevens began repair work on the ship,mackeen signed the contract,which listed the repair work to be done.on the reverse side,the contract contained the exculpatory clauses,paragraphs and,that are at issue in this case the exculpatory clauses state the following 
paragraph.contractor undertakes to perform the servicing and haul and launch of the vessel,provide berthage,wharfage,towage,and other services and facilities only upon condition that it shall not be liable,directly or indirectly,in tort or contract except as expressly warranted,or otherwise to owner,the vessel,its charterers,underwriters,or any of their agents,servants or employees,or persons to whom they may be responsible,for any personal injury,death,or damage to the vessel,its cargo,equipment or movable stores,or for any consequences thereof,unless such personal injury,death or property damage,is caused by contractor negligence,which negligence shall not be presumed but must be affirmatively established.in no event,including the negligence gross negligence breach of contract,including express warranties,of contractor,shall contractor aggregate liability to all such parties in interest for personal injury,death,or damage sustained by them,or any other type of damage exceed the sum of,and in no event shall contractor be liable to any extent to the vessel,owner,charterers underwriters,for the cost of defending any claims asserted by third parties,including attorney fees,whether such actions shall be commenced by its employees or others.no claim for damages for negligence or otherwise shall be valid unless such claim is presented to contractor within sixty days after delivery of the vessel or completion of the servicing,whichever first occurs.all limitations on contractor liability which are contained in this work order shall remain in full force and effect following delivery of the vessel to owner.
paragraph.in no event shall contractor be liable to any person for incidental or consequential damages,for any breach of contract or for any negligence on the part of contractor which might have given rise thereto.
some time after the contract was signed and the repair work commenced,a fire was caused by two merrill stevens workers while they were performing welding work.the fire damaged the ship accommodation houses.in its findings i,the district court determined that the fire was a proximate result of merrill stevens negligence.as a result of the fire an additional eight weeks to repair the damage to the accommodation houses was necessary during the period of repair for the fire damage the ship was out of service.while out of service,yii shipping claimed that it had lost certain shipping routes to competitors that it could not reclaim when the repairs were completed.
merrill stevens commenced this action on june,claiming that yii shipping failed to pay the balance for the repair work,and sued for prejudgment interest of percent,as provided by the contract.they also claimed that paragraphs and of the contract precluded yii shipping recovery for incidental or consequential damages.yii shipping claimed that the contract terms were void since merrill stevens breached the contract by negligently setting fire to the ship.additionally,yii shipping claimed that paragraphs and of the contract were ambiguous and,thus,unenforceable.therefore,yii shipping for the fire damage to the ship,lost profits sustained while the ship underwent an additional eight weeks of repair,and lost profits sustained after the ship returned to service.
in its findings i,the district court found that the fire was caused by merrill stevens negligence and as a proximate result of the fire,the ship had to undergo an additional eight weeks of repair for the damaged accommodation houses.finding paragraphs and unambiguous,the district court awarded yii shipping in damages for the fire damage,and in damages resulting from the loss of use of the ship during the eight weeks of repairs.
the district court denied yii shipping claim for lost profits after the ship returned to service for failure to prove the lost profits to a reasonable certainty.merrill stevens was awarded prejudgment interest of percent,as specified by the contract.both parties moved for reconsideration and amendment.
upon reconsideration,the district court issued its findings ii,which reversed,in part,its findings i by finding paragraphs and of the contract ambiguous.accordingly,the district court determined that paragraphs and would be read against the drafter,merrill stevens.the district court affirmed the december order awarding merrill stevens prejudgment interest of percent.both parties appealed to this court.
there are four issues on appeal whether the contract was unambiguous and thus enforceable,whether the district court erred in awarding yii shipping damages for the fire damage and damages for loss of use of the ship during the eight weeks of repair,whether the district court erroneously failed to award yii shipping damages for lost profits after the ship was back in service,and whether the district court erred by awarding merrill stevens prejudgment interest of percent.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.

iii.discussion 
ambiguity of paragraphs and 
the first issue on appeal is whether the limited liability clauses,paragraphs and,of the contract,are unambiguous,and thus enforceable.a limited liability clause is enforceable if it satisfies a test set forth in diesel repower islander investments,cir.first,the limited liability clause must clearly and unequivocally indicate the parties intention.second,the limitation must not absolve the repairer of all liability and must still provide a deterrent to negligence
