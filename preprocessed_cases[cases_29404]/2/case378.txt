in this admiralty case,we are asked to review the district court finding that a barge owner lost profits while repairing several barges damaged in towing accidents.we are also asked to review the district court award of prejudgment interest on those lost profits.finding no clear error in the district court fact finding,and no abuse of discretion in the award of prejudgment interest,we affirm.
background 
in,inland river towing company inland contracted with conagra,doing business as peavey barge lines peavey,to tow the large fleet of barges peavey operates on the inland rivers of the united states.on six occasions between april and june,barges towed by inland were damaged in accidents.peavey had the barges repaired at various times between february and july.in november,peavey sued inland to recover for cargo damage caused by the accidents,the repair costs of all barges,and damages for of the barges.only the last claim is at issue in this appeal.
the district court conducted a bench trial.to prove that it suffered damages,peavey called two power,peavey of operations and jay johnston,of freight grain merchandising.power and johnston testified that the barge market was very active between february and july,that demand for barges exceeded supply,that peavey entire fleet of available barges was always in use to the extent possible,and that peavey had no spare barges that they could substitute without losing revenue.
power oversaw barge maintenance,repair,and dispatching,and had personal knowledge of the operation of peavey entire fleet.he testified that demand for barges between february and july was very high and the highest level of demand that he had seen during his years in the river industry.tr.at.he testified that peavey worked as fast as its system allowed to keep all available barges ready for use,because the market was contributing at a level far exceeding fixed costs,so the faster we could move the barges after they completed and repaired and were ready for their next loading,it just created more of an opportunity to add to our bottom line.id.at.power admitted there were times,in his eight years with peavey,that peavey idled some barges because of low demand.but he stated that february to july was not one of those periods.during those eighteen months,peavey had no spare barges to take the place of damaged barges,and it used its available barges to the full extent possible.
johnston sold barge use to customers and also had personal knowledge of the demand for peavey barges.in addition,johnston had knowledge of the general market demand for barges,since he checked on peavey competitors on a constant basis.johnston testified about a relationship between the going freight rates on the river,and demand for barges.he explained that whenever the freight rates were high,the demand for barges was high.based on his personal knowledge of peavey daily barge demand,and his review of records showing the average freight rates,johnston testified that demand for barges between february and july was extremely high and the highest period he had seen in many years.id.at.he testified that as soon as peavey unloaded a barge,it easily resold the barge use to another customer.johnston indicated that demand for barges exceeded the available supply,that peavey had no idle barges,and it could have sold the use of more barges if they had been available.
on,both power and johnston admitted that they did know the total number of barges peavey operated between february and july,or the total number of freight commitments peavey had during that period.they also admitted the possibility that bought in freight had been substituted for the damaged barges.bought in freight referred to barge use peavey purchased as a commodity in a futures market.in addition to operating its own fleet of barges,peavey often speculated by buying in other freight for use in the future.peavey then hoped to profit by using bought in freight to to fulfill commitments at a future date,at less expense than the cost of using its own barges.
peavey also presented evidence to prove the amount of the loss.peavey introduced records that showed the company average fleetwide earnings,or barge earnings per day.peavey calculated its barge earnings on a monthly basis by adding the gross revenue generated by peavey entire fleet of barges during the month,subtracting expenses,and dividing that figure by the total number of available barge days in that month.for each discrete period of time that a damaged barge was under repair,peavey requested the district court to award damages by multiplying the fleetwide net barge earnings by the number of days the particular barge was out of service.
prior to trial,peavey had used two other methods to compute the amount of its damages.the first method based the loss on the cost of insuring and maintaining the barges.the second method utilized peavey net freight position reports to choose a particular freight commitment that a barge might have met had it not been under repair,and then estimated the net revenue the barge would have earned from that trip.the evidence showed that the net revenue of individual barge trips varied dramatically.individual trips could net less than a dollar a day,or more than.at trial,peavey settled on the net barge earnings method,arguing that it was the fairest method,gave the best picture of what a barge was likely to earn,and involved less guesswork than other methods.
following the bench trial,the district court awarded peavey damages.adopting a rule followed by the fifth circuit in a case involving a single vessel rather than a fleet,the district court held that lost profits could reasonably be assumed to have been lost upon a showing that an active and ready market existed for the type of vessel damaged.see in re nicole trahan,cir.applying that legal standard,the district court concluded that peavey carried its burden of showing that demand was high,and that there was a ready market for the type of barges damaged by inland negligence.the district court also found that peavey was operating its entire fleet of barges and had no spare barges that could be substituted for the damaged barges without losing revenue on the substitutes.
as to the amount of the loss,the district court determined that peavey fleetwide average method of calculating damages was reasonable,and awarded damages accordingly.the district court also awarded prejudgment interest on the damages,which it calculated by using the same dates that the parties had stipulated could be used to calculate prejudgment interest on repair costs.
on appeal,inland argues that the active and ready market test for proving lost profits is inappropriate in a case involving a fleet of vessels,where a plaintiff can use spare vessels to substitute for those under repair.inland also challenges the district court finding that peavey had no spare barges.inland argues that the testimonial evidence of power and johnston,standing alone,is insufficient to take the claim outside the realm of conjecture,speculation,or opinion unfounded on definite facts.cargill,taylor towing,cir.
with respect to the amount of loss,inland contends that the average fleetwide net earnings method is legally inadequate to prove damages to a reasonable degree of certainty.inland argues that peavey must prove the specific profitability of particular barges for particular voyages.inland also contends that peavey proof of the amount of loss is inherently suspect because peavey changed its methodology for calculating the amount of loss and the amount itself several times before and during trial.
finally,inland asks us to reverse the award for prejudgment interest on the damages.inland contends that the district court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest because peavey failed to show when it would have been paid for trips that each damaged barge would have made during the times of repair.without such evidence,inland argues the district court abused its discretion by calculating prejudgment interest from the dates the parties agreed to use for prejudgment interest on repair costs.
