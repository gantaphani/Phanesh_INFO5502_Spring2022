this to wojciech about pain.working as a commercial fisherman aboard the sea watcher i,bielunas had his right foot crushed in a ghastly accident.an orthopedic surgeon said it looked like someone had taken a sledgehammer to bielunas foot.his livelihood lost,bielunas later sued the vessel owner,misty dawn,charging jones act negligence ship unseaworthiness,and a right to maintenance and cure a jury returned a verdict in bielunas favor,and the district judge entered judgment against misty dawn for.in this arena,misty dawn criticizes the district judge for admitting certain evidence and denying a motion for new trial or remittitur.detecting no hint of reversible error,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
we present the facts in the light most flattering to the jury verdict.see,whitfield,cir.bielunas emigrated from poland to the united states with his family in,eventually settling in rural pennsylvania.he had worked on fishing boats before leaving poland,and he became a commercial fisherman here.from through,bielunas worked for misty dawn,a massachusetts corporation,on its vessel,the sea watcher.
safety was hardly the watchword for misty dawn conduct.the company made no real effort to ensure that its employees complied with accepted safety standards.misty dawn had some safety guidelines,but they were not posted anywhere on the sea watcher.instead,the company relied on,with ownership passing safety concerns to the captain who then passed them on to the crew.but there is some dispute whether ownership ever did this.
to make the venture as profitable as possible,misty dawn stored clam cages on the walkways.with the walkways blocked,crew members looking to traverse the ship had to sidle along a thin,unguarded ledge overlooking a drop into the cargo hold or amble over a conveyor belt.but the conveyor belt was not a realistic option because the belt was quite slippery and the system lacked adequate handrails,so the crew including the captain opted to shimmy along the hatch ledge.apparently no one told them not to do this.
that brings us to the accident.asked to help close the hatch that covered the cargo hold,bielunas had to indicate to another crew member when the cover was in the proper wire cable attached to a machine would haul the hatch forward along the ledge.ideally,one would perform this job by standing on the designated walkways.but because they were blocked,bielunas rode atop the closing hatch is how he and others had done it before,and no one had ever told him to do it differently.unfortunately,he lost his balance,stepped onto the ledge to keep from falling into the cargo hold,and got his right foot caught between the cover and a protruding piece of metal.stop,stop,bielunas yelled,hoping to get the attention of the seaman operating the machine.bielunas could feel steel pressing into him,crushing his foot.flesh and muscle were stripped off the bone,leaving a gaping hole.blood was everywhere.
the coast guard airlifted bielunas to a hospital on cape cod,where a doctor performed a series of emergency surgeries.the doctor noticed that about half of the bone material was dead.he removed the dead matter and a significant amount of dead muscle and tissue,too,but he could not close the wound.eventually,after nearly two months,doctors sealed the opening,but bielunas foot is still disfigured,and the damage is severe,permanent,and degenerative.as if this were not enough,bielunas walks with a pronounced limp,and his altered gait triggered back and knee problems.
bielunas will never be able to return to any form of hard work.his poor english skills make it highly unlikely that he will ever be able to do office or clerical work.because this work is the only kind of employment that a person with his new physical disability would be capable of performing,bielunas will likely never be able to work can even pizza delivery and security guard from any list of potential jobs because his mangled foot affects his driving and ability to patrol a site,too.
bielunas total medical and economic damages approximated.in his opening statement,bielunas lawyer pushed for a damages award,which he upped to in his closing.the jury returned a verdict against misty dawn but also found bielunas comparatively negligent.factoring in the figure and an between the parties,the district judge entered a judgment in bielunas favor.misty dawn moved for a new trial or a remittitur,which the district denied in an unexplained order.
with this background in place,we turn to the issues presented on appeal,highlighting further facts when needed to put misty dawn claims into proper perspective.
evidentiary issues 
misty dawn contends that the district judge erred in admitting plaintiff exhibit and lawson bronson expert testimony.neither claim has traction.
plaintiff exhibit 
the protested exhibit is a staged photo apparently taken by a defense expert of a deckhand holding a wire and sidling along a hatch ledge,as the sea watcher crew frequently would.misty dawn argues here,as it did below,that the exhibit is irrelevant because bielunas was injured while standing on the moving hatch while traveling along the hatch ledge holding a wire.this argument is easily disposed of.
a argument is usually a tough sell.the definition of relevance is quite expansive relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence more or less probable.see.emphasis added.to be relevant,the evidence need not definitively resolve a key issue in the case,see,united states rivera calderón,cir,cert.denied.it need only move the inquiry forward to some degree,see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence b joseph mclaughlin,ed.because this is a quintessential judgment call,see morales feliciano rullán,cir,we give trial judges considerable leeway in deciding whether the contested evidence satisfies this standard,reversing only on a showing of abuse of discretion,see,united states sepulveda,cir.
relevancy is not assessed in a is gauged in light of the underlying substantive law,see roy v.the austin,cir,here,jones act negligence and ship unseaworthiness.a jones act shipowner must see to the safety of the crew.koehler transp,cir frank.a crew member burden of proving causation is featherweight,meaning liability exists if the shipowner negligence contributed even in the slightest to the injury.ferrara fishing,cir quotation marks omitted.also,a shipowner must keep the decks,passageways,equipment,a seaworthy condition and must use safe work methods,too.see id.and a shipowner is responsible for injuries even if not negligent.see id.
if a picture speaks a thousand words,this one spoke plenty,giving context so the jury could better understand the parties actions.again,the photo showed a seaman inching his way along a tiny hatch ledge with no guardrails while lugging a unacceptable practice,bielunas expert said,which misty dawn turned a blind eye to and which highlighted misty dawn cavalier attitude toward safety.the photo also showed a ship with blocked walkways,which further bolstered bielunas theory that misty dawn failed to provide a safe deck for work on the high seas.misty dawn talked a good game about how crew safety was a top concern,but the photo suggested otherwise.seen in this light,then,the photo tended to make misty dawn negligence and the ship unseaworthiness more probable,see generally degioia united states lines,cir holding that a cluttered deck constitutes jones act negligence and vessel unseaworthiness bonnewell united states,cir same which is all the liberal relevancy standard requires,see,iacobucci boulter,cir.consequently,the district judge did not abuse his broad discretion in admitting plaintiff exhibit.
bronson testimony 
also sailing wide of the mark is misty dawn claim that the district judge stumbled in admitting bronson testimony about the means of traversing the deck,the danger of obstructing the walkways,and other safety problems on the sea watcher.misty dawn calls this testimony irrelevant and says its admission affected the verdict misty dawn does not contest bronson expert credentials which means we apply the standard.see,f d,cir.again,that standard is hard to satisfy,and misty dawn can not satisfy it here.
bronson the meaning and significance of the staged photo,the dangers posed by the open hatch covers and the missing conveyor belt handrails,to matters of consequence did misty dawn provide bielunas with a safe work place,and was the sea watcher seaworthy misty dawn protests that bielunas was not hurt while sidling along the hatch ledge a misty practice that bronson condemned,that only one cover was open when tragedy struck,and that the missing handrails played no part in the mishap ignoring that misty dawn had faulted bielunas for not standing on the conveyor belt during the episode,a ridiculously unsafe suggestion,bronson said,given the lack of handrails.but this evidence gave the jury a proper frame of reference for assessing the parties competing claims,so it is relevant.see faigin kelly,cir.misty dawn could and did fight tooth and nail to undermine the evidence meaning.but once relevancy is found,complaints of the sort misty dawn pursues go to the weight,not the admissibility,of bronson testimony.see,united states schultz,f d,cir united states diaz,cir.the upshot of all this is that we do not see anything close to an abuse of discretion here 
the new issues 
in its motion,misty dawn blasted bielunas counsel for suggesting a damage award in his opening statement and closing argument,saying counsel comments unfairly influenced the jury and entitled it to a new trial.misty dawn also contended that the jury ultimate award,constituting roughly in damages,which is the crux of the matter was simply too large to stand.the district judge denied the motion without comment,so we have two choices remand for clarification or address the issue if a reasonable basis supporting the order is made manifest on the record.united states podolsky,cir see also generally presley united states postal,cir noting that w hile a written explanation of a district court basis for denying a motion is certainly preferable as an aid to appellate review,a separate written opinion is not necessarily required when a district court rebuffs the motion.we choose option two in this instance.
suggesting specific damage amount 
misty dawn did not object to the comments in bielunas counsel opening statement and closing summation.rather,it first surfaced this issue in its motion.that is still an unpreserved challenge,however,so our review is limited to a search for plain error.united states brandao,cir accord springer henry,cir.
plain error is one hard test to meet,particularly in civil litigation.see smith kmart,cir.plain error is error which is so clear that a trial judge should act even without an objection and which affects the appellant substantial top of that,even if the appellant makes this required showing,we need not intervene unless the error also seriously impugns the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states roy,cir quotation marks omitted see also smith,at union fire ins.of pittsburgh,pa west lake,cir.consequently,misty dawn faces a steep climb nearing,that slope is insurmountable.
misty dawn cites no first circuit cases banning lawyers from suggesting a damage number to the jury.instead it says that federal courts tend to let counsel make arguments during summation,a lawyer tells the jury plaintiff pain is worth x dollars per day,month,or year and then multiplies it by plaintiff life expectancy to get a figure.bielunas lawyer did just that,proposing a number and discussing a process through which the jury could reach it 
some courts permit arguments,some leave the matter to the trial judge discretion,and some ban the practice most courts,particularly federal courts,seem to fall into the first two camps.see generally mileski long island,cir collecting federal and state cases giant food satterfield,same.not this court,however.we forbid counsel from asking jurors to consider the amount of a party ad damnum in crafting a damage award,see davis,cir see also wilson bradlees of new england,cir and we have cited approvingly a case outside this circuit for the point that lawyers can not state in summation the number they think jurors should award for pain and suffering.see davis,at highlighting waldorf shuta,cir.building on this foundation,we held in an unpublished opinion that davis precludes counsel from requesting a dollar amount in closing.kimberly mary hitchcock mem.hosp.hitchcock clinics,wl,at cir,unpublished.consistent with the davis line of cases,district judges in this circuit have stopped lawyers from doing just that.see wilson,at see also generally united parcel,d,discussing and applying davis and the like.consequently,measured by our precedents we conclude that the district judge here made a mistake,and that the mistake is obvious enough.but,again,plain error requires more the mistake must also be prejudicial in a sense that there is a reasonable probability not just a theoretical possibility that it affected the result,and the result must be unjust,too.see united states marcus,see also united states padilla,cir boudin,concurring en banc.this is where misty dawn gets tripped up.
for starters,we are not convinced that this was a error.united states taylor,cir stressing that the doctrine focuses on blockbuster errors quotation marks omitted.we question whether misty dawn can show that it is reasonably opposed to merely the jury would have fixed a different damage figure absent the breakdown.that the jury found bielunas comparatively negligent as opposed to the his lawyer had argued for suggests that the jury did not blindly adopt counsel analysis.but we need not dwell on this issue.see johnson united states,skipping over the third component of the test and deciding the case on the fourth prong.assuming for argument sake that the breakdown affected the outcome of the case,we see no injustice here given that bielunas will live out his life in pain,deprived of his livelihood details we delve more deeply into below,we can not say that the award is intolerable.
if more were we doubt that it judge in his charge made clear that the lawyers statements and arguments were not evidence and that the verdict must be reached on the evidence alone.misty dawn counsel did not object or request any instruction on the issue.after deliberating for a bit,the jury asked the judge if bielunas lawyer could go over the suggested award amounts and the reasoning used to reach them.misty dawn attorney asked the judge to remind the jurors that arguments were not evidence in the case and that they are to decide the matter on their own.the judge agreed and told the jury 
i presume that you are referring to the plaintiff counsel argument to you where it was all laid out.i am not going to have him do that again nor should he have to do it again.
what i want you to do is to use your collective memories as to what he said and what reasoning he offered for the conclusions that he suggested to you.and have in mind what i told you before,that statements of counsel are not the evidence in the case.you are supposed to remember what the evidence was.
what counsel was endeavoring to do was to remind you of what the evidence was and put his interpretation before you so you could consider it.so that is the answer to that.you are to try to remember the evidence yourself.
misty dawn lawyer did not object or ask the judge to say anything else,and we think the judge instructions help undercut any claim.see united states robinson,cir.
plain error is not an standard,united states,cir,vacated on other grounds,and rightfully so it keeps parties from rolling the dice on a favorable verdict and then raising problems on appeal that could have been easily fixed with a timely objection below.see,united states jacquillon,cir wisdom.ultimately,that is exceedingly tough to be met here.
the damage amount 
as a parting shot,misty dawn calls the jury damage award over unreasonably high and faults the district judge for not ordering a remittitur.we see things differently.
converting legal damages into a monetary award is the jury,only rarely and in extraordinary circumstances will we veto the jury decision.palau,
