john simeonoff simeonoff injured his foot while crab fishing on a commercial vessel,the saga saga.simeonoff brought a claim pursuant to the jones act,et,and general maritime law against the saga and,clare and todd hiner hiners claiming negligence and unseaworthiness.after a bench trial,the district court found the saga and the hiners appellees seventy percent negligent and simeonoff thirty percent negligent.the court found total damages and,reducing that by thirty percent,awarded to simeonoff.simeonoff appeals arguing that the district court clearly erred by finding simeonoff contributorily negligent the district court erred by issuing unreviewable damages findings the district court clearly erred by awarding insufficient damages and the district court erred by failing to award prejudgment interest.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm in part because we hold that the economic damages findings are sufficiently detailed for appellate review and the damage awards are sufficient.we reverse and remand in part because we hold that simeonoff was not contributorily negligent for responding to a cry for help.we also remand to permit the district court to make findings relating to its denial of prejudgment interest.
simeonoff began salmon fishing commercially at age and crab fishing at.at the time of the accident,he fished primarily for salmon and crab.when the accident occurred,simeonoff was the stack man on the saga,but h e could do basically any job on the boat.simeonoff was also an experienced ship engineer,and he assisted the saga engineer jed miller miller at miller request.
on february,when he was years old,simeonoff was injured aboard the saga when his foot was crushed by a pot launcher launcher while crab fishing,simeonoff discovered a leaking crack in a fitting on a hydraulic pipe hose or pipe that raises and lowers the launcher.simeonoff reported the leak to engineer miller.miller reported the problem to the ship captain,dennis black black,and went below to make a replacement hose.the crew put the launcher in the up position,and black turned off the hydraulics.simeonoff left the launcher to work at the bait station.miller returned and started to remove tape called densil tape from the hose.miller then called to the crew for assistance.immediately,simeonoff responded to miller call for help to remove the tape.as simeonoff went under the launcher,the hose gave,the fitting gave,and the launcher fell on him causing his serious injuries.
the launcher can be supported by hooking it to the ship crane.the crane uses the same hydraulic system as the launcher but has a mechanical brake that can support the launcher.had it been attached to the launcher,the crane would have prevented the accident.both miller and simeonoff were experienced with hydraulic repairs and knew of the need to secure the launcher before repairing it.miller failed to ensure the launcher was supported before directing simeonoff to remove the tape.simeonoff also failed to ensure the launcher had been supported before following miller direction 
after the accident,the crew used the crane to lift the launcher off of simeonoff,who was thereafter transferred to a boat and taken ashore.simeonoff was examined at a clinic and then flown to a hospital in anchorage.simeonoff underwent two surgeries on his foot.the first occurred after the accident and involved open reduction and internal fixation surgery followed by an april hardware removal.the second occurred in november,during which a joint in his foot was fused followed by a january removal of a screw.simeonoff was released for work on a trial basis in march and did not visit the doctor again until january.
procedural history 
after a bench trial,the court concluded that miller negligence for repairing the launcher without first supporting it rendered the saga unseaworthy at the time miller directed simeonoff to go beneath the launcher.the court concluded that miller negligence and the saga resulting unseaworthiness caused simeonoff injury.the court further found that,despite the maritime expectations that seamen follow orders,simeonoff was negligent for going under the launcher without first assuring himself that the launcher was secured by the crane.the court also found that simeonoff comparative negligence reduced his recovery of damages caused by the saga unseaworthiness.the court further found that the saga unseaworthiness was seventy percent responsible for simeonoff injuries,and simeonoff was thirty percent responsible for his own injury.the court found the reasonable value of simeonoff past lost wages,reduced for taxes,was,and found defendant responsible for seventy percent.the court found the reasonable value of simeonoff future lost wages,reduced to present value and adjusted for taxes,was,and found defendant responsible for seventy percent.the court found the value of simeonoff past pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life to be reasonably measured at,with defendant responsible for seventy percent.the court reasonably valued simeonoff future pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life at,with defendant responsible for seventy percent.in total,the court awarded judgment and damages of to simeonoff.
simeonoff moved the court to amend its findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court denied the motion.
appellees had offered a settlement that simeonoff did not accept.because it was greater than the court award,the court subsequently entered a modified judgment awarding costs to the hiners as prevailing parties.
simeonoff appeals the damage award.
discussion 
comparative negligence 
simeonoff argues that the district court erred by reducing his damage award by thirty percent because he was not negligent in responding to miller call for help.we agree.
we review a judgment of a trial court,sitting without a jury in admiralty,for clear error.mcallister united states.vance am.hawaii cruises,cir.
we have held that in admiralty cases assumption of risk is not a defense and can not be applied to bar or reduce damages sustained by seamen.dubose matson navigation,cir assumption of risk has no place in maritime law.but on the other hand in maritime personal injury actions under the jones act courts have long applied the concept of comparative fault.fisheries,marine constr.design,cir.contributory negligence is applicable to mitigate damages when a seaman is injured if alternative courses of action are available to the injured party,and he chooses the unreasonable course.dubose,at citing cases from the first,second,fourth and fifth circuits oil smith.contributory negligence is proper if a seaman knowingly failed to choose an available safe method of doing his or her work,such as making use of a defective appliance knowing that a safe one is available.contributory negligence is measured by what a reasonable person would have done under similar circumstances.see am.president lines,welch,cir.
courts apply the doctrine of comparative fault to encourage reasonable care by seamen while at the same time placing a high degree of responsibility on owners for the seaworthiness and safety of their vessels and appliances.socony,at.the general rule permitting application of the doctrine of contributory negligence is well settled,and here simeonoff may have had options other than going below the launcher as he did.nonetheless,simeonoff asks us to consider whether an exception to the doctrine of comparative negligence exists when a seaman is injured while following orders.
the fifth circuit has held that a seaman may not be contributorily negligent for carrying out orders that result in his own injury,even if he recognizes possible danger.williams brasea,cir citing darlington national bulk carriers,cir.in williams,the district court found a seaman negligent for failing to make a reasonable effort to ensure that his supervisor who was injured was clear from danger before following the same supervisor order to cut power on some machinery.id.for the seaman to exercise the care found lacking by the district court,the seaman would have had to descend the platform,walk to the side of the cathead to observe the supervisor hands,then return to the platform in order to cut on the power and all this coming after receipt of a direct order from the supervisor to turn the power on.id.the court then concluded that a seaman duty to obey orders from his immediate superior overrides the postulate that the seaman must delay execution of the order until he makes a reasonable effort to be sure that following the order will not injure the superior who gave the order.id.the fifth circuit thus identified circumstances where the reasoning behind contributory balance between encouraging reasonable care of seamen and requiring a high degree of seaworthiness and safety from ship no place.as the court explained in williams,it is unreasonable to require a seamen who has received an order to delay execution of the order until he or she has made a reasonable effort to be sure that following the order will not cause injury.
the eighth circuit in alholm american steamship,cir,also acknowledged the obstacles faced by seamen given a potentially dangerous order and devised a rule whereby the recognition of comparative negligence for following an order depends on whether the seaman is ordered to complete a task in a specific manner.in alholm,a seaman contended on appeal that,because he was following orders,the jury should not have been permitted to find him comparatively negligent or to consider whether there was a safe alternative course of action at the time of the incident.id.plaintiff argued that seamen can not be comparatively negligent when following orders,citing two cases that quote the rule established in williams burden evansville materials,cir,and hall american,cir.id.the eighth circuit reasoned that t he cited cases do not establish a blanket rule precluding a seaman from being found contributorily negligent when acting at the direction of a supervisor.id.the court continued 
the negligence of the worker and the possibility of a safe alternative may be considered when a seaman is ordered to do a task but is not instructed on the method to use and he acts negligently despite the availability of an alternative.see burden,at.a seaman can not be found comparatively negligent,however,when following an order to complete a task in a specific manner.burden,at cir plaintiff comparatively negligent where he followed order to complete task but was negligent in failing to use a known safe technique tolar kinsman marine transit,cir no comparative negligence where seaman completed task in only way possible.
id.the eighth circuit thus recognized a balance between encouraging reasonable care of seamen and requiring a high degree of seaworthiness and safety from ship owners and tipped the balance in favor of seamen who receive specific orders to do a task a specific way that yielded injury.
the eighth circuit rule at first seems appealing because it recognizes the obvious limits on a seaman who receives a specific order to do a particular task in a particular manner faced with such an order,a seaman can not reasonably pause to investigate potential harms before carrying out the order.but the eighth circuit rule does not go far enough because it fails to consider the effect of even a general order on a seaman.when given any order,a seaman might be aware of potential injury if the order is followed,but reasonably might sacrifice personal safety for the good of the ship or crew.an order given from superior to seaman on the open sea should constitute the result of the superior consideration of risk to the seaman balanced against the value of the task to the safety and mission of all.it is more reasonable for a seaman to follow an order without assessing alternatives than to weigh alternatives beyond the immediate order.to assess alternatives is to second guess a superior assessment of the situation.disruption of the chain of command at sea,and delays by seamen in executing orders,may imperil crew and vessel.
we conclude that the fifth circuit rule in williams is persuasive,fair to crew and vessel owners alike.no ship departs for open seas leaving care behind,and no seaman passes from port to port without peril.compliance with orders from supervisors will promote vessel safety and will aid efficacy of command at sea.we hold that a seaman may not be held contributorily negligent for carrying out orders that result in injury,even if the seaman recognizes possible danger and does not delay to consider a safer alternative.this,however,does not end our inquiry.
our adoption of the rule in williams leads us to consider whether this rule against contributory negligence when a seamen follows an order also precludes contributory negligence when a seamen responds to an urgent,yet general,call to the crew for assistance.we hold that it does.in the worst case,one who hesitates at sea to aid a superior may cause dire loss to vessel or crew or both.a seaman can not safely pause to assess the dangers of responding to an urgent,general call for help from a superior.an urgent call for help,like an order,should represent a superior assessment of hazards to vessel and crew in a perilous marine setting.seamen who respond to a call for help,when the need may be urgent,must not be penalized.we hold that a seaman who responds to a superior urgent call to the crew for help can not be found contributorily negligent 
the record demonstrates that miller hollered for help from the crew and simeonoff responded to help miller at once and went beneath the crab launcher.in such circumstances,it is unfair to the seaman and unwise for the vessel to apply contributory negligence.we announce today an exception to our general rule.in view of this exception,the district court clearly erred by reducing simeonoff damages based on a finding of contributory negligence.
reviewability of economic damage awards 
simeonoff argues that the district court lump sum economic damage awards are insufficiently detailed for review pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.
in bench trials,a court must find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.fed.civ.pro.a.
one purpose behind rule a is to aid the appellate court understanding of the basis of the trial court decision.this purpose is achieved if the district court findings are sufficient to indicate the factual basis for its ultimate conclusions.failure to comply with rule a does not require reversal unless a full understanding of the question is not possible without the aid of separate findings.we will affirm the district court if the findings are sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for the decision,or if there can be no genuine dispute about omitted findings.vance,at internal citations omitted.
the district court is not required to base its findings on each and every fact presented at trial.id.citation omitted.conclusory and unhelpful findings of fact do not necessarily require reversal if the record supports the district court ultimate conclusion.see,unt aerospace,cir.
lump sum damage awards are not per se insufficient under rule a.see,security farms int l brotherhood of teamsters,cir sines united states,cir gypsum carrier,handelsman,cir.see also charles wright,arthur miller,fed.prac.proc.civ d west a ppellate courts,in examining a lump sum damage award,should not adopt a per se rule that all cases must be remanded for compliance with rule a.rather,we remand for further findings under rule a when we can not adequately resolve objections raised regarding validity of an award because the award is insufficiently detailed.see,carpenters local hill,cir daido line gonzalez,cir.see also neill diamond drilling,cir.
here,simeonoff merely observes that the district court finding that past lost wages from february through trial amounted to,reduced for taxes,does not specify the years the loss occurred,how the loss was calculated or what tax rate applied and the court finding that the reasonable value of simeonoff future lost wages,reduced to present value and adjusted for taxes of,does not provide a figure for uninjured earning capacity or residual earning capacity.however,the district cour
