this is an appeal by a lobster dealer little bay lobster company and several lobster boat operators based in new hampshire from a decision of the district court sustaining new federal regulations affecting the plaintiffs.for convenience,we refer to the appellants collectively as little bay in describing the claims presented on appeal and assume familiarity with earlier decisions cited below setting forth the legal and factual background in great detail.
the federal regulations in question govern lobster catches in the exclusive economic zone the eez an area of federal jurisdiction extending from to nautical miles seaward of the coastline.ace lobster,evans.state governments regulate the first three miles seaward of their coastline and the federal government regulates beyond that limit to the outer boundary of the zone.id.the legal framework and regulatory history are peculiarly complicated,but only a nutshell description is needed to set the scene.
in,the fishery conservation act the act,was adopted to conserve and manage fishery resources.b campanale sons,evans,cir.regional fishery management councils,including federal and state officials and others,were authorized to adopt for each fishery requiring conservation a fishery management plan,b,campanale,at and the statute provided for the secretary of commerce the secretary to adopt implementing regulations based on notice and comment if the plan was consistent with a set of national standards set forth in the statute.a,a a.
east coast lobsters are such an endangered fishery,and in a group of east coast states proposed a plan for both state and federal waters.in,the pertinent regional council under the new england fishery management council the council adopted a fishery management plan for lobsters that was later implemented by the federal national marine fisheries service.nevertheless,years later a study revealed that northeast lobsters were dangerously overfished.in december the council circulated a draft amendment proposing that four areas be designated in the eez and subjecting each to different restrictions,trap limits aimed at rebuilding stocks.
counterpart regulations were adopted by the secretary in the spring of.may,codified at,subsequently repealed effective.june,codified at b,subsequently repealed effective.the four new management areas included two areas in the federal waters of the gulf of maine area starting three miles offshore and area adjacent to area but lying seaward of it.at.the line separating the two areas,sometimes called the dick allen line,lay about miles off the coast.the restrictions on lobster traps in area have been more stringent than those applying in area.
in the meantime,congress in had adopted the atlantic coastal fisheries cooperative management act atlantic coastal act.this statute chartered an atlantic states marine fisheries commission the commission comprising representatives of states from maine to florida.the commission direct concern is with mobile atlantic coast fisheries within state waters,but in the absence of regulations under the act,the secretary can adopt for eez waters a plan compatible with one adopted by the commission for state waters.b.
this case involves such a plan under the new statute.the new plan began life as a proposed amendment to the existing plan but,along the way,prompted by further pessimistic studies in,the federal national marine fisheries service proposed that the act regulations be withdrawn and that new regulations be adopted under the authority of the new statute if and when a suitable plan was adopted by the commission.ace lobster,at.
during the summer of,the commission sought comments on its amendment.this plan included among other things more stringent limits on the number of lobster traps in areas and.in september,after further public hearings,the commission lobster management board voted to alter amendment to move the boundary line between area and area from to miles offshore.the alteration enlarged area,the area subject to most stringent limits,thereby disadvantaging anyone who had sought lobsters within the area lying between the old line and the one now proposed.
the commission approved amendment with the revised boundary line between areas and in december.in march,national marine fisheries service issued a draft environmental impact statement eis,pursuant to the national environmental policy act,evaluating new alternatives for lobster regulation in federal waters one of the alternatives was amendment.a number of hearings on the draft eis were held including one in portsmouth,new hampshire,in may,and written comments were received including one from little bay itself attacking the shift from the dick allen line.
in january,a proposed federal rule was published implementing amendment for federal waters.proposed january,and public comments were received including several pertaining to the new line.a final eis was issued in may,noting that amendment had the most support of all the alternatives under consideration.the final eis included a final regulatory flexibility analysis,as required by the regulatory flexibility act,concluding that those using lobster traps would be impacted in the but that the benefits of rebuilding stocks outweighed the harm.
in december,the national marine fisheries service issued final regulations,codified at part which were adopted by the secretary pursuant to the atlantic coastal act,b.these regulations implemented amendment for federal waters including the new stricter trap limits and the shift of the dick allen line.in early january,little bay and a number of portsmouth,new hampshire,lobster boat operators brought suit in the federal district court against the secretary to challenge the new regulations.
an action of this kind,framed as a declaratory judgment proceeding,is in effect a suit for review of agency action ordinarily based on the administrative record.see campanale,at massachusetts ex rel.div.of marine fisheries daley,cir.after extensive proceedings,the district court on may,granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary,and this appeal followed.our review of the district court decision is de novo,massachusetts ex rel.div.of marine fisheries,at.what standard we and the district court both apply to the agency own decisions varies with the issue.id.
the most prominent issue on appeal concerns one of the requirements the secretary had to meet before adopting the regulations.the atlantic coastal act requires inter alia that federal regulations adapting the commission plan for use in the federal eez follow consultation with the appropriate regional councils,and be consistent with the national standards of the act.b.here,little bay claims,the failure to consult is established by our intervening decision in campanale sons,evans.
that case,like this one,involved amendment and the december regulations implementing the plan for the eez,but the plaintiffs were rhode island fishermen concerned with the numerical limits on traps.campanale,at.the district court rebuffed the attacks but a divided panel of this court held that the secretary had violated his obligation to consult with the council.id.at.the court declined to say that the error had been harmless,ruling that this inquiry was a factual one best undertaken initially by the district court.id.at.
campanale was decided after the district court in our own case had sustained summary judgment for the secretary.in campanale,the court acknowledged that the secretary had advised the council of the proposed trap limits through the draft eis alternatives and had gotten comments back from the council.the campanale panel held this to be inadequate at least where the secretary did not tell the council that this was its statutory consultation opportunity.campanale,at.
conceivably,the secretary might have consulted with the council on one issue the line but not another the trap limits but in our case,the secretary has not sought to distinguish campanale by arguing that consultation met the letter of the statute.rather,he argues that the council knew what was being proposed and least as to the line surrounding circumstances show that a more f
