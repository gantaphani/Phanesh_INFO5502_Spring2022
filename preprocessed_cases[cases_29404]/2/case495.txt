this appeal arises out of a tragic accident in which a tugboat owned by magnolia marine transport company magnolia collided with the interstate bridge over the arkansas river near webbers falls,oklahoma.magnolia filed a petition in district court in mississippi for limitation of liability under admiralty law.meanwhile,the state of oklahoma filed a suit for damages against magnolia in oklahoma state court,which magnolia removed to federal district court.thereafter,the mississippi district court transferred magnolia limitation petition to the federal court in oklahoma.the state filed a motion to dismiss the limitation petition on eleventh amendment grounds,which the district court denied.an order denying a motion to dismiss on the basis of state sovereign immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d innes.state in re innes,cir.the state appeals,and we affirm.
on may,the robert love,a tugboat owned and operated by magnolia and piloted by captain william joe dedmon,was pushing two empty barges up the arkansas river in oklahoma.as the tugboat neared the interstate bridge,captain dedmon suffered a form of cardiac arrhythmia that caused him to lose consciousness for several minutes.while captain dedmon was unconscious,the tugboat pushed the barges into the bridge,causing the bridge to collapse into the river.several vehicles plunged off the damaged overpass.fourteen people died and five suffered injuries.the subsequent search and rescue,repair,loss of use,and costs required the state of oklahoma to expend more than million dollars.
one week after the accident,magnolia filed a petition in federal district court in mississippi invoking the procedures of the limitation of shipowners liability act.the next day,the state filed suit for damages in oklahoma state court.after removal of the state suit and transfer of magnolia limitation petition,the parties legal actions were consolidated in federal district court in oklahoma.positing that under the united states constitution,the state of oklahoma can not be prohibited from pursing sic its claim against magnolia in the courts of oklahoma,nor can the state be forced,without its consent,to pursue its claims in federal court,the state claimed it was entitled to sovereign immunity from this limitation proceeding and from the limitation act.at.we now consider the state appeal from the district court denial of the its motion to dismiss on immunity grounds.
the limitation of shipowners liability act is at the heart of this appeal.because issues pertaining to it are somewhat unfamiliar in our landlocked circuit,we begin with an explication of the act central features and the procedures employed to implement them.
limitation of liability is an important theme of admiralty law.thomas schoenbaum,admiralty maritime law,ed.a feature of continental european sea codes since medieval times,it came to english admiralty law in the eighteenth century and to this country in as the limitation of shipowners liability act.id.at.the act provides for the enjoining of pending suits against shipowners and their consolidation in a single federal court so that liability may be determined and limited to the value of the shipowner vessel and freight pending.id.at.the apparent purpose of the act was to encourage shipbuilding in this country and to place the shipping industry on equal footing with foreign competitors who enjoyed such limitation procedures at home.id.
because the act was badly drafted even by the standards of the time,the supreme court codified a procedure for its implementation in rule f of the admiralty rules.id.at.rule f provides a single forum for the determination of whether the vessel and its owner are liable at all whether the owner may in fact limit liability to the value of the vessel and pending freight the amount of just claims and how the fund should be distributed to the claimants.id.at.while a shipowner may only file a petition for limitation in admiralty jurisdiction in federal district court,he or she may plead limitation as a defense to an action seeking damages in federal or state court.id.at.
as a condition of limitation,the shipowner 
shall deposit with the court,for the benefit of claimants,a sum equal to the amount or value of the owner interest in the vessel and pending freight,or approved security therefor,and in addition such sums,or approved security therefor,as the court from time to time may fix as necessary 
supp.rule f.in addition,the security posting must include six percent yearly interest.schoenbaum.once a shipowner deposits this sum,the court will stay all other proceedings against the shipowner relating to the incident at issue and compel claimants to file for recovery in the limitation court under penalty of default.id.at.
the burden of proof in a limitation proceeding parallels that in a standard suit for damages.claimants against the shipowner must prove the vessel negligence or unseaworthiness caused their losses.if they so prove,the burden shifts to the shipowner to prove there was no design,neglect,privity or knowledge on his or her part.id.at.if the shipowner is not exonerated,but the court finds he or she is entitled to limitation of liability,payment to claimants is made on a basis,generally out of the security deposited with the court.id.at.
the state of oklahoma insists its constitutional sovereign immunity from suit prevents magnolia from invoking the procedures of the limitation of shipowners liability act as to the state claim for damages.the logical starting point for our analysis of this proposition is the text of the eleventh amendment to the united states constitution.
the eleventh amendment mandates that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.the question we must first answer,therefore,is whether magnolia limitation petition constitutes a suit commenced or prosecuted against the state of oklahoma.for reasons we explore below,the answer to that question is no.
the state advocates a different starting point for our analysis.oklahoma would have us begin with the test enunciated by the united states supreme court in college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,d.aplt.br.at.in that case,the court recognized only two circumstances in which an individual may sue a state where congress has authorized the suit pursuant to its enforcement power under the fourteenth amendment,and where the state has waived its sovereign immunity.florida prepaid,at.in urging these two exceptions to sovereign immunity as this court analytical starting point,the state misses a crucial distinction between florida prepaid and the case before us.in florida prepaid,college savings bank sued florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,an arm of the state of florida,for violations of the lanham act.id.at.clearly,the bank suit was a suit against a state,which the court presupposed in recognizing only two circumstances in which an individual may sue a state.id.at.emphasis added.
here,to the contrary,the state of oklahoma has sued magnolia for damages.magnolia neither named the state as a defendant in its limitation proceeding nor served process upon the state.the limitation proceeding merely provides a forum for establishing a shipowner right to limitation of liability and managing disbursement of a limitation fund to claimants who prove magnolia is liable to them.the limitation proceeding thus lacks the traditional characteristics of a suit against the state.
the state argues that whether magnolia limitation proceeding is a suit against a state is irrelevant to eleventh amendment analysis.according to the state,the supreme court has repeatedly held that even though a state is not named a party to an action,the suit may nonetheless be barred by the eleventh amendment.aplt.br.at.in support of this argument,the state cites edelman jordan,d,and ford motor department of treasury.the state is correct
