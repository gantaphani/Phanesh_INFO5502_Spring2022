this admiralty action concerns the definition of a vessel for purposes of applying burden shifting principles outlined in maritime case law.the appellant freeport marine repair,freeport appeals the district court judgment against it after a ship owned by freeport broke free from her moorings and damaged appellee bunge corporation bunge grain loading facility.bunge seeking a higher damage award.we affirm and remand.
freeport manufactured and owned a casino vessel hull that was in the final stages of construction at freeport facility at four mile creek near freeport,florida.by october,funding for completion of the ship dried up resulting in a vessel not rigged for steering by early evening of the same day,hurricane opal was nearing florida panhandle at approximately mph.freeport was aware of the impending hurricane,but only made limited preparations because freeport did not believe opal would make landfall until october.opal,however,accelerated from to mph,causing freeport to work from until on october,in an attempt to secure hull from the storm.both sides dispute the integrity of the preparations conducted by freeport in anticipation of hurricane opal.the district court was unable to find,as a matter of fact,exactly how hull was moored because the cables that broke were not preserved,and,thus,not in evidence 
by,the weather worsened,and freeport evacuated its employees.the parties dispute the severity of the weather at the time hull broke free from her moorings.the district court found that the storm approached the coast line with winds up to mph,but by the time it reached freeport,hull was only subjected to sustained winds between mph and mph.by,hull broke free from her moorings and drifted to the west bank of four mile creek.while adrift,hull apparently struck and damaged a conveyor facility owned by bunge.the following day hull returned to freeport mooring facility under her own power.bunge brought suit in federal district court seeking recovery of the damages it sustained as a result of freeport alleged negligence.the district court entered judgment against freeport in the amount of.
freeport appeals the judgment against it,while bunge,seeking an increase in the amount of damages awarded.the primary issue in this case concerns freeport defense that a must be a vessel in order for the burden shifting principles announced in the louisiana,wall.the louisiana rule,to apply.
ii.standards of review 
whether hull was a vessel for purposes of the louisiana rule is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.southern natural gas land,cullman county,cir american dredging,lambert,cir.the district court findings regarding the severity of hurricane opal are findings of fact that must stand unless clearly erroneous.it is settled that the clearly erroneous standard of review applies in admiralty cases.mcallister united states.compania anonima venezolana de navegacion perez export company,cir in reviewing damage awards,this court should reverse only if it finds the award to be clearly erroneous.nakajima,cir.this court should not reverse the district court damage award simply because it may conclude that it would have computed damages differently.hiatt,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the louisiana rule 
we first address whether hull was a vessel such that it was subject to the louisiana rule.when a moving ship strikes and damages a stationary object,it is presumed that the moving ship is at fault.the louisiana,wall.the oregon.bunge furness bridge,cir.this presumption operates to shift the burden of persuasion onto the moving ship.delta transload,mv navios commander,cir.the presumption derives from the observation that moving vessels do not usually collide with stationary objects unless the moving vessel is mishandled in some way.id.it stems also from the observation that any evidence of actual negligence,or the lack of it,is likely to be known only to the persons on board,who are in the best position to either keep damaging evidence hidden,or bring favorable evidence forward.united states merchant mariner license joseph,decision of the.the presumption is universally described as strong,and as one that places a heavy burden on the moving ship to overcome.bunge,at.
this presumption of negligence may be rebutted by showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,either that the allision was the fault of the stationary object,that the moving vessel acted with reasonable care,or that the allision was an unavoidable accident.bunge,at.the presumption operates not just against the ship,but against all parties who participated in the management of the vessel.woods department of,cir.
therefore,when the district court determined that hull fell within the purview of the louisiana rule,freeport had the burden to overcome the presumption that it was negligent in causing damage to the bunge facility.on appeal,freeport argues that the louisiana rule applies only to vessels,that hull was not a vessel in admiralty,and that the district court,therefore,erroneously applied the louisiana rule to freeport.because we conclude hull constituted a vessel for purposes of admiralty tort jurisdiction,we hold that the district court correctly applied the louisiana rule to hull.we need not address whether a must constitute a vessel as defined elsewhere in admiralty jurisprudence in order for the louisiana rule to apply.
our analysis,then,begins with admiralty jurisdiction.historically,admiralty tort jurisdiction depended solely upon the locality of the wrong.executive jet aviation,city of cleveland,d if the wrong occurred on navigable waters,the action was within admiralty jurisdiction if the wrong occurred on land,it was not.the supreme court,however,rejected the purely mechanical application of the locality test,concluding that the wrong must also bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.id.at.this second prong is commonly termed the nexus test.id.thus,we must consider the situs of the allision locality test as well as the relationship between the unmooring of a partially constructed ship and traditional maritime activity nexus test in order to determine admiralty jurisdiction.
we consider first whether hull passes the locality test.in the plymouth,wall,the supreme court stated that e very species of tort,however occurring,and whether on board a vessel or not,if upon the high seas or navigable waters,is of admiralty cognizance.to satisfy this test,the tort need only occur on navigable waters.see id.in this case,hull broke free from her moorings on the east side of four mile creek,drifted across to the west side of four mile creek where it struck the bunge grain loading facility.the injury to bunge property clearly occurred on navigable waters and,thus,satisfies the locality test.
we next determine whether hull allision with the bunge facility bears a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.the nexus test presents two queries did the incident have a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce sisson ruby,d and does a substantial relationship exist between the activity giving rise to the incident and traditional maritime activity id.at.as to the first query,a court must assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether such an incident is likely to disrupt commercial activity.id.at.sea vessel reyes,cir.no actual disruption of maritime commerce need occur in order to satisfy this query,rather the law requires that we examine the general features of this type of incident.id.here,a partially constructed vessel broke free from her moorings and drifted unattended down four mile creek,damaging property along side the waterway.clearly,hull was not only a potential disruption to commercial activity,it was an actual disruption.
as to the second query of the nexus test,we must determine whether there was a substantial relationship between the activity giving rise to the incident and traditional maritime activity.sisson,at.the relevant activity in the instant case was the construction of hull and the mooring of hull on the navigable waterway of four mile creek.therefore,we must determine whether the construction and mooring of
