this admiralty case requires us to interpret a marine insurance policy,open cargo policy the policy issued by mutual marine office,mmo for new york marine general insurance company new york marine and certificates of insurance,special marine policies smps,issued under the policy by tradeline tradeline to deepak fertilisers and petrochemicals,deepak to cover two shipments of diammonium phosphate dap aboard the sea guardian.deepak incurred a loss when a cyclone struck the port of kandla,india,during the discharge of the dap in early june.
plaintiff new york marine brought suit,seeking to disclaim liability under the policy for any of deepak loss.on june,the district court awarded deepak partial recovery.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,and reverse and remand in part.
background 
a.the parties 
new york marine general insurance company is an insurance company that does business in new york through its managing general agent,mutual marine office.mmo issued to tradeline the marine insurance policy at issue in this litigation.tradeline is a united arab emirates corporation engaged in the business of supplying and shipping various commodities.frenkel frenkel,an insurance broker with an office in new york,acted as an intermediary for tradeline in obtaining the insurance policy by negotiating with new york marine through mmo.frenkel,however,is not an agent of either new york marine or mmo.
deepak fertilisers and petrochemicals,is a corporation organized under the laws of india,engaged in importing fertilizer for sale in the indian market.
b.the policy 
in may,mmo,on behalf of new york marine,issued to tradeline open cargo policy,effective may,the policy.the policy remained in effect until it was canceled around november,and therefore was in effect during the incidents giving rise to this litigation.the policy contained typed or manuscripted clauses,several typed endorsements,and several attached forms,including the industry standard institute cargo clauses c icc c which were referenced in the typed clauses or endorsements.tradeline is the named insured under the policy.
clause of the policy authorized tradeline to issue to its customers evidence of insurance in the form of certificates or special policies of insurance.this clause provides that t he clauses appearing in this form shall be deemed to be included in certificates special policies of insurance when issued under the authority granted in this clause.these certificates or special policies were intended to provide tradeline customers with a way to make direct claims against new york marine for loss or damage to insured cargo.shortly after the policy became effective,mmo forwarded to tradeline certificates for issuance to its customers.
c.the contract 
in april,deepak purchased two shipments of diammonium phosphate from tradeline,in the amounts of metric tons mt and both shipments were to be carried from mexico to the sole port of discharge at kandla,india aboard the sea guardian,a vessel chartered by tradeline.
the dap was purchased on cif cost,insurance and freight terms for per metric ton,for a total price of.tradeline was bound by the terms of its contract with deepak to maintain insurance on the cargo on a warehouse to warehouse basis and to sell insurance to deepak for the risks associated with the transit.therefore,tradeline delivered to deepak special marine policies smps and as evidence of the insurance on the dap shipments,issued pursuant to its power under clause of the policy.in addition to the preprinted provisions,both smps contained a typed provision that stated,n otwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary average terms conditions london icc clauses c,london war clauses cargo,london strikes clauses cargo.deepak fulfilled its obligation to tradeline under the contract,having paid to tradeline the full purchase price of the dap.
d.the voyage and request for rainwater coverage 
on or about april,the two shipments of dap were loaded aboard the sea guardian at the port of lazaro cardenas,mexico,under two bills of lading.the port of kandla,india was agreed upon by deepak and tradeline as the sole port of discharge.
on may or,the sea guardian arrived at the port of kandla,and,because of draft restrictions at the berth,began to load the dap onto lightering barges for transit to the wharf at kandla.the lightering process continued through june,and the offloaded dap was located on the wharf or at other locations within the port trust area,where the dap was being bagged by rishi shipping rishi,deepak handling and forwarding agent.
meanwhile,on may,deepak was informed by rishi that weather is cloudy and we should take risk of rain.the next day,rishi again informed deepak by facsimile that insurance for rain was necessary.deepak forwarded this fax to tradeline on that same day,with a handwritten note,please do the needful immediately.deepak advised tradeline,shortly after this communication,that it did not wish to insure for the more expensive all risks coverage under institute cargo clauses a icc a,but rather wished to add rainwater coverage to the existing coverage.deepak also wished only to cover mt of the entire shipment.
on june,tradeline inquired of frenkel whether it could obtain an upgrade to include the risk of rainwater.specifically,tradeline asked if icc a terms covering only rainwater damage could be obtained,whether rainwater coverage could be added to the existing icc c coverage,and whether rainwater damage could be obtained for only part of the total dap shipment.on june,after various communications between tradeline and frenkel,and frenkel and mmo,mmo set the rate for an upgrade of icc c coverage to include risk of rainwater damage at cents per of insured value.on june,deepak informed tradeline that it accepted these quoted terms and tradeline issued new smps shortly thereafter.the new smps contained a revised typewritten provision stating 
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary average terms conditions 
london icc clauses c 
london war clauses cargo 
london strike clauses cargo 
including risks of rainwater damages,with effect from june.
claims payable in india.
frenkel approved these smps and to replace smps and,with the new coverage to be effective june.tradeline wrote cancelled on smps and.
on june,while the dap was still being discharged,a cyclone struck the port of kandla,involving cyclonic wind and rain forces,tidal waves and rising waters.when the cyclone struck,approximately mt had been offloaded from the sea guardian.about mt were already bagged and transported to other inland locations.the sea guardian,with approximately mt of dap still on board,was diverted from the port of kandla,which was closed due to the cyclone,to the distress port of jnpt,india.
on june,deepak gave notice of loss stemming from the cyclone to new york marine through frenkel.shortly thereafter,mmo,on behalf of new york marine,retained tata marine services,who in turn hired boda surveyors to assess the extent of the damage to the dap shipment.
undisputed losses incurred by deepak 
deepak suffered seven separate categories of damages.first,mt of dap were lost as the result of the sinking of lightering barges in the port of kandla,amounting to a claim of.second,mt of dap were lost in the shore area of the port of kandla as a result of the cyclone rains,rising tides,and tidal waves of meters,resulting in a claim of.third,mt of dap were damaged by the cyclone and resulting floods in the port trust area of kandla.the dap had been deposited from the lightering barges onto the shore area.the loss amounted to,which represents the difference in insured value less the monies received after a salvage sale.fourth,deepak incurred mitigation expenses in segregating and reconditioning the damaged dap,cost of replacement bags,additional transportation costs and extra overhead for the salvage operations amounting to.fifth,deepak incurred forwarding,landing and storage costs for diverting the cargo to the port of distress,jnpt,in the amount of for additional wharfage,statutory port charges,demurrage,cost of excavators,customs overtime,manual bagging charges statutorily imposed,additional supervision,cost of transporting empty bags to jnpt and survey costs plus toward the cost of moving the vessel from kandla to jnpt.sixth,mt of dap were damaged by rain water at the port of jnpt,resulting in a loss of,the difference in insured value less the monies received for the salvage sale.seventh,mt of dap was lost during the discharge of the shipments at the port of distress,in the amount of.
total losses claimed amount to.by letter dated september,mmo declined deepak claim in its entirety.
proceedings below 
because this complex appeal raises several issues among several parties,we set forth the claims,counterclaims and claims in some detail.
on october,new york marine brought a declaratory judgment action against tradeline and deepak,seeking a declaration that the policy was void ab initio.new york marine claimed that the defendants violated the duty of utmost good faith when they sought to add rainwater coverage,by failing to inform new york marine that the dap was in route,that two dap shipments were aboard the same vessel,and that dire weather was predicted.
tradeline and deepak against new york marine,alleging that new york marine breached the policy by failing to pay deepak claim and,in addition to compensatory damages,prayed for punitive damages based on new york marine alleged bad faith in denying the claims under the policy.deepak filed a against tradeline for breach of the cif sales contract.tradeline also filed a complaint against mmo,new york marine agent,alleging that mmo breached its duty of good faith by causing deepak claim to be wrongfully denied.
new york marine filed a complaint against frenkel,alleging that frenkel misrepresented or failed to disclose to new york marine material facts regarding the requested rainwater coverage upgrade and that it permitted unauthorized smps to issue.
on motions for summary judgment filed by deepak,tradeline,and frenkel and on new york marine motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court dismissed tradeline and deepak claims for punitive damages,but denied all the remaining motions because disputed questions of material fact existed.see new york marine general ins.tradeline,civ.hb,wl,at,new york marine i in deciding the parties motions for summary judgment,the district court concluded that,despite the choice of law provision in the policy calling for application of english law,new york law applied.see new york marine i,wl,at.the parties do not dispute this conclusion and have set forth their arguments on appeal based on new york law.
following a bench trial,the district court rejected new york marine claim that the policy was void ab initio.see new york marine general ins.tradeline,civ.hb,wl,at june,new york marine ii.the district court did conclude,however,that tradeline and deepak would not get the benefit of the rainwater coverage evidenced by smps and because they violated the duty of utmost good faith by not disclosing the weather conditions to new york marine or mmo.see id.at.therefore,the district court awarded to deepak that part of its claim covered by the policy and the original smps and,which,the district court concluded,amounted to.see id.at.the district court dismissed new york marine complaint against frenkel,as well as deepak against tradeline.see id.at.finally,the district court denied deepak and tradeline requests for attorneys fees,finding no evidence of bad faith on the part of new york marine and concluding that deepak was not truly successful in defending new york marine declaratory suit,having prevailed only to a modest degree.see id.
the parties filed timely appeals.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,deepak principal argument is that the district court misinterpreted the policy,thereby erroneously failing to accord it full recovery on its claim.deepak also contests other determinations made by the district court regarding evidence,agency relationships between the parties,dismissal of its contract claim against tradeline,and the interest rate to be applied to its recovery.
new york marine and mmo,contending,as they did below,that the policy was void ab initio.tradeline likewise,and echoes deepak principal argument 
jurisdiction,standard of review and choice of law 
federal subject matter jurisdiction exists pursuant to,which provides federal district courts with original jurisdiction over any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.federal admiralty jurisdiction extends to cases involving marine insurance contracts.see advani,underwriters at lloyd,cir.
although we review a district court findings of fact for clear error,see atlantic mut.ins.balfour maclaine int l in re balfour maclaine int l,cir,we review a district court construction of an insurance policy de novo,see commercial union ins.flagship marine,cir.absent a specific federal rule,federal courts look to state law for principles governing maritime insurance policies and apply federal maritime choice of law rules to determine which state law to apply.id.citing wilburn boat fireman fund.and advani,at.here,as earlier indicated,the district court concluded that new york law governed interpretation of the policy,and the parties do not contend otherwise.
b.the status of the policy 
new york marine principal contention below was that deepak and tradeline violated the doctrine of uberrimae fidae,the duty of utmost good faith,by failing to disclose to mmo or new york marine the status of the dap shipments and the weather predictions when deepak sought rainwater coverage.because of this failure to disclose,new york marine argued,the entire policy was void ab initio,and deepak should recover nothing on its claim.the district court agreed that deepak and tradeline had violated this duty,but held that the entire policy was not void instead,only the smps issued with rainwater coverage were void.see new york marine ii,wl,at.
on appeal,new york marine again urges that the entire policy is void.deepak,on the other hand,argues that it violated no duty,because it disclosed to tradeline the existence of bad weather at the port of kandla and that any knowledge possessed by tradeline is imputed to new york marine,because tradeline was acting as new york marine agent with respect to the issuance of the smps.because we agree with deepak argument that tradeline was acting as new york marine agent,we reverse the district court holding with respect to deepak duty of utmost good faith.
new york common law provides that an agency relationship results from a manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control,and the consent by the other to act.meese miller,dep t see also pensee,quon,dep t same.under new york law,knowledge acquired by an agent acting within the scope of its agency is imputed to the principal,even if the information was never actually communicated.see christopher douglaston club,dep t.
clause of the policy explicitly grants authority to tradeline to issue special policies of insurance for shipments covered by the policy,manifesting new york marine consent to tradeline acting on its behalf.when tradeline issued,upon deepak request,smps and,which included rainwater coverage,it consented to act as new york marine agent with respect to this transaction.there is no question that tradeline was under new york marine control in issuing the communicated with new york marine managing general agent,mmo,in acquiring and setting the premium for the coverage.therefore,tradeline acted as new york marine agent in issuing both the original smps and and the rainwater coverage smps and.knowledge possessed by tradeline regarding the location of the vessel and the weather predictions will thus be imputed to new york marine.
perzy intercargo.is instructive.perzy involved a marine insurance dispute between edwin perzy,a manufacturer and seller of snowball paperweights,and intercargo corporation,an insurance company.see id.at.a customer of perzy in california sought to return unsold snowball paperweights to perzy in vienna,and enlisted a freight forwarder to arrange for shipment and insurance of the paperweights.see id.at.the freight forwarder sent to perzy a certificate of marine insurance stating that it covered the shipped cargo.see id.at.when the paperweights arrived in vienna in a frozen and damaged condition,perzy filed an insurance claim which intercargo denied.see id.in addressing the parties motions for summary judgment,the district court noted that the freight forwarder was likely acting as intercargo agent in the original placement of the insurance coverage.see id.at.intercargo contended that the freight forwarder was acting as perzy agent,to which the district court responded,
it is beyond dispute that even if the freight forwarder may also have been serving as perzy agent when she purchased insurance,in all events she was surely intercargo agent in that respect.before perzy had ever entered the picture intercargo had given the freight forwarder the authority to write insurance policies with intercargo as insurer.
id.at emphasis in original.the court further noted that intercargo controlled the policy terms,and that the freight forwarder worked on intercargo behalf in writing certificates for it.see id.
here,too,the relationship between tradeline and new york marine commenced prior to deepak dap shipments.as we noted earlier,tradeline was authorized under clause to issue special policies of insurance,but new york marine generally controlled the terms of the policy and set the premiums.we therefore conclude that tradeline was acting as new york marine agent when it sought the price for rainwater coverage and subsequently issued the updated smps.any knowledge possessed by tradeline in issuing the smps will be imputed to new york marine,as the principal.
application of the doctrine of uberrimae fidae 
p arties to a marine insurance contract are held to the highest degree of good faith.under this obligation,called uberrimae fidae,the party seeking insurance is required to disclose all circumstances known to him which materially affect the risk.puritan ins.eagle steamship,cir.uberrimae fidae,the duty of utmost good faith,requires an assured to disclose any information that materially affects the risk being insured,because the assured is more likely to be aware of such information.see knight fire ins,cir.a fact is material if it would have affected the insurer decision to insure at all or at a particular premium.see mutual benefit life ins.jmr elecs,cir.
the district court found,and we agree,that the prediction of severe rainy weather in the kandla area is a material fact that would have affected new york marine decision whether to issue the extended coverage at all or to do so at a higher premium.see new york marine ii,wl,at.deepak,therefore,had a duty to disclose this information when seeking the rainwater coverage.
the record includes a letter sent by fax from deepak to tradeline which references the impending rainy weather at kandla.tradeline does not dispute that it received this letter.tradeline was therefore aware of the material weather information,and this knowledge is imputed to new york marine.deepak fulfilled its duty of utmost good faith by informing tradeline,as new york marine agent,of the material circumstances.we therefore conclude that uberrimae fidae does not void smps and,and that deepak can recover any loss covered by those smps.as we conclude below,however,deepak is not entitled to full recovery,even under smps and 
deepak recovery under open cargo policy 
the governing terms of the policy 
both the original and the rainwater smps contain the phrase,n otwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary average terms conditions london icc clauses c.the district court concluded that this phrase is unambiguous and resolves all potential conflicts between policy and icc c provisions in favor of the provisions outlined in the icc c clauses.new york marine ii,wl,at.on appeal,deepak challenges this conclusion and contends that the policy manuscripted clauses,along with the attached endorsements,trump the icc c clauses referenced in the smps.we reject deepak challenge and conclude that the icc c provisions govern deepak claim under the policy 
in support of its argument,deepak invokes several of the policy provisions.the first,clause,provides that i t is further agreed that the terms,conditions and limits contained herein clauses to inclusive shall supersede those of the printed policy to which this form is attached wherever the same may conflict.second,clause g provides that i n the event that broader terms or conditions appear in a policy,special policy,or certificate which has been accepted by this assurer,then such terms and conditions shall be applicable.third,clause,which authorizes tradeline to issue smps,provides that the clauses appearing in this form shall be deemed to be included in certificates special policies of insurance when issued under the authority granted in this clause.finally,the smps were issued subject to conditions of open policy.deepak contends that the combined effect of these clauses demonstrate that the parties intended,where any conflict in terms arise,the broader terms and conditions to govern coverage.additionally,deepak cites rules of insurance policy interpretation,which require conflicts to be interpreted against the insurer and which require courts to afford broader coverage where the policy contains conflicting clauses.therefore,deepak argues that the manuscripted policy clauses are given effect over the icc c clauses.
we reject this contention.although it is true,as a general rule,that where a certificate states expressly that it is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy,the language of the policy controls,taylor kinsella,cir,the certificates smps at issue here include typewritten,not,provisions limiting the terms of the coverage to icc c clauses.typewritten statements in an insurance policy will prevail over stock or forms.see,perth amboy drydock mfrs.ins,dep t see also lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed.couch on insurance written or typed portion of a policy must be taken as more immediate or deliberate expression of intention than the printed portion if there is any repugnancy or conflict between them written or typed portion prevails.the typewritten statements in the smps,adopting the icc c provisions as governing terms,control where there are conflicts.
we agree with the district court that these typewritten provisions modify both the average terms and conditions paragraph contained in the smps and clause of the policy,also entitled average terms and conditions.see new york marine ii,wl,at.first,the smps were issued pursuant to tradeline authority under the policy,and the smps specifically state that they are subject to the conditions of the policy.clause a,modified by endorsement nine,contemplates that the assured will choose either icc c coverage or icc a coverage 
all goods merchandise are insured 
cement clinker,sulphur,rock phosphate,bentonite,barytes,scrap metal,ammonia,diammonium phosphate,urea,silicon sand,salt,soyabean and rice in bulk are insured 
institute cargo clause c and all claims for shortage leakage are subject to a deductible of of one percent of of the insured value.
or,if declared by the assured prior to know sic or reported loss.
ii.per institute cargo clauses a.all claims subject to a deductible of of the insured value.
the original,unamended clause a provided for no such choice,and dictated the level of coverage.when tradeline and deepak chose icc c coverage in the cif sales contract,and tradeline incorporated this choice into the smps,it incorporated the icc c terms into the policy to govern coverage.
clauses g and do not require the opposite result.clause g states that i n the event that broader terms appear in a policy,special policy,or certificate then such terms and conditions shall be applicable.clause g contemplates the situation where the smps contain broader terms than the policy and states that the broader terms control.here,the policy itself contains broader terms than the smps.the smps additional notwithstanding anything contained herein language plainly supersedes the broader policy provisions.also,as the district court recognized,if clause g required that the policy broader terms were always applicable,tradeline could never insure any shipment for less than coverage.see new york marine ii,wl,at.as noted earlier,such an outcome directly contravenes endorsement nine,which allows the assured to choose the level of coverage.
deepak argument for broader coverage based on clause,which provides that clauses through of the policy supersede clauses contained in the printed policy in cases of conflict,fails for the same reason.if the phrase printed policy refers either to the smps issued pursuant to clause or to the icc c provisions which were attached to the open policy,then the policy would,in effect,always provide one level of coverage,notwithstanding the choices later made by the insured party with respect to a specific shipment.this result would ignore both clause g,which allows,for an additional premium,broader coverage than that provided in the policy,and endorsement nine,which allows the insured to choose between either icc c or icc a coverage.we refuse to interpret a contractual term in such a way as to nullify other provisions.couch on insurance t he expressed intent of the parties is to be ascertained by examining the policy as a whole t he policy must be construed in its entirety,with each clause interpreted in relation to others contained therein.all its words,parts,and provisions must be construed together as one entire contract,each part interpreted in the light of all the other parts.footnotes omitted.
we therefore conclude that the terms governing the dap shipments are contained in the icc c provisions,with the addition of rainwater damage as a covered risk.we now examine those provisions to determine what portion of deepak claim is covered by the policy.
deepak recovery under the policy 
thus far,we have concluded that the icc c provisions contain the governing terms of the policy with respect to the dap shipments at issue here.additionally,contrary to the decision of the district court,we have concluded that,because tradeline was acting as new york marine agent in issuing smps and and deepak fully informed tradeline of the circumstances surrounding the request for rainwater coverage,deepak did not violate its duty of uberrimae fidae owed to new york marine.therefore,we will now ascertain which aspects of deepak claim are covered by the policy as amended by smps and.
deepak asserts that it is an assured under the policy,and new york marine does not dispute this assertion.we agree that deepak is an assured.clause of the policy provides the policy is f or account of whom it may concern.insurance carried for the account of whom it may concern covers anyone having an insurable interest in the insured property at the time of the happening of the loss.the john russell,cir.endorsement nine of the policy specifically lists diammonium phosphate as a good covered by the policy.coverage of the dap attached automatically to the two shipments upon commencement of transit,as provided by clause of the policy which states t his policy attaches to all shipments made on or after may.
the district court awarded to deepak in connection with the dap lost due to the sinking of the lightering barge in the port of kandla.additionally,the district court awarded in connection with the dap lost during discharge at jnpt,the port of distress.see new york marine ii,wl,at.new york marine concedes that,if deepak was entitled to insurance coverage,the district court was correct in awarding these two categories of damages under the policy.
our focus,therefore,is whether deepak is entitled to recover for any other losses incurred.clause delineates the risks covered,which include loss or damage due to a fire or explosion b a stranded,grounded,sunk or capsized vessel c collision of the vessel with any external object or d discharge of cargo at a port of distress.smps and modify this clause by adding the risk of rainwater damage.clause of the icc c terms outlines the duration of insurance coverage.this clause provides that the insurance coverage commenced from the time the dap left tradeline warehouse and continue d during the ordinary course of transit and terminated either on delivery to the final warehouse or storage site at the named destination or on delivery to any other warehouse or storage site,
whether prior to or at the destination named herein,which the assured elect ed to use either for storage other than in the ordinary course of transit or for allocation or distribution or on the expiry of days after completion of discharge overside of the goods hereby insured.
deepak seeks to recover for mt of dap that had been deposited from the lightering barges onto the shore area and was washed away as a result of rising tides and tidal waves.additionally,deepak claims for dap that was damaged by the cyclone on the shore of kandla.the district court concluded that these two claims were not covered.see new york marine ii,wl,at.we agree.
although the smps and amended clause of the icc c provisions to include the risk of rainwater damage,the smps did nothing to alter clause,the duration clause,which terminates coverage upon delivery to any site,either prior to or at the named destination,used for storage or distribution allocation.therefore,once the dap had been offloaded from the sea guardian onto the shore area into the custody of rishi shipping,deepak clearing and forwarding agent,the dap had been delivered to any other warehouse of place of storage and was no longer in the ordinary course of transit under clause.at that point,the insurance coverage terminated,and any loss or damage at that point can not be recovered under the policy.see jomark textiles,int l fire and marine ins,interpreting policy provision virtually identical to clause and holding that where the insured exercised dominion and control over the goods,they were no longer as a matter of law,and therefore,were no longer covered by the policy see also lumber wood,ins,cir same.
clause of the policy,which provides for broader warehouse to warehouse coverage does not affect our determination of deepak coverage with respect to these two claims,because,as we concluded earlier,where there are conflicts between icc c provisions and the policy provisions,the icc c provisions control.similar reasoning defeats deepak arguments for coverage which invoke clause of the policy,entitled shore coverage,providing that where this insurance covers on goods while on any land conveyance while on docks,wharves,quays,or elsewhere on the shore,the perils insured against include cyclone,flood,and rising waters.this clause does not apply here,because such shore coverage was not included in the insurance covering the dap shipments,as demonstrated by the smps adoption of icc c terms.we therefore agree with the district court that new york marine is not liable under the policy,as amended by the smps,for either the approximately mt of dap washed away on the shore of kandla or the approximately mt of dap damaged while at the shore area at kandla.
the next category of loss claimed by deepak amounts to in salvage and reconditioning costs for the dap damaged at the shore of kandla.the district court concluded that,because the damage itself was not covered under the policy,the costs incurred in salvage efforts were likewise not covered.see new york marine ii,wl,at.deepak challenges this conclusion on appeal,and contends that clause of the policy allows it to recover these costs.clause requires the assured to undertake mitigation efforts without jeopardizing the insurance coverage and provides that the mitigation costs are recoverable we reject deepak clause argument.the costs incurred by deepak in salvage efforts are not covered under the policy,because the dap itself was not covered when the damage occurred.as we outlined earlier,the dap was ashore at that point and,therefore,this damage was not covered by virtue of icc c clause.
next,deepak claims that it should have been awarded recovery for forwarding,landing and storage expenses incurred at the port of distress,jnpt and for rainwater damage to mt of dap caused by a leak in a silo at jnpt.the di
