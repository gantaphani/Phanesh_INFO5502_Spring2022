the issue presented in this interlocutory appeal is whether the codification of the maritime safety laws in title creates a cause of action for lay share fishermen under the highest rate of wages provision of,and the liability provisions of.we hold that it does.
this appeal arises out of a compensation dispute between,timothy doyle,greg hagaman,brian lague,anthony richards,and eric edwards the fishermen,former deckhands on the fishing vessels the persistence and relentless,and the corporate owners of the fishing vessels,huntress,and relentless.the fishermen brought suit against the vessel owners in the united states district court for the district of rhode island,alleging that the vessel owners failed to comply with,which requires,among other things,that the owners of a fishing vessel make a written fishing agreement with each seaman employed prior to the voyage.plaintiffs claimed statutory damages under a companion statute.the defendant owners moved for summary judgment,alleging that their lay share fishing agreements did not violate section,does not create a remedy for lay share fishermen,and plaintiffs claims are barred by waiver and laches.the district court concluded that the vessel owners violated the requirements of,doyle huntress,d,and concluded that applies to fishermen,and may be utilized by plaintiffs as a statutory default wage in place of their void contracts with defendants.id.at.the district court thus granted summary judgment in favor of the fishermen as to the application of and to their claims.however,the district court found that genuine issues of material fact remained in dispute as to the defendants defenses of laches and waiver,thus necessitating trial.the district court stayed the proceedings below pending resolution of this interlocutory appeal.
served as deckhands and crewmen aboard the fishing vessels persistence and relentless at various times from until.the vessels are,steel hulled freezer trawlers,weighing in excess of twenty tons each,and operating out of the port of davisville in north kingstown,rhode island.
as is typical in the fishing industry,the vessel owners used the lay share system to compensate the fishermen they employed.the owners generally employed a crew of ten to thirteen per trawler for commercial fishing voyages along the new england and coastline.upon completion of a fishing voyage the vessel owners sold the catch and deducted the trip expenses from the profit.the remaining profit was then be divided,with the vessel owner retaining more than half of the between and the remaining proceeds being divided among the crewmen in the form of lay shares.
the share or fraction of a share each crewman received was determined by the captain of the vessel,based on the fisherman skills and performance on the voyage.the size of the share was not a product of any written agreement with the fisherman made prior to leaving port,and no fisherman was told before the trip exactly what percentage of the net profit he will receive at the end of the voyage.this determination was left to the discretion of the captain based on the performance of the fisherman during the voyage.after the captain calculated the share due each fisherman,the vessel owners issued a check in that amount.more experienced and skilled crewmen are better able to perform highly specialized functions,making them more valuable on a voyage.thus,fishermen with greater experience received a larger share of the profits than less experienced crewmen.
we begin with the question of appellate jurisdiction.although both parties agree that jurisdiction exists in this court to review the district court order granting partial summary judgment,we have an obligation to inquire sua sponte into our jurisdiction over the matter.florio olson,cir.
the underlying action is still pending in the district court and has been stayed until we resolve this question.thus,the district court decision and order granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their claim is not a final decision in the sense required by conferring appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of the district courts.however,congress has created statutory exceptions to the final judgment rule,including a,which allow immediate appeal from some interlocutory orders.section provides that a t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from interlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.see martha vineyard scuba headquarters,unidentified,wrecked and abandoned steam vessel,cir.an interlocutory appeal under a applies to any order that conclusively determines the liability of a party,even if the order leaves unresolved an issue which may ultimately preclude recovery by a particular plaintiff.in re tropic breeze,cir.three prerequisites must be met for this court to have jurisdiction to consider this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a the underlying case must be an admiralty case in which appeals from final decrees are allowed the appeal must be from an interlocutory order or decree of the district court and the order or decree must have determined the rights and liabilities of the parties.wingerter chester quarry,cir citing foulk donjon marine,cir martha vineyard scuba headquarters,at.
admiralty case 
the case at hand arises in admiralty and concerns the interpretation of two statutes that regulate the employment of seamen,and.whether a case is an admiralty case turns on whether the plaintiff properly designated the action as an admiralty case.wingerter,at.federal rule of civil procedure h governs the designation of admiralty claims 
a pleading or count setting forth a claim for relief within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction that is also within the jurisdiction of the district court on some other ground may contain a statement identifying the claim as an admiralty or maritime claim for the purposes of rules c,e,and the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims a case that includes an admiralty or maritime claim within this subdivision is an admiralty case within a.

interlocutory order 
the district court decision and order of january,was plainly interlocutory because it leaves unresolved the defenses of laches and waiver.
rights and liabilities 
finally,to ascertain whether,for purposes of a,the substantive rights and liabilities of these adversaries were sufficiently determined by the order,martha vineyard,at,we must identify a decision on the merits of the claims or defenses underlying the dispute which determines substantive rights.id.
although the district court decision and order did not fully resolve the plaintiffs claims regarding their ultimate damages,it did conclusively determine the substantive grounds of the complaint.the district court determined that defendants the vessel owners had violated the requirements of in the fishing agreements they entered into with plaintiffs the fishermen.huntress,d at.in addition,the court determined that applies to lay share fishermen and therefore could be utilized by plaintiffs as a statutory default wage in place of their void contracts with defendants.id.at.thus,the district court found that plaintiffs were statutorily entitled to recover the highest rate of wages at the port from which the seaman was engaged or the amount agreed to be given the seaman at the time of engagement,whichever is higher.id.at quoting.therefore,the district court granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs as to the application of and.we are satisfied that the district court ruling meets the substantive rights and liabilities prerequisite of a.we conclude,therefore,that we have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal.
we now turn to the merits.the question before this court on interlocutory appeal is whether the partial codification of the maritime laws created a cause of action for lay share fishermen under the highest rate of wages provision of,and the liability provisions of.a question of statutory construction presents a purely legal question therefore,we review de novo.see strickland comm r maine dep t of human,cir.
section provides as follows 
an engagement of a seaman contrary to a law of the united states is void.a seaman so engaged may leave the service of the vessel at any time and is entitled to recover the highest rate of wages at the port from which the seaman was engaged or the amount agreed to be given the seaman at the time of engagement,whichever is higher.
emphasis added.
ordinarily,t he starting point in discerning congressional intent is the existing statutory text.lamie united states,d.w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.dodd united states,d quoting hartford underwriters ins.union planter bank,d.
however,it is well established that there is a presumption against change in codification statutes.i t will not be inferred that congress,in revising and consolidating laws,intended to change their effect,unless such intention is clearly expressed.fourco glass transmirra prods,d see also united states ryder.same tidewater oil united states,d t he function of the revisers of the code was generally limited to that of consolidation and codification c onsequently,a principle governing the interpretation of provisions altered in the revision is that no change is to be presumed unless clearly expressed.quoting fourco glass,at.
in this case,contend that we must look beyond the plain meaning of the text of the statute to legislative history because the exclusionary companion statute to expressly excluded seamen entitled to earn lay shares from entitlement to the highest rate of wages was repealed in the course of the partial recodification of title.see repealed excluding any vessel where the seamen are by custom or agreement entitled to participate in the profits or result of a cruise,or voyage from,among other wage statutes,the highest rate of wages predecessor to.the repeal of this exemption constitutes a major change,which argue should not be inferred.point out that all of the other exemptions that were previously under were recodified in other locations,and is the only wage statute that applies to share fishermen in the recodification.therefore,conjecture that this exemption must have been inadvertently deleted during the codification.
given the presumption against change in codification statutes and the significant,unannounced change congress made in the recodification to the application of the highest rate of wages provision to seamen earning lay shares,we agree that it is appropriate to go beyond the plain meaning of the text of the statute and consider the legislative history.
another significant factor that we must consider in our construction of this statute is the presumption in favor of seamen.l egislation for the benefit of seamen is to be construed liberally in their favor.mcmahon united states.see also isbrandtsen johnson.whenever congressional legislation in aid of seamen has been considered here since,the court has emphasized that such legislation is largely remedial and calls for liberal interpretation in favor of the seamen.this holds true for statutes concerning seamen wages and penalty wages.t he maritime law by inveterate tradition has made the ordinary seaman a member of a favored class.he is a ward of the admiralty,discrimination may thus be rational in respect of remedies for wages.isbrandtsen,at.quoting warner goltra.see also forster oro navigation,cir penalty wages statute,designed to protect seamen,must be liberally interpreted for their benefit.
history of the highest rate of wages provision 
the substance of the highest rate of wages provision was not new when was enacted in.in,congress enacted the statute that eventually became act of july,ch,stat.current version at this statute entitled all seamen engaged contrary to the provisions of any act of congress to the highest wage paid at the port of engagement,or to the agreed wage at that time,there was no provision excluding fisherman employed aboard lay share vessels from this highest rate of wages statute.
during the mid to,however,several federal courts concluded that a lay share is not a wage within the purview of the highest rate of wages statutes.see caffray v.the cornelia kingsland,the ianthe,cas.then,as part of the shipping commissioners act,which imposed new regulations on the burgeoning foreign and intercoastal shipping industry,congress excluded vessels from multiple statutes,including the highest rate of wages statute.see shipping commissioners act of,ch,stat.repealed.these exemptions were later consolidated in.see repealed excluding coastwise vessels and any boat where the seamen are by custom or agreement entitled to participate in the profits or result of a cruise,or voyage from many regulatory statutes reserved for vessels engaged in foreign shipping,including the highest rate of wages predecessor to thus,prior to,lay share vessels were explicitly excluded from the highest rate of wages provision of the predecessor statute to.
more than one hundred years later,as part of its effort to recodify all of the united states code,congress passed an act recodifying the maritime statutes in title.in the course of this revision,the exclusionary statute,was repealed.it was replaced,for the most part,however,by individual exclusions where appropriate.the exclusion of vessels from the highest rate of wage statute,however,was not replaced.
legislative intent 
the presumption that codification is not intended to make changes of substantive law is particularly true where the legislative history shows a positive disclaimer of any such intent.united states standard accident ins,cir citing united states sischo.washington maricopa county,cir.however,we would be hard put to find that congress showed a positive disclaimer of any such intent in this case.this circuit previously noted that the signals in the legislative history of the revision are mixed.united states rivera,cir.t he stated purpose of the legislation was simply to recodify in an organized fashion the law relating to the safety of vessels and protection of seamen.id.both the senate and house reports emphasize repeatedly that no substantive changes of a controversial nature were intended.see,at the purpose of,as reported,is to restate without substantive changes of a controversial nature,the existing laws governing commercial shipping and navigation and recreational boating,principally contained in title of the,at,reprinted in same.the senate report even cited to supreme court case law discussing the presumption against substantive change as follows in a codification statute the courts uphold the presumption no change in law is intended unless clearly expressed,at citing fourco glass,at.tidewater oil,at.muñiz hoffman,d.
despite these disclaimers,congress anticipated questions about the substantive revisions made to the laws.
the committee wants to make it clear that the bill does in fact make a great many substantive changes to the present law.those changes are all either minor changes,adjustments,or modifications,or they are more significant changes to which the committee received no objection and which the committee believed would enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the law and the sic generally accepted by the industry.thus,if a comparison of the language of this bill with the existing law shows that a substantive change has resulted,it should be understood that that change was intended by the committee.the committee intends and hopes that the interpretation of the maritime safety laws as codified and enacted by this bill will be based on the language of the bill itself.the bill,as reported,is based on that premise.there should,therefore,be little or no occasion to refer to the statutes being repealed in order to interpret the provisions of this bill.the committee also feels,as the courts have held,that the literal language of the statute should control the disposition of cases.there is no mandate in logic or in case law for reliance on legislative history to reach a result contrary to the plain meaning of the statute,particularly where that plain meaning is in no way unreasonable.
at,reprinted in,emphasis added.
appellants point to carbo united states,d,in which the supreme court rejected the claim that congress had substantively changed the law in a new codification statute,explaining that a fter almost two hundred years,we can not now say it has been abandoned by a congress which expressly said it intended to make no substantive changes.id.at.but in the present case,congress expressly stated that it had in fact ma d e a great many substantive changes to the present law,at.thus,although congress disclaimed any intent to make substantive,controversial changes,congress recognized that it made many substantive changes and stated that where the existing law shows that a substantive change has resulted,it should be understood that that change was intended by the committee,at,
while the direction in the house report is clearly to rely on the plain meaning when interpreting the new statutes,the report also indicates that the committee intended to make no substantive changes that were objected to by any affected party or that the committee felt would be a significant change in maritime policy or that would adversely affect any rights,benefits,or duties of those impacted by this bill.id.at emphasis added.the vessel owners argue that repeal of the exclusion of lay share fishermen from the highest rate of wages provision adversely affects the owners of commercial fishing vessels.however,although the vessel owners cite the testimony of a representative of the fishing industry before congress,they have not identified any instance in which any affected party objected to the repeal of this exclusion as the revision wound its way through congress as congress stated 
the maritime community has been aware of and has actively participated in this revision of the maritime safety laws since when the project was in its initial stages within the coast guard.provisions in the early draft that were objectionable have been removed or altered.the remaining substantive changes are deemed noncontroversial by virtue of the fact that there has been no objection raised to them during the two and one half years in which the maritime community has examined and commented on each successive draft.
at,emphasis added.
because the legislative history provides mixed signals,we do not apply the presumption of recodification that congress did not intend substantive changes.
scrivener error 
if appellants believe that congress inadvertently removed the provision during the course of the revision,then their proper course of action would be to request that congress correct the alleged error by the exclusionary language.cite to the recent supreme court case,koons buick pontiac gmc,nigh,d,and ask us to follow the recommendation of the concurring opinion of justices stevens and breyer by following common sense rather than giving effect to a scrivener error.id.at stevens,concurring.however,i f congress enacted into law something different from what it intended,then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.it is beyond our province to rescue congress from its drafting errors,and to provide for what we might think is the preferred result.lamie united states trustee,d internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.see also koons buick.at scalia,dissenting same.
d.the common law 
also argue that the statutes at issue here do not create a cause of action under the highest rate of wages provision for lay share fishermen because the common law principle was,and still remains,that statutory wage provisions do not generally apply to fishermen earning lay shares.in support of this argument,the vessel owners point to two nineteenth century cases that declined to apply the old highest rate of wages provision to fishermen earning lay shares,despite the absence of a statutory exclusion for lay share fishermen.see,the cornelia kingsland,at treating fishermen differently than seamen the ianthe,cas.at.
in the cornelia kingsland,several lay fishermen brought a claim under a predecessor to of the revised the highest rate of wages.the southern district of new york held against the fishermen because it found that the highest rate of wages provision was intended to apply to seamen,and that fishermen had been treated as distinct from seamen in all legislation the language of the provision seemed more appropriate to a seaman earning a sum agreed upon rather than an agreement for a lay subject to general average distribution and that engaging seamen through oral contracts was not contrary to the provisions of any act of congress because no act of congress required that agreements with fishermen be in writing at that time.the cornelia kingsland,at.in the ianthe,lay share fishermen made a similar claim and the district court of maine also found that the act made no provision for fishermen employed without a written agreement.cas.at.
times have changed,and we see no reason to rely on these cases in our decision today.first,this court observed as early as that f ishermen are seamen,having uses and customs peculiar to their business,but are at the same time,except as modified by their peculiar contracts,express or implied,protected by law as other seamen are.for their wages they can look to the vessel,her master,and ordinarily her owners.the carrier dove,cir see also cromwell slaney,same tran captain glyn,fishermen are seamen under the jones act,for the purpose of maintenance and cure,and wage relief.second,as we discuss more fully below,we do not find that the disparity between determining the amount a seaman and a lay fisherman should receive bars application of the highest rate of wages provision to lay share fishermen.we agree with the ninth circuit that should be construed as entitl ing the wronged seaman to recover either his promised wages or the highest rate of wages of a seaman of comparable rating at the port from which he was engaged,whichever is higher.tcw special credits chloe z fishing,emphasis added.third,unlike what the court found in the cornelia kingsland,there is a violation of an act of congress in this case thus the fishermen were engaged contrary to law.section is the liability section,and it clearly lays out requirements for fishing agreements the district court determined that the vessel owners failed to meet those requirements.
furthermore,the statutes considered in the cornelia kingsland and the ianthe,which are older versions of and,have been repealed and replaced with new code sections multiple times.as the alaska supreme court noted in bjornsson dominator,reliance on the older statutes is misplaced,alaska.therefore,rather than relying on these outdated cases,we focus on interpreting the applicable statute.
e.our reading of the statute 
the most natural meaning of the text of is that it declares a n engagement of a seaman contrary to a law of the united states is void,and provides remedies for the seaman.
the cardinal rule is that a statute is to be read as a whole,since the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.conroy aniskoff,d.section is located in part g,merchant seaman protection and relief,of subtitle ii of title.the provisions of part g form an interlocking whole and are exclusively concerned with regulating the relationship between seamen and the masters and owners of the vessels in which they set out to sea.rivera,at torruella,concurring.reading the highest rate of wages provision in the context of the rest of part g,it seems appropriate that the provision should be applied to violations of lay share fishing agreements.
the most natural reading of the term seaman in is that seaman encompasses lay share fishermen.section provides remedies for a seaman who is engaged con
