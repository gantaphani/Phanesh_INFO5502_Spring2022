this case involves an,container filled with perfumes and cosmetics shipped from france to florida that mysteriously disappeared while in a marine terminal at port everglades,florida.the cargo insurer brought a subrogation action against the carrier,the port terminal operator,and the port security provider.the carrier and the terminal operator each brought against the security provider for indemnity and contribution.
in resolving this dispute,this court once again navigates through the muddy waters of determining the meaning of package under of the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa or the act.et.subsection limits carrier liability to per package,but fails to define the term package.in this case,the district court deemed each of the cartons,all but two of which were wrapped onto a total of pallets,a package for purposes of liability.the court also dismissed both claims and appellants against the security provider.
on appeal,the carrier and port terminal operator argue that the district court erred in ruling that the package limitation applied to the cartons instead of to either the one sealed container or,in the alternative,to the pallets plus two cartons that the district court erred in dismissing the insurer claim against the security provider and that the district court erred in denying the carrier and port terminal operator indemnity from the security provider.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
parbel is a florida company that imports products from france.in,parbel ordered a shipment consisting of four containers from parfums et beaute international et cie parfums,which shipped the order on the nedlloyd holland,a ship operated by containers.contracted to deliver the shipment from lehavre,france,to parbel warehouse in miami,florida.after the nedlloyd holland arrived at port everglades in lauderdale,florida,the containers were from the ship and stored in a container yard operated by service,until delivery to the consignee in miami.sometime between december and december,one of the containers mysteriously disappeared.
the perfumes and cosmetics in the missing container were packed into a total of corrugated cardboard cartons.these small cartons were then consolidated into larger units,which were bound together with plastic wrap and packed onto pallets,with two cartons remaining.
groupe.de chalus groupe chegaray parbel subrogated insurer,paid for the loss under a cargo insurance policy and brought a subrogation action against and together,appellants,as well as wells fargo guard service,wells fargo.the district court found in an omnibus summary judgment order that the number of packages under cogsa was and that appellants were jointly and severally liable for groupe chegaray damages up to after a bench trial,the court also dismissed both groupe chegaray and appellants claims against wells fargo.

we note at the outset that we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and the district court findings of fact for clear error.see levinson reliance std.life ins,cir.
cogsa claims 
cogsa lineage dates back to with the harter act,which was relied upon by the hague rules in,which were in turn adopted at the international convention for the unification of certain rules relating to bills of lading at the brussels convention of.see laurence alexander,comment,containerization,the per package limitation,and the concept of fair opportunity.law.in,congress adopted the language of cogsa almost in its entirety.see monica textile tana,cir citing robert herd krawill mach,d spartus yafo,cir.congress did change liability under in one significant respect,however.the international rules limit liability per package or unit,whereas limits it per package or in the case of goods not shipped in packages,per customary freight unit.see hartford fire ins.pacific far east line,cir.arguably,this change underscores the emphasis that congress placed on the package as the elemental unit of liability for purposes.despite this emphasis,congress neither defined the term in the statute nor left behind any legislative history to help courts do so.see id.at see also monica textile,at.
in addition to the lack of statutory guidance,unforeseeable technological strides in the shipping industry since have contributed to the frustration of many courts attempting to define a cogsa package.traditionally,shipments were made by breakbulk,whereby goods were packaged into parcels which could be into a vessel.see nancy sharp,comment,what is a cogsa package,pace int l.the advent of the container in the revolutionized the shipping industry by enabling the shipment of massive metal boxes filled with goods that were often concealed not divided into breakbulk size.see id.modern containers are able to hold hundreds of packages as the term was probably understood in.the very concept of a was transformed when vessels were retrofitted to hold containers,which functionally became part of the ship itself.see leather best,mormaclynx,cir mitsui,american export lines,cir.thus,if ever the meaning of a package was,the container turned it into a puzzle and,of course,there remains consideration of the decrease in the value of the dollar between,when cogsa set the amount,and the present.
moreover,while it is generally understood that cogsa liability limitation was originally enacted in order to restrain the superior bargaining power wielded by carriers over shippers,vegas compania anonima venezolana de navegacion,cir per curiam,the bulk of modern litigation under consists of subrogation actions because cargo shippers,instead of paying increased freight by declaring the value of what is shipped,buy insurance from cargo insurers.see nichimen at cir leather best,at.as the second circuit remarked in nichimen,most cargo damage actions are really battles between insurers and there is thus no need for shedding crocodile tears on behalf of the shipper or consignee.at.
in this case,parbel chose to buy full value insurance coverage and to the value of its shipment,thereby obtaining the lowest freight rate.by doing so,parbel paid approximately less in freight than it would have paid had it declared the containers actual value.appellants argue that because parbel protected itself by obtaining insurance coverage,we should resolve any ambiguities in the contract against parbel and its subrogated insurer.while it is true that shippers have a choice when declaring the value of their shipments and that insurers assume the risk associated with their services,appellants argument begs the inescapable statutory question presented by,which we now address.
application of cogsa ex proprio vigore 
appellants argue that because the container was lost after it was discharged from the nedlloyd holland,cogsa does not apply ex proprio vigore to the facts of this case,but only as a contract term.in support of their argument,they cite to cogsa e,which defines carriage of goods to cover the period of time when the goods are loaded onto the ship to when they are discharged from the ship.accordingly,appellants argue that the trial court erred in applying the legal definition of package under cogsa and that,instead,the court should have applied the principles of contract interpretation to determine the meaning that the parties intended to assign to the term package.
we disagree and find that the bill of lading is fully subject to the provisions of cogsa.we arrive at this conclusion for two independent reasons.first,clause of bill of lading explicitly incorporates cogsa as paramount throughout the time the goods are in the custody of or its subcontractor at the sea terminal and until they are delivered to the consignee in miami second,appellants explicitly stipulated the application of cogsa to the facts of this case in their march stipulation as well as in each of their april motions for partial summary judgment as to the liability limitation under 
discrepancy between shipper and carrier bill of lading 
in order to determine what constitutes the cogsa package,we begin by looking at the bill of lading.see,oriental knight,cir quoting binladen bsb landscaping nedlloyd rotterdam,cir.here,altered the bill of lading that parbel shipping agent,ocetra,submitted to along with the containers.specifically,what ocetra bill of lading refers to as pallets,the rider to on board bill of lading refers to as packages.the question is whether bill of lading is enforceable as to the description of the pallets as packages.we believe that it is.
ocetra bill of lading is almost identical to rider,except that packages are described in ocetra bill of lading as pallets.
groupe chegaray argues that we should not accept revised bill of lading as the manifestation of the parties contract because by the time the shipper received a copy of the revision,the goods were already aboard the nedlloyd holland,thus giving the shipper no means by which to reject the change.groupe chegaray also contends that the revision violated cogsa,which requires,in certain circumstances,that carriers issue bills of lading reflecting the shipper stated representations of the number of shipped packages.appellants maintain that it is not only customary for a carrier to issue the final bill of lading,but that,in this case,ocetra had specifically requested a clean on board bill of lading and voiced no objection when it received the final bill of lading with the altered language.
it is remarkable that after so many decades and dollars spent litigating the package liability limitation clause under,the shipping industry has not yet settled upon a sound strategy for protecting both parties interests.while courts have struggled to modernize the language of,the industry seems to have neglected to do its part.appellants protest that they are helpless to demand a clear and explicit statement from shippers as to the number of cogsa packages,even though it presumably would enable them to calculate an appropriate surcharge.they claim that charging freight according to the number of declared cogsa packages is not feasible because the fixed industry custom is to charge freight by weight and declared excess value.while we are to argue with over one hundred years of shipping expertise,we remain confounded by the inefficiencies exemplified in this case.carriers seem unable to protect their interests and,the law clearly being in their favor,shippers seem to have grown too complacent to make their interests explicit.
fault,nevertheless,does not fall on the parties alone.cogsa operates by law and,while the parties intent is a factor,it is not determinative of the meaning of package under the statute.perhaps,as the second circuit noted decades ago regarding,this area is one in which the search for predictability and avoidance of litigation will go on regardless of what we may do until there is a legislative solution the courts will have to deal with the cases as they arise.cameco,american legion,overruled in part by mitsui,at.
groupe chegaray cites to belize trading,sun insurance,cir,to support its argument that the description in ocetra bill of lading is controlling.in belize trading,the carrier issued a bill of lading listing only the number of containers under the description of packages and goods column,even though the shipper had submitted a packing list indicating the number of cartons within each container.see id.at.the district court held that the carrier bill of lading was controlling for purposes,but this court reversed,stating that the carrier descriptions were unilateral and rather than accurate.see id.at.
the belize trading court based its decision on two grounds.first,although the court acknowledged that it is customary in the shipping industry for carriers to issue bills of lading upon stowing the cargo aboard the vessels,the carrier in belize trading had not issued its revised bills of lading until after the vessel had left port and part of its cargo had been lost at sea.at.for this reason,the court found that the shippers never actually accepted the carrier bills of lading and,thus,those bills of lading were unenforceable.see id.at.second,the court noted that the carrier bills of lading fell afoul of cogsa see id.
the facts in this case are quite different from those in belize trading.here,the cargo was not loaded aboard the nedlloyd holland until december,when issued its bill of lading ocetra received revised bill of lading when the cargo was put aboard the contracted ship,as is required for clean on board bills of lading.ocetra was anticipating receipt of an on board bill of lading from.in fact,it had demanded it.clearly,ocetra could not have believed that its bill of lading represented the final manifestation of the parties contract.when ocetra did receive bill of lading,it voiced absolutely no objection to the changed language.indeed,ocetra conceded to the changed language through its silence and inaction coupled with the parties expectation that would be issuing a final bill of lading.although the record is unclear whether ocetra could have retrieved its containers before the nedlloyd holland set sail,at the very least it could have registered opposition.appellee is estopped from now claiming that the revision was unacceptable to the shipper at the time.see mitsui,at.
moreover,unlike in belize trading,this is not a case in which the carrier erased altogether any mention of the number of cartons from its final bill of lading.rather,preserved and detailed all of the relevant information that ocetra had submitted,including the number of cartons contained in the pallets.and,in light of ocetra failure to furnish a proper description of packages,it was perfectly reasonable for to interpret a pallet as a package.
finally,we believe that did not violate because it was not under an obligation to list the number of cartons in the bill of lading.under c,a carrier is not bound to state upon its bill of lading any quantity which it has had no reasonable means of checking.because the cartons were packaged together in to mention the fact that the pallets were themselves sealed away within the was no reasonable way for to check that the number of cartons ocetra listed on its bill of lading was in fact the actual number of cartons bound together upon the pallets.
in this case,the district court accepted bill of lading as the manifestation of the parties contract.see zurich int l france containers,d.as mentioned above,we believe that the district court was correct in so doing.we now proceed to review the court analysis of the package liability issue under the terms of the final bill of lading.
number of cogsa packages 
appellants argue that the number of cogsa packages is four because is listed in the bill of lading under the heading no.of pkgs.in the alternative,they argue that the pallets plus two cartons are the cogsa packages because they are described as such in the bill of lading.groupe chegaray,on the other hand,contends that because the bill of lading is ambiguous regarding the number of cogsa packages,we are required to resolve the ambiguity in their favor and affirm the district court finding that the cartons constitute the cogsa packages.we believe that the pallets,described as packages in the bill of lading,plus the two cartons,represent the accurate number of cogsa packages.
in this circuit,we approach any attempt to define a container as a cogsa package with great reluctance.moreover,our inquiry into the matter does not end at a quick glance at the number of packages column on the bill of lading.fishman tobin,tropical shipping constr,cir footnote omitted see also monica textile,at noting that courts have consistently cast a jaundiced eye upon agreements that containers be cogsa packages.
even if we were not reluctant to take the container as the package,appellants principal argument does not withstand analysis under,supra,the case which sets out the two basic rules in this circuit for determining the number of cogsa packages in container cases 
when a bill of lading discloses the number of cogsa packages in a container,the liability limitation of section applies to those packages but when a bill of lading lists the number of containers as the number of packages,and fails to disclose the number of cogsa packages within each container,the liability limitation of section applies to the containers themselves.
