this appeal primarily concerns the proper application of the presumption of fault,applicable in maritime law,known as the oregon rule.see the oregon.hornbeck offshore transportation,llc hornbeck appeals from the january,judgment of the district court kevin fox,magistrate judge,finding hornbeck liable to zerega avenue realty zerega and fred todino sons,todino sons for more than million in damages.see zerega avenue realty hornbeck offshore transportation,llc,civ,wl.the damages were awarded because of an allision between hornbeck barge and a bulkhead on zerega property abutting westchester creek in bronx county,new york.hornbeck principally claims that the court erred by applying a presumption in favor of zerega on the issue of causation and by excluding the testimony of hornbeck experts.we conclude that the oregon rule presumption of fault does not shift from a plaintiff the burden of proving causation,and that the preclusion of hornbeck expert testimony was an abuse of discretion.we therefore reverse the judgment,vacate the award,and remand.
background 
zerega and todino sons own property along westchester creek the zerega property.at the waterfront of the zerega property,there is a bulkhead also called a retaining wall or relieving platform and,farther inland,a office building with a basement.hornbeck owns and operates the tug stapleton service the tug and the barge energy the barge,which is approximately feet long and to feet wide.
in october,the commenced an action for damages against their insurance carriers and hornbeck.the amended complaint alleged that on october,hornbeck barge,while being pulled by its tug,struck the bulkhead on the zerega property due to hornbeck negligent operation while traveling south on westchester creek.it further alleged that the allision resulted in the rapid and severe weakening of the bulkhead,which caused most of the bulkhead to collapse nearly two weeks later.the sought damages for repair of the bulkhead and the office building.after a bench trial,the magistrate judge found hornbeck liable for negligently causing damage to the bulkhead and the office building and entered an award of,plus pre and interest,in favor of zerega and todino sons 
the magistrate judge,trying the case by consent,see c,found that hornbeck tug was pulling the barge,in light condition,southbound in westchester creek toward unionport bridge.the tug was being operated by mate steven spurlock with assistance from training mate eric fuerstinger.spurlock and fuerstinger stalled the vessels in the immediate vicinity of the zerega property in midafternoon,while waiting in the narrow channel for the unionport bridge to open.during that time,spurlock became concerned that the stern of the barge was drifting too close to the bulkhead of the zerega property,and that the wind,which the court found to be blowing toward the bulkhead,would cause the barge in its light condition to hit the retaining wall.spurlock maneuvered the tug in an attempt to straighten the barge.as the court found,spurlock could not see the rear end of the barge while operating the tug,and fuerstinger did not have a direct view of the rear of the barge on the starboard side.
the court found,on the testimony of four witnesses,that the barge allided with the bulkhead structure on the zerega property.christopher todino todino,principal of todino sons,and his business guest,michael justino justino,were meeting in an office located at the southern end of the office building at around.they each testified that they suddenly felt a strong jolt and observed from the office window a barge being pulled away from the zerega property by a tug.louis bruno,an office manager of todino sons,working in the center of the office building at around,testified that he felt a thump,heard todino and justino yelling,and ran to a window from which he observed a barge being pulled away from the bulkhead by a tug.laura bruno,of todino sons,testified that,upon hearing todino and justino yelling,she went to a window of the office building and observed a barge being pulled away from the zerega property by a tug.
at trial,there was no dispute that on november,nearly two weeks after the allision,a significant portion of the bulkhead on the zerega property collapsed into westchester creek.however,the parties disputed the cause of the collapse and sought to introduce the opinions of expert witnesses to support their competing theories.zerega was permitted to introduce the expert testimony of steven schneider schneider,a professional engineer,that the bulkhead structure collapsed because either a hornbeck barge struck the retaining wall,causing the piles to shift,and,as the piles moved back,they ripped the planking hardware off the steel,which undermined the retaining wall or b timber or a pole latched on to hornbeck barge,was dragged along the face of the retaining wall,like a stick being pulled along a picket fence,and destroyed the planking that was holding the earth underneath the structure in place,thereby causing the structure to collapse.
the court precluded hornbeck from introducing the expert testimony of roderic ellman ellman and pierce power power,both professional engineers.preclusion was ordered because the court deemed hornbeck to have failed to comply with a pretrial order of the court.that order stated that on or before march,the parties shall provide to the court such information as they reasonably believe will enable the court to fulfill the gatekeeping responsibilities imposed upon it by the supreme court in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.
ellman,one of the precluded witnesses,would have offered the opinion that the cause of the bulkhead collapse was horizontal forces applied from the direction of the land against the bulkhead structure,whose wood pilings had become disconnected due to the corrosion of the metal fasteners and had deteriorated due to the natural biological decay of the timber.power would have offered the opinion that the barge did not strike the bulkhead.
although the testimony of ellman was precluded,hornbeck was permitted to introduce other evidence regarding the deterioration of the bulkhead.hornbeck introduced the pretrial deposition testimony of paul cirillo,who owned the zerega property from the late to the,that a sinkhole would develop in the bulkhead structure every eight to twelve months and require filling,and that in july and august of,he observed a small sinkhole in the bulkhead of the zerega property,which grew larger over time.spurlock and fuerstinger also stated through direct testimony that they observed a sinkhole on the zerega property when they passed it on october.the district court determined that the testimony of cirillo,spurlock,and fuerstinger lacked credibility in light of the totality of the evidence and inconsistencies brought out during.see zerega avenue realty,wl,at.apart from that testimony,the only other evidence on which hornbeck relied was the testimony of stanley white white,zerega expert on the amount of damages.white acknowledged on that more than one plausible explanation for the bulkhead collapse existed and that certain hardware was missing from the area where the bulkhead collapsed,but also stated that the hardware could be at the bottom of the creek.
in determining hornbeck liability,the district court applied what is known in admiralty law as the oregon rule.the court stated the rule as follows it is a proposition of maritime collision law that when a moving vessel collides with a stationary object,an inference of negligence arises and the burden is then upon the owners of the vessel to rebut the inference of negligence.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court ruled that,once zerega established that the barge struck the bulkhead,a presumption arose that the barge was being negligently operated.the court further ruled that hornbeck could rebut that presumption by showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that it acted with reasonable care,that the allision was the fault of the stationary object,or that the allision was an unavoidable accident.see id.at.
implicitly concluding that hornbeck had not rebutted the inferenc
