assuming arguendo that the consent to removal submitted by dees was not properly authorized prior to the expiration of the removal period and that formal authorization was required,we find the circumstances in this case to be exceptional.specifically,we note that the board attempted to schedule a meeting prior to the expiration of the removal period,that the chairman of the board was also a plaintiff in the case,that dees was informally authorized and filed an otherwise proper consent,and that the board ultimately ratified dees conduct.based on the unique circumstances of this case,we agree with the district court s conclusion that the equitable exception stated in getty oil applies.getty oil,at noting that e xceptional circumstances might permit removal even when a defendant fails to comply fully with within the removal period.
