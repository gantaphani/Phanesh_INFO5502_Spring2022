background 
olympic,a washington limited liability corporation,is the legal owner of the fierce packer,a ship chartered to interisland maritime services,imar,on november.the bareboat charter agreement required that imar be responsible for all operating,crew,maintenance,repair,and insurance costs during the charter period.during the imar charter period,olympic played no role either in the hiring and control of the crew,or in the navigation of the ship.
while negotiating the charter agreement,ron ellis ellis,the president of imar,inquired as to the availability of a crew for the fierce packer.ellis was put in touch with skagvik,who had previously served as master of the fierce packer on a number of voyages operated by olympic.ellis hired skagvik to be captain of the fierce packer on november,orally promising him a day for his work on the ship during the imar charter period,and asked him to put a crew together.skagvik never signed a written employment contract with imar.on the same day,ellis hired mallars as chief engineer,orally promising him a day for his work on the ship during the imar charter period.like skagvik,mallars never signed a written contract with imar for his employment,though he did initial certain parts of a document that ellis showed him that outlined his job responsibilities,but omitted his wage and the duration of his employment.
the fierce packer set sail from seattle,washington,to honolulu,hawaii,on november.upon arriving in honolulu,additional crew were hired to work on the fierce packer.ellis hired rodriguez as a on december,orally promising him a day for his work on the fierce packer.while rodriguez never signed an employment contract with imar,he initialed the same document that was initialed by mallars.on january,ellis hired madeja to be a mate on the fierce packer at the rate of a day.madeja worked on the fierce packer for only a short time,ending his employment there on january,finally,on january,skagvik hired his son,olafsson,with ellis approval to work as chief mate at the rate of a day.olafsson flew from seattle to honolulu with the expectation that he would be reimbursed for travel expenses exceeding.while olafsson knew of the imar charter when he agreed to work on the fierce packer,and considered himself imar employee,he never signed a written employment contract with imar.
while in hawaii under the imar charter,the fierce packer went on three trips to christmas and fanning islands.the first trip was from december,to january,the second trip was from january to,and the final trip was from february to.
after the second trip,skagvik and mallars spoke with kim hansen hansen,the president of kim hansen enterprises,khe,a subsidiary corporation of olympic responsible for managing the fierce packer.they told hansen that ellis was behind on payments to the crew and that shippers were beginning to complain about ellis.hansen asked skagvik and mallars to investigate the possibility of conducting further cargo runs to christmas and fanning islands through hansen,rather than through imar.soon after,olafsson and mallars spoke with leif anderson anderson,the of imar,about the possibility of continuing cargo operations under hansen management.anderson supported this proposal and,on february,transmitted a letter to hansen asking that olympic take over management of the fierce packer.
when the fierce packer returned to honolulu on february,mallars,olafsson,rodriguez,and skagvik learned that imar was in bankruptcy and that they had been fired for allegedly consuming alcohol while on the fierce packer.that same day,skagvik called hansen to inform him of imar bankruptcy and the crew termination.hansen asked skagvik to stay on the fierce packer,keep it operational,and wait for paul schultz schultz,a khe employee and the fierce packer vessel operations manager,who would be traveling to hawaii from korea.according to skagvik,olafsson,and mallars,hansen asked that the rest of the crew stay on the fierce packer to await schultz arrival.skagvik,mallars,and olafsson complied with this request rodriguez terminated his employment on the fierce packer on february.while skagvik maintained that hansen promised the crew payment for its work on the vessel after february,hansen denied making any commitments to skagvik on behalf of khe or olympic on february,schultz arrived in honolulu.while appellants asserted that schultz orally promised to pay them for work performed after being fired by imar on february,schultz denied having made any commitments to the crew in that regard 
after schultz arrived,skagvik,mallars,and olafsson worked under his direction.they maintained the fierce packer systems and generators,kept the ship clean,made necessary repairs,informally kept watch on the ship,and moved the vessel three times to accommodate other cargo ships.additionally,schultz,skagvik,mallars,and olafsson further investigated the possibility of an additional cargo trip to christmas and fanning islands under hansen management.while neither schultz nor hansen committed the fierce packer to another cargo voyage,skagvik,mallars,and olafsson created a flier to advertise the runs,faxed copies of the flier to potential customers,talked with customers by cellular phone about the possibility of cargo transport and received some cargo from customers to ship to christmas and fanning islands 
at some point after february,schultz received a check for owed to imar for cargo transported during the imar charter period.the check was written to cash and olafsson cashed the check for schultz because schultz did not have the requisite two pieces of identification.from this sum,schultz paid each to skagvik,mallars,and olafsson,and to rodriguez and at some point between february and march,schultz asked the crew if they would be willing to work for half their usual wage.skagvik and mallars refused this offer and left honolulu on march,according to schultz,only olafsson agreed to the arrangement.however,while olafsson remained on the fierce packer until march,he denied having agreed to a reduced rate of pay 
skagvik and mallars were not paid for work done between february and march.olafsson was not paid for work done between february and march.beginning february,appellants repeatedly made demands on olympic,through khe,for their unpaid wages.shortly thereafter,appellants commenced this action and had the fierce packer arrested as security for their wage claims.olafsson remained on the vessel nearly hours a day,taking care of the fierce packer while it was in custody.to secure the fierce packer release,olympic paid appellants wage claims,as demanded in the affidavits attached to their verified complaint,and posted a bond 
the litigation over who owed the wages and in what amounts proceeded and,shortly before trial,appellants attempted to obtain a statement and documents from anne stevens stevens,an agent of olympic.appellees moved to exclude this evidence at trial and the court granted this motion,finding that appellants request was untimely.
after trial,the district court found that the fierce packer was liable in rem for wages due under the imar charter,but that the vessel was discharged of this liability when olympic paid appellants wages to get the fierce packer released from custody.the court also found that olympic was liable in personam for wages due appellants in the charter period and awarded compensatory damages and interest from the date the wages were due.the court,however,denied appellants penalty wage claim under,finding that there was no discrete,specific,or imminent voyage planned for the fierce packer during the charter period.additionally,the district court rejected appellants wrongful termination claims and request for attorney fees.

iii.discussion 
attorney fees 
initially,we reject appellants request in the district court for attorney fees.the equitable grant of attorney fees is appropriate in admiralty only when the shipowner acted arbitrarily,recalcitrantly,or unreasonably.vaughan atkinson,d kopczynski v.the jacqueline,cir.appellants assert that olympic acted with bad faith both before and during the litigation,and that the district court therefore erred when it refused to award them attorney fees.
these allegations of bad faith fail because there is no evidence that olympic was intentionally dishonest or recalcitrant either in refusing to pay appellants wage claims or in defending against these claims.the district court reasonably concluded that olympic justifiably expected the crew to seek payment from imar for work performed during the imar charter period and that hansen and schultz were credible witnesses when testifying that they never promised to compensate the crew for work on the fierce packer.these finding of good faith are not clearly erroneous as such,they are entitled to deference.see exxon sofec,cir special deference is paid to a trial court credibility findings,aff,d finally,there is no evidence that olympic was intentionally dishonest or recalcitrant during the course of litigation.the district court clearly has discretion to award punitive attorney fees when shipowners,for example,frustrate claims by willfully disregarding court orders,noritake hellenic champion,cir,or by frivolously delaying litigation,h a trading margo farms caribe,wl,at.there simply is no evidence in the record,however,to substantiate appellants claim that the district court abused its discretion by not finding olympic guilty of such obstruction.
rule b amendment 
additionally,the district court correctly denied appellants motion under federal rule of civil procedure b to conform their complaint to the evidence.while leave to amend should be granted freely until the defendant files a responsive pleading,after such point,leave to amend should be granted unless amendment would cause prejudice to the opposing party,is sought in bad faith,is futile,or creates undue delay.yakama indian nation.dep t of revenue,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.with regard to the penalty wage claims except those against olympic for wrongful termination,the district court clearly considered these claims on the merits,making appellants rule b motion irrelevant.with regard to appellants wrongful termination claim,while the district court did exclude consideration of this claim against olympic,it denied the motion because olympic did not have sufficient notice.because rule b does not permit amendments to include issues which are only inferentially suggested by incidental evidence in the record,campbell,at,and because the record supports the district court finding that olympic would have been prejudiced by lack of notice,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants rule b motion.
the district court also correctly rejected appellants rule b motion to cure,for purposes of their in rem action,a failure to verify the amount of wages due.appellants never explain how a motion to conform could have cured their complaint.given the complaint complete absence of wage verification,merely conforming the complaint would not have cured the verification deficiency thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to conform the complaint to the evidence.
verification of post imar wages 
admiralty supplemental rule c a of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that when a party pursues an in rem action to enforce a maritime lien,the complaint for such an action must be verified.united states argent chem,cir under the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims,an in rem action begins with a complaint that must be verified on oath or solemn affirmation and that must describe with reasonable particularity the property that is the subject of the action.quoting supplemental rule c.
although appellants affidavits were attached to their complaint,these affidavits only pertained to wages due as of february,they were completely silent with regard to wages due appellants for the period.appellants never filed supplemental affidavits to verify the complaint allegations of wages due for the period the district court correctly concluded that because appellants claims for wages owed during the charter period were not verified,no lien attached to the fierce packer,in rem.
appellants contend that their claims should be considered in light of the trial testimony for the purpose of verification.but they have cited no case which holds that an unverified complaint can be cured by trial testimony to the contrary,controlling precedent dictates that appellants failure to verify their complaint deprived the district court of in rem jurisdiction.united states currency,cir,rev on other grounds,republic bank united states,d see also pizani cotton blossom,cir supplemental rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure requires the filing of a verified complaint as a prerequisite to obtaining in rem jurisdiction.amstar alexandros,both supplemental rule b and supplemental rule c require that an action of this sort be instituted by means of a verified complaint,aff,cir.given that the complaint failed entirely to verify the wage claims,the district court lacked in rem jurisdiction over those claims.accordingly,the district court correctly held that no lien for appellants wage claims could attach to the fierce packer in rem for period wage claims.
d.other wage and penalty claims 
olympic also is not liable in personam either for,wages due appellants,or for wrongful termination penalty wages under c appellants contend that the district court erred in finding that olympic had sufficient cause to withhold payment of wages,thereby erroneously exonerating olympic from in personam liability for penalty wages.appellants contend that olympic,as the fierce packer owner,had no cause to deny its liability for these wages on account of the lien against the vessel for unpaid imar charter period wages.this contention,however,ignores that a valid bareboat charter agreement existed between olympic and imar through february.under this charter,imar became the fierce packer de facto owner and,as such,only imar is liable in personam for these seamen wage claims.see everett united states,cir.ownership of the fierce packer reverted back to olympic after imar bankruptcy,but,given imar ownership of the fierce packer during its charter period,it was reasonable for olympic to conclude that it was not liable in personam for imar wrongful discharge of appellants and that imar was ultimately responsible for the crew,wage claims.while the crew could and did pursue their in rem claims against the fierce packer,which ultimately required olympic to pay the crew wages to get its vessel released from arrest,olympic justifiably denied in personam liability.see mateo kiso,cir explaining that the phrase without sufficient cause in g means arbitrary,unwarranted,unjust,and unreasonable conduct.
