northern queen,northern queen brings this matter pursuant to the limitation of liability act,et.after its fishing vessel tragically sank with all hands on board,northern queen brought suit seeking to limit its liability to the estate of the vessel captain.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for northern queen,holding that the primary duty doctrine precluded the captain estate from recovering.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to,and we affirm.
northern queen is a small corporation that had two principal shareholders blake kinnear kinnear,the president,managing agent and captain of the corporations primary asset the fishing ship lin j the vessel or the lin j,and kinnear mother linda kinnear,the corporation 
in march,american vessels were completing the opelio crab season in the northwest section of the bering sea one such ship was the lin on march,kinnear sent to his mother and his wife,indicating that the weather was turning bad and that ice was becoming a concern several days later,on march,crabbing was interrupted when the wind blew ice flows through the vessels fishing gear that night the weather continued to worsen,and the vessel spent the next two days gathering crab pots and preparing to return to port.by march,the vessel had gathered crab pots,brought aboard approximately pounds of crab,and began to head southeast to the pribiloff islands to deliver its load to a fishing cannery.
that evening kinnear sent an email to the cannery stating 
trying to make it to you by tomorrow night but slow going.my idea is to follow the ice edge for lee to keep from making spray,but so far it is pretty ragged,lots of zigzags and have to jog slow.probably have to stop and chop ice off the boat often.liable to be hrs getting to you at this rate.
throughout the day weather and icing problems continued,and kinnear sent another twelve hours later to the cannery stating 
we have a load of gear on and are headed your way,naturally the weather and icing are a problem.now we are getting an intermittent bilge alarm from the lazarette and ca seem to pump it.we are hours from paul now and may decide to stop and store the gear there if the alarm gets to be steady.i let you know.
a little over six hours after kinnear previous,at approximately alaska standard time utc,the vessel sent out a distress call indicating that it was capsizing.shortly thereafter,the vessel capsized and sank.tragically,all hands on board were lost.
in a timely manner,northern queen commenced the current action seeking exoneration from or limitation of its liability for the accident under the limitation of liability act,et on september,a bench trial was held before the district court.prior to trial the parties stipulated that the vessel capsized and sank due to instability,which was caused by an excessive ice buildup on the vessel and the water in the lazarette,although the precise amount of water is unknown.the parties also stipulated that the lin j traveled at an average speed of to knots from the time kinnear sent the march to the cannery until the time the vessel sank.at trial,the main witness offered by the estate of kinnear the estate was greene cowan cowan,a former engineer on the lin j who served under kinnear from to.
during trial evidence was presented concerning the icing conditions faced by the lin icing is the buildup of ice on a ship superstructure caused by the spray of water from wind and waves in temperatures.excessive ice buildup renders a vessel unstable,which can cause a vessel to capsize.to prevent ice buildup,in icing conditions it is the typical industry practice to curtail a vessel speed to reduce the spray of water.cowan testified that,when icing was a concern,kinnear would travel at a speed of no more than to knots.
evidence was also presented concerning the bilge alarm in the lazarette.the lazarette is an enclosed space in the stern of the vessel covered by the deck and used for storing extra line,bait jars and miscellaneous gear.a float alarm is installed in the lazarette,that is triggered when the water rises.cowan testified that an intermittent alarm,such as kinnear reported in his last,is caused by approximately gallons of water sloshing around in the lazarette,sloshing back and forth,just raising the float and then dropping it,raising it,dropping it.the intermittent alarm would become constant when approximately gallons of water filled the lazarette.cowan further testified that the only access to the lazarette was through a watertight deck hatch,which,under normal weather conditions,was blocked by crab pots.however,in icing conditions,cowan testified,the vessel would carry no more than pots to prevent excessive ice from accumulating on the vessel.at the time of the sinking,kinnear indicated that he had pots on board,thereby blocking access to the lazarette.
on september,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law,in which it found that 
t he capsize of the lin j is attributable to the decisions made by blake kinnear as captain of the vessel the court finds that it is more probable than not that the vessel was traveling too rapidly in the hours before the casualty to avoid excessive icing and to permit removal of the ice,and that the presence of crab pots on board prevented the situation involving the lazarette from being corrected.
based on this finding the district court determined that northern queen was not entitled to exoneration or a limitation under the act because the vessel was unseaworthy at the time it sank.however,under the affirmative defense of the primary duty doctrine,the district court determined that,because kinnear had knowledge of the unseaworthiness of the vessel and failed to adequately respond or correct those conditions in his capacity as captain,northern queen was not liable to the estate.the estate appeals this determination,as well as the district court finding that kinnear failed to take adequate measures to prevent or correct the condition in the lazarette.
we review a district court conclusions of law de novo.exxon sofec,cir.a district court findings of fact,however,are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard,at.
a.did the district court err in finding that kinnear failed to take adequate measures to prevent or correct the accumulation of water in the lazarette 
based on the evidence presented at trial,the district court found it more probable than not that the presence of crab pots prevented the situation involving the lazarette from being corrected.
while appellant concedes that kinnear had the duty to take reasonable measures to prevent water in the lazarette from becoming a problem,or to correct the problem,if possible,once it arose,it argues that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support the district court finding.in arguing that the district court was in error,appellant points to the fact that carrying pots did not violate the vessel safety standards and theorizes that it may have been dangerous to attempt to dump the extra pots appellant also argues that,while there are to demonstrate that kinnear was aware of the problem in the lazarette,there is no affirmative evidence as to what kinnear did or did not do to correct this problem,and thus the district court finding is,at best,speculation 
we review for clear error the district court findings of fact following a bench trial.this standard is significantly deferential,and we will accept the lower court findings of fact unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.allen iranon,cir.
based on the evidence presented at trial,it can not be said that the district court finding concerning the lazarette was in error.the parties have stipulated that the water in the lazarette was a cause of the instability of the vessel.prior to the sinking it is undisputed that kinnear was aware of intermittent bilge alarms in the lazarette.it is also undisputed that,at the time of the sinking,the vessel was carrying crab pots.at trial,cowan testified that it was typical in icing conditions for kinnear to carry no more than pots,and that with pots on board access to the
