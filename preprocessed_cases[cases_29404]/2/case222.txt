factual and procedural background 
ambraco delivered several thousand bales of bailer twine to the vessel interests,who were to transport this cargo from brazil to the united states on the clipper faith,an cargo vessel owned by faith.pacorini acted as the cargo discharging stevedore in new orleans.
the cargo was covered by seventeen bills of lading,all identical in terms and conditions,issued by bossclip to the other vessel interests.the bills of lading contained three clauses critical to the present dispute 
definitions 
a carrier means the carrier as stipulated on page of this bill of lading,and insofar as carriage by sea is concerned,the registered owner of the vessel.
jurisdiction 
the contract evidenced by this bill of lading shall be governed by english law and any disputes thereunder shall be determined in england by the high court of justice in london according to english law to the exclusion of the courts of any other country.
clause paramount 
d if the carriage is to or from the,the carriage of goods by the sea act of the united states cogsa shall apply whether the goods are stowed on or under deck 
these bills of lading were issued on december,and their validity is not in question.
when the cargo arrived in new orleans,ambraco discovered extensive damage to the bailer twine.ambraco immediately instituted proceedings to seek compensation from the vessel interests and pacorini for the damage to its cargo.first,ambraco threatened to arrest,or seize,the vessel to gain in rem jurisdiction over the ship.the parties agreed to issue a letter of undertaking in the amount of to stand in the place of the ship for purposes of any future in rem action.on november,ambraco filed an original complaint in the district court for the eastern district of louisiana against the vessel interests.one month later,the named in personam,dockendale,and responsive pleadings raising a defense of improper venue.on march,ambraco filed a supplemental and amended complaint naming pacorini as an additional defendant.on may,faith made a restricted appearance as the owner of the clipper faith to defend ambraco in rem action.
on april,the in personam vessel interests filed a motion to dismiss ambraco claims based upon the forum selection clause contained in the bills of lading.the district court dismissed the entire case on may.the district court held that the forum selection clause in the bills of lading required all disputes to be adjudicated in the high court of england.thus,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim.although ambraco had amended its complaint to include a claim against pacorini,pacorini had not appeared by the time the district court dismissed the suit.
ambraco moved under federal rule of civil procedure e to alter or amend the judgment.in support,ambraco submitted an affidavit on issues of english law from english solicitor mark andrew lloyd lloyd.the vessel interests disputed the motion to alter or amend the judgment and contested the introduction of lloyd affidavit.the district court denied ambraco motion to alter or amend the judgment,again concluding that the forum selection clause was valid and divested the district court of jurisdiction over the claim.
the district court did,however,partially reopen the case,clarifying that its judgment dismissing the vessel interests claims did not extend to ambraco claims against pacorini.the district court also asserted jurisdiction over the letter of undertaking,thus maintaining jurisdiction over the res.on july,pacorini filed an answer and a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c,naming the dismissed vessel interests as defendants to ambraco suit against pacorini.on october,the vessel interests filed a motion to dismiss pacorini claims and the district court granted this motion on november,holding that rule c was not available to implead parties previously dismissed from the suit.after denying pacorini motion for reconsideration,the district court granted pacorini motion to certify the order dismissing the complaint as a final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.the court entered final judgment dismissing the case with prejudice on january.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had admiralty jurisdiction over the case pursuant to.this court has jurisdiction under,as the appeal arises from a final judgment entered by the district court.

iii.analysis 
enforcement of the forum section clause 
on appeal,ambraco argues that the forum selection clause in the bills of lading are invalid as the forum selection clause contradicts the public policy evidenced in cogsa,specifically,which limits a common carrier freedom to lessen the minimum liability contained in the act the district court held that the forum selection clause did not violate public policy and that the clause,as enforced,divested the court of jurisdiction.
section of cogsa provides explicit standards of conduct,and it is designed to correct specific abuses by carriers.vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,d.in the century it was a prevalent practice for common carriers to insert clauses in bills of lading exempting themselves from liability for damage or loss,limiting the period in which the plaintiffs had to present their notice of claim or bring suit,and capping any damage awards per package.id.at.cogsa imposes substantive obligations and particular procedures with which carriers participating in international maritime commerce must comply most critically,prohibits a carrier from altering its substantive obligations to its advantage in a bill of lading.id.at.section provides,
any clause,covenant,or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to or in connection with the goods,arising from negligence,fault,or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section,or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this chapter,shall be null and void and of no effect.
while cogsa states that carriers may not lessen their liability beyond that stipulated to by law,cogsa does not prohibit parties from agreeing to enforce the bill of lading provisions in a particular forum.sky reefer,at.thus,a clause is presumptively valid.bremen zapata,d.it will,however,be held unenforceable if enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought,whether declared by statute or by judicial decision.id.the critical inquiry to determining whether a clause violates public policy is whether the and clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies.mitsubishi motors soler,d see mitsui usa,mira,cir per curiam see also haynsworth v.the corporation,cir recognizing the holding in mitsui as binding precedent that rejected a distinction between foreign arbitration clauses and forum selection clauses.the party resisting enforcement on these grounds bears a heavy burden of proof.haynsworth,at quoting bremen,at.
ambraco presents two arguments for why enforcement of the forum selection clause and the provisions would lessen the statutory remedies available under cogsa.first,ambraco argues that english courts will not recognize the vessel interests as carriers,thus impermissibly lessening the vessel interests liability below that which cogsa guarantees.second,ambraco argues that english courts do not permit in rem actions,and that the right to an in rem action is substantively guaranteed.
in personam actions 
it is undisputed that the bills of lading provide that the english high court is the forum for all disputes.english courts have repeatedly been recognized to be fair and impartial.haynsworth,at.as the supreme court stated,plainly,the courts of england meet the standards of neutrality and long experience in admiralty litigation.bremen,at.thus,english courts themselves may be presumed to be fair.the supreme court decision in sky reefer requires us,however,to look beyond this presumption of fairness to discern whether the english courts,in addressing the present dispute,will impermissibly limit the vessel interests liability.
the clause paramount of the bill of lading provides that i f the carriage is to or from the,the carriage of goods by the sea act of the united states cogsa shall apply.despite this clause paramount,ambraco asserts that english courts will apply english law.a brief examination of english decisions,however,suggests that english courts are likely to apply cogsa if the parties intended american law to govern the dispute.for example,the queen bench a subdivision of the english high court considered what role american law should play when an english law incorporates an usa clause paramount in mauritius oil refineries nederlands the stolt sydness,lloyd.the clause paramount at issue expressly incorporated cogsa into the bill of lading.id.at.the english court considered what effect to give this clause paramount and held that,generally,the terms of cogsa would be incorporated as terms of the contract.id.at.thus,the english court honored the clear intention of the parties to incorporate cogsa into the contract.
the english house of lords,in scruttons midland silicones,wl,considered whether stevedores,who admittedly by their negligence caused damage to certain cargo consigned to the plaintiffs under a bill of lading,can take advantage of a provision for limitation of liability contained in that document,id.at.the bill of lading at issue included a provision which stipulated that cogsa would apply to all disputes over the transportation of the cargo.id.at.the stevedores argued that the bill of lading contained a clause limiting liability for all carriers,which they asserted cogsa defines as including stevedores.id.the house of lords found that there was no reason for saying that the word carrier either in the bill of lading or in the united states cogsa means or includes a stevedore.id.at.the court relied upon robert herd krawill machinery,d,in which the supreme court held that cogsa did not define carrier to include stevedores and did not intend the limitation on liability to extend to stevedores,id.at.although the english court eventually applied english law to fill the gaps left by the american law,this decision persuades us that english courts will honor the parties intention to apply cogsa and make every attempt to comply with american law.
in addition,ambraco has provided no convincing evidence that an english court,applying cogsa,would impermissibly limit the vessel interests liability thus,this court must assume that english courts of law would honor the clause paramount in the bills of lading and apply cogsa to the dispute at hand.accordingly,we hold that ambraco has not met its high burden of proving that the and clauses operate in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies.mitsubishi,at.
in rem actions 
ambraco also argues that enforcement of the forum selection clause would lessen the vessel interests liability because of the unavailability of an in rem action against the clipper faith.english courts no longer recognize an in rem action when the ship owner is entitled to sovereign immunity,nor when the plaintiff has already obtained or is seeking judgment against the shipowner in personam in relation to the same dispute.martin davies,in defense of unpopular virtues personification and ratification,tul.thus,if an in rem action is a substantive right protected under cogsa,a failure to provide an in rem action might be unreasonable as against cogsa public policy.see allianz ins.cho yang shipping,d.we need not,however,decide this thorny issue here.the district court preservation of jurisdiction over the in the form of a surety issue of the need for a separate in rem action.see thyssen,calypso shipping,cir per curiam holding that a letter of undertaking replaces the vessel as the res and moots the question of the need for separate in rem claim.
accordingly,we hold that ambraco has not proven that the enforcement of the forum selection clause in the bills of lading would violate public policy.ambraco failure to meet this heavy burden is fatal to its claim.sky reefer,at.holding that i t would also be out of keeping with the objects of the hague rules for the courts of this country to interpret cogsa to disparage the authority or competence of international forums for dispute resolution absent a showing that the foreign court would issue a holding contrary to public policy we therefore affirm the district court order dismissing ambraco claims against the vessel interests.
in a consolidated case,pacorini appeals the district court dismissal of its claim for contribution or indemnity under federal rule of civil procedure c.the district court dismissed pacorini rule c tender of the vessel interests to ambraco and pacorini claims against the original defendants.the district court held that rule c was not available to bring claims against defendants who had already been a party to the suit as original defendants,and it suggested that the proper mechanism for bringing these types of claims was through rule g.pacorini appeals only that part of the district court order which dismissed its claim for contribution or indemnification against the vessel interests 
the district court held that pacorini could have brought its claims against the vessel interests by asserting a under rule g.rule g provides,
a pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim,or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject mat
