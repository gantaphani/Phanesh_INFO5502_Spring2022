plaintiff gary ammar appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,following a bench trial before reena raggi,judge,awarding him against defendant united states under the jones act,and general principles of maritime law,for injuries sustained as a result of negligence and unseaworthiness while working as a seaman on a united states naval ship.the district court found that ammar injuries were caused in part by negligence on the part of ammar himself,and it pro tanto reduced his recovery for pain and suffering,lost wages,and medical expenses.the court also ruled that ammar was entitled to per day in maintenance.on appeal,ammar contends principally that the court erred a in finding him contributorily negligent and reducing his recovery for that reason,and b in denying him any recovery for certain of his medical bills.the united states from so much of the judgment as a awarded ammar maintenance in excess of the daily amount specified in the collective bargaining agreement covering his employment,and b failed to discount to present value the amount awarded for future wages and future medical expenses.for the reasons that follow,we find merit in the,but not in the appeal.
background 
the facts material to these appeals are now largely undisputed.in january,ammar,a member of the seafarers international union,was a bosun aboard the gordon,a united states naval ship stationed in the persian gulf in a convoy with other military sealift command vessels.the gordon was managed by bay ship management bsm,which was originally a defendant to this suit but which was dismissed prior to trial on the ground that,under the suits in admiralty act,and the public vessels act,ammar exclusive remedy,if any,was against the united states.
a.the events 
one of ammar duties aboard the gordon was operation of a shipboard crane,a duty he had performed hundreds of times.the crane consists of two major components,the turret and the boom the turret contains virtually all of the crane controls and is mounted on a round pedestal affixed to the ship the turret is capable of revolving degrees in either direction.the crane normally can be operated either by using the controls mounted on it or by means of a remote control.the controls can be accessed from the deck deck of the ship adjacent to the turret.the is connected to the crane by an electric umbilical cord and allows the crane to be operated from a distance.
on january,there was damage to the umbilical cord of a starboard crane the starboard stores crane that was normally used to lower machinery,food,and other supplies from the dock or a supply boat into the gordon engine room through a hatch on the ship deck deck.the remote control for the starboard stores crane was thus inoperable.although ammar and others were aware that the was inoperable,the crane was not to warn against attempting to operate the crane by using the controls mounted on it.
at approximately on january,ammar undertook to maneuver the starboard stores crane so as to move its hook into position to remove the deck hatch cover in order to enable the crew to lower supplies from the deck to the engine room.in so doing,ammar stood in a precarious position on the crane pedestal,and in attempting to get down from the pedestal,he stepped on a small box,called the remote control box,that was mounted on the pedestal.that box was not meant to bear such weight,and when ammar stepped on it,it gave way.his left foot was caught between a metal bracket and a hydraulic pump,resulting in,inter alia,a sprained ankle and a gash in his calf.ammar,then age,was not able to return to his work as a seaman.
ammar received medical treatment for his injuries over the next several years,along with psychiatric care.the united states or bsm paid for most of his medical expenses and,through the commencement of trial,paid him maintenance of per day,the rate specified in the collective bargaining agreement covering his employment.
b.the decision of the district court 
ammar commenced the present action under the jones act,as well as the general maritime law of the united states,seeking damages for,inter alia,pain and suffering,medical bills,and lost wages.the complaint also sought maintenance payments in excess of the amount ammar had been paid by the united states or bsm,alleging that his daily living expenses substantially exceeded that amount.prior to trial,the parties settled ammar claims for lost wages through may.
at a bench trial in october,the district court heard extensive testimony as to,inter alia,the technical operation of the starboard stores crane,the circumstances surrounding the january accident,ammar medical problems,his treatment by various medical professionals,and other damages and payment issues.the witnesses included members of the ship personnel,persons familiar with the operation of the crane,medical experts for both sides,and ammar himself.
after the close of the evidence and the parties summations,the court announced its liability findings and its tentative findings as to damages on the record on october,see hearing transcript,october,tr,at,and finalized its damages findings at a subsequent hearing on december,see hearing transcript,december,tr,at.the court found that at the time of the accident,the gordon was unseaworthy because the starboard stores crane remote control was inoperable,and there was no safe way to operate the controls from the crane while maintaining the necessary lines of sight for the proper positioning of the boom the court found that the united states was derelict in its duties because it had failed to adopt any of three alternative methods of avoiding injury to the seamen,to wit,a keeping the in repair,b the crane to warn workers against using it before the necessary repairs had been made,or c giving an unequivocal order that the crane not be used.however,the court also found that ammar could have avoided his accident by standing on a rung of the railing of the deck to reach the controls,rather than standing on the crane pedestal and stepping on the flimsy remote control box.the court found that ammar task could have been performed entirely from that position that that was a safer alternative that ammar knew that option was available to him and that his failure to adopt that alternative was an unreasonable choice that contributed to his accident.the court apportioned responsibility for the accident to the united states and to ammar.
turning to the matter of damages,the district court found that,but for the accident,ammar would have worked until he reached the age of and that he lost wages through april,the month of his birthday.the court also found that had ammar worked until age,he would have qualified for a goal he had expressed before joining the crew of the that he was entitled to payment for his lost pension for a period of years,based on life expectancy actuarial tables.the court found that ammar was entitled to damages for pain and suffering,past and future.with respect to the medical expenses claimed by ammar in excess of the bills the united states had already paid,the court rejected the testimony of certain doctors as to ammar mental condition,and it found that certain of the medical charges appeared to have been inflated for purposes of the litigation.
the court ultimately fixed the amount of lost wages after taxes at,the lost pension at the cost of an appropriate annuity,pain and suffering at,and allowable future medical expenses at and it reduced these amounts by on account of ammar contributory negligence.although the court initially indicated that it would discount to present value the amounts to be awarded for future damages,the court ultimately decided,as discussed in greater detail in part.below,that it would not discount those sums.
finally,the court determined that ammar should be paid maintenance at the rate of per day.section of the collective bargaining agreement between bsm and the seafarers international union the union,of which ammar is a member,provides that when a member of the union is entitled to maintenance,the rate is to be per day regardless of the actual expenses incurred for his food and lodging 
maintenance and cure.when a member of the unlicensed personnel is entitled to maintenance and cure under maritime law,he shall be paid maintenance at the rate of eight dollars per day for each day or part thereof of entitlement.the payment due hereunder shall be paid to the man weekly.this payment shall be made regardless of whether he has or has not retained an attorney,filed a claim for damages,or taken any other steps to that end and irrespective of any insurance arrangements in effect between the company and any insurer.
relying on this provision,the united states had argued prior to trial that the amount of maintenance to which ammar was entitled was thus limited to per day.the district court had rejected this argument,observing that,although this court had not ruled on that question,the court of appeals for the third circuit and a number of district judges within this circuit had concluded that 
the special care that the maritime law has always paid to seamen basically preclude s parties from contracting away an individual seaman right to full maintenance.this can not be abrogated by private agreement.and,so,the history and purpose of maintenance a s a right created by the courts to protect individual seamen is simply not something that unions and employers can try to minimize.
hearing transcript,december,at.although noting that courts of appeals for several other circuits had ruled to the contrary,the district court here found the above view preferable.in light of the evidence presented at trial,the court found that the appropriate rate of maintenance here was per day.taking into account the maintenance payments already made to ammar,the court awarded him additional maintenance of.
judgment was eventually entered in favor of ammar against the united states in the amount of.this appeal and followed.
ii.ammar appeal 
on appeal,ammar contends principally a that the district court made errors of law by applying principles of assumption of risk rather than principles of comparative negligence,and b that the court factual findings were clearly erroneous as to methods of operating the starboard stores crane,the existence of options available to ammar,and negligence on the part of ammar.he also contends that the court erred in refusing to award the full amount of his claimed medical expenses.his contentions have no merit.
application of the doctrine of comparative liability 
ammar contends that the district court,in reducing his damages award,mistakenly applied principles of assumption of risk rather than contributory negligence or comparative negligence.we see no indication that this is so.
assumption of risk is the knowledgeable acceptance by an employee of a dangerous condition when and if such acceptance was necessary for the performance of his duties.rivera farrell lines,cir rivera.assumption of risk has long been eliminated from maritime injury law by statute.see id.at citing stat,railroad employees,as amended,stat,made applicable to seamen by stat.
instead,the jones act incorporates the doctrine of comparative negligence,under which recovery is reduced if the plaintiff is found to have been negligent and his negligence contributed to his injury.see,rivera,at.such contributory negligence in a jones act case connotes some careless act or omission on the part of the employee over and above mere knowledgeable acceptance of a risk.id.the defendant must show more than that the seaman simply had knowledge of a hazard it must show that the seaman fail ed to adopt safer alternative courses of action,and the inquiry at trial should thus center on what choices were available to the plaintiff and how he exercised those choices.akermanis service,cir.
in the present case,the district court,citing rivera,expressly discussed the differences between the concepts of assumption of risk and comparative or contributory negligence.noting that n othing about its findings suggest ed that the court thought it was necessary for the performance of ammar duties that he accept the risk of climbing on board the crane,the court stated that its findings all relate to the theory of contributory or comparative negligence,which connotes some careless act or omission on the part of the employee,over and above that knowledgeable acceptance of risk.tr.at.
as discussed in part.below,the court findings focused not simply on ammar knowledge of the danger in the approach he took but also on the existence of less dangerous approaches and ammar awareness of those alternatives.thus,ammar contention that the court applied erroneous legal principles finds no support in the record.
b.the finding that ammar was contributorily negligent 
ammar argues that the district court erred in finding as a factual matter that he was contributorily negligent,that he not only was aware that it was dangerous to stand on the crane pedestal and step on the remote control box but also knew that safer alternatives were available.he argues,inter alia,that the court finding that such safer alternatives existed was based on its understanding of the workings of the crane as reflected in a diagram that ammar contends was flawed.he also contends that the court should have allowed him to place in evidence a different diagram of the crane.these contentions provide no basis for reversal.
first,we reject ammar contention that the court use of the diagram it sketched constituted error.the court drew its diagram of the crane during the trial in order to understand how the crane functioned,because the court found ammar presentation confusing.the court showed its diagram to ammar during his testimony and asked whether the diagram correctly depicted,inter alia,the position of the crane on the deck in relation to the pertinent deck hatch,the location of the control box on the crane,the direction toward which the boom was pointing,the directions in which the boom would be moved at various times,the resulting location of the control box in relation to those boom movements,and the relation of the control box to the deck and its railing.see trial transcript october,at.in every instance,ammar responded that the court diagram and its understanding of the positions,movements,and relationships were correct.
the court noted that t he parties ha d put the court diagram into evidence tr.at that the court had shown the sketch to other witnesses to be sure the court understanding was correct see tr.at and that then the defendant and the plaintiff started using it regularly with respect to various witnesses tr.at.as the court noted,c ertainly if there was any error in that sketch,any witness who was asked about it who had a different view could have explained that.id.only after the trial ended and the court announced its finding that ammar had been contributorily negligent did ammar suggest that the diagram was flawed.in all the circumstances,ammar contention that the court impermissibly used the diagram is specious.
nor is there any basis for overturning the court finding that ammar own conduct constituted contributory negligence that was in part responsible for his injury.findings of fact made by the district court after a bench trial may not be set aside on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous.a.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson bessemer city,d see united states yellow cab.further,when a trial judge finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses,each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence,that finding,if not internally inconsistent,can virtually never be clear error.anderson bessemer city,at.
here,the district court heard the testimony of witnesses from both sides as to the movement and operation of the starboard stores crane,and it received in evidence photographs showing that the controls could be manipulated by a worker standing on the bottom rung of the deck railing.the court credited the testimony of the witnesses who stated that ammar thus could have operated the crane without stepping on the flimsy control box at the base of the crane,and it therefore found that there was an alternative available to ammar other than climbing on board the crane tr.at,that he could have manipulated the controls by moving around the railing area of the deck id,and that ammar did negligently ignore a safer way for him to operate this crane at a time when the body pack was inoperable id.at.these findings were based on credibility determinations that we are not entitled to and on inferences that were permissible in light of the evidence at trial.the district court properly applied the principles discussed in part.above,reviewing ammar actions for reasonableness in light of the alternatives that the court found were both available to him and known to him,and we see no clear error in its finding that ammar decision to mount the pedestal and step on the flimsy control box,rather than adopt the safer alternative of standing on a rung of the ship railing,constituted contributory negligence.
finally,there is no merit in ammar contention that the court should have granted his motion,made after the trial had concluded and the court had announced its liability findings,for permission to present a new diagram and an affidavit from his expert witness as evidence that the crane could not have been operated in accordance with the court finding that ammar had been contributorily negligent.a motion to reopen the record for the presentation of new evidence is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.see,zenith radio hazeltine research,d dow chemical pacific rascator maritime,cir.we see no abuse of discretion here.ammar had ample opportunity to provide evidence during the trial.as discussed above,the court diagram was used extensively at trial by the court and the parties.further,after the court had posed questions to the defense expert as to the functioning of the crane,the court had expressly invited ammar to conduct further,or to resume his own testimony,or to recall his own expert witness to the stand.the court was not required to allow ammar to reopen the evidence after he learned of the court liability ruling.
c.the limited award of medical expenses 
ammar other contentions include his challenge to the district court refusal to award him medical expenses other than the sum of for future psychiatric care.these contentions are without merit.the court rejection of ammar evidence as to other recoverable medical fees was expressly based on its findings that the testimony of ammar medical witnesses at trial was not sufficiently credible and that the charges had been inflated for purposes of litigation.tr.at to a certain extent their credentials,certainly their methodology,and also their motives since both of them have a real financial interest in this case,are such that the court is not prepared to rely on them ammar condition does not appear to be as represented by these doctors,at least i do find adequate medical evidence to support their diagnoses.as discussed above,we are not entitled to overturn the trial court credibility determinations.hence,there is no basis for reversal.
ammar remaining contentions similarly lack merit and do not warrant discussion.
iii.the united states 
on the,the united states contends a that the district court erred in awarding ammar maintenance in excess of the rate agreed to in the collective bargaining agreement,and b that the court should have discounted to present value the award for future wages and future medical expenses.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
a.the seaman right to maintenance 
under the general maritime law of the united states,maintenance refers to the duty of a vessel owner to provide food and lodging,comparable to that received aboard the vessel,to a seaman who falls ill or becomes injured while in the service of the vessel.see,vella ford motor,d the osceola.gilmore and black,the law of admiralty ed.gilmore black schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed.schoenbaum.the duty to pay maintenance arises regardless of whether the shipowner was negligent and regardless of whether the illness or injury was,see,vella ford motor,at.and the duty to make such payments continues until the seaman has recovered or his condition is declared permanent and incurable,see,id.at.vaughan atkinson,d.
the reasons underlying the rule are those enumerated in the classic passage by justice story in harden gordon,fed.cas.the protection of seamen,who,as a class,are poor,friendless and improvident,from the hazards of illness and abandonment while ill in foreign ports the inducement to masters and owners to protect the safety and health of seamen while in service the maintenance of a merchant marine for the commercial service and maritime defense of the nation by inducing men to accept employment in an arduous and perilous service.
vaughan atkinson,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as a right judicially fashioned to protect poor,friendless and improvident seamen,
m aintenance differs from rights normally classified as contractual.as justice cardozo said in cortes baltimore insular line,supra,the duty to provide maintenance is imposed by the law itself as one annexed to the employment contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin,but given the relation,no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident.
vaughan atkinson,at.footnote omitted.see also de zon american president lines.a shipowner provision of maintenance is a duty that no private agreement is competent to abrogate.
historically,the amount of a maintenance award was determined by the court,taking into account all relevant circumstances,such as the somewhat equivalent costs for housing and food ashore as well as regional differences in prices in the united states.mangone,united states admiralty law mangone.in the late,the judicially approved rate of maintenance was per day.see,gilmore black at.that rate remained standard until the.see,gary michael haugen,maintenance and cure contract right or legal obligation,tul.
from at least until the late,collective bargaining agreements cbas between vessel owners and seamen unions uniformly set the maintenance rate at per day.see mangone at.thereafter,some cbas set different amounts such as per day,see,macedo paul michelle,cir,or per day,see,frederick kirby tankships,cir durfor transportation,civ,wl,at july,or per day,see,covella buchanan marine,civ,wl,at.in the wake of such agreements,defendants in suits by seaman claiming maintenance have contended that the maintenance to which the seaman is entitled is the rate specified in the cba.this contention has divided the federal courts of appeals that have addressed it,with the first,fifth,sixth,ninth,and eleventh circuits ruling that a seaman who is a member of a union that has agreed to a specified daily rate of maintenance is,despite having incurred higher actual costs,limited to recovery of that rate,see frederick kirby tankships,cir baldassaro united states,cir american steamship,cir macedo paul michelle,cir gardiner service,cir.gardiner,cert.denied,d,and the third circuit ruling that the collective bargaining agreement rate is not binding,see barnes andover,cir barnes.
in gardiner,the seminal court of appeals decision on this issue,the ninth rejecting the defense contention that,to the extent a cba establishes a daily maintenance rate,the traditional right to maintenance has been preempted by the federal labor that the broad policies which underg ir d the labor laws,as well as the nature of the collective bargaining process,require nevertheless that the maintenance rate expressed in the collective bargaining agreement be enforced.id.at.the court reasoned that the importance of collective bargaining to industrial peace is such that a cba,although it could not properly eliminate all right to maintenance,may properly limit its amount 
important policies support the enforceability of the maintenance rate involved in this case congress viewed collective bargaining as a key instrument in its effort to promote industrial peace our national labor policy is built on the premise that employees can bargain most effectively for improvements in wages,hours,and working conditions by pooling their economic strength and acting through freely chosen labor organizations.nlrb manufacturing,d.consequently,this court will not lightly embrace the repudiation of contractual obligations enumerated in a collective bargaining agreement and will choose the rule that will promote the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements although the right to maintenance is presumed to exist because of its establishment at common law,its rate may be subject to the negotiation process.the collective agreement covers the whole employment relationship.it calls into being a new common common law of a particular industry or of a particular plant.united steelworkers of america warrior gulf nav,d.thus,it is clearly the policy of our national labor legislation to encourage both labor and management to negotiate contracts that will effectively regulate every aspect of their complex relationship as the supreme court has noted,t he mature labor agreement may attempt to regulate all aspects of the complicated relationship,from the most crucial to the most minute over an extended period of time.united steelworkers of america,at.at.
here,the parties to the agreement included the traditional right to maintenance as a subject of the negotiating process.the resulting collective bargaining agreement incorporated an explicit rate of maintenance as one of its terms.we can not fairly say that this rate,as a consequence of the normal give and take process of collective bargaining,is not entitled to the same reliability accorded to other terms and conditions within the same agreement.the national labor policy of promoting and encouraging collective bargaining agreements would be unduly compromised were we to conclude otherwise.
gardiner,at other internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.
the court reasoned that,because t he rate of maintenance is but one of many elements contained within the union contract and over which the parties negotiate,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,the adequacy of the maintenance rate should not be examined in isolation by the court because the determination of its adequacy in relation to the whole scheme of benefits has already been made by the union and the seamen who voted for the contract,id.observing that there may be a considerable amount of give and take exercised by the parties in coming to a final agreement on all of the elements,id.internal quotation marks omitted,and noting that the collective bargaining agreement in the case before it had,for example,provided for overtime,premium and penalty pay for unpleasant tasks,for very generous vacation allowances,and for such amenities as television sets and feature films,ice cream and fresh baked bread,the court concluded that acceptance of a particular package of benefits should be binding on the union members,id.
w hen a benefits package includes an express reference to a precise rate of maintenance,the adequacy of this rate,considered in isolation,is not a subject for judicial speculation when the rate is part of a total package of wages and benefits resulting from the process of collective bargaining.
the ninth circuit reasoning in gardiner was soon followed by the sixth circuit,see american,at t he maintenance per diem rate,like any other benefit,which is the ultimate result from give and take collective bargaining between the parties,should be binding on them courts generally have decided that it is more appropriate for the courts to enforce privately negotiated contractual rates of maintenance,rather than engaging in overt legislation of particular dollar figures,and by the first circuit in macedo paul michelle,at supreme court dictum in vaughan atkinson,that no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident of maintenance,at,is not dispositive in the quite different circumstances of a collective bargaining agreement.
thereafter,the third circuit reached the contrary view in barnes,holding that a union can not bargain away the individual seaman common law right to maintenance by agreeing to a wholly inadequate figure as a daily maintenance rate.at.the barnes court acknowledged that almost every case concerning the right to maintenance relies on justice story description of the seaman as generally poor and friendless.id.at quoting harden gordon,cas,cc me.and it acknowledged that today those seamen who are unionized are neither friendless nor improvident,barnes,at that the seafarers international union has obtained for its members overtime and premium pay,vacation allowances,disability pensions,and amenities such as televisions,washers and dryers,coffee breaks,and midnight lunches,id.at that now,under union contracts,ill or injured seamen are quickly repatriated,and that the changed circumstances of seamen unionization undercut the rationale supporting the traditional right to maintenance and cure,id.however,the barnes court found it inconsistent both with the traditional doctrine of maintenance and with the rejection of preemption of maintenance by the labor laws to hold that the maintenance rate set in the collective bargaining agreement is binding on a seaman who can show higher daily expenses.id.at.having noted that the supreme court has shown no inclination to depart from its solicitude for seamen,id.at,the third circuit concluded that unless congress determines that the circumstances giving rise to the need for maintenance have changed and that collective bargaining is now a more appropriate way to deal with the issue of the ill or injured seaman,the common law remedy must remain in full force,id.at.
thereafter,despite the rationale of barnes,the eleventh and fifth circuits found the reasoning of gardiner more persuasive and ruled that,in light of unionization,seamen should no longer be considered weak and friendless,and that in the absence of any assertion of unfairness in the collective bargaining agreement as a whole the maintenance rate should be honored.see frederick kirby tankships,at baldassaro united states,at.
no opinion of this court has discussed the issue of whether the maintenance rate in a cba should be upheld when that amount is less than the unionized seaman actual expenses.in a case involving a seaman who was not a union member,we held that the union rate was not binding.see incandela american dredging,cir.in a case brought by a union member,we affirmed the judgment limiting his maintenance award to the collective bargaining rate,but we did so without opinion.see dixon maritime overseas,aff,cir table,cert.denied,d.
the district court opinions within this circuit have been divided.some have adopted the majority view initiated in gardiner.see,denardo energy transportation,civ,wl,at may,cba rate of per day binding dixon maritime overseas.at same.but most have adopted the view of the third circuit in barnes.see,durfor transportation,wl,at cba rate of per day not binding bachir transoceanic cable ship,civ,wl,at,cba rate of per day not binding brown united states,same gillikin united states,same.
after reviewing the competing factors,we adopt the majority view as elaborated by gardiner.we are persuaded by the considerations that n ational labor policy has been built on the premise that by pooling their economic strength and acting through a labor organization freely chosen by the majority,the employees of an appropriate unit have the most effective means of bargaining for improvements in wages,hours,and working conditions,nlrb manufacturing,d that the federal courts have authority to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements,textile workers union of america lincoln mills,d and that today,most seamen are union members with a package of compensation and benefits of which the right to maintenance is a small component,schoenbaum,at.the modern reality is that most seamen are no longer friendless rather,they have gained strength through collectivity,and they are a work force with sophisticated leaders who constantly press for better working conditions,pay,and benefits,as well as increased job security.thus,the need for judicial intervention
