petitioner custom ship interiors appeals the decision of the benefits review board brb that regular per diem payments made to employees incurring no room and board expenses should be included as wages under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca or act,et.custom ship contends that the payments were advantages not subject to tax withholding,and thus not properly viewed as wages under the act.because the per diem payments were disbursed to the employee each week despite the fact that custom ship knew that he was incurring no food or lodging expenses needing reimbursement,we affirm the judgment of the brb that the payments were includable as wages under the act.
michael roberts injured his back while remodeling a carnival cruise ship for his employer,custom ship interiors.roberts had worked for custom ship for approximately nine years.his work was seasonal,covering roughly of the year.during his periods of employment,he normally worked six days a week for a total of about sixty hours.
in addition to his weekly salary and any overtime pay,roberts employment contract entitled him to per diem payments of approximately per day.according to custom ship,the per diem was and was intended to cover employees meal and lodging expenses while they were on jobs away from home.however,custom ship provided these cash payments without any restrictions,meaning the recipients could spend them in any way they saw fit.for approximately one year prior to his injury,roberts was assigned to carnival and incurred no room and board expenses because carnival provided free room and board to its remodelers.custom ship knew that carnival provided these amenities.still,custom ship continued to provide the unrestricted cash payments to employees working on carnival ships despite knowing that none of the employees incurred any expenses.
on august,while working aboard a carnival cruise ship docked in norfolk,virginia,roberts was struck by a steel bunk bed falling from the wall.immediately after the accident,roberts was sent to lie down in an adjacent cabin and his supervisors were notified.a day or two later,after experiencing intense back,neck,head,and right leg pain,he went to see a physician on the ship.he remained on the ship for some time,hoping his condition would improve and attempting to do some light work.however,he was unable to work and eventually left the ship for florida in order to seek medical attention.since the injury,roberts has experienced constant back pain and has not performed any further work for custom ship.
on march,roberts filed a claim for disability benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,et,in florida where he was living at the time.his claim went before an administrative law judge who determined that roberts was temporarily disabled as a result of a injury,a finding not disputed on appeal.roberts was thus entitled to benefits,the amount of which are based on a claimant average weekly wage as defined and calculated under the act.roberts claimed that in addition to his normal weekly wage and overtime,the per diem should be included in his average weekly wage calculation.however,the alj ruled that per diems for the purpose of defraying expenses for meals and lodging do not fall within the definition of wages set forth in the act.the alj concluded that roberts average weekly wage was.
the benefits review board reversed.because the injury occurred in virginia,the law of this circuit was controlling.see c.and under universal maritime service wright,cir,the board held roberts per diem payments should be included in the calculation of average weekly wages.the brb based its conclusion primarily on the fact that roberts received the per diem in his pay check every week,regardless of whether he incurred any expenses.moreover,the brb concluded that the per diem was part of roberts employment contract.thus,the brb determined that roberts average weekly wage was.custom ship now appeals.
the longshore and harbor workers compensation act compensates covered workers for the loss of capacity due to disabling injuries.see metropolitan stevedore rambo,d.at the heart of the act compensation scheme is the definition of wages contained in.that section specifies what items will be used to determine the claimant average weekly wage,which is then used to calculate benefits.see wright,at.it defines wages as 
the money rate at which the service rendered by an employee is compensated by an employer under the contract of hiring in force at the time of the injury,including the reasonable value of any advantage which is received from the employer and included for the purposes of any withholding tax under subtitle c of the internal revenue code of et relating to employment taxes.the term wages does not include fringe benefits,including but not limited to employer payments for or contributions to a retirement,pension,health and welfare,life insurance,training,social security or other employee or dependent benefit plan for employee or dependent benefit,or any other employee dependent entitlement.
in wright,we interpreted to define wages as the money rate of compensation that is provided for the employee services by an employer under the employment contract in force at the time of the injury.at.all compensation that meets these requirements satisfies the act definition of wages,although contains two clauses under which a payment might fall.
the opening clause of broadly covers the money rate at which an employee is compensated under his employment contract for providing services.we concluded in wright that,a t a minimum,this encompasses cash compensation provided for services rendered under the employment contract.id.at.if the payment at issue is not regular cash compensation it might still fall under the second clause,which expressly includes as a wage the reasonable value of any advantage received by the employee that is subject to tax withholding.id.at.it is important to note that the second clause does not serve to limit the first.see id.at.instead,it defines a different category of benefits that might be considered wages.although the second clause encompasses both monetary and in kind compensation so long as it is readily identifiable and calculable,id.at,it primarily addresses nonmonetary benefits that can not be viewed as the regular money rate of compensation.see id.at.finally,the third clause expressly excludes other fringe benefits,whose value to the employee is too speculative to be readily converted into a cash equivalent.id.at.
the fifth circuit subsequently interpreted our decision in wright to mean that if a benefit is paid in dollars and cents and therefore has a value that is apparent on its face,it constitutes a wage rather than a fringe benefit under.james flanagan stevedores,gallagher,cir.thus,in gallagher,the fifth circuit held that container royalty benefits paid annually to longshoremen are properly included as wages in the calculation of benefits under the act.id.at.
custom ship contends that the contested payments were reimbursements for food and lodging rather than regular compensation,and thus that they may not count as wages unless they were subject to employment tax withholding.however,custom ship argument flies in the face of its decision to regularly provide roberts the payments despite knowing that he had no expenses to reimburse.because the payments were virtually indistinguishable from roberts regular hourly wages,we must affirm the decision of the brb.
we recognize,of course,that per diem payments are traditionally seen as reimbursements for expenses,including room and board when traveling,and are not generally considered regular taxable wages.see.however,when a per diem is given in the face of knowledge that the employee has no expenses,it is less clear that the per diem is a reimbursement rather than a regular wage.
the payments here had every indicia of an ordinary wage.roberts regularly received them in his weekly pay check as a part of his employment contract.like his hourly wages,the payments correlated to the amount of time roberts worked each week.if roberts worked one day,he would receive one
