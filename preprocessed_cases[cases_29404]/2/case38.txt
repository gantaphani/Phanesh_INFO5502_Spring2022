plaintiff quincy commerce center,llc qcc,has brought this appeal to challenge the district court entry of summary judgment against it on its claims under the administrative procedures act apa,et.qcc argues that the maritime administration of the united states marad and william schubert,marad administrator in his official capacity,violated the merchant marine acts of and mma,app.et,and the coastal zone management act of czma,et,and otherwise acted unlawfully,in the course of auctioning off the assets of the defunct fore river shipyard in quincy,massachusetts.omlc,omlc,also appeals to challenge the court entry of summary judgment against it on its claim that its exclusion from the auction was arbitrary and capricious.the court explained its rulings in a comprehensive,memorandum and order.see quincy commerce,llc maritime,civil filed.we draw heavily on the court fine work in setting forth the background.
plaintiffs claims challenged the legality of the january,outcry auction of the real estate on which the shipyard was located,and certain personal property stored there.qcc asserts standing to bring its claims because it was an unsuccessful bidder for both the realty and personalty.omlc premises its standing on the fact that it sought,but was denied,permission to bid for the realty.as set forth above,the primary defendants are marad,the federal agency that oversaw the auction,and its administrator.the verified second amended complaint also invoked.to name as defendants spillane,llc spillane,the winning bidder for the realty march fourth,llc march fourth,a corporate affiliate of spillane and assignee of spillane rights to the realty perfection machinery sales perfection,the winning bidder for the personalty and myron bowling auctioneers myron bowling,perfection bidding partner.michael fox international,fox,was the auctioneer,but is not a named party.
the fore river shipyard was founded in and has played a historic role in the united states shipbuilding industry.in,however,the declining shipyard was closed and sold to the massachusetts water resource authority,which eventually conveyed it to massachusetts heavy industries,mhi.in,mhi asked marad to guaranty a loan to finance the shipyard reopening.marad initially balked because,in its view,the project did not meet the statutory requirement that it be economically sound.app.d a.but in the coast guard authorization act of,congress enacted legislation which impelled marad to provide the guaranty.see,b,stat.in,marad guaranteed a million loan that mhi obtained from fleet bank,taking a senior mortgage on the real estate on which the shipyard is located and a senior security interest in the shipyard personalty.
on december,mhi defaulted on its loan,and on february,marad paid fleet million under its guarantee.soon thereafter marad took possession of the realty and personalty.on march,mhi filed for bankruptcy under chapter.in august,marad petitioned the bankruptcy court to lift the chapter automatic stay so that it might sell the assets of which it had taken custody.in support of its application,marad submitted a declaration from paul stott,an expert in the shipbuilding industry,who averred that reopening the shipyard was not economically feasible because the costs of restoration at the fore river site would be prohibitive,and because of reduced worldwide demand.the bankruptcy court granted marad petition and authorized marad to sell the shipyard assets after the end of the year.
marad first advertised the property in october.the agency received several offers in the year that followed,but all proved to be unsatisfactory.in early,marad began actively soliciting offers from businesses that contemplated using the facility to scrap ships.local officials strongly objected,citing environmental concerns,and marad abandoned this plan.ultimately,in august,marad decided to sell the property at a public auction and hired fox to serve as auctioneer.
marad publicized the auction by means of newspaper and internet advertisements and direct mailings,and made a property information package available to parties interested in bidding.the information package explained the rules of the auction and that the realty would be sold separately from the personalty,which would have to be removed from the property immediately after the auction or at such other times as permitted by marad and fox.a party wishing to bid first had to become a potential bidder by demonstrating to marad satisfaction that it had the financial wherewithal to purchase the property.next,a potential bidder had to become qualified by submitting a sealed bid and a deposit.any bid for the realty had to include a statement of intent setting forth the bidder plans to use the real property and the projected impact on employment,the environment,and business and tax revenue in the locality.in formulating the auction rules,marad retained considerable authority.the rules informed bidders that marad reserves the right to share bidders intentions with local elected officials and to disqualify any bidders whose plans marad deems unsatisfactory.the rules also stated 
the sales agent fox may determine,in its business judgment,but only upon receipt of marad consent,which qualified bid s,if any,is the highest or otherwise best offer,and may reject at any time,any bid that,in the sales agent sole discretion,is i inadequate or insufficient,ii not in conformity with the requirements of the bidding procedures,or the terms and conditions of sale,or iii contrary to the best interests of marad or the united states of america.at any time before or at the sale,the sales agent may impose such other bidding procedures and terms and conditions as it may determine are in the best interest of marad and other parties in interest,and may modify or amend these procedures.
the sale was conducted in two stages.marad first required that written bids be submitted by december,although it reserved the right to extend,and did extend,that deadline to the date of the auction itself.second,on january,marad engaged fox to preside over a live public auction at which the written bids were unsealed and qualified bidders were afforded the opportunity to raise their bids beyond the highest written bids.in the end,marad qualified six entities to bid on the realty and two to bid on the personalty.no qualified bidder stated an intention to use the property for ship scrapping.nor did any qualified bidder state explicitly that it intended to use the property to run a shipyard or ship repair facility,although qcc stated that it contemplated redevelop ing the site as a vital center of commercial activity including marine industry,and spillane stated that it was contemplating marine related uses.qcc says,however,that marad knew,or at least should have known,that it truly intended to use the assets for merchant marine purposes,while spillane did not.
on december,qcc submitted a written bid of million for the personalty.on january,spillane submitted a written bid of million for the realty.on the night before the auction,marad and fox determined that these were the bids that the winning bidders would have to beat.that same night,in response to a written request from perfection that the winning bidder for the personalty be afforded months to remove it or to abandon it at the shipyard site,marad and fox also agreed to give the winning bidder a window.the provision of this grace period was announced at the beginning of the auction,although qcc alleges and we shall assume for purposes of this appeal that it was communicated by a fox representative to perfection,which had business ties to fox,at some point prior to its public announcement.
on the morning of january,within an hour of the time at which the auction was scheduled to begin,a representative of omlc,which had not been qualified to bid by marad,appeared at the auction site and stated that omlc wished to bid on the realty.marad declined to qualify omlc.marad says that it based its disqualification decision on omlc failure to submit written documentation of its financial ability to purchase the property,and the fact that omlc representative stated that the company
