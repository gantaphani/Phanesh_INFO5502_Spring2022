this case involves a question of first impression as to the scope of maritime liens.gowen,brought the action in december in federal district court against the vessel quality one and her owner,nunya.gowen sought to recover debts owed for wharfage and repair,and sought relief in rem against the vessel and in personam against the owner.federal maritime lien act.the amount sought,with interest through november,was just under,plus unspecified costs of collection and attorney fees.the vessel was arrested pursuant to a warrant commanding the seizure of her equipment,engines,and appurtenances.
after nunya failed to answer gowen complaint,gowen secured an entry of default and then a default judgment establishing liability.a,b.upon entry of the default judgment,gowen promptly moved for sale of the vessel,including specifically her fishing permits and history,which gowen motion argued were appurtenances of the vessel.no opposition was filed.on february,the court ordered a public sale of the vessel,including any valid fishing permits and history to the extent permitted by applicable law.the permits,as more fully explained below,are federal permits allowing restricted use of the vessel for the fishing of specific species.see,b sea watch int l mosbacher,
after local advertising the vessel was sold at auction on march,by representatives of the united states marshals service.seven or eight bidders attended,as did the captain of the vessel.prior to the bidding,the captain told those present that the sale was being challenged legally and that the permits would not be transferred with the vessel.only two bids were then made one by gowen for,and the other by andrew todd for.todd bid was accepted.under the terms of the auction,todd paid the sale price that same day.
gowen moved on march,for confirmation of the sale,and for the first time counsel for the vessel and owner appeared and opposed the motion.the opposition disputed inter alia the inclusion of the permits and the fairness of the price.the district court then held an evidentiary hearing,in which it heard testimony from five witnesses.the court later received briefs from both sides.on june,the court issued a decision upholding the sale and ruling that the permits and history were included as appurtenances.gowen,quality one,wl.thereafter,the marshal provided a bill of sale to todd.
nunya and the quality one have now appealed from the confirmation of sale and the decision that the sale includes the permits and history.although interlocutory the proceeds have not yet been divided,the confirmation order is appealable.a.nevertheless,gowen has argued that the appeal should be dismissed,for mootness or lack of jurisdiction,because the appellants allowed the sale to be completed without seeking a stay.this means,says gowen,that no effective relief is now possible since todd owns the vessel and permits and todd is not even a party to the case.
the problem raised by gowen is common enough in a number of different contexts.see,oakville dev,cir mortgage foreclosure sale,miller in re stadium mgmt,cir bankruptcy.here,it is sufficient to defeat any claim of mootness that a reasonable chance of effective relief would remain if we were persuaded to reverse the district court.for example,a ruling that the fishing permits were not transferred would be possible.only if it were indisputable that no form of relief could be provided would a mootness claim lie.pine tree med.assocs.sec y of health human,cir.
obviously,any relief that nullified the sale or stripped out the permits could raise issues of fairness and reliance,and there is an interest in making auctions viable.see munro drydock,heron,cir.but in the ordinary case,these are arguments against relief or particular types of proof that relief is impossible.it is only in an extreme case,a completed complex reorganization,rochman northeast utils.serv.group in re pub.serv.of,cir,cert.denied,d,that the failure to seek a stay might be deemed fatal at the outset.
alternatively,gowen says that appellants waived their objections,or that laches applies,because they did not oppose the default,default judgment,or motion for sale,and did not seek a stay of the confirmation order.no obvious reason exists why either default entry or judgment should bar an objection to the adequacy of the auction price the fairness of the sales price could hardly be an issue prior to the sale.by analogy,failure to contest a default judgment for an unliquidated sum does not automatically bar a dispute as to damages.see.b sony elm state,cir.
on the other hand,the failure to object in advance to inclusion of the permits could be deemed fatal to an appeal on that issue.this is not because of the default judgment the complaint did not specifically mention the permits nor does a default judgment automatically preclude all challenges,in subsequent stages of the same case,to the legal premises of the complaint it is because after the default but before the sale nunya knew from the terms of the motion that gowen sought to include the permits in the sale and did nothing to object to this inclusion in court prior to the sale.
although the complaint did not request anything more specific than the arrest,attachment,and sale of the quality one and the attachment and sale of other unspecified property of nunya,the duly served motion for an order of sale explicitly sought to include the permits and history as appurtenances to be sold.no objection was filed on behalf of appellants.thereafter,the court order specifically designated the permits and history as items to be sold at the auction to the extent legally permitted although there were more than two weeks between the order and the sale,again no objection was filed by appellants.
it seems to us that once appellants knew that the order of sale was intended to sell the fishing permits and history,they had an obligation to make a timely objection to the district court.reilly united states,cir.under the district of maine local rules,objections to the motion for an order of sale were waived if they were not filed within ten days after the filing of the contested motion,me.b the period was recently increased to days.appellants did not file any objection in the more than three weeks between gowen motion and the date when it was granted.
nonetheless,although the obligation to make timely objections is worth stressing for the benefit of future litigants,we do not rely upon it in this case.when the district court ordered that the sale include the permits,it said that this inclusion was to the extent permitted by applicable law,arguably reserving the issue for later disposition.and the district court decided on the merits the issue of whether the permits were properly included.under these circumstances,we decline to decide the dispute based solely on waiver or laches.
under maritime law,a maritime lien against the vessel and its appurtenances arises for certain liabilities,including wharfage and repairs,and the vessel can be arrested and sold to satisfy such liens.see generally gilmore black,the law of admiralty ch.ix ed.it was on that doctrinal premise that the sale in this case took place.if the permits were appurtenances,they were subject to the lien and passed with the sale of the vessel if not,they were merely personal property of the owner,like a desk in a steamship company office.benedict on admiralty,at ed.the term vessel includes its apparel and appurtenances.
traditionally,a maritime lien attaches not only to the bare vessel but also to equipment that is used aboard the vessel and is essential to the vessel navigation,operation,or mission.gonzalez destiny panama,d,see also united states sylvester whalen.although a vessel fishing permits generally must be kept on board,l,the rights themselves are what matter,and they are intangible.the question,not often mooted,is whether a maritime lien applies to intangibles that play a role similar to the vessel equipment.
there is no general objection to treating an intangible as an appurtenance.on the contrary,freight charges due on account of a vessel carriage of cargo are subject to maritime liens against the vessel.united s
