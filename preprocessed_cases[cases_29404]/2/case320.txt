between and,the united states,through its commodity credit corporation ccc,and with the assistance of several private relief organizations,shipped cargoes to areas of africa on behalf of the agency for international development aid.the cargoes were shipped under various charter parties made expressly subject to cogsa on the overseas harriette and the overseas marilyn,vessels owned by the defendants,ocean bulk ships,and transbulk carriers.the shipments included a variety of foodstuffs such as vegetable oil,corn,and bulgur wheat,which were shipped to the african ports of mombasa,kenya beira and maputo,mozambique freetown,sierra leone and tema,ghana.clean bills of lading were issued for each shipment after the cargo was stowed,indicating that the cargo was received by the carrier in good condition.unfortunately,the goods were not received in the same quantity or quality when discharged in africa.survey reports documenting the loss and damage indicated several problems.some parts of the cargo were simply not received at all.some parts of the cargo were received in a damaged and unusable condition.for example,bags were torn and spilled,and some of the cargo was wetted and rotten.the total amount of documented loss and damage to the cargo was.
in december,the united states filed the first of five lawsuits,seeking damages for the lost and damaged cargo under cogsa.in february,these suits were consolidated.in september,the matter was tried to the bench.in december,the district court entered judgment in favor of the united states for the limited sum of,the amount of damage that the defendants admit occurred prior to discharge.this appeal ensued.
when cogsa was enacted in,one of its express purposes was to redress the edge in bargaining power enjoyed by carriers over shipper and cargo interests by setting out certain duties and responsibilities of carriers that can not be avoided even by express contractual provision.thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed citing.cogsa applies to all contracts for carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states in foreign trade.the provisions of cogsa are not generally applicable to charter parties.id.a shipper and carrier may agree,however,to a clause paramount by which the terms of cogsa are incorporated into a charter party.schoenbaum,supra,at.in this case,the charter agreements,shipping contracts,and bills of lading contain clauses making the shipments subject to the terms of cogsa.thus,the parties agree that cogsa governs the resolution of this dispute.
cogsa sets up a complex system of shifting burdens and accompanying presumptions of liability.id,at.this use of presumptions and shifting burdens of proof predates the statutory schemes of liability and is thus rooted in strong policy considerations specific to the context of cargo loss.most of these rules developed to alleviate the perceived unfairness of certain common law rules requiring a shipper to conclusively prove the cause of cargo loss or damage notwithstanding the fact that the circumstances surrounding the loss or damage were primarily accessible to the.id.those policy considerations are evident in cogsa current statutory scheme,which shifts the burden of proof more frequently than the winds on a stormy sea.see also tubacex,risan,cir characterizing cogsa statutory scheme as a game of burden shifting.the first stage of cogsa statutory framework requires the shipper to establish a prima facie case of loss or damage by proving that the cargo for which the bill of lading was issued was loaded in an undamaged condition,and discharged in a damaged condition.tubacex,at see also quaker oats torvanger,cir.a clean bill of lading issued by the carrier to the shipper is prima facie evidence that the goods were received in an undamaged condition.shell oil gilda,cir blasser,line,cir see also.a bill of lading is prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described.a cogsa shipper must also demonstrate damage upon discharge.int l,laurel sea,cir.damage upon discharge may be established by the report of an independent cargo surveyor attending the discharge.united states cent.gulf lines,cir discussing the use of survey reports to establish loss or damage upon discharge see also c requiring that a cargo surveyor attend the discharge of aid shipments made by the agency for international development or a cooperating sponsor.
a shipper prima facie case creates a presumption of liability.see blasser,at.at that point,the burden of proof shifts to the,which must prove that it exercised due diligence to prevent the loss or damage to the cargo,or that the loss or damage was the result of one of the act enumerated uncontrollable causes of loss,id.at.see also tubacex,at blasser,at.
if the carrier successfully rebuts the shipper prima facie case,then the presumption of liability vanishes and the burden returns to the shipper to show that carrier negligence was at least a concurrent cause of the loss or damage to the cargo.tenneco resins,davy int l,ag,cir blasser,at.if the shipper successfully establishes that the carrier negligence is at least a concurrent cause of the loss or damage,then the burden shifts once again to the carrier,which must establish what portion of the loss was caused by other factors.tenneco resins,at blasser,at.if the carrier is unable to prove the appropriate apportionment of fault,then it becomes fully liable for the full extent of the shipper loss.tenneco resins,at blasser,at.
we review the district court application of this burden shifting paradigm and other legal issues de novo.see mendes.int sokai maru,cir.the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.id.
on appeal,the united states claims that it established a prima facie case by producing clean bills of lading as proof that the carriers received the goods in an undamaged condition and survey reports showing that the goods were either missing upon discharge or were discharged in a damaged condition.such a showing is clearly sufficient under cogsa.see,quaker oats,at.
the defendants seek to avoid that conclusion in this case by arguing that the district court found the survey reports offered by the united states as evidence of loss or damage to be incredible.thus,defendants maintain that the district court did not find credible evidence establishing the united states prima facie case.
we disagree.the district court accepted the clean bills of lading as evidence that the cargo was delivered to the defendants in good condition.the district court did not question the reliability of the survey reports as tendered to establish loss or damage to the cargo upon discharge.to the contrary,the district court accepted the virtually undisputed fact that the cargo was either lost or damaged upon discharge,and then held that the defendants were not responsible for the losses,either because the damage occurring during discharge could have been caused by third parties,such as the port authority or its agents,see world food programme tay,cir interpreting the statutory exception codified at.q to permit a carrier to avoid liability when it can prove that the loss or damage was caused after the carrier relinquished control of the cargo to a third party that,likewise,was acting completely beyond the carrier control,or because the united states failed to respond to the defendants suggestion that improper packaging,an excepted cause under.n,played a role in the loss with evidence that the loss or damage was caused,at least in part,by negligence attributable to the carrier.both of these holdings presume the existence of a prima facie case,and thus focus upon later stages of the cogsa burden shifting paradigm.
to the extent that the district court raised any question at all about the united states reliance upon the survey reports,that question was limited to the issue of whether the survey reports were probative on the issue of causation,rather than damage.the district court referred to language appearing in two of the five survey reports,stating its opinion that the reports listed several possible causes without settling upon a single cause as more probable than another.thus,the district court suggested that those two reports standing alone did not tend to establish what caused that portion of the loss and damage about percent documented in those surveys.the issue of causation,however,and the shipper burden to prove concurrent causation in particular,is not a required element of the shipper prima facie case and is,likewise,limited to the later stages of cogsa burden shifting framework.for the foregoing reasons,we reject the defendants argument that the district court implicitly rejected the united states evidence of damage upon discharge and conclude that the united states satisfactorily established a prima facie case of loss or damage under cogsa by producing clean on board bills of lading for each shipment,paired with records unambiguously documenting that the cargo was either missing or damaged when discharged at the destination port.
the united states claims that the carriers failed to rebut its prima facie case.as set forth above,cogsa lets carriers rebut the shipper prima facie case by showing that the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss fall within one of seventeen statutory exceptions denominated as uncontrollable causes of loss or,more directly,by demonstrating that the carrier exercised due diligence in its stowage,carriage,and discharge of the cargo.see.there is considerable controversy,and even an conflict,as to whether the carrier rebuttal burden with respect to most of those exceptions is one of production or persuasion.
the first sixteen of the seventeen statutory exceptions to carrier liability set out at.merely provide that the carrier is not liable for losses or damages caused by one of the listed causes.in this group are included losses attributable to such things as an act of god,id.d,an act of war,id.e,and the primary exception at issue in this case,a shipper own improper packaging,id.n.the seventeenth exception,q,is a exception,which states that the carrier is not liable for losses or damages resulting from any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier or its agents.that subsection goes on,however,to provide that,with respect to q,the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that the carrier fault or neglect did not contribute to the loss or damage.id.q.thus,the exception codified at q expressly requires that the carrier prove the applicability of the exception,while the remaining statutory exceptions are silent on the point.
some fifth circuit panels have relied upon the additional statutory language in q to implicitly place a heightened burden of proof on the carrier under q and to permit a more lenient burden under the remaining exceptions.specifically,some panels of this court have required a carrier proceeding under q to bear,not just the burden of going forward with evidence,but the burden of persuasion with respect to any defense premised upon that subsection.see tubacex,at the burden on the carrier under q is more than merely a burden of going forward with evidence,but rather it is a burden of persuasion with the attendant risk of.quaker oats,at the carrier burden of establishing his own freedom from contributing fault under q is no mere burden of going forward with evidence,but a real burden of persuasion,with the attendant risk of nonpersuasion.internal quotations omitted see also westinghouse leslie lykes,cir citing in re ta chi navigation panama,cir,for the proposition that w hen congress wanted to put the burden of proving freedom from fault on a shipowner claiming the benefit of an exemption,it specifically said so.other courts have,in similar fashion,placed a mere burden of production on a carrier seeking to rebut the shipper prima facie case when the provision in q was not involved.see,sun oil carisle,cir thus,if the carrier wants to escape liability under cogsa without reference to a cause specified in section a p,it must prove that its negligence did not contribute to the loss.eac timberlane pisces,cir declaring that q imposes upon the carrier the most demanding burden under maritime law,that is,the burden of persuasion,whereas other cogsa exceptions carry less imposing burdens in re ta chi navigation panama,at opining that congress intended for shipowners to bear a heightened burden of proof when relying upon q and refusing to read that burden into b lekas drivas,goulandris,cir refusing to read the qualification of q into a p,because congress did not put it there hecht,levis kahn,president buchanan,cir the language relating to burden of proof in.q pretty clearly refers only to the carrier burden of proving that damage comes within subsection q and does not relate to the inherent vice exception contained in m.under these authorities,it would seem that once the shipper has proved his prima facie case,the carrier claiming an exception under a p bears merely a burden of production with respect to establishing the applicability of one of those exceptions.when,however,the carrier relies upon q,the carrier must bear the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to the applicability of that exception.
the earliest fifth circuit decision to address the issue,however,at least implicitly reaches a different conclusion.in waterman united states smelting,refining mining,cir,this court held that a carrier seeking to avoid liability on the theory that the damages were caused by perils of the sea,c,or latent defects in the cargo,p,bore both the burden of going forward to demonstrate the applicability of the exceptions and the risk of.id.at.the proposition that a carrier bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion with respect to those exceptions was drawn from commercial molasses new york tank barge.in commercial molasses,the supreme court held that the shipowner,in order to bring himself within a permitted exception to the obligation to carry safely,whether imposed by statute or because he is a common carrier or because he has assumed it by contract,must show that the loss was due to an excepted cause and not to breach of his duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel.id.at.furthermore,since the burden is on the shipowner,if he does not sustain it,the shipper must prevail if,upon the whole evidence,it remains doubtful whether the loss is within the exception.id.the commercial molasses court explained that this burden rests upon the carrier not in consequence of his being an ordinary bailee but because he is a special type of bailee who has assumed the obligation of an insurer.id.in addition to waterman,which has never been overruled,there are decisions by this court and others,which either suggest that the carrier bears the burden of persuasion for all exceptions or fail to delineate any difference between the applicable burden for those exceptions codified at a p and the exception codified at q.see shell oil gilda,cir section q provides that the carrier has the burden of proving it was not at fault if the cause of the loss is not listed in a p.q.congress therefore could not have intended the shipper to bear the burden of proving negligence in every case.most courts and commentators have concluded from the structure of that congress did not intend to pla
