in this case involving a maritime contract,we review the appellant claim that the district court erred when it found appellant claim time barred.appellant argues that the district court erred in holding that the carmack amendment,and its statute of limitations,was inapplicable to this case.we also review the district court denial of summary judgment in two brought by one appellee against the other appellee.after careful consideration,we affirm the district court order with regard to appellant carmack amendment claim,affirm the district court denial of summary judgment on one,and vacate and remand the remaining for reconsideration by the district court.
in march of,altadis altadis purchased a shipment of cigars and cigar bands from congar international,a company located in cayey,puerto rico.the shipment,containing cartons of cigars and cartons of bands,was placed in a container and booked with sea star line sea star for shipment to altadis in tampa,florida the cigars and cigar bands were to be shipped from puerto rico to the port in jacksonville,florida.from there,they were to be transported overland to tampa,florida where altadis would receive them.a single through bill of lading was issued in puerto rico and covered the entire shipment including the ocean voyage to jacksonville and the overland transportation from jacksonville to tampa.
on march,the ship arrived in jacksonville and american atf took possession of the cargo as the inland carrier responsible for delivering the shipment to altadis in tampa.according to the transportation service agreement tsa between altadis and sea star,atf was engaged to continue the carriage under the same multimodal bill of lading at some point after receiving the container,atf driver parked the truck which contained the cigar container in the front driveway of a closed gas station.he left the vehicle overnight.when he returned the next day,march,to continue the trip to tampa,the container was gone.it was found empty on march,in south dade county,florida.
altadis sued sea star and atf in florida state court under various theories of liability.the case was removed to federal court soon afterward.both sea star and atf filed affirmative defenses based on the statute of limitations.sea star filed a against atf asserting common law contribution and indemnity and also breach of contract sea star then filed a series of motions for summary judgment,all of which claimed that altadis had failed to timely file its suit within one year after the date the container should have been delivered.this statute of limitations was provided for both in the bill of lading and in the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa.the bill of lading also stated that the relationship between carrier sea star and atf and shipper altadis shall have effect subject to the provisions of the united states carriage of goods by sea act.atf filed a similar motion for summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment for atf as to the claims by altadis but it did not initially rule on altadis claims against sea star or the by sea star against atf.later,the court granted sea star motion for summary judgment as to the claims by altadis and denied sea star motion for summary judgment on its against atf effectively ruling that sea star were without merit.the district court then ordered the clerk to close the case.
altadis appeals from the district court order of summary judgment for sea star and atf.altadis appeal is based on the carmack amendment,which states that a carrier can not provide,by rule or contract,for a statute of limitations of less than two years for bringing a civil action.altadis argues that the carmack amendment,with its minimum statute of limitations,governs the case,and that the statute of limitations relied upon by sea star and atf,and used by the court to grant summary judgment,is inapplicable.sea star seeks review of the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment on its two brought against atf one under a common law theory of contribution and indemnity,and another alleging breach of contract.
ii.discussion 
the district court granted summary judgment to atf and sea star on altadis complaint based on the language contained in the bill of lading issued by sea star.the district court relied upon two grounds the bill of lading issued was a through bill of one issued to the final therefore all carriers,including land carriers,are subject to its terms and the bill of lading specifically incorporated cogsa into the agreement,and therefore cogsa and its statute of limitations,not the carmack amendment,applies to the case.
using the date of the second amended complaint filed by altadis and the date of the alleged theft or loss of the cigar container,the district court agreed with atf and sea star that more than one year had passed between the loss to altadis and the service of process on atf and sea star the court then quoted from the language of the bill of lading,which said that suits for loss or damage to cargo must be brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date the goods should have been delivered,and that no suit will be deemed to have been brought unless service of process on carrier or the vessel has been effected.since altadis did not serve process on atf until april,and the loss occurred on march,the district court found that atf was entitled to summary judgment 
on appeal,altadis argues that the carmack amendment,and its minimum statute of limitations,applies,and not the statute of limitations provided for in the bill of lading and cogsa.altadis suggests that the secretary of transportation and surface transportation board have jurisdiction of atf carriage on the overland jacksonville to tampa leg and that the carmack amendment minimum statute of limitations is applicable 
on the other hand,sea star and atf argue that the instant carriage is maritime commerce governed by a maritime contract.they argue that the governing law is the bill of lading and cogsa,both of which provide for a statute of limitations 
the question with which we are faced is straightforward where a single bill of lading covers a shipment from puerto rico to tampa including the ocean leg to jacksonville and the overland leg from jacksonville to tampa,does the carmack amendment and its minimum statute of limitations apply to a loss occurring on the overland leg,or does the statute of limitations provided for in the bill of lading and cogsa apply 
the case law has established that the carmack amendment does not apply to a shipment from a foreign country to the united states including an ocean leg and overland leg to the final destination in the united states unless the domestic,overland leg is covered by a separate bill of lading.the sixth circuit so held in american road service consolidated rail,cir holding that the carmack amendment and its minimum statute of limitations does not apply to a shipment from a foreign country governed by a through bill of lading,unless a domestic segment of the shipment is covered by a separate domestic bill of lading.in shao link cargo taiwan,cir,the court held that the carmack amendment does not apply to shipments from a foreign country to the united states unless a domestic segment of the shipment is covered by a separate bill of lading.the seventh circuit is in accord see capitol converting equipment lep transport,cir holding that the carmack amendment does not apply to a shipment from a foreign country to the united states covered by a through bill of lading,unless a domestic segment of the shipment is covered by a separate domestic bill of lading.dicta in our own circuit is consistent with the fourth,sixth and seventh circuits.in swift textiles,watkins motor lines,cir,we held that the carmack amendment was applicable to a shipment from a foreign country where the loss occurred during the domestic,overland portion of the shipment between the united states port and the final destination in the united states,and where the domestic overland portion of the shipment was covered by a separate,domestic bill of lading.we held that when a shipment of foreign goods is sent to the united s
