we are asked to decide the law to be applied to the loss of cargo during an intermodal shipment of is,a shipment carried by water and land transportation on a single bill of lading.defendants orient overseas containers lines uk,oocl europe,orient overseas container line,and oocl usa appeal from a november,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york douglas eaton,magistrate judge.that court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff hartford fire insurance hartford and awarded damages for cargo shipped originally from wisconsin and stolen in belgium during the final land segment of a shipment to the netherlands under a bill of lading issued by defendants to hartford insured and subrogor,trek bicycles trek.the district court concluded that the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,et,governed the entire intermodal carriage from wisconsin to the netherlands and,therefore,that cogsa provision applied even though the cargo was lost while being transported by truck in europe after discharge from the vessel.for the reasons stated below,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in august,defendant oocl usa,as agent for defendant oocl uk entered into a service agreement with trek to move certain cargo containers from wisconsin to various destinations in europe.two months later,oocl uk issued to trek a through bill of lading for the shipment of a container of packages of bicycles and bicycle framesets from oconomowoc,wisconsin to spijkenisse,the netherlands.the bill of lading indicated that oocl uk would serve as the carrier for the water segment of the carriage,while other unnamed participating carriers would transport the container for the land portions of the carriage.
pursuant to this arrangement,the container was picked up at trek facility in oconomowoc and transported by truck to chicago.from chicago,the container was moved by rail to montreal,canada,where it was loaded onto defendants vessel,the oocl bravery.defendants transported the container by sea from montreal to antwerp,belgium,and then discharged it to a participating carrier who was supposed to transport it by truck to the consignee premises in spijkenisse.
defendants had selected debrock gebr.transport,debrock as their trucker between antwerp and inland destinations in europe,but debrock subcontracted with groeninghe groeninghe to transport trek container from antwerp to spijkenisse.on october,a groeninghe truck picked up the container from defendants ship at antwerp.later that evening,thieves stole the truck,together with the container of trek bicycles,after the truck had been left on a public road without any supervision or guard near the driver domicile in deurne,belgium.the police were able to track down approximately of trek stolen packages,but the remainder were never recovered.
in november,trek filed a claim with its insurer,hartford,for the value of the missing packages.hartford reimbursed trek on the claim and then,as subrogated insurer,commenced the instant action for recovery of the value of the missing cargo plus incidental expenses.defendants responded by setting forth two reasons for why their liability should be limited under clause of the bill of lading first,they maintained that,as the carrier under the bill of lading,they were exonerated from liability under clause because the cargo was lost while in the custody of a participating carrier.second,they contended that,even if they were liable under the bill,clause subjected their liability to the limits established by the law governing the particular transport stage during which the goods were,the convention on the contract for the international carriage of goods by road,may,et.cmr.
in its memorandum and order dated november,the district court rejected both of these arguments and granted summary judgment in favor of hartford.holding that cogsa applies to the entire intermodal carriage,including the period of time when the goods were in the trucker custody,the court concluded that defendants could not avail themselves of either the exoneration provision in the bill of lading clause or cmr provision,because both provisions are inconsistent with cogsa section of cogsa provides that 
a ny clause in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability arising from negligence,fault,or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section,or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this chapter,shall be null and void and of no effect.
cogsa,therefore,prohibits a carrier from reducing its liability by inserting an exculpatory clause in its shipping contract.the district court found that defendants invocation of the exoneration provision in the bill of lading and cmr provision was an attempt to circumvent this prohibition.accordingly,it declined to apply either provision.
the district court also found that the application of cmr provision would violate the fair opportunity doctrine,which is a federal common law doctrine developed in admiralty.under the fair opportunity doctrine,a shipper must have had a fair opportunity to declare a higher liability value for its cargo in order for a carrier to limit its liability under cogsa.see general mv nedlloyd,cir.applying this doctrine,the district court found that defendants had failed to provide the shipper,trek,with an opportunity to declare a cargo value higher than cmr limit.accordingly,the court refused to limit hartford recovery under cmr and granted summary judgment in hartford favor for the full market value of the unrecovered cargo plus incidental costs.defendants filed a notice of appeal on december,and an amended notice of appeal on february.
we consider at the outset hartford claim that we lack appellate jurisdiction as to defendants oocl usa and oocl europe because they failed to file a timely appeal.rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure requires a party to file an appeal within days of entry of judgment hartford maintains that oocl uk was the only defendant identified in the initial notice of appeal,and that days had elapsed before other defendants were specifically designated as appealing parties in the amended notice of appeal.hartford contends that we must therefore dismiss this appeal with respect to defendants oocl usa and oocl europe.
hartford is correct that the amended notice of appeal is untimely,but dismissal is not warranted in the circumstances presented here because the initial notice of appeal provided adequate notice of the intent of all defendants to appeal.the rules provide that a n appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.fed.c.the test for determining whether a notice of appeal is adequate is whether it is objectively clear that a party intended to appeal.fed.c advisory committee note amendment see also maerki wilson,cir w hat constitutes compliance with rule c has clearly been liberalized.in this case,the initial notice of appeal refers in a parenthetical phrase to every defendant the caption of the notice also lists each defendant as a party to the case.such references demonstrate a clear intention by all defendants to appeal the district court judgment.agee paramount communications,cir finding no appellate jurisdiction over an attorney appeal where the attorney failed to list himself as a party to the appeal in the caption or body of the notice of appeal.accordingly,we conclude that we have appellate jurisdiction over every defendant and proceed to the merits of the appeal.
our primary task is to determine the appropriate law that governs the final overland portion of the carriage.to complete this task,we must first address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.
in its complaint,hartford alleges that this case falls within both our admiralty and diversity jurisdictions.defendants argue,in response,that no admiralty jurisdiction exists.rather than resolve this issue,the district court proceeded to analyze the case under its diversity jurisdiction,which is undisputed.we must address the question of whether this case falls under our admiralty jurisdiction because both the district court opinion and hartford arguments are based,in part,on the application of federal common law principles developed in admiralty.in the district court view,defendants can not avail themselves of cmr provision because they failed to provide trek with a fair opportunity to declare a higher cargo value,in contravention of federal common law.hartford similarly relies on federal common law when it claims that the exoneration provision in the bill of lading violates the common law principle that holds carriers contractually liable for the acts of their subcontractors.see leather best,mormaclynx,cir holding,as a matter of federal common law,that a carrier is responsible for the loss of cargo due to a subcontractor negligence.because federal common law developed in admiralty is not freely transferable to the diversity setting,stewart,ricoh,d citing texas industries,radcliff materials,d,we must answer the question that the district court avoided and determine whether there is admiralty jurisdiction.
the general rule for exercising admiralty jurisdiction in a contract case is that jurisdiction arises only when the of the contract is purely or wholly maritime in nature.transatlantic marine claims agency,ace shipping,cir citing rea v.the eclipse.mixed contracts,which involve obligations for both sea and land carriage,generally do not fall within a federal court admiralty jurisdiction.see see also,berkshire fashions,hakusan ii,cir holding that a bill of lading providing for partial sea and partial land transport would not give rise to admiralty jurisdiction.the bill of lading in the case at bar qualifies as a mixed contract,as trek container was to travel by land from oconomowoc to montreal,by sea from montreal to antwerp,and again by land from antwerp to spijkenisse.accordingly,the bill ordinarily would not fall within our admiralty jurisdiction.
notwithstanding this general rule,we have held that a federal court can exercise admiralty jurisdiction over a mixed contract if the claim arises from a breach of maritime obligations that are severable from the obligations of the contract or the portion of the contract is merely incidental to the portion.see transatlantic marine,at.neither of these exceptions,however,applies in this case.
the first exception does not apply because,even if the maritime obligations were severable,the loss of trek container did not arise from a breach of such obligations rather,the loss occurred while the cargo was being transported on land in belgium.see id.explaining that the first exception is not available where the loss at issue arises from activity.
the second exception also fails to provide a ground for admiralty jurisdiction in this case.transport by land under a bill of lading is not incidental to transport by sea if the land segment involves great and substantial distances.berkshire,at holding that extensive states transport is not an incidental aspect of a shipping contract see also kuehne nagel ag geosource,cir deciding that a carriage of goods of up to miles was more than incidental to the maritime portion of the contract coleman compagnie generale maritime,describing the transport by rail from kansas to georgia as far more than merely incidental.although the record in the instant case does not reveal the exact mileage that the cargo would travel by land or sea under the bill of lading,the land segment of the carriage is clearly more than incidental to the water segment.the bill involves land shipment from oconomowoc to chicago by truck chicago to montreal by rail and antwerp to spijkenisse by truck.we take judicial notice that the sum of these segments of overland transportation is at least miles.see the new international atlas,rand mcnally,providing scaled maps that show the sum of distances between these cities deutch united states,d taking judicial notice of the fact that ithaca is more than one hundred and miles from albany boyce motor lines united states.we may,of course,take judicial notice of geography.furthermore,the bill requires carriage by land through four countries using two different modes of transportation truck and rail and several different participating carriers.alaska barge and,united states,examining the overall subject matter of the contracts and the nature and importance of the overland services rather than relying strictly on mathematical computations to determine whether carriage of cargo by land is incidental.we therefore conclude that the bill of lading in this case involves land carriage that is more than incidental to sea carriage,thus placing this dispute outside of our admiralty jurisdiction.
in the absence of admiralty jurisdiction,this case is governed,under diversity jurisdiction,by applicable state rules.see klaxon stentor electric.specifically,we are required to apply the rules of the state in which the trial court sits,which in this case is new york.see id.new york law is clear in cases involving a contract with an express provision absent fraud or violation of public policy,a court is to apply the law selected in the contract as long as the state selected has sufficient contacts with the transaction.see international minerals and resources,pappas,cir.we therefore turn to the provisions in the contract at issue bill of determine the law that governs this case.
as is often true in disputes regarding contracts for transportation,the bill of lading in this case is not a model of careful draftsmanship.amazingly,there are two applicable provisions in the bill.the first,clause,provides that e ach stage of the transport shall be governed according to any law and tariffs applicable to such stage.see supra note.the second,clause,states in relevant part that 
a ll carriage under this bill of lading to or from the united states of america shall have effect subject to the provisions of cogsa or if this bill of lading governs carriage to or from canada,it shall have effect subject to cogwa which shall be deemed to be incorporated herein except as otherwise provided herein,cogsa or cogwa shall govern the goods before loading on board and after discharge from the vessel and while subject to this bill of lading.
emphasis added.
the resulting confusion over the governing law is unsurprising,for clause seems to indicate that cogsa governs that portion of the trip after trek container left defendants ship at antwerp,while clause suggests that the laws of belgium,which has ratified cmr control this stage of the carriage.
in resolving this conflict,the district court gave undue weight to some fragments of clause and essentially ignored clause.the court held that cogsa applies to the entire intermodal carriage,including the period of time when the goods were in the trucker custody in belgium.it based this holding on a determination that cogsa imposes responsibility on a carrier for the acts of its agents regardless of conflicting contractual provisions such as clause.it therefore refused to enforce provisions in the bill of lading that,in seeming contravention of this federal statute,reduced defendants liability.
we conclude that this was error.the district court reasoning rests on the incorrect assumption that cogsa applies here by its own force,or in the quaint and famous latin aphorism of the law,ex proprio vigore.cogsa only applies by its own force,however,during the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.e.a carrier and a shipper can extend cogsa so that it applies prior to loading and subsequent to discharge of goods from a ship,see but the extent of any application beyond the scope of the statute is a matter of contract.see colgate palmolive dart canada,cir parties may contractually extend cogsa application beyond its normal parameters.when they do so,however,cogsa does not apply of its own force,but merely as a contractual term.in this case,the parties agree that the bill of lading extended cogsa beyond its normal statutory reach consequently,if cogsa applied to the instant case,it would do so only by virtue of contract and not ex pr
