a city requested that a volunteer youth group affiliated with the boy scouts of america,in order to qualify for continued free use of berths in the city marina,provide written assurance the group would not discriminate against homosexuals or atheists wishing to participate in the group program.the city,deeming the policy statement the group provided ambiguous and therefore insufficient,discontinued its subsidy.members of the group sued,claiming,among other things,that the city action violated their freedoms of speech and association.the trial court sustained the city demurrer,and the court of appeal affirmed.we conclude the court of appeal correctly determined that the complaint does not establish a violation of plaintiffs constitutional rights and affirm the lower court judgment.

plaintiffs are individual adult and youth participants in the berkeley sea scouts,suing for themselves and other program participants.the berkeley sea scouts sea scouts are volunteers joining together in a nonprofit association with no formal administrative structure,no budget,and no employees.adults,including some of the named plaintiffs,use sea scout vessels to teach sailing,seamanship,marine engine repair,electrical repair,woodworking,and other skills for a maritime career,as well as teamwork,to teenagers who pay no more than a year to participate.ethnic diversity is a hallmark of the sea scouts,and many youth participants are economically disadvantaged.girls as well as boys participate,and the sea scouts have never actually discriminated against anyone on the basis of sexual orientation or religion.
according to the operative complaint,the sea scouts are a subdivision of,or with,the national boy scouts of america bsa.the sea scouts operate under what the complaint describes as bsa regional office,the mount diablo council.each sea scout ship functions as the equivalent of a boy scout troop.bsa provides the group with a maritime liability insurance policy but gives it no direct funding.bsa,according to the complaint,follows a policy of discriminating against homosexuals and atheists participation.
in the late,berkeley began giving bsa one or more free berths at its marina for use by the sea scouts,after the mount diablo council permitted berkeley to quarry rock from bsa property to build the marina and breakwater.the arrangement was formalized by city resolutions in and that required compliance with marina rules and regulations and allowed revocation on days written notice.
in march,in response to requests from other nonprofit organizations for free berths,the city manager recommended and the berkeley city council adopted through resolution resolution a uniform policy for awarding free berths to nonprofit community service organizations under the resolution,an organization seeking free berth space must supply a beneficial public service,the benefit of which greatly exceeds the value of the berth.the organization also must demonstrate,through m embership policy and practices,among other criteria,that it promote s cultural and ethnic diversity.resolution goes on to specify that access to marina facilities may not be predicated on a person race,color,religion,ethnicity,national origin,age,sex,sexual orientation,marital status,political affiliation,disability or medical condition.the resolution provides for the berkeley waterfront commission waterfront commission to review applications and make recommendations to the city council.organizations receiving berthing subsidies are to have those subsidies reviewed annually by the city council after a review and recommendation by the waterfront commission.
the continued provision of free marina berths to the sea scouts came up for review in the waterfront commission in early.the commission expressed concern that bsa policy of discrimination against homosexuals and atheists was in conflict with resolution and asked the sea scouts to provide a local policy statement ensuring nondiscrimination.the sea scouts,in negotiation with the mount diablo council,approved a policy statement intended to satisfy berkeley requirements.in a letter to the waterfront manager,dated april,the sea scouts stated we will continue to comply with the constitution of the united states of america,the laws of the state of california and the berkeley municipal section and city council resolution,we actively recruit adult leaders and adolescents meeting the minimum age requirements without regard to sex,race,color,national origin,political affiliation,religious preference,marital status,physical handicap or medical condition.we believe that sexual orientation is a private matter,and we do not ask either adults or youths to divulge this information at any time.
the waterfront commission recommended the city council continue the sea scouts free berths.the city manager,however,recommended the council discontinue the free berths,based on an opinion by the city attorney concluding that continuation of the free berth subsidy to the sea scouts would violate both resolution and section of the berkeley municipal code,which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in the use of city owned or supported facilities and services 
in her opinion,which was provided to the council with the city manager recommendation,the city attorney concluded the sea scouts april,letter did not constitute compliance with resolution or berkeley municipal code section.in the city attorney view,the sea scouts assertion in the april letter that they considered sexual orientation to be a private matter did not state a policy that the group would not,in the future,discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.according to the city attorney,the sea scouts said they were unwilling to state such an express policy due to fear of losing their charter from the boy scouts.from her examination of this court then recent opinion in curran mount diablo council of the boy scouts,supra,cal th,d,and her discussion with bsa attorney in that case,the city attorney concluded that bsa requires local groups to adhere to its policy of excluding avowedly gay or atheistic members or adult leaders,even where a local nondiscrimination law requires otherwise.in light of bsa policy,the city attorney concluded,the qualified language of the april letter was insufficient to show compliance with berkeley ordinance and resolution.
the berkeley city council took up the matter on may.according to plaintiffs complaint,at the may meeting the city council was made aware that the sea scouts had never discriminated against gays or atheists and that the sea scout program served an ethnically and economically diverse group of young people.the city council nevertheless voted to end the berth subsidy.
according to the minutes of the may council meeting,the free berths were discontinued due to bsa discriminatory policies against gays and atheists.in a letter giving the sea scouts notice their free berths were cancelled,the berkeley waterfront manager indicated the city council had denied free berths to the sea scouts because,in the complaint words,the sea scouts were associated with the national boy scouts of america organization which has a national policy of discriminating based on sexual orientation and atheism.
because of its hostility to bsa,plaintiffs allege,berkeley decided to punish and intentionally discriminated against the completely innocent children and community volunteer s of the sea scouts.berkeley allegedly knew plaintiffs had,in the april,letter,agreed not to discriminate against gays or atheists.the city used g uilt by association,excluding plaintiffs from the free berth program solely because of bsa policies,without ever determining that the sea scouts themselves pose d the threat feared by the government discrimination in the use of publicly owned facilities.here,there is no evidence that plaintiffs or any participant in the berkeley sea scouts program was going to unlawfully discriminate against anyone,yet they have been penalized by the deprivation of the continued free use of the public facilities.
plaintiffs allege the exclusion of the sea scouts from the free berth program violated their rights of free speech and association and constituted a denial of due process and equal protection of the laws.these deprivations of constitutional rights are claimed to be violations of state and federal civil rights laws,including civil code sections,and,and title united states code section.plaintiffs seek damages reflecting the value of berths they were unable to afford to continue using,the rental they have paid and will pay for the berth they still use,emotional distress,and consequential losses.the complaint does not pray for injunctive or declaratory relief.
the trial court sustained berkeley demurrer to the amended complaint without leave to amend.the court of appeal affirmed,reasoning that plaintiffs had merely been denied a city subsidy because they declined to adhere to berkeley nondiscrimination policy.berkeley had not attempted to muzzle anyone speech or force the sea scouts to sever their association with bsa,but had only conditioned a city subsidy on compliance with nondiscrimination principles.
we granted plaintiffs petition for review.
discussion 
plaintiffs contend berkeley violated their rights of free association,speech,and equal treatment under the law by punishing them for being part of bsa despite their having never violated berkeley antidiscrimination laws and having solemnly promised not to do so in the future.the court of appeal,plaintiffs argue,erred in holding berkeley had properly conditioned the subsidy on compliance with nondiscrimination laws because plaintiffs have agreed to comply.the lower court and berkeley,plaintiffs maintain,are refusing to take yes for an answer.
berkeley,in contrast,argues that it may place nondiscrimination conditions on government funding without violating rights of speech and association,and insists it properly denied continued free berthing solely because the sea scouts were unable to provide adequate assurances of future nondiscrimination,assurances berkeley reasonably demanded in light of the known policies of bsa,of which the sea scouts are a part.
we agree with berkeley and the court of appeal that a government entity may constitutionally require a recipient of funding or subsidy to provide written,unambiguous assurances of compliance with a generally applicable nondiscrimination policy.we further agree berkeley reasonably concluded the sea scouts did not and could not provide satisfactory assurances because of their required adherence to bsa discriminatory policies.
berkeley could constitutionally demand sufficient guarantees of nondiscrimination 
berkeley requirement that an individual or group receiving a city subsidy in the form of free berths in the berkeley marina agree in advance to administer its program without invidious discrimination did not infringe on plaintiffs speech or associational rights.in order to meet the city mandate of nondiscriminatory participation policies,the sea scouts were required neither to espouse nor to denounce any particular viewpoint nor to form or break any association or affiliation,but only to assure berkeley of their adherence to the city policies in connection with subsidized use of berkeley facilities.
under the decisions of the united states supreme court,that berkeley nondiscrimination requirement applied only to programs assisted by a city subsidy,in the form of free berths at the marina,is virtually dispositive.the high court has generally approved,against first amendment challenges,programs of governmental financial assistance that limit the expressive activities for which the funds may be used.
in the leading case of rust sullivan,d,the court rejected a first amendment challenge to regulations prohibiting abortion counseling in programs supported by federal family planning funds.the government can,without violating the constitution,selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest,without at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in another way.in so doing,the government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.a legislature decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.citations.id.at.
in restricting the range of counseling and advocacy in which programs receiving federal funding could engage,the government had not denied the grantees the right to engage in activities.congress has merely refused to fund such activities out of the public fisc rust sullivan,supra,at.accord,united states american library,d.statutory requirement that libraries receiving aid for internet access use filtering software does not penalize libraries that choose not to install such software,or deny them the right to provide their patrons with unfiltered internet access.the statute simply reflects congress decision not to subsidize their doing so.to the extent that libraries wish to offer unfiltered access,they are free to do so without federal assistance regan taxation with representation of,d denial of full status to an organization that engages in substantial lobbying activities does not infringe on freedom of speech a legislature decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right,and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny locke davey,d scholarship program exclusion of theology students does not violate first amendment free exercise clause provision of assistance to those pursuing secular education does not constitute a baseline against which denial of assistance to theology students must be deemed a burden on religion.
the supreme court has applied these principles,in particular,to uphold,against first amendment challenges,government rules limiting financial assistance to those organizations that agree in advance not to practice invidious discrimination in programs.grove city college bell,d grove city is the closest case on point.a federal statute required recipients of federal education funds to agree not to discriminate on the basis of sex in any program so funded.when the plaintiff college declined to provide an assurance of compliance with the statute,the federal department of education terminated a program of tuition assistance to the college and its students.id.at.
the grove city plaintiffs attacked the statutory condition as,inter alia,a violation of their first amendment rights,but the high court found the constitutional claim warrants only brief consideration.congress is free to attach reasonable and unambiguous conditions to federal financial assistance that educational institutions are not obligated to accept,pennhurst state school and hospital halderman,d.grove city may terminate its participation in the tuition aid program and thus avoid the requirements of the nondiscrimination provision.students affected by the department action may either take their tuition aid elsewhere or attend grove city without federal financial assistance.requiring grove city to comply with title ix prohibition of discrimination as a condition for its continued eligibility to participate in the tuition aid program infringes no first amendment rights of the college or its students.grove city,supra,at,italics added see also bob jones university united states,d bob jones restrictive condition on charitable tax status,requiring lack of racial discrimination,did not infringe university first amendment right to freedom of religion because the compelling interest in preventing racial discrimination in education justified the policy limited impact on exercise of religion denial of tax benefits will inevitably have a substantial impact on the operation of private religious schools,but will not prevent those schools from observing their religious tenets.
similarly,berkeley,in conditioning free berths on a group adoption of a nondiscriminatory membership policy,has not prohibited or penalized plaintiffs exercise of speech or associational rights.in adopting resolution and applying it to end free berths for the sea scouts,the city did not purport to prohibit the scouts from operating in a discriminatory manner it simply refused to fund such activities out of the public fisc rust sullivan,supra,at.to the extent the sea scouts objected to compliance with resolution,the organization to paraphrase grove city,supra,at.was free to terminate its participation in the free berth program and thus avoid the requirements of the nondiscrimination provision a legislature decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right regan taxation with representation of,supra,at.
the supreme court has recognized two exceptions to its broad rule that the government refusal to subsidize exercise of a first amendment right does not infringe that right.neither is applicable here.
first,a funding restriction that has as its purpose the suppression of a disfavored,but not only,where the government program at issue exists to create or foster a public subject to strict scrutiny.invalidating a rule precluding federally funded legal services affiliates from challenging welfare laws,the supreme court explained where private speech is involved,even congress antecedent funding decision can not be aimed at the suppression of ideas thought inimical to the government own interest.legal services velazquez,d see also rosenberger rector and visitors of of,d exclusion of journals promoting a particular set of religious viewpoints from program of financial assistance to student newspapers infringed student group freedom of speech regan taxation with representation of,supra,at.refusal to subsidize lobbying would not come within the rule of permissibility if congress were to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas perry sindermann,d college teacher allegation that the administration decision not to rehire him was based on his public criticism of its policies presented a bona fide constitutional claim speiser randall,d denial of a tax exemption for engaging in certain speech infringes freedom of speech because it is frankly aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas.
the exception for attempted suppression of a disfavored viewpoint is inapposite to the condition imposed here.in terminating the sea scouts free berths because of the group failure fully and unambiguously to promise future nondiscrimination,berkeley did not demand adherence to or renunciation of any idea or viewpoint.a government that requires aid recipients to conform their actions to its laws does not thereby enforce adherence to the philosophy or values behind those laws.more specifically,to state,in applying for government funding,that one will not use the funding for a discriminatory program is not necessarily to state that one agrees with the government nondiscrimination objective.thus berkeley,in requiring assurances that its subsidy and property will be used without discrimination on the basis of religion or sexual orientation,does not demand adherence to the viewpoint that motivated the nondiscrimination provision.see boy scouts of america wyman cir,exclusion of bsa from state workplace charitable contribution campaign because of its discriminatory policies was viewpoint neutral in that nondiscrimination rule purpose was to protect persons from the economic and social harms of discrimination rather than to impose a price on the expression of bsa point of view but see boy scouts of america,south florida till d,exclusion of local council from use of public schools because of its adherence to bsa discriminatory policy characterized as punishment of council for its message.
second,a restriction is suspect to the extent it goes beyond limiting the government funded expressive activity of the recipient and attempts further to limit expressive activities that are not government funded.in rust sullivan,supra,at pages,the high court explained that funding restrictions previously held to constitute unconstitutional conditions had involved a condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather than on a particular program or service,thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program,but that a recipient of family planning funds could,despite the restrictions at issue,continue to engage in abortion advocacy through programs that are separate and independent from the federally assisted project.see also fcc league of women voters of california,d invalidating rule precluding public broadcasting stations from editorializing,in part because under the rule a station that received only a small amount of its income from federal grants was barred absolutely from all editorializing the station has no way of limiting the use of its federal funds to all noneditorializing activities,and,more importantly,it is barred from using even wholly private funds to finance its editorial activity sullivan,unconstitutional conditions harv,discussing germaneness as a limitation on government funding conditions.
this exception,too,is inapplicable.berkeley,in conditioning its free berths on the sea scouts agreement not to engage in invidious discrimination,did not purport to control the exercise of speech or associational rights by the sea scouts or individual plaintiffs outside the berkeley marina program.even were the nondiscrimination assurance demanded by berkeley regarded as a conditional burden on speech or association,its scope would be limited to the very program subsidized by the city.as in rust sullivan,supra,d,and regan taxation with representation of,supra,d,plaintiffs here would be free to exercise their expressive or associational rights fully in any program not funded by public money.federal high court precedent thus fails to support plaintiffs constitutional claims.
plaintiffs also contend that by conditioning free berths on adequate assurance of nondiscrimination,berkeley has established an unconstitutional condition under the decisions of this court.we disagree.
in danskin san diego unified sch.dist.cal d,this court held invalid on first amendment grounds a statutory and regulatory scheme that permitted the use of school facilities for the meetings of private groups but excluded subversive elements.we explained that while t he state is under no duty to make school buildings available for public meetings id.at,having done so it could not constitutionally demand tickets of admission in the form of convictions and affiliations that it deems acceptable id.at.we reiterated this principle in bagley washington township hospital dist.cal d,explaining that the power of government,federal or state,to withhold benefits from its citizens does not encompass a supposed lesser power to grant such benefits upon an arbitrary deprivation of constitutional right.at the same time,we emphasized that some such conditions on public benefits were justifiable we articulated a test of justification focusing on how germane and the condition is to the purpose of the legislation establishing the benefit and whether the utility of imposing the condition outweighs the impairment of constitutional rights.id.at,see also committee to defend reproductive rights myers cal d.
to apply these principles governing conditions on public benefits here,we need not decide whether berkeley had adequate justification for its condition,as the giving of adequate assurances of not demand or preclude the exercise of any speech or associational right by plaintiffs.plaintiffs repeatedly disavow,both in their complaint and in their briefs in this court,any desire to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or religion.they therefore can not,and do not,claim that berkeley,by requiring them to refrain from such discrimination as a condition of the free berths,is restricting their freedom to limit their membership for purposes of expressive association.boy scouts of america dale,supra,d hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,d.indeed,plaintiffs,in their briefing,explain why this is a misconstruction of their claims berkeley suggests that petitioners challenge the condition as forc ing inclusion of homosexuals and atheists in their ranks.obviously this is not so,because petitioners do not discriminate.
berkeley requirement that the sea scouts document a nondiscriminatory membership policy in order to qualify for the free berth program also did not condition receipt of a public benefit on the sea scouts giving up their right to be a part of bsa.in requiring assurances of nondiscrimination,berkeley did not in any way demand,even as a condition of the free berths,that the sea scouts quit bsa.to the extent compliance with the city requirement would have that effect,it would be by the choice of a third party,bsa.were bsa,that is,to cut its ties with a local scouting program because the program made assurances of nondiscrimination to a local government,the decision to sever the association would be bsa,not the government.we are aware of no authority for the extraordinary proposition that government infringes on associational rights by offering one group a financial benefit that,if accepted,could lead another group to sever its association with the recipient 
nor,as already discussed,did berkeley requirement that free berth recipients have nondiscriminatory membership policies require the sea scouts,as a condition of the subsidy,to adopt an antidiscrimination viewpoint or repudiate bsa discriminatory philosophy a philosophy the sea scouts,in any event,expressly state they do not share.we therefore do not agree with plaintiffs that by conditioning free berths on the sea scouts statement of a local nondiscrimination policy,the city compelled them to renounce bsa positions and to advocate and disseminate berkeley own philosophy.as already explained,to condition a public benefit on assurances of nondiscrimination is not to compel advocacy of a viewpoint.
the complaint alleges berkeley attempted to compel the sea scouts to subscribe to a pledge of fealty or loyalty oath according with berkeley antidiscrimination values.on analysis,however,these general claims provide no valid grounds for a claim of unconstitutionality.the only facts alleged regarding such a coerced statement of viewpoint concern the waterfront commission request for a local policy statement of nondiscrimination.the sea scouts,according to the complaint,provided such a statement in their letter of april.this satisfied the waterfront commission,which recommended continuation of the free berths,albeit on conditions that the letter be distributed to program participants and that the sea scouts initiate a dialogue with the mount diablo council on obtaining a change in the national bsa policy.had the berkeley city council accepted the waterfront commission recommendation and imposed these conditions on continuation of the free berths,plaintiffs might with greater plausibility contend the conditions infringed their freedom of speech.but the city council rejected the waterfront commission recommendation,instead accepting the city manager and city attorney recommendation that the subsidy be discontinued because the april letter was an insufficient assurance of nondiscrimination.the city council action mooted any claim that the conditions proposed by the waterfront commission were unconstitutional.
ii.plaintiffs have not been punished for associating with bsa 
relying on healy james,d,plaintiffs contend they have been subjected to a judgment of guilt by association in that berkeley had no reason to believe the sea scouts themselves pose d the threat of discrimination feared by the government,but rather assumed they discriminated simply because of their affiliation with bsa.id.at.berkeley denial of free berths was arbitrary and unjustified by its nondiscrimination purpose because,plaintiffs contend,it punishes innocent children,and their adult leaders,who are not engaged in the discrimination that berkeley claims to be battling.in a related claim,they argue they were denied equal protection of the laws in that they were treated differently from other nonprofit community service organizations using the marina,solely because of their association with bsa.again,we disagree.
the sea scouts are a part of bsa,an organization whose official policy excludes homosexuals and atheists from participation.that berkeley officials were unaware of any past discrimination by the sea scouts does not mean none would occur in the future.to require of a group operating as part of an organization with an official policy of discrimination that it agree in advance not to discriminate in the use of the city free marina berths is a reasonable and narrowly tailored step to implement the diversity and nondiscrimination provisions of resolution.that other groups,which were not part of bsa,were not required to give local policy statements assuring nondiscrimination does not show unequal treatment.
when the city asked the sea scouts to document that their local policy differed from bsa,the sea scouts negotiated with bsa over such a policy,but,as their attorney explained to the trial court,they could say the words we do not discriminate on the basis of sexual discrimination sic orientation,because the boy scouts objected.according to the attorney,bsa told plaintiffs,you ca say you do discriminate based on sexual orientation.
at oral argument in this court,plaintiffs,through their attorney,expanded on these concessions.when asked by the court what plaintiffs course of action would be if an openly and avowedly gay person sought to participate in the sea scouts program,counsel responded,if the boy scouts forbid it,it would happen i f the boy scouts came down on us,we would have to exclude that person.asked whether plaintiffs and bsa were one and the same with regard to potential discrimination,counsel replied,essentially,and explained that while bsa and the sea scouts were different organizations,we are bound by what the boy scouts tell us we have to do.we accept these concessions by plaintiffs as establishing,even as against any contrary allegation or implication of the complaint,that the sea scouts could not,consistent with the limitations imposed on them by bsa,truthfully state they would not in the future discriminate against openly gay or atheistic participants.see derose carswell d.concessions of the plaintiff attorney before trial court negate contrary allegations for purposes of demurrer browne superior court cal d,the petitioner concessions at oral argument negate contrary allegations in the habeas corpus petition sacramento county deputy sheriffs county of sacramento th,fn,d admissions in the plaintiffs appellate brief negate statements in declarations for summary judgment purposes.
because of the restrictions enforced by bsa,the april,letter was ambiguous as to how the sea scouts would treat an avowedly gay or atheistic participant.the sea scouts statement that they would obey city law implied they would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or religion,as city law forbade such discrimination.but the subsequent statement that the sea scouts recruit without regard to a list of factors including race,sex,and religious preference,but not including sexual orientation or religion as such,implied,to the contrary,that the group would disfavor potential participants who were known to be gay or who prefer red no religion.finally,the sea scouts statement that they viewed sexual orientation as a private matter they do not ask participants to divulge strongly implied that they viewed openly or a
