melvin sidwell petitions for review of the decision and order of the benefits review board brb denying his claim for permanent partial disability benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,as amended,west lhwca.sidwell,who became president of local of the international longshoremen association local after leaving his former employer,virginia international terminals,vit,alleged in his application for benefits that he suffered a hearing loss while employed as a container repair mechanic by vit.the administrative law judge alj reviewing sidwell claim found his subsequent employment as president of local constituted maritime employment that exposed him to injurious stimuli,and that local was therefore responsible for sidwell injury,rather than vit.the brb affirmed that decision.because we conclude the alj and brb erred in finding that sidwell responsibilities with local constituted maritime employment,we grant sidwell petition for review,vacate the brb final decision and order,and remand.
in,a doctor diagnosed sidwell with a hearing loss.at the time of the diagnosis,sidwell was employed as the president of local,which represented employees involved in maritime cargo operations at various waterfront terminals around the hampton roads area of chesapeake bay in virginia although sidwell generally discharged his duties as president from his home,in order to address specific issues or grievances he would appear from time to time at one or more of the waterfront terminals where local members worked as a result of these visits,sidwell spent approximately one hour per week at locations where longshoring activity was taking place.the remainder of sidwell was devoted to representing local on supervisory committees of the hampton roads port authority away from the waterfront terminals.
prior to becoming a employee of local in,sidwell primary employment was with vit as a container repair mechanic at vit,sidwell inspected the shipping containers from cargo vessels and the trailers on which they were placed for transportation by truck before they left the terminal.the inspections were performed in vit roadability lanes,where employees conducted any necessary cleaning,structural repairs,and maintenance on the containers and trailers as they entered or left the marine terminal.in discharging these duties,sidwell routinely used,chippers,grinders,and tire changers.it is undisputed that the operation of these tools as well as other machinery and vehicles in the area contributed to high levels of noise throughout the.
after ending his employment with vit in order to serve as president of local,sidwell spent much less time at the roadability lanes or other areas of the marine terminals around hampton roads.sidwell occasionally visited the waterfront marine terminals in order to resolve issues regarding pay,productivity,shift rotation,and other labor issues.however,sidwell primary responsibilities as local president involved maximizing the number of jobs available to his local membership and resolving questions regarding the scope of the union jurisdiction.sidwell also served as the local representative on several committees with oversight responsibility over various aspects of the operation of the hampton roads waterfront marine terminals.
following the diagnosis of his hearing loss,sidwell filed a claim under the lhwca for permanent partial disability benefits that identified vit as the responsible employer.in opposing sidwell claim,vit attempted to shift liability for sidwell disability to local through the last maritime employer rule.under that rule,the last employer covered by the lhwca who causes or contributes to an occupational injury is fully liable for compensation benefits.in support of this effort,vit asserted that the nature of sidwell employment as president of local demonstrated that local was a covered employer under the lhwca and that sidwell time at work sites where local membership was employed exacerbated his hearing loss.
both the alj at the hearing and the brb on appeal concluded that sidwell employment with local constituted maritime employment and that he was exposed to injurious stimuli in that capacity.sidwell now petitions this court for review,arguing that the brb erred in concluding that sidwell position as president of local constituted maritime employment.
our review of the brb order is limited.we review the brb decision to assess whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the alj and whether the legal conclusions of the brb and alj are rational and consistent with applicable law.see gilchrist newport news shipbuilding dry dock,cir see.metro.area transit,cir.while our review of the alj factual findings is thus limited to ascertaining whether the alj relied on evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support its conclusions,see see,at,we review the legal conclusions on which the determination is based de novo and without deference to the brb interpretation of the lhwca provisions,gilchrist,at.
sidwell challenge to the brb decision and order turns on whether the brb properly applied the last maritime employer rule.in keeping with the lhwca policy to encourage the prompt and efficient administration of compensation claims,newport news shipbuilding dry dock stilley,cir quoting rodriguez compass shipping,d,this court and others have adopted a last employer rule in assigning liability for lhwca claims involving multiple employers.this rule assigns full liability under the lhwca to the last maritime employer that exposed the employee to injurious stimuli before the became aware of his injury.id.at.because the rule applies only to maritime employers,the last employer covered by the lhwca will always be fully liable for a claimant injury even though a subsequent,employer also contributed to the injury.id.at 
in his petition,sidwell argues that local was not a maritime employer to whom vit could shift full liability.in response,vit reiterates its contention that sidwell responsibilities as president demonstrate that he is a covered employee under the lhwca.for purposes of the last maritime employer rule,the terms covered employer and maritime employer are synonymous.see stilley,at.an employer is covered under the lhwca if it has any employee engaged in whole or in part in maritime employment.see.hence,whether local is a maritime employer turns on whether sidwell position as president,the only position with the local,constitutes maritime employment.
although the term maritime employment is not defined by the lhwca,the act does provide a list of occupations that meet the criterion.section of the act defines a covered employee as any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations,and any including a ship repairman,shipbuilder,and.emphasis added.although the position of president of a union local is not among the occupations enumerated by the lhwca as qualifying as maritime employment,vit argues that the nature of sidwell responsibilities demonstrates that his position constitutes maritime employment under the other person s engaged in longshoring operations language of.the assessment of whether a person employment qualifies under this category entails an occupational test that focuses on loading and unloading.pfeiffer ford,d emphasis added.more precisely,only occupations that are an integral or essential part of loading or unloading a vessel qualify as maritime employment under the other persons category of.see chesapeake ohio ry.schwalb,d.the determinative consideration in identifying whether an occupation is integral or essential is whether the employee role is such that the ship loading process could not continue absent the employee participation.id.at.
it is undisputed that sidwell role as union local president does not require him to engage in the physical activity of loading and unloading vessels.the question then becomes whether sidwell duties are such that his occupation can be considered integral or essential to the process of loading or unloading vessels so as to bring him within the category of other persons engaged in longshoring operations.first,vit argues
