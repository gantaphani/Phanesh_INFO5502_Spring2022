ii.background 
in october,representatives of zernavi,an italian ship catering company,met with representatives of royal olympic lines,royal olympia cruises collectively,roc,the operator of the vessel,in greece to begin negotiations for zernavi to provide victuals and food and beverage management to the vessel.the parties reached agreement on the services zernavi would provide and the prices to be charged,with the details of the agreement to be finalized in continuing negotiations.the negotiations continued into november,when the vessel made its positioning voyage from greece to florida,where it would operate for the winter months from the home port of port everglades in fort lauderdale,florida.before the vessel left on the positioning voyage,zernavi assumed control of the victualing and food and beverage management.accordingly,zernavi purchased worth of existing food and beverage items already onboard the vessel and in a warehouse in greece that were owned by owc and roc,and loaded the warehouse items onto the vessel before it left the mediterranean sea.
during the positioning voyage zernavi had one representative onboard the vessel,giuseppe longo longo,and another representative,vincenzo orlandini orlandini,who was onboard for part of the voyage.upon arriving in florida,zernavi issued invoices totaling for items consumed and services rendered during the positioning voyage.
orlandini,along with another zernavi representative,massimo guglielmo guglielmo,met the vessel when it arrived in fort lauderdale,florida.from florida,they organized zernavi purchase of food,beverage,and food service items from united states suppliers and had the items loaded onto the vessel before it conducted cruises from port everglades.together,longo,orlandini,and guglielmo provided food and beverage management services both while the vessel was in port everglades,and while the vessel conducted cruises from its home port of port everglades.
the vessel made two cruises from port everglades the first was from november,to december,and the second was from december,to january.zernavi issued invoices to the vessel totaling for items consumed and services rendered during the first cruise,and invoices totaling for items consumed and services rendered during the second cruise.zernavi also issued invoices related to items consumed and services rendered on both cruises that totaled.all together,zernavi invoices for the two cruises from port everglades amounted to.
at the end of december,after the second cruise had already departed from port everglades,roc submitted a proposed contract to zernavi for its approval.however,the proposed contract included several provisions that were either directly opposite zernavi proposals or had not yet been negotiated,including an english choice of law provision.zernavi never signed roc proposed contract and explicitly rejected it during a telephone conversation.ultimately,owc filed for bankruptcy protection and the banks filed this action to foreclose on the vessel.
after the vessel ceased operations,zernavi sold to the vessel and her owners the food,beverage,and food service items that remained onboard after the conclusion of the second port everglades cruise on january.zernavi and representatives for the vessel conducted a full inventory of the remaining items,and zernavi issued invoices to owc and roc totaling.
zernavi filed a motion to intervene in this action,claiming that it was entitled to a maritime lien under the commercial instruments and maritime liens act cimla,et,which grants priority to creditors holding maritime liens for necessaries provided in the united states over those holding preferred mortgages on foreign vessels.see.the banks contested zernavi claim,arguing that english law should be applied to zernavi claim under the choice of law provision in the proposed contract that roc submitted to zernavi in december,or,alternatively,that greek law should apply.the banks claim that neither english nor greek law would give zernavi claim priority over the banks preferred ship mortgage.
the district court found that zernavi never agreed to the proposed contract,and did not agree to any choice of law provision.the district court ultimately determined that united states law should apply,and that zernavi was entitled to a maritime lien under cimla,which was superior in priority to the banks preferred ship mortgage.the district court determined that zernavi was not entitled to a lien for the invoices totaling related to bringing the vessel from greece,as those items and services were not provided in the united states.this amount was offset by the credit zernavi gave the vessel to purchase the existing inventory on the vessel when zernavi began servicing the vessel in greece.accordingly,the district court concluded zernavi is entitled to a preferred maritime lien for,arriving at that amount by adding the invoices from the two cruises from port everglades and the items sold to the vessel after the cruises,and deducting the remaining credit due the vessel after the positioning voyage.

discussion 
choice of.the proposed contract 
the banks first argue that the choice of law is determined by the english choice of law provision included in the proposed contract that roc submitted to zernavi,which zernavi explicitly rejected and refused to sign.the district court found that in october the parties owc,roc,and zernavi reached an agreement for zernavi to provide certain victualing and food and beverage services to the vessel,and agreed upon the pricing for the goods and services.however,the court found that the proposed contract did not represent the agreement of
