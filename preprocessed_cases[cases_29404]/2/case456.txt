we must decide a challenge to the constitutionality of the maritime drug law enforcement act arising out of the boarding by the united states coast guard of a foreign vessel in international waters off the west coast of mexico and the arrest and conviction of the colombian nationals on board.
carlos,alberto,jose,and bernardo defendants are colombian nationals who were on board a vessel in international waters approximately miles southwest of acapulco,mexico on july.the antietam,a navy destroyer,was patrolling those same waters that night,carrying a united states coast guard law enforcement detachment team.a naval helicopter based on the antietam spotted the ship sitting dead in the water.soon thereafter,the vessel began moving south and one of the men on board was observed speaking on a radio.the naval personnel in the helicopter then contacted the antietam,which proceeded to the area.upon seeing the approaching antietam,the vessel speed increased and its occupants were observed pulling white bundles from compartments on the vessel,which they proceeded to throw overboard 
the vessel eventually was stopped and boarded by coast guard personnel.all on board stated that they were colombian nationals,while the individual identified as the captain of the boat claimed that it was of colombian registry.the coast guard then notified the state department which in turn contacted the colombian government in an effort to verify registry.the colombian government neither confirmed nor denied that the ship was in fact colombian.
the vessel was deemed stateless and the defendants were taken into custody,brought to san diego,and,on august,indicted for violations of,the maritime drug law enforcement act mdlea.specifically,the defendants were charged with violations of section a,possession of cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states with intent to distribute,and section j,conspiracy to possess cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states with intent to distribute.
on august,the defendants moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the mdlea is an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority the district court lacked jurisdiction over the defendants and the penalty provisions of the mdlea violate the fifth and sixth amendments by allowing for increased maximum penalties on the basis of facts not charged in the indictment and submitted to the jury.
on october,following a hearing,the district court denied the defendants challenges to the constitutionality of the statute and to the court jurisdiction.in denying the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,the district court stated 
insofar as the argument that the statute is basically unconstitutional,or at least the jurisdiction of this court is unconstitutional,the government has relied on the constitution,article i,section,clause,which allows congress to define and punish piracies and felonies on the high seas and offenses against the laws of nations,and the ninth circuit has specifically held the maritime drug law enforcement act that involved in this case constitutional in united states davis.
on january,however,the government filed what it termed a motion on jurisdiction which noted that,under the mdlea,the court is required to rule on jurisdictional issues prior to trial.see.f.
the government attached to its motion a copy of a certificate under seal bearing the signature of the acting secretary of state.that certificate attests that one commander scott genovese was,at the time the certificate was issued,the coast guard liaison to the state department.attached to the certificate under seal is genovese declaration describing the events surrounding the apprehension of the defendants.also appended to the certificate is documentation concerning the communications between the united states and colombian governments in the aftermath of the detention of the defendants revealing that the colombian government could neither confirm nor deny the claim of registry.
the government attempted to present this documentation at a hearing before the district court on friday,february,four days before trial was set to begin.while the government asserted that its motion was merely a housekeeping matter,there was nevertheless quite a bit of confusion.the district that it had already decided all issues of jurisdiction at the october,when presented with the certificate,asking counsel for the government,what am i supposed to do with this counsel for defendants objected to the admission of the document,to which the court responded,okay,i take your objection under submission.if there anything further anybody wants to say about this document,you can tell me monday.
there was no further challenge to the document,and on february,a jury was empaneled.the next day,before opening statements in the trial were scheduled to be delivered,the defendants agreed to plead guilty to the first count of the indictment,conspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than kilograms of cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.
under the relevant terms of their plea agreement,the defendants preserve d their right to appeal the court rulings concerning constitutionality of the statute,jurisdiction,and violation of rule on the bases set forth in the papers below.during the rule colloquy,the court questioned the defendants regarding their qualified pleas so,basically,what you want to appeal is the constitutionality of the statute that brought you here,why i have saying you still do like the fact that you in the united states.when asked by the court if they understood that they could appeal those issues and those issues only,each defendant answered affirmatively.
the guilty pleas were entered and the defendants timely appealed.
on appeal,the defendants first raise two distinct constitutional challenges.they argue,first,that congress lacked the authority to enact the mdlea and,second,that the statute itself violates their rights under the fifth and sixth amendments to the constitution.
three of the four defendants persist in arguing that.is unconstitutional because it does not require on its face a showing of nexus to interstate or foreign commerce with the united states this despite the district court finding that the government had correctly located congressional authority to enact the mdlea not in the commerce clause,but in article i,section,clause of the constitution,which empowers congress to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,and offences against the law of nations,art.i,cl.
as an exercise of congressional power pursuant to article i,section,clause,this court clearly has held that the mdlea is constitutional.see united states davis,cir holding that the mdlea falls within congress power to define and punish piracies and felonies on the high seas.
one of the defendants,contends that is not among the felonies and piracies on the high seas that congress is empowered to define under article i,section,clause.we,however,have held otherwise.in united states aikins,cir,this court found that the mdlea expressly prohibits the possession of drugs on certain vessels with intent to distribute and,citing davis,further found that such a prohibition was within congress power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas.id.at.
congress,therefore,was acting within its constitutionally conferred authority when it passed the mdlea.that authority is expressly conferred by article i,section,clause,not by the commerce clause,so there need be no nexus between the activities proscribed by the mdlea and interstate or foreign commerce.this court earlier holdings in aikins and davis require us to reject defendants claims that the mdlea is unconstitutional because it lacks a nexus to interstate because drug trafficking is not a piracy or felony within the meaning of article i,section,clause.
defendant contends that the mdlea,and specifically section f of the act by declaring all jurisdictional issues to be questions of law to be decided by the court and not the jury,violates his constitutional right to have every element of the offense presented to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.see apprendi new jersey,d,and in re winship,d.
under the explicit terms of the plea agreement reached with the government,each of the defendants preserved his right to appeal the court pretrial rulings regarding the constitutionality of the statute,jurisdiction,and violation of rule on the bases set forth in the papers below,unlike the other three defendants,contends that the term constitutionality of the statute in the plea agreement should not be construed so as to prevent him from asserting on appeal that,in enacting section f of the mdlea,congress has removed from the jury consideration an element of the is,whether or not the defendants were aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.
but by focusing solely upon the term constitutionality of the statute in the plea agreement,overlooks the two essential qualifying,the court pretrial rulings and set forth in the papers below that bookend the term he cites.defendants motions to,their papers below upon which the court pretrial rulings were include challenges to the constitutionality of the statute and the court jurisdiction.as noted above,however,the constitutional challenges were based not on section f,but rather on congress alleged lack of authority to enact the mdlea,on the one hand,and the alleged constitutional infirmity of the act penalty provisions,on the other.we have already addressed and rejected the former claim and the latter claim is similarly without merit it is clear,therefore,that did not raise his constitutional challenge to section f in the papers below,nor did the district court address such a challenge in its pretrial rulings.consequently,the claim that the mdlea violates the fifth and sixth amendments because it removes from the jury an element of the offense has not been properly preserved under the terms of the plea agreement.see united states chon,cir holding that a conditional plea of guilty results in a waiver of all issues not expressly reserved for appeal 
even if challenge to the constitutionality of section f had been preserved in the plea agreement,that challenge is still not properly before us.for,by pleading guilty,like the other defendants,waived his right to have a jury determine his guilt or innocence with respect to every element of the offense.indeed,the plea agreement clearly states that the defendant understands that this guilty plea waives his right to continue to plead not guilty and require the government to prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and his right to a speedy and public trial by jury.the agreement further notes that defendant understands that the offense to which he is pleading guilty includes as one of its elements.the defendant his possessed cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.can not knowingly waive his right to a jury trial and then contend on appeal that his right to such a trial has been violated.while we will discuss section f in greater detail below,it is sufficient for present purposes to note that the statute can not violate rights that the defendant has voluntarily surrendered.see united states gonzalez,cir holding that a defendant unconditional guilty plea renders his sixth amendment challenge to section f a moot issue.
defendants next contend that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction over them.
the mdlea states that i t is unlawful for any person on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute,or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance.a.five possible definitions of a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states are set forth in section c,the most important of which for the purposes of this case is a vessel without nationality.c a.a vessel without nationality,according to section c,can take one of three forms 
a a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry,which claim is denied by the flag nation whose registry is claimed 
b any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge fails,upon request of an officer of the united states empowered to enforce applicable provisions of united states law,to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel and 
c a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.
in opposing the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,the government initially relied on section c a as a basis for the court jurisdiction over the vessel in this case and contended that because the appropriate authorities in colombia were unable to confirm registry,the defendants vessel was a stateless vessel within the definition of section c c.yet,when it filed its motion on jurisdiction on january,to which motion it attached the state department certificate,the government relied on section c c,a contention that counsel for the in its brief and at oral was erroneous.on appeal,the government renews its earlier contention that the jurisdiction was proper under section c a.
defendants counter that,because the government did not introduce the state department certificate until february,the government provided no proof that the vessel in this case was subject to the jurisdiction of the united states at the time the district court made its jurisdictional ruling on october.in short,defendants argue that the only possible basis for a finding of therefore of the state department certificate.because that certificate was not before the district court when it made its jurisdictional determination,defendants contend that jurisdiction was improper.
in response,the government argues that,in reality,there were two different jurisdictional determinations made by the district constitutional,the other statutory.the october hearing on jurisdiction,in the government view,was limited to determining only constitutional,whether the court could exercise jurisdiction over the defendants without violating due process.the issue of statutory the court had subject matter,according to the government,reserved until the motion on jurisdiction along with the attached state department certificate was filed on january.
the government assertion that there were actually two separate findings of constitutional,the other statutory is belied by the district court own confusion at the alleged second jurisdictional hearing,indicating that the court itself did not believe it was engaged in such a bifurcated analysis 
aside from the district court admitted confusion,there is a still more significant flaw in the government theory concerning the jurisdictional determination in this case.
the government contention on the court decided constitutional jurisdiction first and statutory jurisdiction with our precedent.simply put,the government places the cart before the horse.our precedents make clear that,in applying the mdlea,a court first must ensure that a united states court will assert jurisdiction only over a defendant who should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in this country.united states,cir citation omitted.this determination,moreover,must be made before trial.id.nexus is part of the jurisdictional inquiry,but it is an inquiry for the court,not the jury.but where the united states has jurisdiction by virtue of the statelessness of the vessel in question,we have made clear that the statelessness determination obviates the need for any showing of nexus.the law of this circuit,as well as that of at least five sister circuits treats defendants apprehended aboard stateless vessels differently from those apprehended aboard ships for the purposes of this nexus analysis.with respect to those apprehended aboard vessels,there must be some nexus to the united states before jurisdiction can be established there is no such requirement for defendants aboard stateless vessels.compare u
