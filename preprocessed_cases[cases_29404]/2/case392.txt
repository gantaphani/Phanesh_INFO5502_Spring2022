the economic loss doctrine precludes recovery against a manufacturer for physical damage that the manufacturer defective product causes to the product itself.river delaval.but the manufacturer can be sued for physical damage the product causes to other property.id.at.we consider whether a vessel owner may sue for the physical damage a defective vessel component causes to property that the owner adds to the vessel before the vessel is delivered.put another way,is property added by the owner to a vessel prior to the delivery of the vessel considered other property 
background 
chmm,llc is the owner of jamaica bay,a meter luxury yacht.in,chmm contracted with nobiskrug gmbh to construct,equip,launch and complete the yacht at nobiskrug shipyard and to sell and deliver the yacht to chmm for approximately million.nobiskrug subcontracted with freeman marine equipment for the manufacture of a weathertight door for installation in the yacht.this door provided access from the foredeck to the interior of the yacht.
the shipbuilding contract between nobiskrug and chmm states that the interior outfit of the yacht is to be provided by chmm and that delivery and installation of the interior outfit has to be executed within the time frame laid down in nobiskrug construction schedule.chmm contracted with third parties for the purchase and installation of the items in the yacht interior.the yacht that nobiskrug ultimately delivered to chmm contained a finished interior outfit.
in,while the yacht was at sea en route to the bahamas,the freeman door allegedly malfunctioned,letting in a substantial amount of water.the subsequent flooding severely damaged the yacht and its interior,including woodwork,furniture,carpeting,electrical wiring,and electronics.chmm estimates it would cost over million to repair the damage.
chmm sued freeman,alleging five tort claimsnegligence,defect in design,defect in manufacture,failure to properly instruct in the installation and use of the door and negligent misrepresentation.freeman moved to dismiss on the ground that recovery for physical damage to the yacht interior was barred by the economic loss doctrine announced in east river steamship.while this motion was pending,chmm amended its complaint to add a sixth claim for breach of contract,warranty.
the magistrate judge construed the motion as against the amended complaint and determined that the economic loss doctrine barred chmm five tort claims because the interior of the vessel was integrated into the completed vessel and was therefore part of the product itself.the magistrate judge held that the portion of the sixth count that alleged breach of contract should be dismissed because chmm had no contractual relationship with freeman.but the magistrate judge concluded that it would be premature to dismiss the breach of or express warranty claims without giving chmm an opportunity for discovery.the district court adopted the magistrate judge findings and recommendation in full and granted chmm leave to file a second amended complaint to the extent that chmm seeks tort remedies for damage to other property added after delivery of the vessel by nobiskrug to chmm.

ii.discussion 
we have described the economic loss doctrine,as applied in products liability cases,as follows 
if a plaintiff is in a contractual relationship with the manufacturer of a product,the plaintiff can sue in contract for the normal panoply of contract damages,including foreseeable lost profits and other economic losses.whether or not the plaintiff is in a contractual relationship with the manufacturer,the plaintiff can sue the manufacturer in tort only for damages resulting from physical injury to persons or to property other than the product itself.
giles motors acceptance,cir emphasis added.this doctrine is rooted in t he distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss.seely white motor,cal en banc.as chief justice traynor explained in seely,this distinction rests on the understanding that a manufacturer can appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by requiring his goods to match a standard of safety defined in terms of conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm,but he can not be held liable for the level of performance of his products in the consumer business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer demands.id.
the supreme court relied on seely in applying the economic loss doctrine to products liability cases in east river.at.there,supertanker charterers sought recovery in tort for damage caused by defective turbine parts.the court held that the charterers were precluded from tort recovery because there was no damage to other property,as each supertanker defectively designed turbine components damaged only the turbine itself.id.at.the court reasoned 
damage to a product itself is most naturally understood as a warranty claim.such damage means simply that the product has not met the customer expectations,or,in other words,that the customer has received insufficient product value.the maintenance of product value and quality is precisely the purpose of express and implied warranties.therefore,a claim of a nonworking product can be brought as a action.or,if the customer prefers,it can reject the product or revoke its acceptance and sue for breach of contract.
id.at citations and footnote omitted.
the court added that a contract or warranty action has a limitation on liability in the form of the agreement of the parties and the requirement that consequential damages,such as lost profits,be a foreseeable result of the breach.id.at.by contrast,permitting tort recovery for all foreseeable claims for purely economic loss could make a manufacturer liable for vast sums,as products liability law imposes a duty to the public generally.id.indeed,it difficult for a manufacturer to take into account the expectations of persons downstream who may encounter its product.id.thus,the court observed,the economic loss doctrine account s for the need to keep products liability and contract law in separate spheres and to maintain a realistic limitation on damages.id.at.
a decade later,the court revisited this corner of tort law in saratoga fishing martinac.martinac built a fishing vessel in which it installed a hydraulic system designed by marco seattle.joseph madruga purchased the vessel and added equipment a skiff,fishing net and spare parts.madruga then sold the vessel,which contained the additional equipment,to saratoga fishing company.the vessel later caught fire and sank as a result of a defective hydraulic system,after which saratoga fishing filed a tort suit against martinac and marco seattle.
there was no dispute that the product itself consisted at least of a ship as built and outfitted by its original manufacturer and sold to an initial user.id.at.the question was whether saratoga fishing,the subsequent user,could recover in tort for the physical destruction of extra equipment added by the initial user after the first sale and then resold as part of the ship when the ship itself is later resold to a subsequent user.id.the court held that the equipment added by madruga was other property and,as such,saratoga fishing was eligible to recover
