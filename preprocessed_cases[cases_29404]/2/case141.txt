debra ward,a resident of new york,appeals from the march,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york denis hurley,district judge granting summary judgment to cross sound ferry csf,a connecticut company,and dismissing ward complaint as.
on june,ward fell and injured herself on a gangway while boarding a csf ferry in new london,bound for orient point,although ward counsel sent a claim letter to csf within a month of the injuries,no suit was filed until november,some years after the accident.
after removing the case from state court to federal court on the basis of diversity and admiralty jurisdiction,csf moved in the district court for summary judgment on the ground that the suit was.although a statutory limitations period of three years would otherwise apply to the case,see,csf sought to enforce a contractual time limitation appearing on the back of the passage ticket that required suits to be filed within one year of an injury.a ticket identical to the one received by plaintiff was submitted with csf motion.the front of that ticket,which measures about two inches by inches,reads as follows 
cross sound ferry 
ticket good on date of issue only 
contract subject to terms on reverse side 
cross sound ferry at the top appears to be in bold times new roman type and ticket good on date of issue only contract subject to terms on reverse side on the bottom appears to be in bold times new roman type.the writing on the reverse side of the ticket appears to be in arial type and reads as follows 
terms of passage contract between the ferry,its owners and their employees and concessionaires the carrier and passenger by accepting this contract passenger agrees to its terms.contract not transferable and valid and refundable only on day issued.carrier liability for loss or damage to vehicles or personalty is limited to.carrier is not liable for loss of or damage to vehicles or personalty,or for personal injuries,illnesses or death,unless written notice is given to owners within six months of the date of the occurrence,and suits on all such claims shall not be maintainable unless commenced within year after the occurrence.all disputes in any way connected with this contract must be litigated in a state court of new london county,or in the district court of connecticut,ticketed vehicles must remain in staging area until boarding.ferry passage may be denied at the discretion of the carrier.
it is undisputed that plaintiff husband obtained both her ticket and his just two to three minutes before boarding the ferry.plaintiff,after falling on the gangway,was carried on board by her husband,who simultaneously handed the tickets for both husband and wife to the ticket collector.csf does not dispute that it typically issues tickets just prior to boarding and collects them upon boarding,and that plaintiff possession of the tickets for a total of only two to three minutes is not unusual.
following oral argument on the motion,the district court issued its decision from the bench.relying on various cases,the district court reasoned that plaintiff had ample time to read the ticket terms before handing it to the ticket collector while boarding,and that she had ample opportunity to obtain a duplicate ticket after the injury if she had not read the ticket or could not remember its contractual terms.concluding that ward attorney presumably dropped the ball in failing to get a duplicate copy of the ticket,the district court upheld the contractual limitation,granted summary judgment for csf,and dismissed plaintiff complaint.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,including the issue of whether a passage ticket reasonably communicated contractual limitations imposed by the sea carrier,which is a question of law for the court.see effron sun line cruises,cir.jurisdiction in the district court was properly based on admiralty.see kenward v.the admiral peoples.holding that admiralty jurisdiction applied to injury that occurred on gangplank leading to ship.
the issue of whether time limitations appearing on a passenger ticket are enforceable is one that arises with surprising regularity,although the particular facts of this,possession of the ticket for only a few seemingly unique.title.a permits a sea carrier to contractually limit the time period in which a suit for injuries may be filed by passengers,provided that time period is at least one year.see.a.the only restriction to enforcement of such limitations is that the carrier reasonably communicate the existence and importance of the limitation to the passenger.see spataro kloster cruise,cir per curiam.the reasonably communicate standard devolved from judge friendly seminal opinion in silvestri italia societa per azioni di navigazione,cir,in which he found,based on his review of the case law,that a contractual limitation would not be enforceable unless the carrier satisfied its burden of showing that it had done all it reasonably could to warn the passenger that the terms and conditions were important matters of contract affecting his legal rights.most circuits,including ours,have since construed silvestri as requiring that sea carriers reasonably communicate any limitations period to their passengers.spataro,at.
in applying this standard,several circuits have adopted a test whether the physical characteristics of the ticket itself reasonably communicate d to the passenger the existence therein of important terms and conditions that affected the passenger legal rights,and whether the circumstances surrounding the passenger purchase and subsequent retention of the permitted the passenger to become meaningfully informed of the contractual terms at stake.shankles costa armatori,cir see also dillon admiral cruises,cir.as the court in shankles noted,given the likelihood that a passenger will not read the fine print upon purchase or during a pleasure cruise,the surrounding circumstances examined in the second part of the test may be of equal importance as the prominence of warnings and clarity of conditions examined in the first part in deciding whether a provision should be held to bind a particular passenger,since the same passenger might very well be expected to consult the multifarious terms and conditions of the in the event of an accident resulting in a loss or injury.at.
the second circuit has never discussed,much less adopted,the test,perhaps because the second part has never been at issue.see,effron,at noting that plaintiff purchased ticket one month before cruise spataro,at omitting discussion of when plaintiff received ticket or whether plaintiff retained possession,but language of ticket indicated that plaintiff received tickets in advance of arrival for the cruise.in the instant case,however,plaintiff conceded that there was no dispute with respect to the first part of the test because the physical characteristics of the passenger ticket reasonably communicated the existence and importance of the contractual terms of passage.thus,plaintiff success depends entirely on whether we adopt the second part of the test and apply it in her favor.
several district courts in this circuit have employed the test,reasoning that it is used widely among other circuits and is not inconsistent with our circuit approach.see,ames celebrity cruises,dkt.civ.lap,wl,at july,applying test and noting its widespread use boyles cunard line,dkt.civ.ces,wl,at,applying test on reasoning that,although not explicitly adopted by second circuit,test is not inconsistent with this circuit decisions lieb royal caribbean cruise line.the district court below also applied the test,finding that it could be harmonized with the test applied by the second circuit.we believe the test to be useful in analyzing the reasonably communicated standard and to be a satisfactory refinement of judge friendly holding in silvestri,and therefore,take this opportunity to expressly adopt it.
applying the test second part to the facts of this case,we must decide whether a carrier gives reasonable notice of contractual limitations when it issues a ticket bearing the terms of the limitati
