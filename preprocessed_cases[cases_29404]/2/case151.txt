opinion of the court 
although maher terminals,llc maher challenges the rent it must pay under its lease agreement the lease with the port authority of new york and new jersey the port authority,this case is not a typical dispute.maher,a landside marine terminal operator,asserts that the rent due under the lease violates the constitution tonnage clause,const.art.i,cl,as well as two related federal statutes,all of which historically have concerned taxes and fees imposed on vessels,their owners,and their passengers and crews.the district court dismissed maher complaint in its entirety,reasoning that maher rent obligations did not violate the tonnage clause or its related statutes,and that maher failed to establish admiralty jurisdiction for its remaining tort claim.we agree and hold that landside service providers like maher are not within the class of plaintiffs that the tonnage clause or its related federal statutes were intended to protect,that is,they are outside each law zone of interests.accordingly,we will affirm.
maher is a marine terminal operator with its principal place of business in elizabeth,new jersey.maher primary business is to load and unload cargo on vessels also known as stevedoring and to berth vessels at its terminal.the port authority is an entity created by a compact between new york and new jersey with the consent of congress.the port authority oversees various transportation systems and,of most relevance to this appeal,the port of new york and new jersey,the third largest seaport in north america and the largest maritime cargo center on the eastern seaboard 
the port authority leases many of its marine terminal facilities at the port of new york and new jersey to private companies like maher,which in turn directly manage the terminals and provide stevedoring services to ships using those terminals.in october,maher signed a lease with the port authority to rent the largest marine terminal at port elizabeth,consisting of acres of improved land including structures and a berthing area.
the lease divides maher rent into two categories.first,the basic rental charges maher a fixed rate per acre of the terminal.when the complaint was filed in,the basic rental was per acre,totaling for the year.the second form of rent and this is the crux of the case is the container throughput rental throughput rental,which is a variable charge based on the type and volume of cargo that is loaded and unloaded at maher terminal.for the first eight years of the lease term,maher was exempted from paying any throughput rental.since,the throughput rental has been calculated based on the following formula the first containers loaded and unloaded by maher are exempted from any fees for containers to,maher pays a fee set forth by a schedule in the lease per container when the complaint was filed and for each container over,maher pays a lower fee per container when the complaint was filed.
in addition,maher must load and unload a minimum amount of cargo annually as a condition of maintaining the lease containers when the complaint was filed,which is subject to increase to containers upon completion of certain harbor improvements,and maher must pay an annual guaranteed minimum throughput rental equivalent to loading and unloading containers subject to the exemption for the first containers,regardless of the number of containers maher actually handles.all told,maher paid roughly million in throughput rental in,and it expected the throughput rental to increase to million.
according to maher,the port authority profits from the lease.the port authority also allegedly uses revenue from the lease to fund projects as well as projects wholly unrelated to the services that the port authority provides to maher or vessels using the port.
in september nearly twelve years after the lease effective date maher sued the port authority in the district court for the district of new jersey.maher complaint alleged violations of the constitution tonnage clause,const.art.i,cl.the rivers and harbors appropriation act rha,b and the water resources development act wrda.maher also asserted a negligence claim against the port authority for the way it established and collected fees.
the port authority moved to dismiss the complaint under rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and in july,the district court granted the motion.the district court reasoned that maher lacked standing to bring its tonnage clause and rha claims because it was not a protected vessel.even if maher had standing,the tonnage clause and rha claims still failed,the district court held,because maher did not adequately plead that any fees imposed on vessels were not for services rendered.the district court also dismissed maher wrda claim because maher had not shown that the port authority imposed fees on vessels or cargo and because the wrda did not prohibit the port authority from using revenue from the lease to finance projects.finally,the district court decided that it lacked admiralty jurisdiction over maher negligence claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claim.maher filed this timely appeal 
the district court exercised jurisdiction only under,concluding that it lacked admiralty jurisdiction over maher negligence claim under and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim under.we have jurisdiction under.

with respect to maher negligence claim,we review the district court determination of its own admiralty jurisdiction de novo,sinclair soniform,cir,but we review the court refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims for abuse of discretion,figueroa buccaneer hotel,cir.
the central question on appeal is whether fees imposed on landside entities like maher can support claims under the tonnage clause,the rha,and the wrda.a secondary question is whether the district court correctly decided that it lacked admiralty jurisdiction,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over maher negligence claim.we address these issues in turn.
the constitution prohibits states from lay ing any duty of tonnage without the consent of congress.const.art.i,cl.maher alleges that several fees imposed by the lease,but principally the throughput rental,violate the tonnage clause maher contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that maher lacked standing to bring a tonnage clause claim and that maher did not adequately plead a violation of the tonnage clause.
standing involves constitutional limitations on jurisdiction on the one hand and prudential limitations on the other.warth seldin,d.here the district court concluded that maher tonnage clause claim failed for lack of standing,but the court did not explain whether its holding was based on constitutional or prudential limitations.we read the district court opinion as relying on prudential limitations,not constitutional ones the district court made no reference to the requirements of constitutional standing,instead explaining that maher lacked standing because it was not a vessel or other protected entity under the tonnage clause.maher terminals,llc port auth.of,civ.km,wl,at july.in other words,the district court concluded that maher fell outside the class of plaintiffs who are protected by the tonnage clause.in so doing,the district court effectively conducted a analysis.see lexmark int l,static control components,d framing the test as asking whether a particular plaintiff falls within the class of plaintiffs authorized to sue under a particular law.
we have previously categorized the requirement as one of three components of prudential standing,freeman corzine,cir but in lexmark international,static control components,the supreme court criticized the placement of the requirement within the rubric of prudential standing.at p rudential standing is a misnomer as applied to the analysis.internal quotation marks omitted see also shalom pentecostal church,at.the court clarified that the requirement goes to whether a particular plaintiff has a cause of action under a given law,not a plaintiff standing.lexmark.at.though lexmark was decided only a few months before the district court decision in this case,we agree with maher that lexmark strongly suggests that courts should link the test to the doctrine of standing and that the district court erred by apparently doing so here.but putting aside the label that applies to the test,we agree with the district court that maher still must satisfy this test to state a tonnage clause claim and,as explained below,that maher fails the test.
in applying the test,we must discern the meaning and purpose of the tonnage clause using traditional methods of interpretation and ask whether it extends to maher claim.id.at analyzing the meaning and purposes of the lanham act to determine the interests protected by the act.we have applied the test liberal ly and have noted that it is not meant to be especially demanding.oxford assocs.waste.auth.of montgomery,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the test is particularly generous in the context of challenges to agency actions under the administrative procedure act,but it may be less so in other contexts.lexmark.at.
turning to the tonnage clause meaning,we are guided by the principle that the constitution was written to be understood by the voters its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning.district of columbia heller,d internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.although the constitution appears to speak broadly by prohibiting states from lay ing any duty of tonnage,the term duty of tonnage had a meaning to the founding generation.it referred to the common commercial practice of taxing a ship according to the internal cubic capacity of a vessel,its tons of carrying capacity.polar tankers,city of valdez,d quoting clyde mallory lines alabama ex rel.state docks comm n.further,tonnage duties referred to taxes on the privilege of access by vessels to the ports of a state and were distinct from fees for services facilitating commerce.clyde mallory lines,at.
to the framers,the tonnage clause supported and shared a purpose with the import export clause,const.art.i,cl,which generally prohibits states from taxing imports and exports.see clyde mallory lines,at.the purpose of the import export clause,in turn,was to prevent states with convenient ports from taxing goods travelling in commerce at the expense of consumers in located states.see polar tankers,at.the framers understood that the import export clause could be effectively nullified i f the states had been left free to tax the privilege of access by vessels to their harbors.clyde mallory lines,at accord portwardens,wall.although there was some disagreement about whether the commerce clause already prohibited tonnage duties,clyde mallory lines,at,the tonnage clause was adopted to prevent that nullification and to further restrain states from obtaining geographical tax advantages,polar tankers,at.
to effectuate these purposes,the supreme court has interpreted the tonnage clause to prohibit more than only classic tonnage duties,taxes on a ship based on the ship capacity the court has also said that a state can not do that indirectly which she is forbidden to do directly.id.at alteration in original quoting passenger cases,how.thus,the tonnage clause prohibits taxes that vary according to ratios other than a ship capacity,such as the number of masts,mariners,or passengers.id.it likewise prohibits taxes that are imposed not just on the vessel itself but also on the ship captain,owner,supercargo the person in charge of the cargo on the ship,and passengers.passenger cases,how.at.the clause even prohibits flat taxes on a ship those that do not vary according to tonnage if they are for the privilege of entering a port.portwardens,wall.at.in sum,the tonnage clause prohibition embrace s all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form,and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel,which operate to impose a charge for the privilege of entering,trading in,or lying in a port.clyde mallory lines,at.
consistent with the original understanding of tonnage duties,the tonnage clause does not prohibit states from charging vessels for services rendered to and enjoyed by the vessel,such as pilotage,or wharfage,or charges for the use of locks on a navigable river,or fees for medical inspection.id.at citations omitted.charges for such services,even those that vary according to tonnage,are constitutional for at least two reasons.first,they are not taxes which are assertions of sovereignty but are instead demands for reasonable compensation which are assertions of a right of property.packet keokuk.second,charges for services are constitutional because they facilitate,rather than impede,commerce.see clyde mallory lines,at keokuk,at a charge for services rendered is not a hindrance or impediment to free navigation.
of course,a state may not escape the tonnage clause reach merely by labelling a tax as a charge for services.keokuk,at cannon city of new orleans,wall.a tax which is due from all vessels arriving and stopping in a port,without regard to the place where they may stop,can not be treated as a compensation for the use of a wharf.vessels that pay a purported services charge must actually receive a proportionate benefit in return.see state tonnage tax cases,wall.striking down a tax because it was an act to raise revenue without any corresponding or equivalent benefit or advantage to the vessels taxed.so it is constitutional for a state to demand just and reasonable compensation for services rendered,cannon,wall.at,but the inverse must also be true a state may not demand unjust and unreasonable compensation for services,even if services are actually rendered.additionally,a reasonable charge for general services that benefit all ships that enter a port,such as policing services for a harbor,is constitutional,see clyde mallory lines,at,but a tax that has a general,purpose is probably not,see polar tankers,at.
from this discussion,we conclude that the tonnage clause was meant to protect vessels as vehicles of commerce.see keokuk,at the tonnage clause was designed to guard against local hindrances to trade and carriage by vessels emphasis added.tonnage duties were originally understood as taxes on vessels,and the modern formulation from clyde mallory lines and polar tankers extending the clause to all charge s for the privilege of entering,trading in,or lying in a port does nothing to change the fundamental object of the provision.the body of law surrounding the services exception to the tonnage clause drives home the point.fees for services are allowed because they do not impede a vessel free navigation in commerce and are only levied when a passing vessel elects to use those services,see keokuk,at,a concern that is plainly inapplicable to plaintiffs.therefore,to come within the tonnage clause zone of interests,we hold that a plaintiff must allege an injury to a vessel as a vehicle of commerce.
our conclusion does not conflict with the supreme court admonition that the tonnage clause prohibits indirect tonnage duties and,consequently,extends to taxes imposed not only on a vessel,but also on an owner,ship captain,supercargo,or the passengers to the contrary,the two are very much consistent.though these people are obviously not ships,the tonnage clause prohibits taxes imposed on them because they are representatives of ships.see passenger cases,how.at it is a duty on the vessel it is a taxation of the master,as representative of the vessel and her cargo.and unlike the landside provider of harbor services,these people travel with the ships moving as vehicles in commerce.as discussed above,the tonnage clause protects the rights of vessels to navigate free of local hindrances by prohibiting charges that the vessels do not choose to incur.just as a tax on a vessel impedes the vessel ability to freely move in commerce,taxes on the people on board the vessel have the same effect.taxes on certain people the owner,captain,supercargo,and crew directly impact where a vessel decides to make port by taxing those responsible for the vessel navigation,and taxes on passengers will likely indirectly impact a vessel decisions by reducing demand for passage on the vessel.the interests of these people are the same as the interests of the vessels they occupy,so the tonnage clause prohibits taxes on them just as it prohibits taxes on the vessels themselves.
as a landside marine terminal operator challenging the rent it owes under the lease,maher is not a member of the class of plaintiffs that can state a claim under the tonnage clause.maher injury is not an injury to a vessel or its representative.unlike a fee imposed on a vessel or the people on board,a fee imposed on maher does not in and of itself impact a vessel ability to freely navigate in commerce.fees imposed on maher affect vessels only if maher passes on such fees to vessels that use its terminal for stevedoring services.that it is not enough for maher to satisfy the test.a party may not contract its way into a law zone of interests if that party does not itself have any protected interests under the law.freeman,at p laintiffs who allege only that a party with whom they contract is subject to an undue burden on its ability to freely participate in interstate commerce are not within the zone of interests protected by the dormant commerce clause.internal quotation marks omitted.to hold otherwise would allow parties to evade the first prudential standing requirement that parties must assert their own legal interests,not the interests of third parties.see id.at.therefore,the tonnage clause is not concerned with taxes on any entity that has some relationship with vessels rather,it prohibits taxes that are directed at vessels or their representatives.vessels may be able to challenge maher rent but maher can not assert the rights of vessels 
we are unpersuaded by maher argument that it satisfies the test because it is engaged in interstate commerce and seek s to vindicate interests related to the protection of interstate commerce.maher br.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.for support,maher relies on cases applying the test in the context of the dormant commerce clause.see freeman,at oxford,at.though the tonnage clause supports the commerce clause as well as the import export clause,the tonnage clause is not the commerce clause.the tonnage clause protects the free flow of commerce through a specific means by protecting vessels operating as vehicles of commerce.
nor is maher within the tonnage clause zone of interests because it pays fees that vary according to the volume of cargo moving through its port.in polar tankers,the supreme court said that the tax at issue there was at the heart of what the tonnage clause forbids.at.it did so in part because the tax depend ed on a factor related to tonnage,a ship cargo capacity,in that it applied to vessels only of a certain size.id.but other cases teach us that whether a fee varies according to tonnage is not actually the touchstone of unconstitutional tonnage duties.see clyde mallory lines,u.at holding that the tonnage clause prohibits all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form,and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel,which operate to impose a charge for the privilege of entering,trading in,or lying in a port emphasis added portwardens,wall.at holding that the tonnage clause prohibits fixed fees as well as fees that vary with vessels capacity emphasis added.we therefore do not read polar tankers or any of the tonnage clause precedent as standing for the proposition that any fee on anyone or anything that varies according to cargo volume is an unconstitutional tonnage duty,as maher does.what actually made the tax in polar tankers unconstitutional,and what maher can not show here,is that the tax was directed at vessels and was not in exchange for services.see at noting that the tax applie d only to large ships and was not for services provided to the vessel s.the same is true of bridgeport port jefferson steamboat bridgeport port authority,where the second circuit struck down a fee imposed on all passengers of a ferry under the tonnage clause,cir.although the tax in bridgeport varied depending on whether the passenger was a person or vehicle,the tax was unconstitutional,in our view,because it was directed at a vessel passengers.
if we unmoor the tonnage clause from taxes on vessels and allow landside entities to bring tonnage clause claims,we would transform the tonnage clause into a broad maritime commerce clause.landside entities having some relationship to maritime commerce would be able to challenge not only volumetric charges like the one here,but any unreasonable fees for the privilege of being in a port.see portwardens,wall.at it was not only a pro rata tax which was prohibited,but any duty.so,for example,a restaurant renting state property in a port that serves food to mariners fresh off a vessel could state a claim under the tonnage clause by claiming that its rent is unreasonably high given the services provided by the state.we doubt the framers intended the tonnage clause to sweep so broadly as to transform these and other disputes into constitutional questions,especially given the conspicuous absence of vessels and cargo owners from this case complaining about the fees they are paying at the port of new york and new jersey although the tonnage clause should be interpreted in light of its general purposes of preventing nullification of the import export clause and stopping states from obtaining geographic advantages by taxing vessels,these purposes do not give us license to transform the tonnage clause into something it is not and was never intended to be.
in sum,while we hold that the district court should not have couched its conclusion in terms of standing after lexmark,we agree with the district court essential holding maher,as a landside entity,is outside the tonnage clause zone of interests.this is not,as maher contends,to elevate form over substance.anchoring the tonnage clause to taxes on vessels and their representatives is the only way to preserve the clause meaning.accordingly,maher failed to state a tonnage clause claim.
maher next challenges the district court dismissal of its rha claim.under the rha,taxes and fees from interests like the port authority can not be levied upon or collected from any vessel or other water craft,or from its passengers or crew,except for,inter alia,reasonable fees charged on a fair and equitable basis that a are used solely to pay the cost of a service to the vessel or water craft b enhance the safety and efficiency of interstate and foreign commerce and c do not impose more than a small burden on interstate or foreign commerce.b.
by its terms,the rha only applies to taxes and fees imposed on or collected from vessels,their passengers,or their crews.as a landside terminal,maher is none of these and therefore can not state a claim under the rha.maher itself recognizes that the rha codifies the body of law surrounding the tonnage clause.accordingly,we hold that maher rha claim fails for the same reasons as its tonnage clause claim,and for the additional reason that the plain language of the rha is explicitly limited to categories of entities that do not include maher.
we also reject maher argument that the district court incorrectly dismissed its wrda claim.the wrda grants the consent of congress to certain tonnage duties and cargo fees to finance projects provided that such fees are imposed in accordance with the wrda requirements.a.among other things,the wrda permits the collection of fees only after the project has been completed.id.a.before fees may be imposed under the wrda,there must be notice and a public hearing on the proposed fees,id.a,and the interest must publicly file a schedule of harbor fees with the federal maritime commission,id.a a.the wrda allows a ny person who is aggrieved by a proposed scheme or schedule of port or harbor dues under this section to seek judicial review of that proposed scheme or schedule,provided that the action is brought within days of the hearing required by a.id.b.
maher wrda claim fails for two reasons.first,the wrda expressly applies only to fees imposed on vessels and on cargo.here maher is challenging neither.granted,the lease calculates maher rent based in part on the amount of cargo moving through maher terminal,but maher rent is not a fee on the cargo itself.nor is it a tonnage duty,as explained above.
second,we agree with the port authority that maher has no wrda claim because the port authority never even purported to impose rent on maher pursuant to the wrda.the wrda provides a limited private right of action to persons aggrieved by a proposed scheme or schedule of port or harbor dues under this section and only allows for judicial review of that proposed scheme or schedule.id.b emphasis added.additionally,the day time limit for bringing a wrda claim is tied to the date of the public hearing required by the wrda.id.because there is no wrda schedule of fees for us to review,maher has no wrda claim.
maher argues that such a reading of the wrda is preposterous,maher reply br,but we disagree.nothing in the wrda prohibits interests from raising revenue in ways other than tonnage duties and cargo fees to finance projects,as the port authority is allegedly doing in this case.moreover,the wrda merely provides congressional consent to tonnage duties and cargo fees that meet the wrda other requirements.in other words,it is a safe harbor for what would otherwise be unconstitutional duties.if a interest imposes tonnage duties or cargo fees that do not comport with the wrda requirements,those duties and fees would not have the consent of congress,and the remedy would be a direct challenge under the tonnage clause or the import export clause.
therefore,we hold that maher can not state a claim under the wrda.
finally,we address maher negligence claim.the district court concluded that it lacked federal admiralty jurisdiction over the claimyea,under and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claim under.
a proponent of admiralty jurisdiction for a tort claim must satisfy conditions both of location and of connection with maritime activity.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.to satisfy the location test,the tort must have occurred on navigable water or an injury suffered on land must have been caused by a vessel on navigable water.id.t he tort occurs where the alleged negligence took effect.exec.jet aviation,city of cleveland,d internal quotation marks omitted.
maher claim of negligence is that the port authority negligently establish ed and collect ed charges and fees for the use of maher terminal upon such bases and in such amounts as are unlawful.put simply,any negligence by the port authority occurred on land.maher and the port authority are entities.the lease was negotiated on land,and payments were made on land.accordingly,maher can not satisfy the location test for admiralty jurisdiction,so its claim arises not under federal law but state law.
and because the district court correctly dismissed all of maher federal claims over which it possessed original jurisdiction,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over maher negligence claim.see hedges musco,cir discussing c.
for the reasons set forth above,we will affirm the order of the district court 
although i concur in my colleagues resolution of maher statutory and tort claims,i respectfully dissent from their conclusion that maher has not stated a constitutional claim.the majority opinion runs contrary to a long line of supreme court precedent interpreting the tonnage clause.most recently,in polar tankers,city of valdez,alaska,d,the court reaffirmed its broad reading of that clause as prohibiting state and local governments from doing indirectly what they may not do directly,namely,lay a tax on shipping.id.at.the tonnage clause forbids any attempt regardless of its name or form,id.to raise revenue by charging duties on maritime commerce.that,however,is precisely what maher alleges is the effect of the container throughput rental assessments it must pay under the terms of its lease with the port authority.the assessments are a tax on the stevedores working with the vessels and will be passed on to the vessels,according to maher.while those allegations may ultimately prove unfounded,i believe that maher has pled sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss.i would therefore vacate the district court dismissal of the tonnage clause claim as to the container throughput rental assessments.
the constitution declares that no state shall,without the consent of congress,lay any duty of tonnage,art.i,cl.my colleagues correctly note that the word tonnage literally refers to the entire internal cubical capacity,or contents of the ship or vessel expressed in tons of one hundred cubical feet in re state tonnage tax cases,wall.the term was used by the framers because at that day and time it was the customary mode of measuring the value of a ship.erik jensen,quirky constitutional provisions matter the tonnage clause,polar tankers,and state taxation of commerce,geo.mason,quoting samuel freeman miller,lectures on the constitution of the united states photo reprint new york albany,banks.but the tonnage clause has long since been extended to address taxation beyond the narrow reach inherent in that definition.it had to be,because,taken in this restricted sense,the constitutional provision would not fully accomplish its intent.so.steamship of new orleans portwardens,wall.it was designed to support the constitution import export clause,which,as its name suggests,bars states from placing duties on imports or exports in re state tonnage tax cases,at tonnage duties are as much taxes as duties on imports or exports,and the prohibition of the constitution extends as fully to such duties if levied by the states as to duties on imports or exports,and for reasons quite as strong as those which induced the framers of the constitution to withdraw imports and exports from state taxation.by its very nature,the tonnage clause also serves the fundamental purpose of the commerce clause ensuring federal control over matters of interstate and foreign commerce.see of revenue of state of ass of.stevedoring,d.in fact,james madison was of the opinion that the commerce clause independently restrained the states from imposing duties of tonnage.plaquemines port,harbor terminal dist.fed.comm n.nonetheless,the tonnage clause was added to the constitution and so provided,along with the import export clause,a set of bars to complement the commerce clause barricade against state meddling in matters of national and foreign commerce these three clauses in combination the commerce clause,the import export clause,and the tonnage clause are meant to enhance the federal government power to speak with one voice on matters of trade,to protect federal import revenues from state diversion,and to avoid discord among the states.see michelin tire wages,d.
the purposes meant to be accomplished by constitutional provisions,however,may not come easily or naturally.is a powerful countervailing force.in the context of maritime commerce,that has manifested itself in repeated efforts by state and local authorities to circumvent the tonnage clause,often by merely calling a tax something else or moving the aim of it from a ship to a related target.the supreme court has been vigilant in recognizing and rejecting such creativity.a state can not take what would otherwise amount to a tax on the ship ca
