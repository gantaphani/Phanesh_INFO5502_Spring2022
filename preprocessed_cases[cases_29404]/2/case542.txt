this appeal follows our remand to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to state a cause of action for hostage taking under the terrorism amendment to the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,a.simpson socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,simpson i.libya contends that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and makes both legal and evidentiary challenges to the amended complaint.we hold that because the fsia definition of hostage taking,e,focuses on the state of mind of the hostage taker,a plaintiff need not show that the hostage taker communicated a demand reflecting the hostage taker intended purpose to a third party.we assume here that a plaintiff asserting an exception to sovereign immunity under fsia has a burden of production to support its allegations of hostage taking,and further hold that the plaintiffs met their burden and,conversely,that libya has failed to meet its burden of persuasion.libya offers no evidence of its own and points to nothing in the plaintiffs evidence that is inconsistent with the allegations in the amended complaint about libya possible intended purposes for the detention.accordingly,we affirm the order denying libya motion to dismiss the amended complaint on sovereign immunity grounds.
in february,sandra jean simpson,a united states citizen,and her husband,mostafa karim,a permanent resident of the united states who was born in egypt,were aboard the carin ii,a private yacht,cruising in the mediterranean sea on a course from italy to greece,when an unexpected storm forced the boat to veer off course and send a radio distress signal.libyan harbor authorities responded to the signal on february,offering the port of benghazi as a safe harbor.according to the amended complaint,on february,while the boat was in port,libyan authorities boarded the boat and removed the passengers and crew.the libyans held the carin ii party captive and threatened to shoot them if they attempted to leave.three months into the captivity,libyan authorities forcibly separated simpson and karim,permitting simpson to fly to zurich and placing her husband in solitary confinement,in unsanitary conditions without adequate medical care or proper food,for a period of seven months.karim was released from captivity in november,after intense negotiations among belgium,egypt,and libya he died of cancer in.
simpson and her husband estate sued libya,alleging torture,battery,false imprisonment,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and loss of consortium,and seeking compensatory damages.libya moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,on the ground that simpson offer to arbitrate did not satisfy fsia jurisdictional requirements lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim for torture and hostage taking.the district court denied the motion.see simpson socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,d.on appeal,this court held that simpson offer to arbitrate satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of fsia,see a b i,but reversed as to the torture claim for insufficient allegations of severity,citing price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,price i,and vacated and remanded on the claim so that the plaintiffs could amend the complaint to allege facts supporting the proposition that libya intended to compel action or inaction by a third party as a condition of releasing simpson and karim.simpson i,at.
in response,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which alleged three likely motives libya might have had for abducting simpson and karim.the amended complaint stated that,in exchange for releasing them,libya may have wanted the united states to stop conducting air raids against libya revenge for previous air attacks and egypt to return military assets to libya.it also referenced libya pattern of terrorist activity.the amended complaint cited newspaper articles,libya history of taking and releasing hostages,and a department of defense intelligence report.
upon libya renewed motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,personal jurisdiction,and for failure to state a claim,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b,b and b,the district court ordered the plaintiffs to provide support for their jurisdictional claim.the plaintiffs submitted additional materials,including an expert opinion and the state department patterns of global terrorism,to show that prior and similar acts demonstrated that libya intended to hold simpson and karim to trade them for libyan defectors and military equipment held in egypt,as human shields against another united states air attack on libya.libya submitted no materials of its own in response,and the district court denied the motion to dismiss.the district court found that the plaintiffs had produced sufficient evidence of a quid pro quo to support two theories,regarding use of simpson and karim as human shields and use of karim to obtain the return of libyan defectors and material lost to egypt,but not as regards libya alleged pursuit of retributive justice as that entailed no form of exchange with a third party.simpson socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,d.

the exception applies only if three additional criteria are also satisfied the foreign state was designated a state sponsor of terrorism at the time the act occurred the foreign state was given a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate a claim regarding an act that occurred within the state borders and the claimant or victim was a national of the united states.a a,b.these three criteria are satisfied here,and thus the only question is whether the plaintiffs claims fall within the main body of the exception.kilburn,at.libya bears the burden of proving that the plaintiffs allegations do not bring its case within a statutory exception to immunity.phoenix consulting,republic of angola.
the legal question raised by libya is whether awareness of a intent is a required element of the exception that must be pled as a jurisdictional fact and supported by evidence.libya contends that the plaintiffs can show intended purpose only where there is a minimum showing that the third party is at least aware of the possibility that there is a hostage.appellant br.at.libya contention,however,is wholly unsupported by our case law and the statutory definition of.
