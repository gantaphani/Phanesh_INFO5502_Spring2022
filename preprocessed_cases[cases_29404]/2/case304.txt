edilson pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of the maritime drug law enforcement act.see app.the district court sentenced bustos to months in prison,followed by a term of supervised release.on appeal,bustos argues that the district court did not have jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea,that the court should have suppressed his statement to united states coast guard officials,and that the court erroneously enhanced his offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon.
in may of,the china breeze,a panamanian freighter bound for portugal,sailed through the international waters south of the passage between hispanola and puerto rico.the united states government suspected the vessel use in drug trafficking based on information from federal authorities in greece.on may,the panamanian government issued a statement of no objection to allow the united states coast guard to board the freighter and search for contraband.the coast guard boarded the vessel and found four tons of cocaine in a disabled sewage tank.the following day,panama gave express permission for the enforcement of united states laws on the vessel.the coast guard then ordered the china breeze to galveston,texas.during the voyage to galveston,coast guard officials questioned the crew members about the hidden cocaine.
agent mihalopoulos of the drug enforcement administration interviewed bustos on may.three other uniformed officers and a translator were present during the interview.after agent mihalopoulos recited the miranda warnings,bustos asked the officers whether his right to counsel entailed postponing the interview until a lawyer arrived.one of the officers stated that bustos was correct.bustos claimed that an officer told him that it would be in his best interest to cooperate because he was facing a potential prison sentence.bustos began crying and agreed to give a statement.
when asked about his identification,bustos claimed that the documents identifying him as pacifico duarte,a panamainian citizen born on december,were falsified.bustos stated he was edilson from colombia,born on june.he explained that he traveled from colombia to panama in to obtain the false identification so that he could work as a seaman on a panamanian vessel.bustos admitted to being on three voyages where drugs were transported.bustos claimed he was responsible for accounting for the cocaine on the china breeze.he also admitted that he possessed a caliber revolver,which he threw overboard when he heard the coast guard helicopters.
following his arraignment,bustos filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to the coast guard and dea officials.bustos also objected to the court jurisdiction claiming that his true date of birth was february,and therefore he was a juvenile at the time of the offense and indictment.bustos also filed a motion to incorporate and adopt the motions of his,who argued that the court lacked jurisdiction under app.c because coast guard officials did not have consent from the panamanian government to enforce united states laws at the time the officials seized the cocaine.the district court rejected bustos arguments and set the case for trial.on november,bustos volunteered an unconditional guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance under app.a and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance pursuant to j.prior to sentencing,bustos objected to the enhancement recommendation in the presentence report,arguing that his possession of a firearm was unrelated to the charged offenses.the district court adopted the conclusions in the presentence report and sentenced bustos to a term of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.
ii.maritime drug law enforcement act 
bustos claims that the district court did not have jurisdiction to accept his plea because the china breeze was not subject to united states jurisdiction at the time the officers seized the hidden cocaine.before reaching the merits of bustos argument,we assess whether his guilty plea prevents him from raising the issue on appeal.
effect of bustos guilty plea 
a guilty plea forecloses appellate review of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence.see united states broce,d.by entering a plea of guilty,the accused is not simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment he is admitting guilt of a substantive crime.id.at.a defendant who pleads guilty may challenge the very power of the state to bring the defendant into court to answer the charge against him.blackledge perry,d.defendants may therefore raise jurisdictional defects on appeal.see united states,cir explaining that errors on the face of an indictment constitute jurisdictional defects,which are not waived by a guilty plea united states owens,cir by pleading guilty to an offense,therefore,a criminal defendant waives all defects preceding the plea.united states ruelas,cir stating that a guilty plea does not confer jurisdiction on a district court to receive the plea.the validity of a guilty plea is a question of law we review de novo.see united states hernandez,cir 
a defendant violates the provisions of the maritime drug law enforcement act if he possesses with intent to distribute a controlled substance while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.see app.a.a marine vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation is subject to the jurisdiction of the united states if the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of united states law app.c c.bustos argues that if the united states did not have jurisdiction over the vessel,then the district court did not have jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea.
bustos argument hinges on whether the jurisdictional requirements of section are merely substantive elements of the crime or prerequisites to the district court subject matter jurisdiction.certain elements of an offense may be jurisdictional in nature,yet not a condition to subject matter jurisdiction.see,united states johnson,cir holding that the interstate commerce requirement is merely an element of the offense and not essential to subject matter jurisdiction,vacated on other grounds,united states johnson,d united states rea,cir same united states robinson,cir noting that the interstate commerce element in the hobbs act is not purely jurisdictional.based on the former language of section,courts construed the phrase a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states as a factual element of the offense.see united states cardales,cir,cert.denied,d united states,cir united states medina,cir.united states pretel,cir stating that whether an exiled panamanian leader had authority to consent was a political question that was not appropriate for submission to a jury.
congress added subsection f to the statute in.subsection f states that j urisdiction of the united states with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense.all jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined by the trial judge.app.f.based on this addition to the statute,we conclude that the district court preliminary determination of whether a flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of united states law is a prerequisite to the court jurisdiction under bustos is therefore not foreclosed from raising the issue on appeal.
jurisdiction under the maritime drug law enforcement act 
bustos argues that the district court did not have jurisdiction under the statute because the united states lacked jurisdiction over the vessel at the time coast guard officials seized the cocaine.bustos claims that the coast guard received permission to enforce united states law the day after the drugs were discovered he argues that he can not be prosecuted for violating section if the statute did not apply to him during the time he possessed the cocaine we review the district court legal conclusions on jurisdictio
