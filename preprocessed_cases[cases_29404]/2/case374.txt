the arkansas state highway commission commission initiated this maritime action to recover the expenses it incurred in repairing the bridge that spans the mississippi river at helena,arkansas.the bridge was damaged when the arkansas river pushboat,the james hines hines,rammed a dragline barge into the underside of the bridge.following a bench trial,the district court found that the arkansas river was liable to the commission for the damage to the bridge.the district court further found that the arkansas river was entitled to contribution from the united states because the united states army corps of engineers corps,the owner of the barge,failed to tender the barge to the hines captain in a condition that would have permitted it to pass safely under the bridge.the united states and the commission appeal we affirm.
facts and background 
the corps entered into a time charter with the arkansas river on july,engaging the services of the company pushboat,the hines,and the hines crew.a time charter is a maritime contract providing that the chartered vessel owner navigates,operates,and maintains the chartered vessel,but the chartering party directs the work the vessel is to perform,including the routes it will take,during the charter period.see interocean shipping lygaria.
pursuant to the charter,the corps directed the hines to transport six corps barges,including the corps dragline barge,the odum,from greenville,mississippi,up the mississippi river to memphis,tennessee.a dragline is an excavating machine that has a bucket attached by cables to the end of a long boom.the bucket is filled by using the cables to draw the bucket toward the machine.the odum has a boom which can be maintained at either a or angle.at the angle,the boom tip is to feet above the water,whereas at the position,the tip is to feet above the water.the corps also directed its own pushboat,the singleton,to assist the hines in transporting the flotilla to memphis.
on july,the corps employees in greenville were preparing the odum for transport under the direction of walter fuquay.fuquay initially directed the employees to lower the odum boom to its position,but charles cates,acting chief of the grading unit at greenville,told fuquay that the boom did not need to be lowered.fuquay and the singleton captain,david bradford,questioned cates decision because they were concerned the odum would not pass under the bridge at helena,arkansas,with the boom in its raised position.cates asked captain bradford to verify his height computations at the helena bridge.based on the river stage projections cates provided to bradford,bradford also determined that the odum would clear the bridge,and cates issued a direct order not to lower the boom.lowering the odum boom is not a simple process.it apparently takes a crew of no less than four people three to four hours to complete the process.there was testimony at trial that lowering the boom is a dangerous process,which can not be undertaken once the odum is unmoored.
captain jay foster,an arkansas river employee,arrived the following day with the hines to pick up the corps flotilla.captain foster made a customary inspection of the entire tow by walking around it.he noted during the inspection that the corps employees had secured the odum boom for transport,that the boom appeared to him to be in the position,and that the boom looked to be about feet above water.that same morning,captain foster had calculated that there was feet of clearance at the helena bridge based on that morning river stage,and thus he erroneously assumed the odum boom would clear.before departing,captain foster asked cates whether there were any special instructions,and cates responded that there were not.captain foster was never informed by cates or captain bradford that the odom boom had not been lowered.
the trip from greenville was uneventful until the flotilla reached the helena bridge at around on july.as the hines and the singleton pushed the flotilla under the bridge,the odum boom struck the bridge underside,knocking loose most of the bridge underlying steel support structure.to cover the costs of repair,the commission applied to the united states department of transportation dot for repair funds under the emergency relief program.the dot approved the application and set aside in emergency funds to be used by the state.to receive the emergency funds,however,the commission had to enter into a written agreement with the dot to recover the costs of repair from the parties who were legally responsible for the damage and to reimburse the dot from any recovered funds.see f requiring a state which receives funds to undertake prompt and diligent efforts to recover repair costs from those who are legally responsible for the damage.the commission repaired the helena bridge in one month,stipulating at trial that the total cost of repair was.for a reason undisclosed in the record,the commission claimed only in emergency relief funds from the dot.the commission paid the remaining in repair costs out of state funds.
the commission then filed this suit against the arkansas river and the corps,seeking to invoke the district court admiralty jurisdiction under and the admiralty jurisdiction act.the commission alleged that the arkansas river and the corps were jointly and severally liable for the repair costs.the arkansas river filed a seeking contribution from the united states.the corps moved to dismiss the commission claim on the ground that the corps was not a proper party to the suit,and the commission sought leave to amend its complaint to name the united states as a proper party.
the district court granted the corps motion,reasoning that the commission claims arising out of the corps alleged negligence could only be brought against the united states itself under the suits in admiralty act saa,which,among other things,waives sovereign immunity for all maritime claims arising out of the united states ownership or operation of a vessel,see id.under the saa,a party may maintain suit against the united states in personam only,and the district court therefore ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the corps.the district court denied the commission motion to amend,however,because it found that the commission contractual obligation with the dot essentially created a situation where the court was being asked to settle a dispute between the dot and the united states.the district court concluded that no authority authorized suit in federal court between an agency of the united states and the united states itself.see district court order denying summary judgment,at explaining the court earlier action.
at the beginning of the bench trial,the commission moved for judgment as a matter of law against the arkansas river based on the rebuttable presumption that a moving vessel is at fault when it strikes a stationary object.see,folkstone,csx,cir.the district court granted the motion and entered judgment against the arkansas river for the total amount of the repairs,and awarded prejudgment interest on the of the state funds actually expended by the commission to repair the bridge.
the remainder of the trial involved the arkansas river for contribution from the united states.at the trial conclusion,the district court found that the corps was at fault for the damage to the bridge because the corps had a duty to make the odum seaworthy before turning the vessel over to captain foster.it rejected the government argument that the odum unseaworthiness,the raised boom,was so obvious that captain foster failure to notice it rendered the arkansas river entirely liable.based on its findings,the district court entered judgment in favor of the arkansas river against the united states for the entire amount of the arkansas river liability to the commission.
ii.discussion 
the government argues that the district court erred in entering judgment in favor of the arkansas river on the contribution claim because it contends captain foster had a duty to ascertain the height of the odum boom with certainty,rendering the arkansas river entirely liable for his failure to do so.it also argues that the district court lacked
