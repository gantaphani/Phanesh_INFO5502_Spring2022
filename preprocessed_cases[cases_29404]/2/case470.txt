plaintiff bobbie jo wallis brought an action against defendants princess cruises,and others for damages based on the death of her husband,who drowned off the coast of greece after falling in an undetermined manner from defendants cruise ship.the district court granted defendants motions for summary judgment,with the exception of plaintiff death on the high seas act dohsa claim,and granted defendants motion for partial summary judgment limiting their liability to approximately in accordance with a clause printed in the back of the ticket contract.we reverse the grant of partial summary judgment limiting recoverable damages,and hold that a contract clause that merely refers to the convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea of athens convention does not reasonably communicate a liability limitation.we affirm the district court order in all other respects.
background 
in the summer of,bobbie jo wallis and her husband,joel anderson wallis,embarked on a mediterranean cruise aboard the grand princess,a cruise ship owned by related companies princess cruises,fairlane shipping international corporation,and princess cruise lines,princess or defendants.they were each given a ticket packet containing ticket coupons and a passage contract.at the bottom of coupon of the ticket packet was the warning headline important notice in type,followed by this statement in type 
this ticket includes the passage contract terms set forth at the end of this packet which are binding on you.please read all sections carefully as they affect your legal rights,particularly section governing the provision of medical and other personal services and sections through limiting the carrier liability and your rights to sue.
the warning headline and text was repeated four more times at the bottom of coupon,coupon,coupon,and coupon.text of similar wording appeared across the top of the first page of the passage contract,located behind the ticket coupons.on pages six and seven of the passage contract was a paragraph headed.limitations on carrier liability indemnification.the sixth and seventh sentences of the read 
carrier shall be entitled to any and all liability limitations,immunities and rights applicable to it under the convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea of athens convention which limits the carrier liability for death of or personal injury to a passenger to no more than the applicable amount of special drawing rights as defined therein,and all other limits for damage or loss of personal property.if the athens convention or such exemptions are held not to apply for any reason,then all the exemptions from and limitations of liability provided in or authorized by the laws of the united states including title code sections,will apply.
the passage contract also required that all claims against princess be litigated in a court located in the county of los angeles,california.
sometime in the early morning of july,wallis disappeared from the grand princess.during this time,the ship was traveling towards athens.no one saw wallis fall overboard.by the time the grand princess docked in athens,it was apparent that wallis was missing from the ship.a certified statement from the hellenic coast guard reports that a helicopter and multiple rescue boats were launched that day to search for wallis.the distraught plaintiff initially remained on board,where she was given a sedative by the ship physician and questioned by greek police about her husband disappearance.plaintiff asserts that during this time,commodore moulin the ship master subjected her to remarks that her husband had fallen overboard that he died in his fall from the ship that his body would be sucked under the ship,chopped up by the propellers and probably would not be recovered.later that afternoon,commodore moulin informed plaintiff that the grand princess was set to leave port at,and that she had a choice of disembarking or continuing with the cruise.plaintiff chose to disembark and stay in athens.
on july,wallis body washed ashore near lavrio,greece.the body was severely decomposed,but nothing in the record indicates that the body had been cut by propellers.since wallis death,plaintiff has been diagnosed with depression and stress disorder.plaintiff claims that she has recurring images of her husband being pulled under the ship and into its propellers.
plaintiff filed this action against princess in federal district court,alleging seven causes of action against princess,including wrongful death under dohsa.intentional infliction of emotional distress breach of contract and fraud in various marketing materials.princess moved for summary judgment striking all claims or,alternatively,for partial summary judgment limiting princess liability to the amount approximately prescribed by the convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea athens convention,incorporated by reference in paragraph of the passage contract.on august,the district court granted princess motions for summary judgment on all claims except for the dohsa claim,and granted the motion for partial summary judgment limiting princess liability.plaintiff timely appealed the district court grant of partial summary judgment on the amount of recoverable damages,and its grant of summary judgment on the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
ii.discussion 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir.we determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.
jurisdiction 
under a,a court of appeal has jurisdiction over i nterlocutory decrees of district courts determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.princess contends that because the district court left for trial the issue of whether princess was liable for a negligent search under dohsa,the district court decision below did not determin e the rights and liabilities of the parties within the meaning of a.therefore,according to princess,the district court decision is not subject to interlocutory review under a.we have jurisdiction to determine our scope of jurisdiction.see breed hughes aircraft,cir.
we have previously stated that a is an exception to the final judgment rule and,therefore,is construed narrowly.it permits appeals only when the order appealed from determines the rights and liabilities of the parties.southwest marine danzig,cir,cert.denied,d.at the same time,we have twice exercised jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals under this section when the district court has upheld the validity of a clause limiting the amount of liability but has not reached the question of whether the defendant was actually liable.see carman tool abrasives,evergreen lines,cir vision air flight service,national pride,cir.
in carman tool,defendants were sued for negligent handling of cargo.we wrote 
as an affirmative defense,defendants asserted that their liability,if any,is limited to per package,pursuant to section of cogsa carriage of goods at sea act.supp.iii,the terms of the contract of carriage as contained in the bill of lading 
all parties moved for partial summary judgment as to whether defendants liability is limited to per package.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendants,and plaintiffs took an interlocutory appeal pursuant to a.
at footnote omitted emphasis added.although the district court in carman tool had made no determination as to whether the defendants were actually liable,we nonetheless exercised jurisdiction under a to determine whether the defendants potential liability was properly limited to per package pursuant to cogsa.
our case is procedurally and jurisdictionally identical to carman tool.as an affirmative defense,princess asserted that its liability,if any,for the death of wallis is limited to roughly pursuant to its passage contract.princess moved for partial summary judgment as to whether its liability is so limited,and the district court granted the motion.as in carman tool,the district court in our case has not decided whether princess is actually liable for plaintiff wrongful death claim.it has only decided that,if princess were liable,its liability would be limited pursuant to the contract.
similarly,in vision air,plaintiff sued the defendant carrier for having destroyed two trucks while unloading them from its ship.the defendant moved for partial summary judgment to cap its liability at per truck pursuant to cogsa.the district court granted the defendant motion,and the plaintiff appealed under a.we held that we had jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a,and review a partial grant of summary judgment de novo.at.we then vacated the district court grant of partial summary judgment because the record contained evidence that could permit the conclusion that one of the two trucks had been destroyed intentionally.intentional destruction would have constituted a deviation under maritime law and would have made cogsa limitation of liability unavailable to the carrier.id.at.
it is reasonably clear from our opinion in vision air that the district court had not determined actual liability when we exercised jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal.first,the district court had granted partial summary judgment in a case in which the only question was the liability of the defendant for the destruction of the trucks.if the district court had determined actual liability,as well as limitation of liability,summary judgment would not have been merely partial.second,there is no indication anywhere in our opinion that the district court had decided anything other than the limitation of liability question nor did we ourselves decide anything other than that question.
princess cites several cases holding that a requires a determination of actual liability by the district court.see evergreen int l usa standard warehouse,cir holding that a should be construed narrowly to limit appeals to those cases where liability has been determined ag incotrans spirit,cir holding that the decision whether the cogsa limitation on damages applies in this case is not a decision determining the rights and liabilities of the parties because even if we were to hold that the limit applies,we would still have to remand this case for a decision on whether the defendants were liable burgbacher of pittsburgh,cir dismissing appeal under a because a liability determination has not been made.
we think that these other circuits have read a too narrowly.we believe that we properly exercised jurisdiction in carman tool and vision air,and that we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal under a where,as here,only the validity and applicability of a provision limiting liability has been determined.if a district court holds that a limitation of liability clause is valid and applicable,that determination will,as a practical matter,usually end the case.for example,in a cogsa case,if the district court has held that a plaintiff can recover no more than if actual liability is established,an economically rational plaintiff will not ordinarily pursue the case to judgment,and the correctness of the district court determination of applicability of the liability limitation will never be reviewed.
limitation of liability provisions are common in maritime cases,not limited to cases brought under cogsa.as we read a,it takes into account the practical problem posed by limitations of liability.its explicit text of a authorizes interlocutory decrees.if the phrase determination of the liabilities,which occurs later in the same text,were construed to exclude a determination of limitations of liability from interlocutory decrees,such a construction would make interlocutory appeals impossible in many admiralty cases,and would do so in precisely those cases where such appeals are most needed.we therefore hold that we have jurisdiction to decide this interlocutory appeal.
enforceability of liability limitation 
a cruise line passage contract is a maritime contract governed by general federal maritime law.see milanovich costa crociere.the district court granted princess motion for partial summary judgment after concluding that the passage contract contractually limited princess liability to the amount prescribed by the athens convention through the following statement in paragraph carrier shall be entitled to any and all liability limitations,immunities and rights applicable to it under the convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea of athens convention which limits the carrier liability for death of or personal injury to a passenger to no more than the applicable amount of special drawing rights as defined therein,and all other limits for damage or loss of personal property.plaintiff argues that the passage contract incorporation of the athens convention limitation is unenforceable because it is contrary to the public policy of the united states and it does not reasonably communicate the limitation of liability.we address plaintiff arguments in turn.
plaintiff first contends that.a prohibits princess from enforcing passage contract provisions purporting to limit liability the statute reads,in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for the manager,agent,master,or owner of any vessel transporting passengers between ports of the united states or between any such port and a foreign port to insert in any rule,regulation,contract,or agreement any provision or limitation purporting,in the event of loss of life or bodily injury arising from the negligence or fault of such owner or his servants,to relieve such owner,master,or agent from liability,or from liability beyond any stipulated amount,for such loss or injury all such provisions or limitations contained in any such rule,regulation,contract,or agreement are hereby declared to be against public policy and shall be null and void and of no effect.
a emphasis added.the parties do not dispute that the grand princess voyage upon which plaintiff and her husband sailed did not touch a united states port.thus,the terms of a plainly do not apply to the passage contract of plaintiff cruise.further,the legislative history cited by plaintiff suggests a congressional intent,consistent with the text,to regulate all foreign carriers within the waters of the united states,but not to regulate foreign vessels in foreign waters.see hodes achille lauro ed,cir congress,in sections and,delimited the reach of american public policy to contracts of passage for voyages that touch the united states we refuse to supplement that congressional choice with judicial embellishment,overruled on other grounds by lauro lines chasser,d mills renaissance cruises,wl,same.
plaintiff next argues that the passage contract does not reasonably communicate the limitation so that a passenger can become meaningfully informed of its terms.in this circuit,we employ a reasonable communicativeness test,adopted from shankles costa armatori,cir,to determine under federal common law and maritime law when the passenger of a common carrier is contractually bound by the fine print of a passenger ticket.see deiro am.airlines,cir applying first circuit test for maritime cases to case involving air carrier see also dempsey norwegian cruise line,cir bringing deiro analysis back to maritime cases.t he proper test of reasonable notice is an analysis of the overall circumstances on a basis,with an examination not only of the ticket itself,but also of any extrinsic factors indicating the passenger ability to become meaningfully informed of the contractual terms at stake.deiro,at quoting shankles,at.whether the ticket provides reasonable notice is a question of law,which we review de novo.see dempsey,at.
the first prong of the reasonable communicativeness test focuses on the physical characteristics of the ticket.here we assess f eatures such as size of type,conspicuousness and clarity of notice on the face of the ticket,and the ease with which a passenger can read the provisions in question.deiro,at quoting shankles,at.we believe the physical characteristics of the ticket in this case are such that the terms and conditions are sufficiently conspicuous to the passenger.the reference to the athens convention liability limitation is buried six sentences into paragraph in extremely small inch type.however,paragraph is legible,and it carries the heading.limitations on carrier liability indemnification.the important notice warning headline reminds the passenger at least five times to read sections through.the pages upon which paragraph is printed are marked with the words,passage contract,in the upper right hand corner.other courts have consistently found tickets with similar physical features to have provided reasonable notice that contractual terms are contained therein.see,effron sun line cruises,cir spataro kloster cruise,cir hodes,mcquillan italia societa per azione di navigazione.
the second prong of the reasonable communicativeness test requires us to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the passenger purchase and subsequent retention of the.deiro,at quoting shankles,at.the surrounding circumstances to be considered include the passenger familiarity with the ticket,the time and incentive under the circumstances to study the provisions of the ticket,and any other notice that the passenger received outside of the ticket.id.emphasis added.this prong allows us to examine more subjective,extrinsic factors indicating the passenger ability to become meaningfully informed.id.quoting shankles,at emphasis added.
we believe the liability limitation at issue fails this second prong.it is undisputed that paragraph itself does not specify a limitation to princess liability the paragraph only references the liability limitations applicable to princess under the convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea of.it is also unclear from paragraph whether the liability limitations applicable under the athens convention would necessarily apply,as the above incorporation is followed by the language,if the athens convention or such exemptions are held not to apply for any reason,then all the exemptions from and limitations of liability provided in or authorized by the laws of the united states including title code sections,will apply.emphasis added.
a passenger wishing to inform herself of the nature of the possible liability limitation in paragraph is likely to look up the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea,which was signed in.the passenger would have to understand that paragraph,which specifies the date rather than,refers to the athens convention as amended in,requiring her to look up the protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea.upon finding the protocol,the passenger would discover that article,paragraph,of the athens convention,as amended by the protocol,states in pertinent part the liability of the carrier for the death of or personal injury to a passenger shall in no case exceed units of account per carriage.protocol to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea.the passenger would then have to look at article of the athens convention,as amended by the protocol,to learn that a unit of account is the same as a special drawing right as defined by the international monetary fund and that t he amount mentioned in article shall be converted into the national currency of the state of the court seized of the case on the basis of the value of that currency on the date of the judgment or the date agreed upon by the parties.id.the passenger presumably would have no way of predicting when a potential date of judgment would be,but if the passenger wished to calculate a value for special drawing rights sdr s,she would have to learn the meaning of the term,and would then have to check a financial source tracking the daily conversion rate for an sdr only after such research would the passenger have any sense of the estimated limitation on princess liability in the event of personal injury or,that is,that the athens convention even applied.the united states is not a signatory to the convention or the protocol.we think it is unrealistic to assume the average passenger with no legal background would even attempt to analyze the conditions under which the athens convention would or would not apply 
we are persuaded that the average passenger has little incentive to invest sufficient effort to approximate the value of what she would be led to regard by the language of paragraph itself as only a potentially binding term of the passage contract.under the reasonable communicativeness test,a disincentive to study the provisions of the ticket is considered an extrinsic factor impeding the passenger ability to become meaningfully informed.moreover,even if a passenger were motivated to undertake such effort,it would require some legal and financial sophistication,which are additional extrinsic factors,to research the liability limitation reference in paragraph.for this reason,we hold that princess incorporation of the athens convention liability limitation does not satisfy the second prong of the reasonable communicativeness test.
our holding is consistent with our previous decisions in komatsu,states steamship,cir,and chan soc y expeditions,cir.in komatsu,a district court found an ocean carrier liable for damage to the plaintiffs cargo.one of the issues raised on appeal was whether an ocean carrier is entitled to the damage limitation in cogsa if it incorporates by reference cogsa into its bill of lading.komatsu,at.we held that the defendant was not entitled to the liability limitation as a matter of law,and rejected the defendant argument that 
an experienced shipper should be deemed to have knowledge of an opportunity to secure an alternative freight rate,and higher carrier liability by reason of his knowledge of cogsa,made applicable by a paramount clause in the bill of lading,where such opportunity does not present itself on the face of the bill of lading.the bill of lading is usually a boilerplate form drafted by the carrier,and presented for acceptance as a matter of routine business practice to a relatively shipping employee.we feel that imputing such knowledge of cogsa applicability and provisions to such an employee is an assumption that may go beyond the bounds of commercial realism.
id.at emphasis added quoting pan am.world airways,cal.stevedore ballast,cir.it would make little sense to hold that a reference to a federal shipping statute provides insufficient notice to an employee of an experienced shipper,but that a reference to a foreign treaty provides sufficient notice to a passenger who may take a cruise only once or twice in her lifetime.
in chan,we held that c ruise passenger tickets are contracts of adhesion,and as such,ambiguities in them must be construed against the carrier.chan,at.we refused to enforce a clause absolving a carrier responsibility for personal injuries because of ambiguous language in the purported disclaimer.the problem with the contract terms in the passage contract in this case may be that they are opaque rather than ambiguous.but opaqueness,like ambiguity,obscures the meaning of an instrument that in case of doubt is to be taken against the party that drew it.rams royal caribbean cruise lines,cir internal quotation omitted,cited in chan,at.
princess asserts in its brief that in chan korean air lines,d,the supreme court held that a limitation amount need not be stated in the airline ticket at all only a statement the transportation was subject to the warsaw convention was needed.we believe this assertion misrepresents the holding of the case.in korean air lines,plaintiffs brought wrongful death actions against korean airlines kal.all parties agreed that their rights were governed by the multilateral treaty known as the warsaw convention.a private accord among airlines,known as the montreal agreement,required carriers to give notice of the warsaw convention damages limitation for personal injury or death in print size no smaller than type.the issue in korean air lines was whether the treaty imposed a sanction eliminating the damages limitation when the requirement of the montreal agreement was not met.the warsaw convention liability rules were printed on kal passenger tickets in type instead of type.the court held that nothing in the plain language of the montreal agreement or the warsaw convention provided elimination of the damages limitation as the sanction for defective notice.the court based its conclusion on its interpretation of a treaty text,not on reasonable notice principles applicable to maritime contracts.the court did not hold that a passage contract need not provide notice of liability limitations.
furthermore,unlike the warsaw convention,the athens convention has never been ratified by the united states.therefore,unlike the warsaw convention,the athens convention carries no force of law on its own.see chan soc y expeditions,at.the limitation of liability provision of the athens convention is legally enforceable only as a term of a legitimate contract.as such,an athens convention limitation must be reasonably communicated before it can bind a passenger under federal maritime law.
almost all of the remaining cases princess cites in support of its claims that the terms and conditions of princess ticket contract have repeatedly been found reasonably communicative and that o ther cruise line ticket contracts which are substantially similar or identical to princess have also routinely met the reasonable communicative test as a matter of law,the nature amount of the limitation in question was explicitly stated in the contract.see effron,express forum selection clause dempsey,express time limitation clause spataro,express time limitation clause sharpe indian,d enforcing express time limitation clause but construing ambiguities in another clause against drafter walker carnival cruise lines,d express forum selection clause,modified on other grounds,d bounds sun line cruises,express forum selection clause osborn princess tours,express time limitation clause osborn princess tours,wl express forum selection clause roberson norwegian cruise line.express forum selection clause melnik cunard line.express forum selection clause berg royal caribbean cruises,wl,express time limitation clause miller regency maritime.express forum selection clause mills,wl provision explicitly limiting liability for personal injury or death to becantinos cunard line,wl passage contract appears to have explicitly limited recovery value to british pounds and mcquillan.express time limitation clause.
finally,we note that our holding is not precluded by the court decision in carnival cruise lines,shute,d.in shute,the court held that a forum selection clause in a cruise line passage contract was reasonable and enforceable despite the facts that the clause was not the product of negotiation,and that respondents were physically and financially incapable of litigating in the selected forum.the court expressly stated in shute that 
w e do not address the question whether respondents had sufficient notice of the forum clause before entering the contract for passage.respondents essentially have conceded that they had notice of the provision.brief for respondents the respondents do not contest the incorporation of the provisions nor sic that the forum selection clause was reasonably communicated to the respondents,as much as three pages of fine print can be communicated.
shute,at.emphasis added.as the opinion makes clear,the court in shute evaluated the enforceability of the forum selection clause under the assumption that it was reasonably communicated to the plaintiffs.we have been asked to decide an antecedent issue whether the contract term in question was reasonably communicated in the first place.we now decide that issue,and hold that a passage contract clause that merely references the convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea of athens convention without providing an approximate monetary limitation does not meaningfully inform a passenger of a liability limitation,and is therefore unenforceable.
intentional infliction of emotional distress 
choice of law 
in granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress,the district court assumed without discussion that the claim is governed by general maritime law.plaintiff argues on appeal that the district court should have applied california law instead because her claim,based on the outrageous verbal conduct of defendants and their failure to provide promised legal counsel or psychological assistance,does not implicate the traditional areas of the admiralty bar expertise nor does it threaten to effect sic maritime commerce.
the supreme court held in sisson ruby,d,that general maritime law governs a tort claim when conditions of location and connection to maritime activity are satisfied.a court applying the location test must determine whether the tort occurred on navigable water or whether injury suffered on land was caused by a vessel on navigable water.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.the connection test requires the court to analyze two issues whether the incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce and whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.id.internal citations omitted.
plaintiff does not dispute that the facts underlying her claim satisfy the location test.plaintiff argues,however,that because her claim is based primarily on the verbal conduct of crewmembers and not on any acts or omissions related to the search and rescue for wallis,the incident underlying her claim is not substantially related to traditional maritime activity.we believe that plaintiff focuses too narrowly on the particular causes of the alleged harm,and hold that the general activity giving rise to the incident satisfies the connection test.sisson,at.the court emphasized in sisson that 
o ur cases have made clear that the relevant activity is defined not by the particular circumstances of the incident,but by the general conduct from which the incident arose.in executive jet aviation,city of cleveland,d,for example,the relevant activity was not a plane sinking in lake erie,but air travel generally.
id.emphasis added.similarly,the relevant activity in this case is not simply the crewmembers verbal conduct or the omitted legal and psychological assistance,but a cruise ship treatment of passengers generally.a cruise line treatment of paying passengers clearly has potential to disrupt commercial activity,and certainly has substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.hence,the district court did not err in applying general maritime law to plaintiff claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
noting that there is no maritime law concerning a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress,the district court measured the sufficiency of plaintiff claim under the restatement second of torts.although we have held that claims for emotional distress are cognizable under admiralty law,see chan soc y expeditions,cir,there appears to be no established maritime standard for evaluating such claims.see muratore scotia prince,cir t he district court applied maine law because there is no rule of law in maritime law on infliction of emotional distress.york commodore cruise line,there is no maritime law concerning plaintiffs claim that defendants conduct surrounding the subsequent investigation constituted the intentional infliction of emotional distress.we have the authority to develop general maritime law regarding claims not directly governed by congressional legislation or admiralty precedent.chan,at see also thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed.when new situations arise that are not directly governed by legislation or admiralty precedent,federal courts may fashion a rule for decision by a variety of methods.federal courts may,and often do,look to state statutory law and to precepts of the common law which they borrow and apply as the federal admiralty rule.footnote omitted.while we do not regard the resta
