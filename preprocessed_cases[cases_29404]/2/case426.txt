we are called upon to decide whether a foreign national who forcibly seizes control of a foreign vessel in international waters may be subject to the jurisdiction of the united states when such vessel is intercepted by federal authorities.
on march,the full means,a taiwanese fishing vessel registered in the republic of the seychelles,was sailing in international waters off the coast of hawaii.the captain of the vessel was taiwanese,while its crewmembers,including lei shi the ship cook,were mainland chinese.according to shi,the captain and first mate beat and harassed him repeatedly and,on this date,demoted shi from the position of cook to deck hand,punctuating the decision with a beating that was particularly severe.a few hours later,shi responded.he retrieved two large knives from the kitchen,ascended to the deck of the ship,and fatally stabbed both men.
according to the government,shi then ordered the second mate to drive the ship and ordered the other crewmembers to throw the captain body overboard.shi stated he would kill anyone who disobeyed him and refused to let his fellow crewmates use the radio.shi retained control of the ship for two days,setting a course for china and threatening to scuttle the vessel if his instructions were not obeyed.
on march,the crew overpowered shi and imprisoned him in a storage compartment on the ship.the crew then set a course for hawaii,though they never contacted the ship parent company,apparently because none of them knew how to operate the radio.after several days of silence,the parent company notified the coast guard that the full means was missing and requested the coast guard assistance in recovery.
on march,a coast guard cutter intercepted the ship approximately miles from hilo,hawaii.two of the full means crewmembers set out on a raft to meet the cutter,carrying a letter addressed to the hawaiian government which described shi takeover.after the republic of the seychelles waived jurisdiction,the ship acting master permitted the coast guard to board.the coast guard did not attempt to take control of the ship at the time because the officers decided first to determine whether the crew was staging an emergency to gain entry into the united states or whether a true exigency existed.
among the officers who boarded the ship was junior grade john fu,who spoke mandarin chinese.fu came upon the storage compartment where shi was imprisoned and examined it from the outside.the crew had sealed the door to the compartment shut by welding a metal bar across its doorway.the door contained holes,however,through which fu could see shi sitting inside.shi hands were bound behind him with wire which appeared to be cutting his wrists.the compartment contained no windows or a toilet.fu later testified that he believed the crew fed shi through a hole in the door,although he did not personally witness such acts.
because the coast guard had not yet assumed control of the vessel,the officers still considered shi to be a prisoner of the crew.accordingly,they did not immediately instruct the crew to release shi from the compartment.still,fu insisted that the crew remove the wire restraints from shi hands.the crew obliged,and the wires were replaced with handcuffs.
on march and,fu stood outside the compartment and spoke to shi through the holes in the door.he later testified that his decision to initiate contact with shi was an effort to determine whether shi could corroborate the story told by the crew.in the course of their exchanges,shi told fu that he had killed the captain and first mate.fu never read shi the miranda warnings.
on march at approximately pm,fbi agents boarded the vessel and arrested shi for violating,which prohibits acts of violence that endanger maritime navigation.in addition,the agents obtained a warrant to search shi bunk area on the ship,where they discovered several incriminating letters shi had written to his family.
immediately upon releasing shi from the storage compartment,the agents allowed shi to use the bathroom.next,they escorted him to the ship dining area,where agent lynelle torikai,through the assistance of language specialist kipiu wun,informed shi of the charges against him and read him his miranda rights.in addition,the agents furnished shi with an advice of rights waiver written in mandarin.shi expressed his willingness to answer questions,but called them insignificant and did not sign the form.agent torikai and language specialist wun then explained the miranda rights and the purpose of the form for approximately five minutes,after which shi signed it.
thereafter,a coast guard health technician examined shi,treated his wrists with ointment,and wrapped them.the fbi then transported shi to the federal building in honolulu,where he was fed,permitted to use the restroom,and given a change of clothing.at approximately pm,shi was escorted to an interrogation room where agent torikai questioned him for approximately hours.during such time,shi was fed again,permitted two smoke breaks,and confessed to killing the captain and first mate.
the government filed an indictment charging shi with several violations of,which proscribes certain acts of violence that endanger maritime navigation.the statute codifies the united states obligations under the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation the maritime safety convention,which authorizes any signatory state to extradite or prosecute offenders,regardless of where the offender acts occurred.accordingly,authorizes federal jurisdiction over any offender later found in the united states after a prohibited act is committed.b c.in a published order,the district court concluded that it had jurisdiction under the statute.united states shi,d.
next,the district court granted shi motion to suppress his unwarned statements to fu on march and,but denied his motion to suppress his subsequent confession to agent torikai.the court also denied shi motion to exclude the personal letters the fbi agents seized from his bunk space,rejecting shi arguments that the warrant was invalid and that the scope of the search was overbroad.
shi initially pled guilty,but soon withdrew the plea,and the government filed a superseding indictment the new indictment charged shi with one count of seizing control over a ship by force,in violation of a a,and two counts of performing an act of violence likely to endanger the safety of the ship,in violation of a b.the indictment alleged that the acts charged in all three counts resulted in death,elevating the maximum statutory penalty for each from years to life in prison.the jury convicted shi on all counts,and the district court sentenced him to years in prison.
shi timely filed this appeal,challenging the district court jurisdiction,the sufficiency of the indictment,the admissibility of his statement to agent torikai,the admissibility of the letters seized from his bunk,and the constitutionality of his sentence.we now turn to the merits of these claims.
we begin with shi contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction because he did not meet the jurisdictional prerequisites set forth in and,in the alternative,because is unconstitutional as applied to him.we consider shi constitutional argument first.
section codifies the united states obligations under the maritime safety convention to extradite or to prosecute those who commit acts of maritime violence.section a lists eight proscribed acts,and b vests federal courts with jurisdiction if certain conditions are met.at issue here is the provision which renders jurisdiction proper if the offender is later found in the united states.id.b c emphasis added.the district court concluded that provided it with jurisdiction over shi because shi arrest and transport to honolulu rendered him later found in the united states as the statute defines that term.
article i,section,clause of the united states constitution the offense clause empowers congress to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,and offenses against the law of nations.because the high seas,by definition,lie outside united states territory,see united states davis,cir,the offense clause grants congress the authority to apply federal law beyond the borders of the united states,see eeoc arabian am.oil,d.
section is an exercise of congress constitutional authority to define and punish felonies on the high seas because it proscribes felony offenses and expressly applies to international waters.see e.in addition,a a and b,the provisions under which shi was charged,proscribe offenses which meet the definition of piracy.piracy traditionally has been defined as robbery,or forcible depredations upon the sea.united states smith,wheat.depredation is the act of plundering,robbing,or pillaging.black law dictionary ed.all three acts require the use of force section a a prohibits seiz ing or exercis ing control over a ship by force or threat thereof,and a b prohibits act s of violence against a person on board a ship that are likely to endanger the safe navigation of that ship.because such offenses involve interference with property on the open sea through the use of force,they are within congress power to define and to punish crimes of piracy.see smith,at treating piracies,felonies on the high seas,and offenses against the laws of nations as three separate offenses.
in addition to the offense clause,congress derived the authority to promulgate by virtue of the necessary and proper clause.that clause empowers congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states,or in any department or officer thereof.const.art.i,cl.such powers include the executive article ii treaty power.see missouri holland.section implements the maritime safety convention,an international accord which requires signatory states to prosecute or extradite offenders found within their territory regardless of where the offense was committed.see united states yousef,cir per curiam discussing a similar provision in the montreal convention.in order to satisfy this obligation,it was necessary for the united states to codify the convention extradite or prosecute requirement into federal law.section accomplishes this task.accordingly,the treaty power coupled with the necessary and proper clause provided congress with an additional source of authority to apply beyond borders.
congress constitutional authority to apply a federal law outside borders does not end our inquiry,however,because we may not presume that congress intended to do so unless it clearly expresses such intent.see sale haitian ctrs.council,d.section b applies to covered ships,which the statute defines as ships navigating or scheduled to navigate into,through or from waters beyond the outer limit of the territorial sea of a single country,e emphasis added.in addition,the statute provides federal jurisdiction over acts committed on such ships if the offender is later found in the united states.id.b c emphasis added.we are satisfied that these two provisions are a clear expression that applies outside united states territory.
even if congress had the authority to apply beyond the united states borders and clearly manifested its intent to do so,shi argues that the application of the statute to him violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment.shi points to our decision in davis,in which we held that when the maritime drug law enforcement act mdlea is applied to a foreign defendant apprehended on a ship,due process requires a sufficient nexus between the defendant and the united states,so that such application would not be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.at internal citation and footnote omitted.shi argues that no such nexus exists here.yet before we reach the question of whether a jurisdictional nexus exists,we must first determine whether such nexus is required.
the due process clause requires that a defendant prosecuted in the united states should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in this country.united states,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the mdlea prohibits the possession of narcotics on the high seas.because some states do not consider such conduct criminal,we held in davis that due process requires a foreign defendant apprehended on a foreign flag ship to have some connection to the united states before he can be prosecuted in a domestic court at.yet in united states caicedo,cir,we concluded that due process does not require any such nexus when the mdlea is applied to foreign defendants apprehended on stateless vessels because s uch vessels are international pariahs,that,by attempting to shrug the yoke of any nation authority,subject themselves to the jurisdiction of all nations.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
we need not determine whether the full means was a or stateless vessel at the time it was intercepted by the coast guard in order to resolve this case.instead,we abide by our instruction in caicedo that a nexus requirement,imposed as a matter of due process,makes sense when the rough guide of international law also requires a nexus.see also davis,at explaining that while not binding,i nternational law principles may be useful as a rough guide of whether a sufficient nexus exists between the defendant and the united states.
in applying the rough guide of international law,we turn to the principle of universal jurisdiction.universal jurisdiction is based on the premise that offenses against all states may be punished by any state where the offender is found.see stephen macedo,universal jurisdiction.accordingly,it allows a state to claim jurisdiction over such an offender even if the offender acts occurred outside its boundaries and even if the offender has no connection to the state.
as explained above,the acts with which shi is charged constitute acts of piracy.see supra at.prosecuting piracy was the original rationale for creating universal jurisdiction,see,kenneth randall,universal jurisdiction under international law,citing piracy as the archetypal universal crime,and federal courts have historically accepted the notion that a pirate may be tried by any state,see smith,at piracy is an offense against the universal law of society,a pirate being,according to sir edward coke,hostis humani generis an enemy of the human race quoting blackstone commentaries.due process does not require a nexus between such an offender and the united states because the universal condemnation of the offender conduct puts him on notice that his acts will be prosecuted by any state where he is found.see united states,cir holding that inasmuch as a crime is condemned universally by nations,we see no reason to conclude that it is fundamentally unfair for congress to provide for the punishment of offenders apprehended on the high seas.
sections a a and b prohibit interference with the safe navigation of a maritime vessel through the use or threat of force.because these are acts of piracy,and because such acts are universally condemned,due process does not require the same nexus between the offender and the united states as does the mdlea.
moreover,due process does not require the same nexus between violators of and the united states because implements the maritime safety convention,which expressly provides foreign offenders with notice that their conduct will be prosecuted by any state signatory we acknowledge that in a similar case,the second circuit suggested that a jurisdictional nexus was required.in yousef,a foreign national apprehended abroad was prosecuted in the united states for violating b,which prohibits aircraft piracy,after he hijacked a philippine airlines flight.at.the second circuit cited our decision in davis,which applied a nexus requirement to a foreign defendant apprehended abroad and prosecuted under the mdlea.id.at.the court reasoned that such requirement was met in yousef case because his conduct was purposefully aimed at the united states he previously hijacked aircrafts in the united states and his hijacking of the philippine airlines flight was a for an attack in this country.id.at.
the court treatment of the due process question consisted of only three paragraphs of a opinion,however,and while the court cited our decision,id.at citing davis,at,it never considered the implications of our refusal to extend the nexus requirement to foreign defendants apprehended on stateless vessels in and caicedo.see,at caicedo,at.those decisions suggest that a nexus is not required when the offender conduct is proscribed universally.
the circuit decision united states rezaq,supports such conclusion.in that case,a foreign national was apprehended abroad and charged with hijacking an air egypt flight in violation of app.n.id.at.the circuit concluded that federal jurisdiction over rezaq was proper without noting any possible due process concerns.although the court silence may have stemmed from any number of reasons,it is important to note that,like,the statute in rezaq was enacted to implement an international agreement to extradite and to prosecute perpetrators of conduct.section n implemented the hague convention,which prohibits aircraft hijacking.
congress authority to apply beyond united states borders stems in part from its power under the offense clause to punish piracies on the high seas,not merely felonies,as congress has done in statutes such as the mdlea.because piracy is a crime,a jurisdictional nexus is not required to satisfy due process.as such,we conclude that the universal condemnation of shi conduct and the existence of the maritime safety convention provided him with all the notice due process requires that he could be prosecuted in this country.accordingly,the district court exercise of jurisdiction over shi was neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair,at citing caicedo,at.
having established that the district court exercise of jurisdiction over shi satisfied the constitution requirements,we next consider shi arguments that jurisdiction was improper under the statutory requirements set forth in,which permits jurisdiction if the offender is later found in the united states.id.b c emphasis added.the government contends that shi arrest and transport to the honolulu federal building brought him within the terms of this provision.shi argues otherwise.
it is that jurisdiction over a defendant is not impaired by the fact that he was brought within the jurisdictional territory of the court against his will.see frisbie collins.ker illinois.yet shi argues that creates an exception to this rule because it requires the defendant to be later found in the united states.b c.accordingly,he reads the statute to require a defendant to enter the united states voluntarily before he can be prosecuted.
the circuit rejected an identical argument launched against a similar statute.in rezaq,a foreign defendant was arrested abroad and tried in the united states for violating app.n,an statute.at.section n requires the defendant to be afterwards found in the united states and the defendant argued that this language required that he enter the united states voluntarily.the circuit rejected this interpretation,holding that the word found means only that the hijacker must be physically located in the united states,not that he must be first detected here.rezaq,at emphasis added 
we are persuaded by this analysis,and conclude that the requirement that a defendant be later found does not contain the implicit requirement that the defendant arrival in the united states be voluntary.indeed,if congress intended to create such an exception to the rule,we would expect it to manifest its intent more directly.moreover,the maritime safety convention contains no such voluntary entry requirement.see maritime safety convention.to the extent congress intended to deviate from the convention it was designed to implement,we would expect such an instruction to be express.
accordingly,we conclude that shi arrest on the full means after the united states had established jurisdiction over the ship and his subsequent transport to the honolulu federal building rendered him later found in the united states and subjected him to jurisdiction under.with the propriety of the district court jurisdiction now established,we turn to shi additional challenges to his conviction.
shi next argues that the indictment against him was insufficient.the indictment contained every element of a a and b,the offenses with which shi was charged.as such,it fairly informed him of the charges against him and enable d him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.united states vroman,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.yet shi contends that the indictment was flawed because it failed to allege that he engaged in acts of terrorism sections a a and b contain no such requirement.
the face of the statute does not reference terrorism or suggest that its scope is limited to terrorist acts.moreover,the statutory context does not indicate that such limitation exists.section is codified in title,part i,chapter of the,which describes offenses related to shipping.a separate chapter defines offenses related to terrorism.see title,part i,chapter.shi correctly notes that a violation of is one of several offenses which may constitute a federal crime of terrorism,but fails to note that such classification requires additional statutory showings.see g b i listing as one offense which may be prosecuted as a federal crime of terrorism if such offense is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct.that a violation of may be a federal crime of terrorism in certain cases does not imply that terrorism is an element of the crime.accordingly,we conclude that the indictment against shi was sufficient.
we next turn to shi argument that the district court erred in admitting his march confession to agent torikai into evidence.shi argues that such confession was inadmissible because it was tainted by his unwarned statements to fu on march and shi did not adequately waive his miranda rights upon his arrest shi invoked his right to silence,and the confession was involuntary.we consider each argument in turn.
shi made statements to fu on march and without the benefit of miranda warnings the next day,after he received the warnings,shi confessed to agent torikai.the supreme court has held that when a defendant confession is preceded by an unwarned statement or statements,the confession may only be admitted if both the statements and the confession were voluntary,or if the confession was sufficiently separated from the statement such that the causal connection between the two statements would be speculative and attenuated.oregon elstad,d see missouri seibert,d kennedy,concurring.
although the district court concluded that shi statements to fu on march and were voluntary,it assumed for purposes of this analysis that the statements were involuntary because of the poor conditions of the storage compartment in which shi was confined at the time.we proceed on the same assumption.as such,shi confession to agent torikai is admissible only if it was sufficiently attenuated from his march and statements.
in undertaking this analysis,we consider the temporal proximity between the statements the intervening circumstances and the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.united states jenkins,cir citing brown illinois,d.our examination of the degree of attenuation is merely another way of asking whether the subsequent confession was,itself,voluntary.id.
in this case,one full day elapsed between shi march statement to fu and his confession.in addition,several significant intervening events separated the statements from shi properly warned confession.first,shi unwarned statements were made to coast guard fu,while his confession was made to fbi agent torikai.second,shi unwarned statements were made on board the full means,while his mirandized confession was made at the honolulu federal building.third,during the time that elapsed between shi march statement and his confession,shi was fed,treated by a health technician,given a change of clothes,and twice permitted access to a restroom.
in addition to these intervening events,we note that shi unwarned statements were not the product of purposeful or flagrant official misconduct.see id.fu spoke to shi before the coast guard had exercised jurisdiction over the full means and testified that his purpose in engaging shi was not to ascertain his guilt,but to determine whether shi would corroborate the crew story or whether the crew was simply staging the emergency.as the supreme court has explained,i t is an unwarranted extension of miranda to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings,unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect ability to exercise his free will,so taints the investigator process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period.elstad,at.even if fu decision to speak with shi without first reading the miranda warnings was imprudent,we can not conclude that it was calculated to overcome shi exercise of his free will.accordingly,we conclude that whatever taint was caused by shi unwarned statements to fu does not preclude the admission of shi confession to agent torikai.
even if the taint of his statements was sufficiently dissipated,shi argues that his confession to agent torikai must be excluded because he did not adequately waive his miranda rights.to admit an inculpatory statement made by a defendant during custodial interrogation,the defendant waiver of miranda rights must be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent.united states garibay,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a valid waiver of miranda rights depends upon the totality of the circumstances including the background,experience,and conduct of defendant.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the prosecution bears the burden of proof,and there is a presumption against waiver.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
a waiver is voluntary if,under the totality of the circumstances,the confession is the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than coercion or improper inducement.united states doe,cir citation omitted.prior to his arrest,shi spent four days in a storage compartment where he had been kept by the crew.still,the district court found that upon his release from the compartment,shi appeared coherent and alert.indeed,the district court credited the agents description of shi demeanor as cocky and not timid at all.in addition,shi was allowed access to a bathroom before the agents escorted him to the dining area to read him the warnings.
finally,there is no evidence of police coercion.see united states kelley,coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding a confession involuntary.quoting colorado connelly,d.while the conditions in the storage compartment were quite troubling,shi was in the compartment as the crew prisoner,not the coast guard or the fbi.once the fbi released shi from the compartment and assumed custody,the district court found no evidence that the fbi intimidated or coerced shi in any way,or that there was anything that would render the atmosphere combative.we require some causal connection between police conduct and the defendant statement to render it involuntary.id.citation omitted.no such connection exists here.
accordingly,shi coherent and cocky demeanor and the absence of improper tactics by the agents satisfy us that his waiver was the product of a free and deliberate choice.
nevertheless,even if a waiver is voluntary,we must also determine whether the district court finding that such waiver was knowing and intelligent was clearly erroneous.united states,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the language barrier between shi and the agents is relevant,see garibay,at,and the district court took account of such fact in making its determination.first,it credited language specialist wun testimony that he maintained a to level of understanding with shi throughout their exchange.second,the district court noted that the advice of rights form provided to shi was written in mandarin.although mandarin was not shi native dialect,shi had a ninth grade education and,when asked by language specialist wun,stated that he understood the form.finally,the district court found shi dismissal of agent torikai questions as insignificant to be a product of his cockiness rather than confusion,and that torikai and wun rearticulation of the miranda rights eliminated whatever confusion did exist.
based on this record,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that shi waiver was knowing and intelligent.see doe,at quoting moran burbine,d,at concluding that a district court did not commit clear error in finding that a foreign defendant made a valid waiver despite confusion between the interrogating officers and the defendant over the word methamphetamine because the defendant told the officers he understood his rights and the officers did not indicate that the defendant had difficulty understanding english.
even if shi initial waiver were valid,he contends that he invoked his right to silence before he spoke.once a person invokes the right to remain silent,all questioning must cease.anderson terhune,cir en banc citing miranda arizona,d.while a defendant who invokes his right to counsel must do so unambiguously,davis united states,d,we have not yet determined whether such rule applies when a defendant invokes his right to silence.
still,we have established that,at a minimum,such invocation must not be so equivocal or unclear that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking his right to remain silent.arnold runnels,cir quoting davis,at.emphasis in original.
shi suggests that his dismissal of agent torikai questions as insignificant was an invocation of his right to silence.but as the district court explained,such claim is belied by the fact that shi consistently manifested his willingness to answer questions and that shi signed the waiver form after making this comment.
these facts distinguish this case from united states heldt,cir,the principal authority on which shi relies.in heldt,the defendant was read his miranda rights and provided with a waiver form,but told his interrogator that he understood his rights,but did not wish to waive them,and that he did not wish to answer questions.id.at emphasis added.we concluded that heldt refusal to sign the form was important evidence supporting the finding that he did not waive his rights.id.at.yet as we later explained in united states andaverde,a defendant refusal to sign the waiver form alone does not render his waiver invalid.id.at citations omitted.rather,a refusal to sign a waiver form is an indication that the defendant is invoking his right to silence which casts initial doubt on the government waiver claim.id.at quoting heldt,at emphasis added.additional evidence is necessary to confirm that initial doubt.for example,in heldt,the defendant verbally refused to answer questions and was exhorted to answer by police.id.quoting heldt,at emphasis added.here,shi never refused to sign the form or to answer questions,merely referring to torikai questions as insignificant.once torikai again explained the rights,shi signed the form.
shi also argues that he invoked his right to silence during his interrogation at the federal building when he said to agent torikai i do want to talk about the accident.but as the district court explained,once torikai responded by reminding shi of the waiver form the fact that shi had the right to stop talking at any time,shi continued to respond to questions.
we conclude that shi comment would not have caused a reasonable officer in the circumstances to understand anything more than that shi might have been invoking his right to remain silent.see arnold,at.accordingly,agent torikai was not required to terminate the interrogation.
finally,we consider shi claim that his confession was involuntary.a confession is involuntary if coerced either by physical intimidation or psychological pressure.united states haswood,cir citation omitted.we consider the totality of the circumstances in engaging in this inquiry.united states gamez,cir citing dickerson united states,d.relevant factors include the time
