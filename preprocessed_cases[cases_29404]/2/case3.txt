this case involves rulings of some significance to seamen and their employers in this circuit,as well as for summary judgment practice.jamie rogers,a seaman,was injured on october,on the vessel hedy brenna.admiralty law entitles seamen who become injured during the course of their service at sea to recover maintenance and cure payments from their employers.block island fishing,is the owner and operator of the fishing vessel.having made some maintenance and cure payments to rogers and believing it had overpaid,block island brought this suit against rogers to dispute the duration and amount of maintenance and cure payments that it owed.
block island then moved for summary judgment on the ground that its maintenance and cure duties terminated on july.it supported its motion with record evidence showing that rogers had returned to work as a commercial fisherman on another fishing vessel in july.
the district court rejected july as the proper date of termination.but it went beyond the issue raised by block island summary judgment motion and found november,as the date on which block island obligations ended.that was the date on which a doctor,but not rogers primary care physician,found that rogers no longer needed care.
the district court also noted that injured seamen are generally entitled to maintenance and cure payments only in the amount of their actual living expenses,but it reserved for a jury to determine the exact sum that block island owed rogers,along with other issues not resolved at the summary judgment stage.relatedly,the district court held on summary judgment that block island had overpaid rogers by calculating its maintenance and cure payments using figures that overestimated rogers actual living expenses.it further ruled that block island could offset the sum of overpayment against any damages award that rogers might win at trial.we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
as to the exact date on which block island maintenance and cure obligations ended,the district court erred by sua sponte replacing block island proposed date july with its own november without giving rogers sufficient notice or opportunity to make his case against the new date.a summary judgment order is premature where the nonmoving party lacked notice and a reasonable time to respond to the grounds on which that motion would be granted.fed.civ.f.
we agree with the district court implicit recognition that injured seamen like rogers can generally recover only reasonable expenses through maintenance and cure payments,and that it will be the factually exceptional case where the seaman actual expenses are not reasonable.whether this case presents such exceptional circumstances is an issue for the jury.finally,as a matter of first impression,we adopt the ruling of the fifth circuit in boudreaux transocean deepwater,cir,and hold that block island may offset any overpayment against rogers potential damages award,but may not sue for the sum in an independent action.see id.at.
because our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo,we,like the district court,are obliged to review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and to draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party favor.leblanc great am.ins,cir.although there are numerous dates at issue,the core of the dispute involves when block island maintenance and cure obligations terminated,and the amount,if any,of the maintenance and cure owed.block island takes the position that it overpaid rogers based on an inflated rent amount that it believed rogers to be paying when,in fact,rogers had found less expensive housing.rogers takes the position that special circumstances dictate that actual expenses are not the appropriate measure here.
rogers injury and his various residences from to 
in august,rogers and his family moved into a home in bristol,rhode island.he paid the first month rent of,which included utilities,but he can not remember paying rent in subsequent months.in september,rogers joined the crew of the hedy brenna,a commercial fishing vessel owned and operated by block island.for a fishing trip in which he participated that month,rogers was paid in his catch share for the trip.
on october,during another fishing voyage,rogers fell off the top bunk while sleeping and injured himself.three days later,upon returning from the voyage,rogers was diagnosed with a fractured rib and received medical treatment.in october,block island paid rogers in catch share from the october voyage and in maintenance.on november,block island supplemented that amount with an additional in maintenance and in lost wages.the total sum paid from block island to rogers over this period equaled.
in november,rogers and his family were evicted from the bristol apartment and moved to a less expensive apartment in fall river,massachusetts.he paid in monthly rent,excluding utilities,for the new fall river apartment.on november,rogers treating physician,christian campos,gave him a fit for duty slip and cleared him to return to work as a fisherman without restrictions.
rogers health worsened in december,however,when he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was hospitalized for three weeks.rogers attributes the pneumonia to his rib injury.block island learned about rogers condition and hospitalization on december.
on february,campos reported that rogers condition was improving and that rogers could increase his level of physical activity as tolerated without restrictions while staying on pain medication.on march,campos completed another examination and once again advised rogers to continue to increase his level of physical activity as tolerated without restrictions.
in march,rogers moved to sparta,tennessee,where he lived with his brother.rogers paid his brother per month as rent.finally,in may or june,rogers purchased a boat for and lived on that boat before returning to fall river in june.
on june,rogers primary care physician,melanie cardoza,examined rogers for pain in his lower back and left leg.during this examination,rogers told the doctor that he had returned from a fishing trip the previous day and that he was planning to embark on another fishing trip the next day.the conversation demonstrated that rogers had been working as a fisherman in june.cardoza examination of rogers chest and lungs revealed normal excursion with symmetric chest walls and quiet,even and easy respiratory effort with no use of accessory muscles.
by july,rogers was working on,and was physically fit to captain,another fishing vessel,the kelly ann.but campos examined rogers in august and provided him with a letter stating that he was not yet fit to return to work as a commercial fisherman.
on november,campos examined rogers again and found that his condition had improved to the point that no further formal was necessary.at oral argument,rogers counsel clarified that although campos had discharged rogers from his care on november,he had transferr ed all care to his primary care physician,cardoza,who was also treating rogers for his illness and injury.
communications between parties regarding maintenance and cure 
in january,after learning about rogers pneumonia and hospitalization the previous month as recounted above,block island hired neil stoddard of marine safety consultants to investigate rogers demand for maintenance and cure.from that point,almost a year of correspondence ensued between stoddard and danny alberto,a paralegal employed by rogers counsel,regarding the rate of maintenance and cure owed to rogers.
in a letter dated january,stoddard requested medical records from rogers counsel to support rogers claim of ongoing medical treatment.on january,alberto responded to stoddard letter and requested that block island pay rogers per day in maintenance and cure.alberto cited the following as rogers monthly expenses for rent,for gas,for electricity,and for food,based on the department of agriculture moderate cost plan for a person of rogers age living in a family home.
upon stoddard objection that alberto had provided only cash receipts with nothing on them to identify them as a rent payment,alberto mailed stoddard a copy of the bristol lease on march.rogers had vacated the bristol home in november.this lease indicated that the monthly rent included utilities.when stoddard discovered that rogers had moved to the fall river apartment,and he further objected to the daily rate demanded by alberto,alberto responded that he had provided all of rogers living expenses and all of his medical records and warned that he would pursue punitive damages on rogers behalf if block island did not begin making the requested maintenance and cure payments.at some point during this exchange,alberto also provided stoddard with two utility invoices that reflected two different addresses in fall river.
in late june,block island paid in cure to rogers health care providers.then,on july,block island sent rogers a maintenance check for based on a daily rate of covering the period from october to april,the date of his last treatment record received.the rate was calculated based on rogers monthly rent for his bristol home and per month in food.as the bristol lease reflected that utilities were included,block island did not account for electricity and gas bills in calculating the maintenance and cure rate.
on july,alberto sent stoddard a copy of rogers fall river lease,which reflected a monthly rent of excluding utilities.rogers had vacated this apartment in march.after another threat from alberto that he would seek punitive damages if block island did not provide additional maintenance of per day,block island sent rogers a second check for,based on a daily rate of.
on november,block island filed a complaint against rogers in the district court for the district of massachusetts.block island sought a declaratory judgment on the amount of retroactive maintenance owed to rogers count i,on whether it had any continuing obligation to pay maintenance and cure,and on whether it was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments resulting from rogers failure to provide accurate and timely information about his living expenses and medical treatment count ii.on march,rogers filed a counterclaim alleging negligence under the jones act,count i,unseaworthiness count ii,continuing maintenance and cure count iii,negligent or intentional failure to provide maintenance and cure count iv,and lost wages count v.
block island moved for summary judgment on its counts for declaratory judgment,and on counts iii and iv of rogers counterclaim.block island also sought,the amount by which it had allegedly overpaid rogers.
the district court granted in part and denied in part block island motion.first,as to its demand for reimbursement for its overpayment,the district court agreed with block island premise that it had overpaid rogers because his actual expenses were lower than what block island believed them to be the undisputed evidence is that rogers vacated the bristol apartment with monthly rent in november of,and that his monthly rent since leaving bristol has not exceeded.it is also undisputed that in calculating the daily maintenance due,block island relied on the monthly rent figure and that an overpayment resulted.nonetheless,the court relied on the fifth circuit opinion in boudreaux to rule that,despite the overpayment,block island could not seek affirmative recovery of maintenance and cure payments that it had already made.see at.but the court did allow block island to offset the sum of overpayment,to be determined by a jury,against any damages award that rogers might win at trial.
the district court then denied block island summary judgment motion as to count iv of rogers counterclaim,which alleged that block island negligently or intentionally failed to promptly provide maintenance and cure prior to november.a s with most issues of negligence,the court explained,the issue of the provision of prompt and proper maintenance and cure is a matter for the jury.
with regard to block island summary judgment request for declaratory relief establishing a specific date upon which its maintenance and cure obligations to rogers came to an end,the district court rejected block island proposed date of july,but sua sponte supplied its own date of november,to ultimately grant summary judgment in block island favor.the court noted that o n this issue,the relevant question before the court is not whether rogers returned to work as a fisherman which could be explained by necessity as well as by cure.accordingly,although rogers had been working on the kelly ann in july,that fact was not dispositive of whether rogers had reached the point of maximum medical recovery,as block island had argued.
the district court then turned to november,the date on which campos had found that rogers health had so improved that he required no more visits as the date on which rogers had reached maximum medical recovery and thus was no longer entitled to maintenance and cure.the court observed that while rogers protested that he continued to have trouble breathing and to experience pain at the site of his injury,rogers offer ed no medical evidence that contradict ed his own doctor evaluation that he had achieved the maximum feasible recovery as of november.on that basis,the court granted block island summary judgment motion as to count iii continuing maintenance and cure of rogers counterclaims.
the court lastly denied block island request for attorney fees.

district court duty to give notice before entering summary judgment on grounds not stated in the motion 
rogers primary argument on appeal is that the district court erroneously entered summary judgment on a ground that block island had never briefed,argued,or raised,thus depriving rogers of due notice or opportunity to contest that ground.we agree.
under federal rule of civil procedure f,a district court may grant a summary judgment motion on grounds not raised by the moving party,but may do so only a fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond to the opposing party.fed.civ.f.our circuit has established two criteria that a district court must meet before entering summary judgment sua sponte first,discovery must be sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.berkovitz home box office,cir.citations omitted.rogers does not claim that he did not have a reasonable opportunity for discovery.
second,the district court must first give the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.id.notice,in this context,has two aspects the summary judgment target is entitled to know both the grounds that the district court will consider and the point at which her obligation to bring forth evidence supporting the elements of her claim accrues.rogan menino,cir.citing berkovitz,at.
here,block island sought summary judgment explicitly and only on the ground that its maintenance and cure obligations terminated on july,because rogers had resumed his job as a commercial fisherman by that point.according to block island,rogers return to work signaled that it need not make further payments because m aintenance and cure is designed to provide a seaman with food and lodging when he becomes sick or injured in the ship service and it extends during the period when he is incapacitated to do a seaman work and continues until he reaches maximum medical recovery.vaughn atkinson.
while the district court rejected the july,date and the theory,it independently,and without notice to rogers,determined that november,should be the date on which block island maintenance and cure obligations ended,based on a theory of maximum medical recovery.november is the date on which campos advised that rogers no longer required care from him.
as a threshold matter,the district court correctly noted the law that a fishing vessel must continue to make maintenance and cure payments until the point of maximum medical recovery that is,the point at wh
