intervenor marine salvage services,marine salvage,which asserted a lien for marine necessaries against the the cabot,appeals from the district court ruling that the united states of america the government has a salvage lien against the same ship,priming marine salvage lien.we hold that the government can not assert a salvage claim in the circumstances of this case,and therefore reverse and remand.
facts and proceedings 
the cabot was the last remaining light aircraft carrier cvl that saw service in the pacific theater during world war ii.after the war,the navy used the cabot for training,decommissioned her,mothballed her,and first lent and then sold her to spain,which renamed her the dedalo.in,the cabot dedalo museum foundation,the foundation,a corporation,acquired the cabot and moved her to new orleans,with a view to establishing an museum and docking her permanently in kenner,louisiana.the foundation removed the cabot screws,winterized her engines,and stripped the ship of most of her operational equipment.
by,the foundation had moored the unmanned cabot on the east bank of the mississippi in new orleans,at the press street wharf the wharf,which is owned by the board of commissioners of the port of new orleans the dock board,a state agency.after the mayor of kenner withdrew the offer of a mooring site for the cabot museum,the dock board requested that the foundation either move the ship from the wharf or begin to pay dockage fees,which the dock board had previously waived.in march,the dock board sued to evict the cabot from the wharf.as of april,however,the cabot was still moored at the wharf.
in that month,captain marsh of the united states coast guard,the captain of the port of new orleans,wrote to inform the foundation that the dilapidated condition of the wharf and the unsatisfactory condition of the vessel moorings pose an immediate threat to the safety of the port,given the approach of hurricane season.exercising his authority under chapter to ensure the safety of the port,captain marsh ordered the foundation to move the cabot to a safer berth by the first of june.
the foundation did nothing,so captain marsh wrote again,this time stating that he plan ned to pursue a civil penalty against the foundation and that the coast guard would thereafter conduct all response activities under c a provision of the federal water pollution control act fwpca including stabilization,threat abatement,and oil and hazardous material removal.captain marsh added that the coast guard would invoice the foundation for expenses incurred in these activities,whereupon the foundation filed for protection in bankruptcy.in july,captain marsh informed the foundation that the coast guard had removed chemical drums and some oil from the cabot and had upgraded her mooring at the wharf by installing hurricane moorings.he ordered the foundation to continue monitoring the cabot moor.
almost a year later,as the bulk carrier tomis future was steaming downriver,her pilot brought her too close to the east bank,and she with the cabot,substantially damaging both the cabot and the wharf.the owner of the tomis future called out emergency response tugs to berth that vessel and to secure the cabot against the wharf.after commander daniel whiting,the coast guard chief of port operations,inspected the damage,the coast guard again became concerned for the safety of the cabot moor,particularly because the mississippi was running high.three days after the allision,captain marsh issued another order under chapter,requiring the foundation to hire a tug to stand by the cabot and,within three days,to move the cabot to a safe hurricane mooring site or a robust hurricane mooring location.the next day,the owner of the tomis future took his tugs off hire and his vessel departed the port without posting adequate security.
the foundation did not call out a tug of its own,so captain marsh immediately notified the foundation that the coast guard assumed responsibility for providing the assist tug to properly maintain the safety of the vessel.he also wrote that the coast guard did so in accordance with c and that it would seek reimbursement under f,both referenced subsections being provisions of the fwpca.under this authority,the coast guard hired tugs to stand by the cabot for seven weeks,at the end of which captain marsh again wrote to the foundation,advising that the coast guard had completed preparations to move the vessel to a safe hurricane mooring under the authority of c.the coast guard then shifted the cabot from the wharf to violet,louisiana,some forty miles downstream.this move including the seven weeks tug service,at about per day,and repairs to the moor cost the coast guard and the national pollution funds.
in october of that year,the cabot made a move from violet to port isabel,texas.at approximately the same time,the foundation sold the cabot.under contract with the new owner,marine salvage provided wharfage and security services to the ship in port isabel.later,when the cabot began to list in her berth,marine salvage acted to prevent her from capsizing,at a cost of.
the following year,marine salvage and others sued the cabot in rem in the southern district of texas.several months later,the government sued the cabot,also in rem.the cabot was arrested both times,but was released when those suits were dismissed.
the government again sued the cabot in,and the district court for the southern district of texas arrested the cabot for a third time.other claimants intervened,including the dock board,which sought in rem enforcement of an in personam judgment against the foundation rendered by the district court for the eastern district of louisiana and marine salvage,which sought to recover on both a salvage lien and a lien for necessaries.the district court in texas authorized the marshal to auction the cabot.at the marshal sale,a shipwrecker bid and subsequently paid for the cabot,about half of which was paid to its substitute custodian and to the marshals service,leaving plus interest to be distributed to other claimants.the government,marine salvage,and the dock board asserted lien claims to the funds that remained in the registry of the district court.following a trial to determine the priority and amounts of the liens,the district court held that marine salvage had a valid salvage lien of with priority over a valid salvage lien of the government,which in turn was entitled to the balance of that would remain in the court registry after paying marine salvage.as the government salvage lien exhausted the deposited funds,the district court did not evaluate the merits or priorities of the lien for necessaries asserted by marine salvage or the lien for necessaries asserted by the dock board.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
marine salvage contends that the coast guard can not make a salvage claim for the actions it took under the authority of the district court clearly erred in finding marine peril to the cabot and the district court abused its discretion in calculating a salvage award based on the coast guard costs,which marine salvage contends were unreasonable.as we agree with marine salvage first contention,we do not reach the issues of marine peril or award calculation.
standard of review in salvage cases 
in appeals of admiralty cases,as in most other cases,we review a district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo a factual finding is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court based on all of the evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.as the supreme court has stated,however,w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.assessing the credibility of witnesses is a task exclusively for the trier of fact 
the doctrine of salvage is settled.a successful salvage claim requires three proofs marine peril voluntary service rendered when not required as an existing duty or from a special contract and success in whole or in part,or contribution to the success of the operation.the instant case turns on the voluntariness prong,which is ordinarily an issue of fact here,however,the question of voluntariness is also presented,in two ways,as an issue of law.first,the district court analysis of the voluntariness question was grounded in a precedent of ours,and to that extent was a legal analysis.we review de novo a district court interpretation of our cases.second,the trial court voluntariness determination also turned on identifying and interpreting the provisions of law under which the coast guard acted and statutory interpretation too is a question of law that we review de novo 
b.the district court legal analysis 
the district court analyzed the coast guard claim as follows notes in original 
the services rendered to salve a vessel can not be performed pursuant to a preexisting duty or contract.in other words,an individual efforts to protect a vessel from peril must be voluntary.see the sabine.actions taken pursuant to a duty owed to a third party are voluntary.hence,when the coast guard salves a vessel,its actions are generally voluntary because its statutory mandate exists to protect the public,not the vessel or its owner.see in re american oil,cir in addition,the fifth circuit indicated in dicta in in re american oil that the coast guard has discretion whether to act and therefore its services are rendered voluntarily id.at.a later district court case adopted this statement and held that the coast guard can be reimbursed for its salvage efforts.see dfds seacruises bahamas united states,characterizing the rule that coast guard rescue services are voluntary as 
like marine salvage,the united states has a valid salvage lien.it acted to avert a real risk to the cabot after the tomis future collided with the vessel in new orleans.if the coast guard had not repaired the press street wharf and positioned tugboats alongside the cabot,there was a significant possibility that the cabot would have broken free on the mississippi r iver and been destroyed or severely damaged.the coast guard acted voluntarily because the owner of the vessel,at that time the cabot dedalo museum foundation,stood by and refused to act in an emergency situation,and the coast guard had no legal duty to act.
c.in re american oil 
the district court appears to have concluded,and the government contends vigorously on appeal,that in american oil,we departed from the traditional rule that because the coast guard acts out of a duty,its actions are not voluntary,and it therefore can not bring a salvage claim a brief analysis of american oil shows that this view of our precedent is incorrect.
in american oil,a tanker moored dockside in the houston ship channel and laden with six million gallons of gasoline and heating oil caught fire and was in danger of exploding firefighters from houston,eighteen other cities and towns,and three coast guard stations battled the blaze from midnight into the next morning,when they ran out of the kind of foam required to fight petrochemical fires the coast guard was forced to buy more foam from remotely located commercial sources and have it flown to houston on air force and navy planes in thus assisting the coast guard,the air force and navy incurred expenses totaling the government presented,and the district court approved,a salvage claim in that amount,which did not include any charges for the direct costs incurred by the coast guard we upheld the award,noting both that congress had expressly authorized the air force and the navy to make salvage and that local firefighting units,rather than the coast guard,bore the primary legal responsibility for fighting dockside fires therefore,we reasoned,the government could recover the expenses for salvage services rendered by the air force and the navy to the coast guard in aid of its providing assistance to the vessel 
our american oil opinion went further than was required to decide that case,however.we concluded from the relevant statutory language which we regarded as permissive and not mandatory that the coast guard had discretion whether to aid persons and save property in peril.possibly inadvertently,we then opened the door to the coast guard future assertion of salvage claims 
t he national government has apparently concluded as a matter of policy to make a salvage claim for services rendered by the coast guard to the extent,and only to the extent,that the coast guard used the services and supplies of the air force and navy.this does not mean that the coast guard has no right to salvage for its own services and supplies.the duty bar to salvage by the coast guard has not been sustained by the courts 
this passage,clearly dictum,has had a mixed reception among courts and commentators.some including the district court in this correctly recognized that our american oil discussion of the coast guard entitlement to assert a salvage claim was dictum other inexplicably,given the reasoning and facts of american viewed it as a holding furthermore,the old rule against salvage recovery for the coast guard still finds considerable support among authors of admiralty treatises,who urge that the coast guard ought not usually be permitted to assert a salvage claim for present purposes it suffices that american oil discussion of the coast guard ability to bring salvage claims was dictum and therefore provides no jurisprudential support for the district court holding on this issue.whether,as a general proposition,the coast guard may bring a salvage claim remains an open question in this circuit we need not address it here and therefore reserve it for a later day.
statutory developments fwpca 
in opposition to this dictum,argues marine salvage,stands positive law.as a general rule,admiralty law applies only in the absence of relevant federal statutory law thus,even if here we were to assume without granting that in other circumstances the coast guard could assert a salvage claim,this case requires only that we address how that putative right fares in the face of statutory provisions enacted since american oil was decided for it was pursuant to these oil of the the coast guard asserted it was acting to secure the cabot.examination of those fwpca provisions reveals that they expressly require the coast guard to abate threats of oil pollution.for the district court to conclude that the coast guard had no duty to act in this case was therefore legal error.
the fwpca declares a national policy that there should be no discharges of oil or hazardous substances into or upon the navigable waters of the united states.to effect this policy,says the statute,the president shall prepare and publish a national contingency plan ncp for removal of oil.the fwpca mandates that the ncp shall provide for efficient,coordinated,and effective action to minimize damage from oil and hazardous substance discharges and shall include 
c establishment or designation of coast guard strike teams,consisting of 
i personnel who shall be trained,prepared and available to carry out the national contingency plan 
ii adequate pollution control equipment and material and 
iii a detailed oil and hazardous substance pollution and sic prevention plan 
a ctions to minimize damage from oil and hazardous substance discharges shall be in accordance with the ncp the secretary of transportation shall establish in each coast guard district a coast guard district response group,which shall consist of the coast guard personnel and equipment of each port within the district.the fwpca further mandates that the ncp shall designate the federal official who shall be the federal coordinator for each port or harbor area.the mandatory shall is ubiquitous in the fwpca.
these and other of the fwpca make abundantly clear that the coast guard duty to respond to a threatened oil spill is mandatory,not optional.many of these mandatory provisions were enacted in,in the wake of the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska,and embody a congressional policy that the coast guard must respond swiftly and effectively to threatened oil spills.the coast guard therefore can not forthrightly analogize its plan and mission to its plan and mission,which we determined in american oil to be pe
