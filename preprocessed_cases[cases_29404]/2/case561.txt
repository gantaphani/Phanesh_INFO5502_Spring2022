this is an appeal from the denial of a motion to suppress evidence under penal code section.defendant asserts that the search of his stateroom on a cruise ship by a customs officer,after the ship docked in long beach at the conclusion of a foreign cruise,was conducted without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and therefore violated the fourth amendment.the people assert the search was a routine border search for which reasonable suspicion is not required.we agree with the people and affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
defendant mark stevens laborde pled guilty to a charge of possession of a controlled substance methamphetamine and was sentenced to three years formal probation.the methamphetamine was found during a search of a stateroom on a carnival cruise line vessel shared by laborde and his girlfriend.the ship had just docked in long beach on its return from a cruise to mexico.
crew and passenger lists are provided in ordinary course to customs by the cruise line.analysis of the passenger list provided by carnival showed laborde previously had been arrested on narcotics and drug paraphernalia charges,so customs officers decided to conduct a search of laborde cabin.at approximately,the officers proceeded to laborde stateroom.the officers knocked and laborde girlfriend answered.she was informed the officers were going to do a cabin exam.laborde was still asleep when the officers entered the cabin.his girlfriend awakened him and the officers identified themselves again.after laborde arose,dressed,and denied having anything illegal in the cabin,officer eric clark conducted a search while laborde and his girlfriend waited in the hallway with another officer.in a yellow backpack,clark discovered a glass container with a crystal substance,later found to be methamphetamine.clark also found a glass pipe on the bed stand.laborde admitted the backpack was his,and was taken into custody and turned over to the long beach police department.
the trial court denied laborde motion to suppress the evidence found during the search of his stateroom.the court observed the search was a border search that could be conducted without reasonable suspicion.laborde pled guilty,reserving his right to appeal the denial of the suppression motion.the plea was accepted,imposition of sentence was suspended,and laborde was placed on formal probation for three years under proposition.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
the first port where a vessel docks on arrival from a foreign country is the functional equivalent of an international border,so that the search of laborde cabin was a border search for fourth amendment purposes.routine searches of the persons and effects of entrants are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion,probable cause or warrant united states montoya de hernandez,d montoya de hernandez.in united states,d,the high court explained 
the government interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border.time and again,we have stated that searches made at the border,pursuant to the longstanding right of the sovereign to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this country,are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border.citation.congress,since the beginning of our government,has granted the executive plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border,without probable cause or a warrant,in order to regulate the collection of duties and to prevent the introduction of contraband into this country.citation,supra,at.
nonroutine border searches,however,are another matter.the high court has not opined on what level of suspicion,if any,is required for nonroutine border searches such as strip,or involuntary searches.montoya de hernandez,supra,at,fn.see,supra,at.the high court has held,however,that the detention of a traveler at the border,beyond the scope of a routine customs search and inspection,was justified when there was reasonable suspicion that the traveler was smuggling contraband in her alimentary canal.montoya de hernandez,supra,at.and many federal courts since montoya de hernandez have held that nonroutine border searches require reasonable suspicion see,cir,detention of traveler beyond the scope of a routine search and inspection requires reasonable suspicion removal of shoes was well within scope of a routine border search cardenas cir,fn.lower courts have generally classified routine searches as those which do not seriously invade a traveler privacy reasonable suspicion standard has been applied to nonroutine searches such as examinations and strip searches.
consequently,the current state of the law is that there are two categories of border searches routine searches that require no suspicion at all and nonroutine searches that require reasonable suspicion.border searches found to be routine,requiring no suspicion,include vehicle searches entailing the removal,dismantling and reassembling of the vehicle fuel tank,supra,at,and patdown searches.see,bradley,supra,at patdown,done over clothing and including pushing on breasts and external genitalia,was not so intrusive as to be transformed into a nonroutine border search customs officials are permitted as a matter of standard procedure to feel over clothing for bulges in an area known by them as a common place for hiding contraband.
no controlling authority exists on the question presented by this case whether the search of a passenger cabin of a cruise ship at a customs border is sufficiently intrusive to require reasonable suspicion.united states cir,wl.lexis.courts presented with the issue have declined to adopt a generally applicable rule,instead relying on the facts of the particular case to decide whether there was reasonable suspicion,thereby obviating the need to address the issue ibid.a few cases have proffered thoughts on the point,but without any extended analysis.thus 
in smith cir,the trial court had found that a search of a passenger cabin is not routine given the intrusive nature of the search,and that customs inspectors lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.id.at.on review,however,the court of appeals observed that w hile it may well be the case that applying a reasonable suspicion standard to the search of the smiths cabin at the functional equivalent of a border is plain error,it did not have to decide that issue because reasonable suspicion existed to justify the search.ibid.
in state of louisiana logo so d,the louisiana court of appeal held that customs agents,while having authority to conduct a border search of the vessel without reasonable suspicion,required more than naked suspicion to search a passenger cabin.id.at.the court did not discuss or cite any authority for the point,and went on to find the customs agents had reasonable suspicion to search the cabin.ibid.
in rasheed i,the court found,as an alternative holding and without analysis,that the coast guard search of defendants personal living quarters on a vessel which was boarded in international waters and found to be carrying tons of hashish was justified as a border search,which need not be supported by a warrant or reasonable suspicion.ibid.
in united states alfonso cir alfonso,the court observed 
obviously,a search of the private living quarters of a ship is more intrusive than a search of other areas.citations.the private living quarters are at least analogous to a private dwelling.as a result,even in the context of a border search,the search of private living quarters on a ship should require something more than naked suspicion.alfonso,supra,at.
we conclude from the available precedents that the search of a passenger cabin of a cruise ship at a customs border is a routine border search,requiring no suspicion of criminal activity.we note at the outset the point stated in,with respect to vehicle searches at the border 
t he reasons that might support a requirement of some level of suspicion in the case of highly intrusive searches of the and privacy interests of the person being do not carry over to vehicles.complex balancing tests to
