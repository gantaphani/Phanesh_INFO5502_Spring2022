bruce christensen appeals the district court order granting appellees summary judgment motions.christensen is a longshoreman who was injured while helping to retie a ship that had broken free from the dock.christensen filed negligence claims against the ship,a second ship that had been tied to the same cleat on the dock,and the dock owner.the district court held that,as a matter of law,the injury was not a foreseeable result of appellees acts.we reverse.genuine issues of material fact exist as to breach of duty and proximate cause that must be resolved at trial.
bruce christensen worked as a longshoreman,or stevedore,in coos bay,oregon,when the incident from which this case arises occurred.on april,asian hawk,a ship owned by appellee southern route maritime,docked at the glenbrook dock in coos bay.the ship was longer than the dock,so it tied its stern lines to a cleat on the adjoining dock owned by appellee.asian hawk hired,including christensen,through a local stevedoring company to unload its cargo of nickel ore.when the ship arrived,it received weather reports alerting it to a forecast of high winds.two days later,western condor,a ship owned by appellee anglia maritime,arrived at the dock and tied two mooring lines to the same cleat to which asian hawk was tied.
on april,during a rainstorm with high wind gusts,the cleat holding the mooring lines of the two ships detached from the dock.christensen was sitting in his truck on his dinner break when the ship broke away from the dock and started drifting into coos bay.he went down to the dock,responding to yells for help from the ship crew.he and another longshoreman helped tie one small line,and then several other longshoremen arrived to help with the larger second line.the men lined up in a row to pull the ship line across the dock to another cleat.christensen injured his back while pulling on the line.
christensen filed a negligence claim in state court against southern route maritime for not monitoring its mooring lines and for allowing western condor to tie to the same cleat,and against for allowing two ships to tie to the same cleat and for not properly constructing its dock.immediately removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity and federal question jurisdiction christensen later amended his complaint to include anglia maritime,claiming that the ship was negligent when it tied to the same cleat as asian hawk.
the district court granted southern route maritime motion for summary judgment.the court held that southern route maritime owed no duty to christensen.alternatively,it held that even if a duty existed,southern route maritime negligent act did not proximately cause christensen injury.after this ruling,christensen moved for reconsideration of the court order,and the other two defendants moved for summary judgment.the court granted the motion to reconsider but did not change its decision.it also granted summary judgment in favor of anglia maritime and,holding that their acts were also not proximate causes of christensen injury.christensen appeals those decisions.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law 
southern route maritime duty of care 
the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca governs christensen claim against southern route maritime.that act allows a longshoreman who is injured during the course of his employment to be compensated by his employer,the local stevedoring company the act also allows the longshoreman to bring an action against the owner of a vessel if that vessel negligence caused the injury the act covers any person engaged in maritime employment 
while christensen can sue a vessel for negligence under the lhwca,the supreme court has limited the duties that a vessel owner owes to the stevedores working for him or her under scindia steam navigation de los santos a vessel owes three duties to its stevedores the turnover duty,the active control duty,and the intervention duty the turnover duty is not at issue in this case the active control duty requires the vessel owner to act reasonably if it actively participates in the cargo operations,and to avoid exposing the stevedores to harm from hazards they may encounter in areas,or from equipment,under the active control of the ship the intervention duty requires the vessel owner to take some action if an unreasonably dangerous condition arises during the stevedoring operation that the vessel owner discovers and the stevedores could not be expected to remedy we hold that southern route maritime did owe a duty to christensen under the active control duty and the intervention duty.
christensen presented evidence that it was the custom of the maritime industry,and the practice of the asian hawk,to have the ship crew assess the mooring conditions and loosen the lines as conditions changed in some cases,custom may be enough to establish a duty in this case,not only was it the custom of the maritime industry to have the ship crew monitor the lines,but the asian hawk followed this practice.thus,even after southern route maritime turned over the ship to the stevedore company,it still retained the responsibility of checking and adjusting the mooring lines.that job never became the responsibility of the stevedores.for that reason,the lines constituted equipment under the active control of the ship.therefore,under the custom of the industry and the practice of the asian hawk,southern route maritime had a duty to exercise due care to avoid exposing the stevedores to hazards created by the mooring lines.
alternatively,southern route maritime had a duty to intervene when the weather and decreased weight of the ship created a strain on the lines.the crew of the vessel should have known there was a great strain on the lines,creating a dangerous situation,because it was responsible for monitoring the lines.the stevedores could not reasonably be expected to remedy the situation when they had no duty to inspect the lines and therefore no knowledge of the condition of the lines nor any control over the mooring of the ship.therefore,southern route maritime had a duty to intervene when the increasing strain on the lines created a dangerous situation.
our conclusion concerning southern route maritime duty accords with a decision of the first circuit.in england reinauer transportation the first circuit held that the vessel owed a duty to a longshoreman regarding the ship mooring lines the court noted that the custom in the port of boston was to have the ship crew inspect and adjust the mooring lines before and during loading operations.it held that because of this custom,the ship had a duty to intervene when the lines became tight the court also held that the ship had an active control duty over the lines because there was evidence showing that the ship retained operational control over the lines and thus had a duty to inspect and adjust them this reasoning is valid,and we choose to follow it here.
summary judgment is rarely granted in negligence cases because the issue of w hether the defendant acted reasonably is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact.that is the case here.there is a dispute of fact regarding whether southern route maritime acted unreasonably by allowing the western condor to tie to the same cleat and whether the ship crew actively monitored and adjusted the lines during the unloading process therefore,the issue of whether southern route maritime breached its duty of care can not be decided on summary judgment.we reverse and remand.
anglia maritime and duty of care 
the duty of care that anglia maritime owed to christensen differs from that owed by southern route maritime.anglia maritime owns a vessel which allegedly contributed to the cause of christensen injury.although the lhwca allows christensen to sue anglia maritime for negligence the scindia duties do not apply to anglia maritime because chri
