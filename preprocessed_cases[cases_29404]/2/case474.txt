factual and procedural background 
petitioner is a registered longshoreman.he injured his lower back while at work on october.although in pain,he returned to work the following day.a few days later he made an appointment to see his family physician,mcrae.on november,mcrae diagnosed petitioner as having a muscular ligamentous strain and cleared him for continued work.petitioner returned to the doctor on november,complaining that he was still in pain.mcrae recommended physical therapy and told petitioner to take a week off from work.following this week of rest,however,petitioner was unable to return to his job as a longshoreman.
upon examination of petitioner test results,mcrae noted a slightly abnormal mri and referred petitioner to delashaw,a neurosurgeon.delashaw examined petitioner on december,prescribed various medications,and recommended one week of bed rest.at a visit on january,delashaw noted marked improvement but ordered a test to investigate the cause of petitioner continued pain.the procedure revealed mild to moderate annular bulge and moderate degenerative disc disease.delashaw referred petitioner to another neurosurgeon,frank,to evaluate the need for surgery.frank determined that surgery was unnecessary and,on february,delashaw opined that petitioner would very likely be able to return to work with continued physical therapy.petitioner did so on april.
while lifting plywood at work on april,petitioner his back.on april,this injury caused him to cease working for a second time.delashaw performed additional tests but remained unable to explain petitioner complaints of back and leg pain.after some rest and additional physical therapy,petitioner returned to work on july.
for nearly three years,petitioner was able to manage sporadic of back pain through occasional appointments with a chiropractor,finkas.however,on march,petitioner visited delashaw again,complaining of a somewhat more severe recurrence of back pain.delashaw determined that petitioner had suffered no additional injury.instead,he noted that petitioner was moderately obese and recommended that he stay physically active and lose weight.
on april,finkas wrote a report stating that petitioner responded favorably to chiropractic treatment when he suffered of back pain.however,he opined that petitioner back condition was exacerbated by type work.it is my understanding that several of his jobs at work linesman,lasher and raftsman require this type of manual labor.petitioner would not be suited for that type of work.
petitioner employer paid him temporary disability benefits for the two periods when he was not working november,to april,and april,to july.the current dispute began when petitioner applied for permanent partial disability benefits.
after a hearing,the alj held that petitioner was entitled to per week,because he had not experienced a loss of earning capacity.the board affirmed,and petitioner filed this timely petition for review.
discussion 
the act authorizes compensation not for physical injury as such,but for economic harm to the injured worker from decreased ability to earn wages.metro.stevedore rambo,d.injured employees receive compensation for permanent partial disabilities based on a percentage of the difference between their average weekly wages and their capacity.c see also sproull,owcp,cir.
the alj found that petitioner was not entitled to benefits because his capacity exceeded his average weekly wage.the alj awarded petitioner per week after finding that there is a significant possibility that he may,in the future,experience a loss of wage earning capacity as a result of this injury and that,if such a loss occurred,the award could then be modified upward.the supreme court has mandated de minimis awards in those circumstances.rambo,at.
petitioner argues that the alj incorrectly calculated both his average weekly wage and his capacity and,therefore,that the board erred in accepting the alj award of per week.for the following reasons,we are not persuaded by petitioner arguments.
average weekly wage 
the act provides that a claimant average weekly wage is to be determined by examining the weeks immediately before the time of the injury.although the act defines time of injury for occupational diseases it does not do so for accidental injuries like the one sustained by petitioner.port of portland,owcp,cir,cert.denied,d.
in this case,the alj determined that the time of injury was october,the day on which petitioner hurt his back.petitioner contends that,under johnson director,owcp,cir,the time of injury was november,the date on which he claims he became aware of his disability.because of a quirk in petitioner vacation time,that difference would make his average weekly wage higher.
in johnson,the claimant disability,although due to a traumatic episode,was not evident until more than three years later.johnson,at.the court observed that,i n most cases of traumatic injury,the time of injury will coincide almost exactly with the time the worker is disabled.id.quoting todd shipyards black,cir.however,in an exceptional case,injury under the statute means injury as of the time when the disability attributable to the injury becomes manifest.id.
petitioner argues that his claim is governed by johnson and that the alj erred when she found the time of injury to be the date of petitioner accident rather than the date when petitioner ceased working.his argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.
first,in johnson,at the time of the traumatic episode,the claimant disabling injury was latent and unknown.at see also port of portland,at.the opposite is true of petitioner injury the alj found that 
the facts of this case show that petitioner was aware of his injury the day it occurred,and was bothered enough by the effects that he made a doctor appointment within the next few days although the appointment did not occur until two weeks later on these facts,i can not conclude that the injury was latent 
emphasis added.those findings are supported by substantial evidence.
second,even if we were to accept petitioner claim that his disability first manifested itself fully on november,this is not the kind of exceptional case envisioned by the court in johnson,where more than three years elapsed between the claimant accident and the onset of disability.see johnson,at problems with the traditional rule may arise in exceptional cases,like the one at bar,where the onset of the disability occurs years after the initial trauma emphasis added.instead,petitioner stopped working only days after his accident.johnson is distinguishable for this reason as well.port of portland,at distinguishing johnson because johnson applied to a case where the disabling symptoms of an earlier accident did not appear for years after the accident emphasis added.
petitioner seems to be arguing for a rule that would make the time of injury the date when the claimant actually stopped working,but there is no support for such a rule either in the act or in johnson.even in the context of occupational diseases,the relevant date is when the claimant is or should be aware of the disability.here,the alj found that the claimant was actually aware of the disability on the date of injury.
for these reasons,we hold that johnson does not assist petitioner.the alj properly calculated his average weekly wage.
