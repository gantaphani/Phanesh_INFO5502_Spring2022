a coast guard administrative law judge found that captain john nitkin committed misconduct by failing to sound the warning whistle by treaty,specifically rule d of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea,colregs,when a collision threatens.the commandant of the coast guard affirmed the alj decision,but the national transportation safety board reversed,finding that the text of rule d rendered the rule inapplicable to the circumstances of nitkin accident.we grant the coast guard petitions for review and remand.
on january,captain nitkin was serving as the pilot of the chelsea when it collided with the manzanillo in the miami harbor channel.the two vessels had initially agreed to pass one another,but as they approached each another,captain fernandez,the pilot of the manzanillo,radioed nitkin and announced his intention to attempt a passing.nitkin radioed fernandez that a passing was not possible and urged him to follow their original agreement by turning to port.but the manzanillo in fact turned to starboard and,despite nitkin efforts to maneuver to safety,the two ships collided about minutes after the manzanillo began its starboard turn.
at the time of the accident nitkin was operating under the authority of a coast guard pilot license.he was tried in a disciplinary proceeding before a coast guard alj for negligence and for violations of colregs rule failure to turn to starboard in a meeting situation,rule e failure to reduce speed or reverse engines,and rule d failure to sound warning signal.the alj dismissed the negligence charge and the rule and e misconduct charges,but found that nitkin committed misconduct by failing to comply with rule d.that rule provides 
when vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and from any cause either vessel fails to understand the intentions or actions of the other,or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision,the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle.
colregs,part d,rule d.
the alj suspended nitkin license for five months,with four months remitted on probation.alj final order at.nitkin appealed to the commandant of the coast guard,raising four primary objections.besides charging that the sanction was excessively harsh,nitkin attacked the finding of a violation,arguing,first,that rule d does apply when the danger of collision develops so late that the warning signal would be useless second,that any duty he had to warn the manzanillo of the collision risk was satisfied by his radio communications with fernandez and third,that his failure to sound the warning signal was excusable under colregs rule b exception for special circumstances which may make a departure from these rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.according to nitkin,special circumstances existed in this case because the warning signal would have prevented communication with crew members at the chelsea bow.
the commandant of the coast guard rejected all these claims and affirmed the alj decision.appeal of nitkin,wl.we need not address the commandant reasoning,because although nitkin raised essentially the same claims in his appeal to the ntsb under,the board reversed on quite different grounds and never reached the issues posed in nitkin appeal to the commandant.
rather,the board july,opinion and order,wl july order,rested on the following interrelated conclusions.first,the board determined as a matter of law that rule d is inapplicable in situations where a pilot is certain that the other vessel conduct makes collision inevitable.the board explained that,because rule d plain text specifies that the warning signal requirement comes into play only when a pilot is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other vessel to avoid collision emphasis added,the rule can not apply where a pilot is certain that sufficient action is not being taken.july order,at quoting colregs rule d.
second,the board made a factual determination that nitkin was certain that the manzanillo was not taking sufficient action to avoid a collision,rather than in doubt of the reverse.according to the board,the alj had found that nitkin was not sure whether his vessel could avoid a collision after the unilateral decision of fernandez to execute a passing,but the board concluded that this finding was unsupported by the record.july order,at.
the coast guard filed a notice of appeal indeed,as we shall see,two and we granted nitkin motion to intervene.before we reach the merits,we must consider whether our jurisdiction is undercut either by the possibility that the coast guard commandant does not qualify as a person entitled to appeal under a,or by the coast guard prior filing of a request that the board reconsider its july order.
jurisdiction.
person.although the word person is usually presumed not to include the sovereign,vermont agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d united states cooper,this presumption can be overcome by an affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary.see vermont agency of natural,at.at citing int l primate prot.league administrators of tulane educ.fund,d.here a states that person,in addition to its meaning under section of title,includes a governmental authority,and explicitly applies the definitions in a to the chapter containing.thus,the statute authorizes jurisdiction over an appeal by the commandant,so long as he has a substantial interest in the order,a,as he clearly does.
timing.a petition for judicial review of a final ntsb order must be filed no later than days after the order,see a,and a request for administrative reconsideration must be filed within days of the order,see commandant mintz,holding that the time limit established in the rules of practice for aviation proceedings,b,should also apply to maritime proceedings.here,the coast guard filed an untimely request for administrative reconsideration on august,days after the july order,which the ntsb dismissed as untimely on november,after the initial days for seeking judicial review had run,an initial petition for review on september,days after the july order,and a second petition for review on january,days after the board dismissal of its request for ntsb reconsideration.thus,the sequence of orders and petitions is as follows 
july,the board issued its order reversing the coast guard 
august,the coast guard requested administrative reconsideration by the board 
september,the coast guard filed its first petition for judicial review 
november,the board rejected the request for administrative reconsideration as untimely 
january,the coast guard filed its second petition for judicial review.
attacking our jurisdiction,nitkin correctly notes that our cases treat a petition for review filed during the pendency of a request for administrative reconsideration as incurably premature,see telestar,fcc,and in effect a nullity.as nitkin acknowledges,the reconsideration request ordinarily tolls the running of the time limit for judicial review.id.at.see also outland civil aeronautics,city of pittsburgh federal power.but,nitkin argues,the supreme court said in bowman lopereno,that an untimely request for agency reconsideration could not extend the time for appeal although it actually held that if the agency addressed the merits of such a request,its ultimate denial thereof would start a new period for seeking review,id.at.at.
we can find jurisdiction without resolving the precise effect of the untimely request for ntsb reconsideration.if the request suspended the running of the time limit for appeal,then the coast guard second petition for review was timely if it did not,then the initial petition was effective.either way,we have jurisdiction.
the only nitkin does not express in so many words,perhaps because of the embarrassment of doing that the filing of an untimely request for administrative reconsideration renders the original agency order for purposes of judicial review petitions filed before the agency dismisses the reconsideration request,but does not affect the finality of the original order for purposes o
