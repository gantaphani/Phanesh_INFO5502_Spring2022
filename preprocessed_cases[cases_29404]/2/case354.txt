russell scott scott was seriously injured on april,while standing on a pier at buffington harbor,indiana.at the time of his injury,scott was employed as the training director for mgi america,total marine safety center total marine.total marine was engaged in the business of fulfilling safety requirements for owners of marine vessels.total marine contracted with trump indiana,to design,install,and maintain the lifesaving equipment required by the united states coast guard for the vessel trump casino,a gambling establishment as a part of its agreement with trump indiana,total marine supplied and serviced the trump casino life rafts and provided life raft training to trump casino employees.
scott was an experienced seaman,having served in the coast guard for over twenty years prior to beginning his career with total marine.as a part of his job with total marine,scott developed a training course on the deployment of life rafts and the safe evacuation of a ship in the event of trouble.scott taught this course to personnel from the trump casino and other total marine clients.the majority of the training was conducted at the total marine facility located in mokena,illinois however,scott estimated that he spent about percent of his time on clients vessels,either servicing or doing needs analysis,developing training or doing training.
on april,a life raft drill was held for the trump casino.this drill was required by the coast guard to prove satisfactory operation of the trump casino life safety system.scott was present during the drill,spending time both on the trump casino and on land.as a part of the drill,one of the trump casino life rafts was inflated and deployed into the water by trump casino personnel.while the life raft was being launched,scott observed the drill from the upper decks of the trump casino to evaluate whether trump casino employees launched the raft correctly.after the raft was launched,it was towed to an auxiliary pier to be lifted out of the water and placed on a truck for transport to the total marine facility where the raft would be inspected and repackaged for eventual return to the trump casino.
while most vessels the size of the trump casino have a crane,the trump casino did not.therefore,prior to the drill,total marine hired lola crane to provide a hydraulic truck crane and crane operator to lift the inflated life raft from the water.mark nichols drove the truck crane to buffington harbor and positioned the crane on the auxiliary pier.when the deployed raft was brought to the auxiliary pier,total marine employees who were in the raft connected the crane ball to the raft.while other employees of total marine were actually in the life raft during the drill,scott himself never entered the life raft.scott was standing on the auxiliary pier when the life raft was being lifted out of the water.as nichols used the crane to lift the boat out of the water and across the pier,a gust of wind caused the boat to sway.the boat struck scott in the head,and scott suffered a severe closed head injury with massive swelling requiring a craniotomy.
on april,scott and his wife,lauren scott,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.counts i and ii alleged claims against total marine under the jones act,et.counts iii and iv alleged claims against trump indiana under b of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca.counts v and vi alleged claims against lola crane and crane operator mark nichols under general maritime jurisdiction,
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lola crane and nichols on february,stating the scotts failed to satisfy the requirements of federal admiralty jurisdiction in their claims against these defendants.specifically,the district court held that scott injury was not caused by a vessel on navigable waters.on february,the district court granted total marine motion to dismiss pursuant to.b,holding that the scotts failed to make any allegations of facts that could arguably establish jurisdiction under the jones act.on june,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of trump indiana.while noting it had doubts as to whether scott was covered by the lhwca,the court held that,even assuming scott would be covered by the lhwca,there was no evidence of any negligence by the trump casino.the scotts filed a timely notice of appeal,challenging the district court rulings with respect to lola crane,nichols,and trump indiana.the scotts do not appeal the court ruling on total marine rule b motion to dismiss.

we review a district court legal determination as to whether subject matter jurisdiction exists de novo,while the district court factual determinations are reviewed for clear error.weaver hollywood,cir.article iii of the constitution grants federal jurisdiction over all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.const.art.iii.under,t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,traditionally,admiralty tort jurisdiction existed only when the tort in question occurred on navigable waters.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.however,in,congress enacted the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act,app,which provides,the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the united states shall extend to and include all cases of damage or injury,to person or property,caused by a vessel on navigable water,notwithstanding that such damage or injury be done or consummated on land.
following the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act,courts have established a test to use in determining whether admiralty jurisdiction exists.a party seeking to invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to over a tort claim must satisfy conditions both of location and of connection with maritime activity.grubart,at.a court applying the location test must determine whether the tort occurred on navigable water or whether injury suffered on land was caused by a vessel on navigable water.id.citing app.the connection with maritime activity assessment,also known as the nexus test,examines two issues,first,whether the incident in question has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce,and second,whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.weaver,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
we focus first on the location prong.it is undisputed that the alleged tort did not occur on navigable water.therefore,for admiralty jurisdiction to exist,scott injury must have been caused by the vessel trump casino.the supreme court has interpreted the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act use of the phrase caused by as requiring proximate causation.grubart,at.for purposes of the locality test,an appurtenance to a vessel is treated as part of the vessel itself.id.at.we must determine,therefore,whether scott injury was caused by an appurtenance to the trump casino.appellants contend that it was,arguing that both the life raft and the crane qualify as appurtenances.
appellants liken their case to gutierrez waterman steamship,d,in which the supreme court held jurisdiction existed under the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act when a longshoreman was injured after slipping on loose beans that had leaked from a defective cargo container which had been unloaded from a ship.the gutierrez court held the cargo containers constituted a part of the ship gear.id.at.in its later decision in victory carriers,law,d,the supreme court characterized its decision in gutierrez as turning upon the fact that gutierrez injury was caused by an appurtenance of a ship,the defective cargo containers.
the supreme court in victory carriers again addressed an injury to a longshoreman working on a pier.in victory carriers,the plaintiff was injured while driving a forklift truck on a pier where the sagamore hill was docked.as the plaintiff was operating the forklift,the forklift overhead protection rack came loose and fell on him,injuring him.victory carriers,at.at the time of his i
