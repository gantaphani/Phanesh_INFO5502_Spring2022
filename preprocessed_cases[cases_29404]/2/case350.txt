background 
artco operates towboats on the mississippi river between paul,minnesota and new orleans,louisiana.artco has two types of vessels vessels and vessels.the vessels are smaller because they have to navigate through narrower passages in the river beginning just north of louis.the boats are larger and travel only between louis and new orleans.prior to,the largest vessels towed forty barges,five long and eight wide 
in,artco initiated a six long program meaning that its lower river vessels would push barges,six long and eight wide.at that time,no other towboat company was pushing six long tows on the mississippi river.artco ran the program on a trial basis for six months and then adopted it as part of its regular business practice.pilots and captains who wanted to participate in the program had to receive extra training,but were also paid a higher salary than those pilots and captains pushing smaller tows artco maintains that at all times the six long program was voluntary.
larry gwin captained the daniel macmillan,a horsepower,triple screw three propellers towboat,the largest size towboat on the river.gwin was the daniel macmillan captain for five and a half years and routinely pushed tows between louis and new orleans.gwin supervisor,port captain bruce hussell,informed gwin of the six long program.hussell told gwin that the program was voluntary but that gwin should think about participating.gwin eventually decided not to participate in the program because he thought that the program was unsafe.gwin informed hussell of his decision.
on january,gwin received a written evaluation.hussell rated gwin performance as good in of categories but rated his performance as fair in category,which was titled does operate the vessel to its full potential.under the section titled recommendations for improvement,hussell wrote,other vessels in the class as the daniel macmillan take loads southbound.on february,gwin wrote hussell a letter in response to the evaluation and sent copies to artco president and vice president.gwin wrote,
as for of the evaluation,this is an area which we have discussed on many occasions.you have asked me if i was willing to take barges southbound.i advised you that the safe number of barges to navigate southbound on the mississippi river is determined by the river conditions,but never more than some of the reasons i gave you for not wanting to take more than barges southbound include my concern for the life and safety of my crew and my livelihood,my license.concerning my license,each time we discussed me taking barges southbound,you have been quick to say that this was my decision and was strictly voluntary.you stressed to me that it was not mandatory,not something artco would force me to do.
gwin testified that after he sent the letter,hussell continued to ask him to push six long tows.gwin again told hussell,i thought we talked about this i am not going to do it.
in january,gwin received another evaluation from hussell.hussell rated gwin performance as good in of categories.this time he received a fair rating for learns new skills and does operate the vessel to its full potential.under recommendations for improvement,hussell wrote,larry should put the effort to go to long.as a master on a very good vessel he should be heading in that direction.in april,hussell called gwin and told him that he was being demoted to pilot.thirty days later,artco discharged gwin through a letter indicating that he had been terminated because of a reduction in artco business.
gwin and five other whom artco had also laid off,sued artco under a b which forbids a person from discharging a seaman for refusing to perform duties ordered by his employer if the duties would result in serious various other federal and state common law theories.the statutory claims were tried to a jury during a trial beginning on february.artco moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiffs case.the district court took the motion under advisement.artco renewed its motion at the close of its case.the court sustained the motion as to one plaintiff who admitted he had been terminated for failing a drug test,but denied it as to the other five plaintiffs,including gwin.the jury found for gwin on his claim,awarding him in compensatory damages and in punitive damages,but found for artco on the other plaintiffs claims.the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict.
artco filed three motions.first,it filed a motion renewing its motion for judgment as a matter of law against gwin,arguing that artco never ordered him to push a six long tow.second,it filed a motion for costs under federal rule of civil procedure d as the prevailing party on five of the six plaintiffs claims and on the substantial part of gwin claim.finally,it filed a motion for its retained and experts fees,arguing that artco had entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs that each party would pay the fees and expenses for the other party experts.
on june,the district court held a hearing and denied all three of artco motions.on the motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court held that a plaintiff suing under does not need to show that the defendant explicitly used the word order.the district court denied artco motion for costs,ruling that rule provision for an award of costs to the prevailing party was superceded by the provisions of regarding attorney fees and costs.the district court also held that it would not enforce any agreement between the parties regarding experts.artco filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
judgment as a matter of law 
artco argues that the district court erred by denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law because no reasonable juror could conclude that artco ordered gwin to push six long tows.this court reviews the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.debiasio.cent,cir.section provides that 
a person may not discharge or in any manner discriminate against a seaman because the seaman has refused to perform duties ordered by the seaman employer because the seaman has a reasonable apprehension or expectation that performing such duties would result in serious injury to the seaman,other seamen,or the public 
a b.artco contends that judgment as a matter of law was appropriate because gwin admitted that he never received an order from artco to push six long tows.on cross examination,artco attorney asked gwin 
from the time you were first asked to consider towing barges that were six lengths long,southbound on the mississippi river until the time your employment ended on june,of,nobody at artco ever ordered you to take a six long tow southbound on the mississippi river,did they sir 
gwin answered,no,sir.during examination,gwin and his attorney had the following exchange 
q i want to ask you a few questions about some of the questions,some of the other questions sacks had asked you about.you stated that artco had never specifically ordered you to push a six long tow.do you remember saying that 
q i wanted to know why you said that.
a i got the evaluations,had the evaluations,and i looked at them.and by those evaluations i assumed that was what i had to do,something because i could see the writing on the wall that i was fixing to get furloughed,terminated,or laid off.
artco argues that this testimony demonstrates that gwin did not receive an order to push six long tows.we disagree.while gwin testified that he did not receive an explicit order,the eviden
