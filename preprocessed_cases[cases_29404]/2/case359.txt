the morgan,a tugboat pushing four barges,allided with the street bridge in chicago,illinois.the impact disabled the bridge,severing eight of its ten electrical cables.a suit by the city followed.the district court,applying the oregon presumption of fault against a moving vessel which strikes a stationary object,the oregon,found the morgan presumptively at fault based on its negligent reaction to a mechanical failure but also held the city partially liable for the allision for failing to adequately protect the electrical cables.the court determined that the parties were equally liable and apportioned damages accordingly.the morgan appeals,arguing that the district court erred in its application of the oregon rule and its apportionment of damages.we find that the oregon rule applies,the morgan failed to exonerate itself from liability,and the record supports the district court decision to apportion damages equally.therefore,we affirm.
background 
on april,the morgan a tugboat,was pushing four barges,weighing approximately tons,down the calumet river in chicago,illinois,from the federal marine terminal to the ceres service terminal,a trip which required passing under the street bridge.during its voyage,the morgan starboard winch brake failed causing its crew to lose control of the vessel and strike the western pier face of the street bridge.the foremost barge struck the bridge at an acute angle such that it entered a recessed slot which housed the cables.
the street bridge is managed and maintained by the city of chicago in trust for the general public.the bridge uses submarine electrical cables to control its mechanical functions.the electrical cables run from the eastern pier face of the bridge,feet below the waterline,to its western pier face.from its western pier face,the cables travel above ground into a machine house,from which the bridge operator controls the opening and closing of the bridge.though the full distance from the eastern to the western side of the bridge is feet,the navigable waterway spans only feet and the portion of the bridge which houses the electrical cables on the western pier face is outside of the navigable channel.to protect the superstructure of the bridge from common allisions,horizontal rubbing,or incidental contact with vessels,the city installed protective dolphins and fenders along the sides of the bridge.the city attempted to protect the submarine cables by placing them in a recessed slot however,the cables remained exposed to river debris or vessels moving at certain angles.prior to,the recessed slot was also covered by a wooden fender however,upon the deterioration of the fender,the city chose not to replace it 
the morgan crew included james long,serving as captain,brian grzybowski,the deck engineer,and john kindra and ryan campbell,serving as deck hands.the crew was inexperienced with the morgan.captain long began his employ with kindra two and one half months prior to the accident,while kindra and campbell had primarily served in an administrative capacity as office staff.
the four barges were tied two long and two abreast,forming a square.the morgan was positioned behind the barges,which allowed it to push the barges forward.the barges and the boat were connected at three points.first,the nose of the boat abutted the two rear barges at the center point of the boat.this connection was maintained solely through contact rather than by an independent line.the second point of connection was a line which ran from the winch located on the starboard right deck of the vessel to the starboard cleat on the barge.lastly,another line ran from the winch located on the port left deck of the vessel to the port cleat on the barge.the two winches on the morgan were approximately four feet high and controlled electrically when the winch lines are taut,the morgan and barges form a single body,and the vessel is deemed facing up.winches control the degree of tension on the lines and in turn control the steering of the unit.winch brakes also maintain the tension on the line when the vessel motor is not powered.thus,if the starboard winch line is released,the vessel turns left and if the port winch line is released,the vessel turns right.
to depart from the federal marine dock that morning,captain long directed the crew to tighten the winch lines,start the vessel motor and draw in the starboard winch line to move the vessel right and away from the dock.captain long then put the boat in reverse and slowly began to back out of the dock.as the vessel proceeded,he noticed that the rear of the morgan was too close to the dock.in response,he put more slack in the starboard winch line to force the rear of the vessel to move away from the dock.after achieving a safe distance from the dock and down the river,captain long tightened the starboard winch line using the green button on the control panel to face up the morgan.however,when he released the green button controlling the starboard winch line,the starboard winch brakes failed and the line began paying out unwinding.this caused the vessel to turn to port left.the starboard winch brake failure also meant that the captain lost the ability to steer the vessel to starboard right.
captain long responded to this unexpected mechanical failure by contacting grzybowski by radio and asking him to send someone to the deck of the morgan to stop the paying out of the starboard winch line.to reduce the forward momentum of the vessel,captain long put the engines in reverse.he also radioed the bridge and asked that it be opened to prevent the vessel coaming from striking the underside of the bridge.at this time,the vessel was approximately feet south of the bridge and favoring port gliding left.
kindra responded to grzybowski request,although he had to travel over feet from the front end of the barges,across the vessel,to the starboard winch.captain long directed kindra,by radio,to dog the starboard winch,which prevents the winch line from unwinding,and also to put out a fiber line from the center of the vessel to the center of the barges.the fiber line alone would not have caused the morgan to line up,but,both measures caused the vessel and the barges to properly face up.by this time,the lead barges were passing under the draw of the bridge.
while moving at approximately one mile per hour,the barge made contact with the bridge.it slid down the fenders located on the western pier face and into the recessed slot which housed the electrical wires without causing any visible damage to the fenders it impacted or to the barge itself.the impact was so slight that neither long nor kindra were aware that the barge had made contact with the bridge.even at this slow speed,however,the vessel angular impact damaged the bridge by severing the electrical cables.the damage was extensive,requiring replacement of the eight cables which cost the city of chicago.
the district court conducted a bench trial,during which the morgan presented evidence that the starboard winch functioned properly on the morning of april prior to the accident and that winches were inspected weekly.however,grzybowski,the deck engineer,was not able to identify which day of the week was designated for inspection,the last day the winches were actually inspected,or which member of the crew inspected the winches on the day of the accident.in addition,the captain admitted that he did not inspect the winches as he did not consider that a necessary part of his routine.the court then rendered a written decision listing several findings of fact which this court will accept absent clear error.folkstone maritime,csx,cir.specifically,the trial court found the following 
it is fairly common for barges and vessels to touch or in that sense allide substructures of bridges.
when a vessel allides with a bridge in the city of chicago the damage to the bridge is most often to the superstructure.
it is more common for a vessel to allide with a bridge through rubbing rather than striking at an acute angle.
there was no evidence presented of any specific allision with the east street bridge before april.
without a fender or timber waler,the cables were exposed to the river.the cables,however,were protected from sideways,parallel,contact by being placed in a slot.it was nevertheless reasonably foreseeable that the cables could be damaged by a minor allision in the form of the fairly common rubbing or touching.
long has no explanation why the brake shoes on the starboard winch failed.
one way to have restored tension to the starboard line earlier would have been to draw in the starboard line using the motor on the winch.that is,even if the brake in the winch did not hold,the line could have been drawn in periodically.
if long had used the motor on the starboard winch to draw in the starboard line,he might have been able to maintain tension on the line by intermittently punching the control button for the winch.
long recalls punching the control button for the winch about three times.he also described his actions in this regard as continually or intermittently hitting it to get it to come in.the button on the winch is an electrical connection therefore,once the button is pushed,the motor should almost instantaneously begin to draw in the wire.on the other hand,continually holding down the winch button could blow the breaker.
if the timber waler had been in place across the cable slot,the port bow corner of the barge would have slid along the timber waler and probably would not have contacted the cables.
city of chicago morgan,d,internal citations omitted.applying pure comparative fault principles,the district court found that both parties were responsible for the damage and apportioned fault equally between them.
ii.analysis 
the morgan makes several arguments on appeal.first,defendants contend that the oregon presumption is unnecessary and inapplicable because the facts of the case are apparent and the accident was an expected and minor allision.second,defendants assert that even if we find the application of the presumption appropriate,we should deem it rebutted and exonerate the vessel from liability.defendants seek exoneration based on the district court determination that the city decision not to replace the wooden fender over the recessed slot was a proximate cause of the allision.they also maintain they were without fault as they contend that the allision was an inevitable accident.finally,defendants take issue with the district court apportionment of liability between the parties,arguing that an equal apportionment is not supported by the record and is contrary to this court cost avoidance doctrine and the general principles of comparative fault.
a.the oregon rule.
the oregon rule creates a rebuttable presumption of fault against a moving vessel,which under its own power,allides with a stationary object.at.as a conclusion of law,we review the district court decision to apply the oregon rule to the underlying matter de novo.see union pac.kirby inland marine,cir applying de novo review to determine whether the district court properly applied the rule of the pennsylvania,wall,over the oregon rule however,we review for clear error the district court factual findings,folkstone maritime,at,and apportionment of fault,cement,gypsum city of milwaukee national gypsum,cir citing mcallister united states.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire record is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.citing united states gypsum.furthermore,when sitting in admiralty,we treat a district court findings of negligence as factual determinations also reviewed for clear error.folkstone maritime,at.

liability will not arise unless a party act or omission is a substantial and material factor in causing the allision.american river trans kavo kaliakra,cir.if,however,the vessel contact with the stationary object is expected or minor,the presumption is not applied unless that contact rises above a certain minimal level.see american petrofina pipeline shoko maru,cir recognizing that slight damage to a fender system during normal docking may fall outside the purview of the presumption collecting cases manufacturers rys.riverway harbor serv.louis,same.
application of the oregon presumption does not supplant the general negligence determination which requires a plaintiff to prove the elements of duty,breach,causation and injury by a preponderance of the evidence rather,it merely satisfies the plaintiff prima facie case.bunge,at brown and root marine operators,zapata,cir.once fault is presumed the defendant may come forward with evidence to rebut the presumption,the oregon,at,by showing that the allision was actually the fault of the stationary object the moving vessel acted with reasonable care or the allision was the result of an inevitable accident.folkstone maritime,at finding oregon presumption rebutted when bridge failed to fully open i m rail link,northstar navigation,cir finding oregon presumption rebutted and remanding for trial when bridge was an unreasonable obstruction to navigation graves lake michigan car ferry transp,cir.
rebutting the presumption does not necessarily exonerate the vessel from all liability.under the principles of pure comparative fault,both parties may be found to have contributed to the accident.when two or more parties have contributed by their fault to cause property damage in a maritime collision or stranding,liability for such damage is to be allocated among the parties proportionately to the comparative degree of their fault,and that liability for such damages is to be allocated equally only when the parties are equally at fault or when it is not possible fairly to measure the comparative degree of their fault.united states reliable transfer,d brotherhood shipping,paul fire marine ins,cir.therefore,under the comparative fault analysis between a vessel and a stationary object,a vessel may minimize its liability by providing evidence that the stationary object contributed to the injury it incurred,however,it will be absolved of liability only if the stationary object is deemed the sole proximate cause of the injury.bunge,at emphasis added.
b.the oregon presumption applies.
the parties agree that the allision with the street bridge was the result of the crew of the morgan losing control of the vessel due to the mechanical failure of the starboard winch.while the parties have introduced evidence to dispel some of the mysteries of what occurred during the accident,rodi yachts,at,the morgan has not supplied any reason for the mechanical failure.the vessel asks this court to focus on its reaction once the mechanical failure occurred,however,this does not resolve the question of what caused the starboard winch brake to fail.this lack of an explanation is sufficient to find a factual vacuum meriting the application of the presumption.furthermore,in rodi yachts,this court reasoned that as between a drifting vessel and stationary object struck by it common sense suggests that the former is more likely to have been at fault than the latter id.at.
nor was the morgan contact with the street bridge the type of expected and minor contact which occurs during a normal docking.see american petrofina pipeline,at arguing for the inapplicability of the oregon presumption where the vessel was properly piloted,the contact made with the fender system occurred during a normal docking and was minimal,and the fenders were defective.it is undisputed that the barge contacted the bridge at an angle sharp enough for it to enter the recessed slot which housed the electrical cables.the district court expressly found that common allisions do not occur at acute angles.thus,the district court finding suggests that the allision at issue was not a common parallel rubbing which would constitute expected contact.
also,the western pier face of the bridge,which housed the severed cables,is outside the navigable waterway and therefore contact with this portion of the bridge is not expected or frequent.lastly,the district court also correctly found that damage to the bridge was extensive.we recognize that the vessel was moving very slowly when impact was made,however,the speed of the tugboat is not determinative of whether the impact was minor.the contact caused substantial damage,in the amount of,and can not be characterized as minor.therefore,the district court properly applied the oregon presumption of fault to the morgan.
defendants have failed to rebut the oregon presumption or exonerate themselves from liability.
the morgan has failed to rebut the oregon presumption or exonerate itself from liability by proving either that the allision was the sole fault of the bridge,it acted reasonably,or the allision was the result of an inevitable accident.in addition,the in extremis doctrine does not aid the morgan.
the allision was not the sole fault of the stationary object.
to prove that the allision was the sole fault of the bridge and exonerate itself from liability,the morgan asks this court to draw a distinction between what it characterizes as the actual fault of the bridge and the presumed fault of the vessel for the purposes of this analysis,we find no real distinction between presumed fault and actual fault.as discussed above,presumptions are merely tools used by courts to analyze the facts which underlie an allision and address any factual voids in the record.a presumption implicates the burden of production and proof,not the ultimate liability determination.folkstone maritime,at.
the district court found that the city decision not to replace the fender over the recessed slot was not the sole cause of the damage to the electrical cables.see white stack towing hewitt oil,cir exonerating vessel of liability when damage to breasting dolphins was solely caused by their negligent construction and vessel was properly piloted during docking.under a pure comparative fault analysis,t he plaintiff negligence reduces the amount of damages that he can collect,but it is not a defense to liability.brotherhood shipping,at citing reliable transfer,at.bryant russ,cir in admiralty contributory negligence is properly considered in mitigation of damages.
the district court finding that the fender system or lack thereof contributed to the accident is supported by the record and therefore was not clearly erroneous.the district court reasoned that while the city placed the cables in a recessed slot to protect them,placing a wooden fender in front of the slot would have likely prevented the accident.thus,the court determined that while the city took some preventative action,it did not take sufficient action.on the part of the defendants,the court found that the crew response to the starboard winch brake failure was unreasonable in that it was not able to face up the morgan and this negligence lead to the unusual angular impact.it was therefore proper for the court to decrease the morgan percentage of liability in proportion to the plaintiff relative degree of fault.
the vessel did not react to the mechanical failure in a reasonable manner.
the morgan fault is based on the district court finding that the defendants could have prevented the angular impact by properly facing up the morgan.specifically,the district court found that the morgan did not respond reasonably to the starboard winche failure the crew was inexperienced with the morgan the crew was not diligent in its maintenance of the vessel winches in that they did not inspect the winches that day and could not recall when they were last inspected captain long decision to cast a center line was unreasonable in that it delayed drawing in the starboard winch line and captain long decision to plug the control box was ineffective to restore tension to the winch line the district court was correct that the vessel must bear some of the responsibility for the allision.see american river trans,at finding a drifting vessel liable for alliding with a moored barge based on the vessel negligent reaction to the mechanical failure of its steering system in re american milling,d,holding a vessel liable for an allision with a bridge when the vessel failed to prove that a mechanical failure caused the allision as opposed to the captain navigational errors.
the allision was not the result of an inevitable accident.
the inevitable accident doctrine applies when the cause of the collision was a cause not produced by the vessel,but a cause of which the vessel could not avoid.the olympia,cir.generally,this doctrine is invoked when an act of god,or vis major,causes a vessel to collide with another object or vessel.the louisiana,at frost saluski the blue goddess,cir.unless it appears that both parties have endeavored by all means in their power,with due care and a proper display of nautical skill,to prevent the collision,the defense of inevitable accident is inapplicable to the case.the clarita,wall.therefore,the defense can not be sustained where it appears that the disaster was caused by negligence.american river transp,paragon marine,cir.if applicable,each party is responsible for his respective damages and no liability attaches.the continental,wall.
the doctrine has been applied to collisions brought about by a vessel loss of control due to a mechanical failure,however,the inquiry is whether the defect which caused the malfunction was latent in nature or detectible by the vessel through proper inspection.see the olympia,at cranberry creek coal red star towing transp,cir finding that vessel failed to rebut presumption of fault by proving inevitable accident when it failed to present evidence that mechanical defect was latent or that the vessel was properly maintained and inspected the william reed,hudson river shipyards metropolitan sand gravel,cir finding that the vessel failed to establish inevitable accident defense as it did not present evidence that broken steering gear was in good condition prior to accident,properly or frequently inspected,or purchased from a reputable manufacturer arkansas river csx,meadows and markulis,apportioning fault in collision cases,discussing applicability of the inevitable accident doctrine when a collision occurs as a result of a latent defect in properly inspected and maintained vessel machinery.
the morgan failed to prove that the accident was inevitable.the vessel did not put forth any evidence that the defect in the starboard winch was latent or could not be uncovered through proper inspection.in fact,the defendants testified that they did not know when the starboard winch was last inspected or who was responsible for its continued inspection.most importantly,the district court found that the morgan could have prevented the accident by properly handling the vessel after the mechanical failure.this finding suggests that the allision was not caused by the failure of the starboard winch,but rather by the subsequent mishandling of the vessel.see in re american milling,d at rejecting the inevitable accident defense when captain could have prevented the allision by properly handling vessel after failure of rudders meadows and markulis,supra an inevitable accident is one which occurs without fault.thus,the defendants have not sustained the very heavy burden of proving that the accident was inevitable.
the in extremis doctrine is inapplicable.
sometimes confused with the inevitable accident doctrine,the in extremis doctrine or agony of the moment defense applies when a ship is placed in sudden peril through no fault of its own and is forced to take evasive maneuvers that may be a violation of a rule.thomas schoenbaum,admiralty maritime law ed.see,paterson sons,city of chicago,cir applying in extremis do
