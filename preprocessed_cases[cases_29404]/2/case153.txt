opinion of the court 
richard cassin filed a claim for insurance with agf marine aviation transport agf after his charter yacht the yacht sank off the coast of grenada.upon reviewing the claim,agf discovered that cassin misrepresented the purchase price of the yacht and sought a declaration from the district court for the virgin islands that cassin insurance policy was void from its inception.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of agf,applying the federal maritime doctrine of uberrimae fidei,which requires that an insured exercise the utmost good faith and disclose to the insurer all facts material to an insurance risk.in this appeal we must determine whether uberrimae fidei applies to the insurance policy issued to cassin,and whether cassin made a material misrepresentation that voided that policy.we will resolve both issues in the affirmative,and will therefore affirm the district court dismissal.
because our decision is based on the representation of the purchase price that cassin made at the time he financed and insured the yacht,we begin with a detailed description of those transactions.in late or early,magnus falk placed the yacht on the market for sale with southern trades yacht ship brokers southern trades.thereafter,the yacht was advertised in various boating magazines for.cassin contacted robert carson,the owner of southern trades,and expressed interest in purchasing the yacht.it is undisputed that,at closing in december,falk received from cassin for the sale of the yacht.
nevertheless,cassin represented that the purchase price for the yacht was in his application for financing to purchase the yacht,and in later applications to insure the yacht.in august,several months before the purchase,cassin applied for financing from trident funding corporation trident.in a letter to trident,cassin acknowledged that falk would only receive at closing,but nevertheless requested financing for of the purchase price,or.app.he explained that in two years before falk listed the yacht for sale with southern trades,he acquired a interest in the yacht from falk,his friend and business partner.app.a down payment of for the purchase of the yacht,cassin wrote,will come out of his existing share of the boat.id.finally,a t closing,magnus falk will receive less bob carson commission on the,and i will receive to recapture the remainder of my equity.id.trident eventually agreed to finance of the purchase price.
after the initiation of this action,and in response to an interrogatory from agf,cassin provided a different account of his negotiations for the yacht.he stated that a ll negotiations for purchase of the vessel were conducted by bob carson of southern trades i never had a direct conversation with falk or communicated personally with him in any way until after the purchase transaction was completed.app.in addition,contrary to his representations to trident that he acquired the equity in,cassin stated that the equity was assigned as part of the purchase agreement which falk agreed to and signed before witnesses.it was a component of the deal.app.to explain the transfer of the equity,cassin stated that i t was my understanding from carson that falk had agreed to cede me a equity in the vessel in order to be able to net from its sale.app.in response to a different interrogatory asking for an explanation for the equity,cassin stated i was not given any reason s why falk agreed to assign us a equity position in the yacht.app.
the deal between cassin and falk for purchase of the yacht closed on december.thereafter,cassin insured the yacht from december through march on three successive insurance policies,each time for approximately.none of these policies were with agf,the plaintiff in this case.on march,theodore tunick company tunick sent cassin a letter indicating that his insurance policy was about to end,and offering a renewal indication which listed certain terms for a new insurance policy.app.the renewal indication stated that the policy form would be,which is the insurance policy that cassin ultimately received from agf id.the letter from tunick also stated that form contains certain limitations and exclusions a full copy of the policy form is available upon request.id.cassin completed an application for renewal on march,and submitted it to tunick.on the application,in the space requesting purchase price,cassin wrote.app.tunick then submitted the application to tl dallas,an underwriting agent.tl dallas presented the application to agf on april,and agf bound coverage to cassin for the yacht from april,to april.
two months later,on june,cassin received a insurance binder binder from tunick,in which agf is listed as company and tunick is listed as producer.app.the binder included the following statement at the top of the front page this binder is a temporary insurance contract,subject to the conditions shown on the reverse side.app.emphasis in original.on the reverse side,in a section entitled conditions,the binder states that t he insurance is subject to the terms,conditions and limitations of the policy ies in current use by the company this binder is cancelled when replaced by a policy.app.the binder also makes one explicit reference to citi financing,cit,trident successor and a first priority lienholder on the vessel,listing it as a loss payee.app.the binder does not contain a choice of law provision.
approximately five and a half months after agf began insuring the yacht,tl dallas,on behalf of agf,sent tunick an insurance policy policy marked,which was the form code specified in the march renewal indication.app.tunick forwarded the policy to cassin on october,which was the first time that cassin saw the policy.
on november,the yacht sank in meters of water off the coast of grenada after it allegedly collided with a container.cassin subsequently filed a claim on the policy.on march,after agf investigated cassin claim,agf filed the complaint in the present action,alleging that the policy was void from its inception because cassin misstated the purchase price in his original insurance application.
after extensive discovery by the parties,the district court granted agf motion for summary judgment as to both cassin and cit.the district court noted that under the policy choice of law provision,any dispute arising under the policy shall be adjudicated according to well established,entrenched principles and precedents of substantive united states federal admiralty law,when they exist.agf marine aviation transport cassin,wl,at.january.next,the district court concluded that the doctrine of uberrimae fidei,which requires that an insured fully and voluntarily disclose to the insurer all facts material to a calculation of the insurance risk,is an entrenched federal precedent,and therefore applies to this dispute pursuant to the policy choice of law provision.id.at,quoting hih marine,fraser,cir.moreover,the district court found that the purchase price for the yacht was only,and that cassin statement to the contrary on the insurance application was a material misrepresentation in violation of uberrimae fidei,permitting agf to void the policy from its inception.finally,the district court determined that cit could not recover under the policy independently of cassin.
cassin and cit appeal.they argue that the policy,and its choice of law provision,do not apply to this dispute that uberrimae fidei is not firmly entrenched federal admiralty law and that this court must remand for a trial under virgin islands law,which does not apply the doctrine of uberrimae fidei to marine insurance disputes.in addition,cit argues that it is an additional insured under the policy,permitting it to recover regardless of whether cassin breached the duty of utmost good faith.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to a,which provides the district court of the virgin islands with the same jurisdiction as district courts of the united states.in new england mut.marine ins.dunham,wall,the supreme court recognized marine insurance contracts as within the federal courts maritime jurisdiction.see also wilburn boat fireman fund ins.since the insurance policy here sued on is a maritime contract the admiralty clause of the constitution brings it within federal jurisdiction.
the district court granted the plaintiff motion for summary judgment,which was a final judgment thus,we have jurisdiction pursuant to.for the following reasons,we will affirm the district court dismissal.
cassin and cit argue that at the time the yacht sank the binder,and not the policy,was in effect contrary to cassin and cit contentions,we conclude that the policy was in effect at the time the yacht sank.
as described above,cassin applied for insurance on march,to begin two days later on april.on april,agf bound coverage for cassin.as described in the binder that cassin received on june,the binder was a temporary agreement,subject to the terms,conditions and limitations of the policy ies in current use by the company,and was cancelled when replaced by a policy.app.hence,the binder issued to cassin signaled an intent to conform with the textbook understanding of a binder as a temporary contract of insurance intended to give the applicant protection pending the execution and delivery of a formal written policy.richard lord,williston on contracts,at ed id.at the binder overcomes the general rule that there is no coverage without the issuance of a policy.lee russ thomas segalia,couch on insurance,at i nsurance companies often issue a binder,also called temporary or preliminary insurance,upon application for insurance or payment of the first premium,which covers the applicant until the insurance company investigation of his or her insurability can be completed and a policy issued or the risk refused.as an interim contract,a binder does not necessarily include all of the terms of an agreement to insure rather,the legal rights and duties of the contracting parties that are not covered by the provisions of the binder,or otherwise,must be determined by an inspection of the terms of the written policy which the parties expected would be issued.williston,at couch,at t erms not specified in the binder are,under ordinary circumstances,to be found in the policy,particularly where the application or binder incorporates such terms by reference.
tunick march letter to cassin advised that coverage form contains certain limitations and exclusions and that a full copy of the policy form is available upon request.app.the binder explicitly warned that it was subject to the terms,conditions and limitations of the policy ies in current use by the company.app.moreover,the traditional understanding regarding the formation of contracts to insure is consistent with both the march letter and the binder.yet neither cassin nor cit ever requested to see agf standard insurance policies.under these circumstances,we conclude that the binder was replaced by the policy,which was issued in accordance therewith.
cassin and cit argue that the policy could not replace the binder in this case because the policy was not issued until september or october,five to six months after coverage began.however,we conclude that the time between issuance of the binder and the policy,which was explicitly contemplated in the binder,did not render the policy inapplicable.the appellants also argue that the policy conflicts with the binder,because the policy contains a choice of law provision and the binder does not.we disagree.the absence of a choice of law provision in the binder does not create an inconsistency.in fact,the binder signaled that there would be provisions in the policy that were not explicit in the binder.see couch,at noting that a binder merge s in the terms and conditions of the written policy issued in accordance therewith.therefore,the policy,and its choice of law provision,was in effect at the time the yacht sank,and governs this dispute 
the insurance policy choice of law provision stated 
it is hereby agreed that any dispute arising hereunder shall be adjudicated according to well established,entrenched principles and precedents of substantive united states federal admiralty law and practice but where no such well established,entrenched precedent exists,this insuring agreement is subject to the substantive laws of the state of new york.
app.the plain language of this provision requires that we determine whether there are any entrenched principles of admiralty law that would control the dispute.the relevant principle to consider is uberrimae fidei.
the doctrine of uberrimae fidei imposes a duty of the utmost good faith and requires that parties to an insurance contract disclose all facts material to the risk.if an insured defaults on this duty,the contract may be avoided by the insurer.see certain underwriters at lloyds,london inlet fisheries,cir hih marine,at knight fire ins,cir.a party intent to conceal,or lack thereof,is irrelevant to the uberrimae fidei analysis.see steelmet,caribe towing,cir holding that a material misrepresentation,even if it is a result of mistake,accident,or forgetfulness,is attended with the rigorous consequences that the policy never attaches and is void internal quotation marks omitted.the only thing that matters is the existence of a material misrepresentation.
the policy choice of law provision mandates that we look to well established,entrenched principles and precedents of substantive united states federal admiralty law.app.yet,as we mentioned above in footnote,we see no difference between this mandate and the analysis we would undertake pursuant to wilburn boat in the absence of a choice of law provision.see wilburn boat,at.noting that even if a contract dispute falls under this court admiralty jurisdiction,it does not follow that every term in every maritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined admiralty rule calhoun,at discussing wilburn boat and comparing the relationship between state and federal law in admiralty cases to their relationship in preemption cases such as clearfield trust united states,and its progeny 
we have previously held,in a case decided after wilburn boat,that in the maritime context a boat owner must meet its duty of uberrimae fidei.east coast tender,robert winzinger,cir concluding that while uberrimae fidei is applicable,the insured behavior is consistent with the notion of utmost good faith.the majority of our sister circuits to decide the issue are in agreement that uberrimae fidei controls in maritime insurance disputes.see puritan ins,at cir.it is well established that the parties to a marine insurance contract are held to the highest degree of good faith,uberrimae fidei.inlet fisheries,at cir.following the framework of wilburn boat,we hold that the longstanding federal maritime doctrine of uberrimae fidei,rather than state law,applies to marine insurance contracts.hih marine,at cir.it is that the marine insurance doctrine of uberrimae fidei is the controlling law of this circuit.
meanwhile,the first circuit has questioned whether uberrimae fidei is well established,but has declined to decide the issue.see commercial union ins.pesante,cir declining to decide issue,because even under state law,the facts of the case made the policy voidable windsor joy mut.ins.giragosian,cir declining to decide issue,because even under uberrimae fidei,the insurer would not be able to avoid the policy.
the fifth circuit is the only circuit to disavow the doctrine of uberrimae fidei as not entrenched federal precedent.anh thi kieu,at.in anh thi kieu,the fifth circuit reversed the course it had taken in previous cases.see fireman fund ins.wilburn boat,cir declaring that uberrimae fidei is solidly entrenched in our body of federal maritime law.despite a lengthy exposition of the history of the doctrine of uberrimae fidei,going back years,the opinion concluded that recent application had been spotty and uberrimae fidei is entrenched no more.anh thi kieu,at.
the fifth circuit position has been criticized quite heavily,most recently by the ninth circuit in inlet fisheries.see at.it also contradicts the general sentiment in scholarly literature.see thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed graydon staring george waddell,marine insurance,tul,mitchell popham chau vo,misrepresentation and conceal
