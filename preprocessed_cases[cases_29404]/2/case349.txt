background 
this case involves personal injuries and a death that resulted from a drunken boating collision on may.joshua broughton,tim flemming,stephen turner and eric allen were passengers in a pleasure boat driven by casey barnick.barnick,who was allegedly intoxicated,crashed the boat into a barge,barge rmt,owned by inland marine services.the barge was being towed by a tug boat,the herman crown,owned by imt.billy joe thomas,an employee of imt,was piloting the tug and barge across the illinois river.as a result of the crash,broughton,flemming and turner were injured and allen died.on july,claimants broughton and flemming filed suit in state court against barnick and inland marine services.thereafter,claimant turner was added as a plaintiff and imt and thomas were added as defendants.
on february,imt filed a complaint for exoneration from,or limitation of,liability in district court pursuant to the limitation act,and rule f of the supplemental rules of certain admiralty and maritime claims of the federal rules of civil procedure rule f.in accordance with rule f,the district court enjoined the institution or prosecution of other lawsuits regarding the casualty.five,flemming,barnick,turner and the estate of eric allen the claimants filed claims in the district court against imt.
on january,the claimants filed a joint motion to modify stay seeking to resume litigation of their claims in state court.the claimants attached the following stipulations to the motion 
claimants concede and agree that the united states district court for the central district of illinois has exclusive jurisdiction over all limitation of liability issues which arose out of a collision occurring on or about may,between a pleasure vessel operated by casey barnick and the herman crown and barge rmt 
claimants concede and agree to waive any claim of res judicata respecting any limitation of liability issues as might arise in the event of entry of judgment in any state court or other proceeding based upon the facts of the collision 
claimants concede and agree that should a judgment be obtained in any state court or other proceeding on behalf of any one of more of the claimants,and should this united states district court for the central district of illinois determine that limitation of liability is appropriate,claimants will only seek their respective proportional share of the limitation fund as measured by their respective proportions of any judgment obtained in the state court or other proceeding 
claimants concede and agree that if a judgment is obtained in any state court or other proceeding on behalf of any one or more of the claimants,and should this united states district court for the central district of illinois determine that limitation of liability is appropriate,claimants will in no event seek any amount beyond the value of the limitation fund as determined by the united states district court for the central district of illinois and

additionally,on march,billy thomas filed a waiver of claim,which stated in pertinent part 
billy joe thomas hereby waives any claim for indemnity,contribution,or any other relief that he now has or may have in the future against illinois marine towing,for any legal liabilities he may incur as a result of the collision which is the subject matter of the complaint of illinois marine towing,for exoneration from or limitation of liability.further,billy joe thomas warrants that in the event any judgment is entered against him in favor of any party,he will not enter into any agreement which purports to assign any right of billy joe thomas against illinois marine towing.
at.thomas waiver contained a reservation of counterclaim,stating nothing in this waiver of claim is to be construed as a waiver of any counterclaim which billy joe thomas may have in the event that illinois marine towing should sue billy joe thomas for contribution or indemnity for liabilities arising out of the subject collision.id.over imt objections,and on the basis of the claimants stipulations and thomas waiver,the district court granted the claimants motion and modified the injunction to permit the claimants to pursue their actions in state court,while reserving the question whether imt is entitled to limitation of liability for its own consideration.imt appeals the district court decision,arguing that the claimants stipulations are not a sufficient basis for the modification of the injunction 
ii.discussion 
before turning to the merits of this appeal,we must first determine the appropriate standard of review.imt contends that we should review the district court order de novo the claimants contend we should review for abuse of discretion.generally,we review a district court ruling on an injunction under the limitation act for abuse of discretion.see lewis lewis clark marine,d in re holly marine towing,cir in re mccarthy brothers,cir.here,the district court considered a legal stipulations can transform multiple claims into a single claim within a limitation act part of its decision to lift the injunction.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.doe smith,cir see also odeco oil gas bonnette odeco ii,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the district court finding that the stipulations in the present case adequately protect imt interests and specific decision to lift the injunction.see lewis,at.holly marine,at mccarthy brothers,at.
congress passed the limitation act in to encourage and to induce capitalists to invest in this branch of industry by limiting shipowners potential liability for maritime disasters.lewis,at.quoting norwich wright,wall.internal quotation marks omitted.the central provision of the limitation act provides in relevant part t he liability of the owner of a vessel for any claim,debt,or liability shall not exceed the value of the vessel and pending freight so long as any loss,damage,or injury by collision occurs without the privity or knowledge of the owner.the procedure for a limitation action is defined in the federal rules of civil procedure,supplemental admiralty and maritime claims rule f rule f,which sets forth the following process 
the district court secures the value of the vessel or owner interest,marshals claims,and enjoins the prosecution of other actions with respect to the claims.in these proceedings,the court,sitting without a jury,adjudicates the claims.the court determines whether the vessel owner is liable and whether the owner may limit liability.the court then determines the validity of the claims,and if liability is limited,distributes the limited fund among the claimants.
some tension exists between the limitation act and the saving to suitors clause.see id.specifically,the requirement of the limitation act that the federal district court adjudicate for multiple claimants both the question of liability and whether limitation is referred to as the concursus claimants of their right to pursue their actions in state court,and importantly,deprives them of the right to a jury trial,which is not provided in admiralty law and specifically not an option under rule f.conversely,the saving to suitors clause states that district courts shall have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.in lewis,the supreme court found that this arrangement preserves remedies and the concurrent jurisdiction of state courts over some admiralty and maritime claims.lewis,at.additionally,the saving to suitors clause evinces a preference for common law remedies in the forum of the claimant choice see odeco ii,at,and trial by jury is an example of a remedy available to suitors see lewis,at.the supreme court determined that in light of this potential conflict,district courts should have discretion to retain a limitation action or allow the case to proceed in state court.id.at.
in order to alleviate this tension and assist district courts in exercising their discretion,the supreme court has recognized two situations in which a district court should abstain from invoking its jurisdiction to determine liability and allow claimants to litigate in state court.in langnes green,the court articulated a single claimant exception to the concursus.the court stated that when a single claim is asserted against a shipowner there is no need for the peculiar and exclusive jurisdiction of an admiralty court,and therefore a district court should allow the action to proceed in state court,while retaining exclusive jurisdiction over the question of limitation of liability.id.at.when a state court is competent to afford relief,for a district court t o retain the cause would be to preserve the right of the shipowner,but to destroy the right of the suitor in the state court to a commonlaw remedy whereas,to remit the cause to the state court would be to preserve the rights of both parties.id.at.
additionally,in lake tankers henn,d,the court articulated the adequate fund exception.in lake tankers,the value of the vessel and the pending other words,the possible amount of liability limited under the the total claims made against the vessel owner.id.at.finding that t he state proceeding could have no possible effect on the petitioner claim for limited liability,the court held the provisions of the act,namely the concursus requirement,did not apply.id.at.
in the present case,the claimants argue that their stipulations transform their multiple claims into a single claim,and therefore,the district court did not err in allowing them to proceed in state court.there is significant support for this contention.in holly marine,at,we held 
i f all the claimants stipulate that their claims will not subject the vessel owner to liability beyond th e amount of the limitation fund,then the vessel owner is fully protected,and even if there are multiple claimants,the suits can continue in state court without endangering any interest that the act protects 
moreover,in lewis,the supreme court discussed a hypothetical which is similar to the present case and implicitly concluded that abstention would be appropriate in certain multiple claimants situations 
if the district court concludes that the vessel owner right to limitation will not be adequately for example a group of claimants can not agree on appropriate stipulations or there is uncertainty concerning the adequacy of the fund or the number of court may proceed to adjudicate the merits,deciding issues of liability and limitation.
lewis,at.emphasis added.this statement,albeit dicta,supports by negative implication allowing claimants to proceed in state court so long as the vessel owner right to limitation of liability is adequately protected through appropriate stipulations.
extending the single claimant exception to instances like the present has also been endorsed by a number of our sister circuits.specifically,the second,fifth and eighth circuits have all allowed multiple claimants to proceed in state court where the claimants have stipulated to certain conditions,namely concerning the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal district court to decide the limitation of the vessel owner liability and the claimants waiver of any res judicata assertion.see odeco oil gas bonnette odeco i,cir holding that claimants stipulations,which fully protected the shipowner right to seek limited liability,and claimants agreement to abide by an admiralty court determination of the right to limit were adequate to lift an injunction of state court proceedings in re dammers vanderheide scheepvaart maats christina,cir holding that claimants stipulations conceding the admiralty court exclusive jurisdiction to determine all issues relating to limitation of liability and prioritization of their claims allowed them to proceed with common law actions in other forums jefferson barracks marine serv.casey,cir holding that claimants waiver of any claim of res judicata relevant to the issue of limited liability based on any judgment obtained in state court and claimants concession of the shipowner right to litigate all limitation of liability issues in federal court enabled their actions to proceed in state court.in re s e shipping,cir holding that a single claimant stipulations and prioritization of her multiple claims created a single claim situation.
imt makes much of justice frankfurter plurality opinion in maryland cas.cushing.which states that the concursus is the heart of the limitation act,explaining that the concursus fosters judicial efficiency by bringing together all potential claimants in a maritime accident and resolving their claims in one trial.subsequent supreme court cases,however,have diminished the value of the concursus contribution to judicial efficiency and maintained that the primary purpose of the act is limitation of liability.lewis,at.noting that the act was designed to protect vessel owners from unlimited exposure to liability lake tankers,at.noting that the act was adopted to limit liability and that if the concursus is not necessary to protect this statutory right,it is not required.moreover,imt relies on justice frankfurter language about the concursus being the heart of the act without articulating its relationship to the present case.in contrast,the claimants ground their request to return to state court in their interest in a jury trial.
additionally,imt claims that allowing claimants to proceed in state court will render rule f meaningless,by depriving shipowners of their right to seek exoneration from and limitation of liability.specifically,imt argues that the claimants stipulation that they will only seek their pro rata share of any state court judgment in the event the district court determines limitation is appropriate is nothing more than an acknowledgment that they will comply with what rule f already requires.imt further contends that the single claimant exception will thereby swallow entirely a shipowner right to a concursus of claims in federal court.but,imt argument fails because the claimants have not only stipulated to a potential pro rata distribution they have also conceded that the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over all limitation of liability issues,agreed to waive any claims of res judicata respecting any limitation of liability issues,promised not to seek any amount in excess of the fund in the event that limitation is held appropriate and conceded that the district court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the value of the limitation fund.as such,we agree with imt that a simple stipulation to pro rata distribution is not enough,but here the stipulations go farther.when multiple claimants form adequate stipulations that ensure that all limitation issues will be decided in federal court,as they have done in the instant case,then a vessel owner rights are preserved and a concursus is unnecessary.
finally,imt contend
