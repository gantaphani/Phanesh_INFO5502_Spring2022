plaintiff appellant greenpack of puerto rico,greenpack appeals the dismissal of its claim for damages resulting from a delayed delivery of perishable food items from puerto limón,costa rica to san juan,puerto rico.the district court dismissed the complaint as by the statute of limitations in the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa or the act,ch,stat,reprinted in note previously codified at app.having considered the parties claims,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
in october of,greenpack hired defendant appellee american president lines apl to ship four crates of perishable foodstuffs from costa rica to san juan.although apl had promised to convey greenpack cargo to san juan within seven days,it did not.the food allegedly sat on the dock in costa rica for a number of days before being loaded on board.the last container arrived in san juan on november.perhaps predictably,the items in the crates were no longer fit to sell upon their arrival in san juan,and the department of agriculture duly decommissioned all four cargos 
on february,greenpack filed suit against apl in the puerto rico superior court,claiming breach of contract and demanding damages for the lost cargo.on march,apl removed the action to the district court for the district of puerto rico,and subsequently moved for dismissal or judgment on the pleadings under rules b and c,respectively.
apl argued that cogsa governed the relationship between the parties and that therefore greenpack claim was by the act statute of limitations.see cogsa,note previously codified at app.providing that the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered.greenpack opposed apl argument by positing that the harter act,stat.codified previously at app.and presently at,rather than cogsa,governed any liability arising from these shipments.since the harter act contains no specific limitations period for suits by a consignee against a carrier,under greenpack theory,its suit was not as long as it was filed within a reasonable time.ins.of am.marine,cir.
greenpack complaint had alleged in general terms that the damage to its cargo was caused by the delay in the transportation of the same by apl.in its pleadings,greenpack advanced the theory that the damage likely occurred during those days that the food remained on the dock in costa rica,prior to being loaded on the vessel.for purposes of its motion to dismiss,apl did not contest that the loss may have occurred at a point in time when the goods were in its possession prior to loading.and this fact,which we accept as true at this stage in the proceedings,gray evercore restructuring,cir,is key to the parties dispute.
the timing of the loss alleged by greenpack is germane to the question of which statutory structure controls the parties liability.by its terms,cogsa governs bills of lading for the carriage of goods from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.norfolk ry.kirby,d quoting cogsa e,note previously codified at app.e defining carriage of goods under the act see antilles ins.transconex,cir noting and citing case for proposition that cogsa applies from time goods in international commerce are loaded onto a ship until they are released from the ship tackle at port.in other words,cogsa applies when there is a contract for carriage of goods between a foreign port and a port of the united states,barretto peat,luis ayala colón,cir,but only during the interval when the cargo is at sea,also referred to as the period without more,damage that occurred on the dock during the land portion of the shipment journey,or outside of the period,beyond the tackles,would escape cogsa statute of limitations and,as greenpack argued in its opposition to apl motion,the harter act would govern 
as recognized by the district court,however,the parties to a shipping contract may agree to extend cogsa coverage to the period before loading or after unloading of the goods.ins.of,at.see kirby,at.noting that cogsa gives the option of extending its rule by contract to cover the entire period in which the goods would be under a carrier responsibility,including the period of the inland transport citing cogsa,note previously codified at app.the issue before the district court was therefore whether the bills of lading in this case extended the provision of cogsa to the period when the damage allegedly occurred,prior to loading the cargo on board the ship.
although the four containers of perishable food were shipped separately,they were governed by identical bills of lading,all of which were referenced in the complaint.apl successfully argued before the district court that these bills of lading contained a paramount clause that specifically incorporated cogsa to cover the period prior to loading and after discharge.
the relevant language is contained in subsection iv of the paramount clause,which reads in pertinent part as follows 
prior to loading onto the vessel and after discharge from the vessel or if the stage of carriage during which the loss or damage to goods occurred can not be proved,the carrier liability shall be governed under the hague rules,except that the limitation shall be per package or per shipping unit as stated in the bill of lading package limitation clause,and for this purpose the hague rules shall be extended to the periods before loading and sic to discharge and to the entire period of the carrier responsibility.
as the district court noted,the paramount clause in the bills of lading explicitly references cogsa relationship to the hague rules in its subsection i,which states that,for the period,
the carrier responsibility shall be subject to the provisions of any legislation compulsorily applicable to this bill of lading which gives effect to the hague rules including adaptations thereof,such as cogsa,the provisions of which shall apply on all shipments to or from the united states whether compulsorily applicable or not 
although the district court did not rely on the following additional language,we note as relevant to the parties dispute subsection i of the package limitation clause in the bills of lading,which reads as follows 
for shipments to and from the united states,neither the carrier nor the vessel shall in any event become liable for any loss of or damage to or in connection with the carriage of goods in an amount exceeding which is the package or sic unit limitation under cogsa per package or in the case of goods not shipped in packages per customary freight unit.
this clause further states that it applies in addition to and shall not be construed as derogating from any defense or exclusion,restriction or limitation of liability available to the carrier under the terms of this bill of lading or otherwise.the bills of lading also contained a notice of loss,time bar provision establishing that 
t he carrier shall in any event be discharged from all liability whatsoever in respect of the goods,unless suit is brought in the proper forum and written notice thereof received by the carrier within nine months after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered.
in its order,dated august,the district court granted apl motion for dismissal or judgment on the pleadings,finding that,per the paramount clause in the bills of lading,greenpack claims were subject to cogsa statute of limitations.since suit was filed more than one year after the delivery of the cargo,the same was found to be.this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
greenpack contention on appeal is that the bills of lading did not extend cogsa provision to cover the time prior to loading because the language in the paramount clause incorporated only the liability provision of cogsa and not its statute of limitations apl,in turn,argues that a plain reading of the contractual language at issue reveals the parties intention to extend cogsa provisions in full to the period in question.
standard of review 
we review dismissals under rule b and judgments on the pleadings under rule c de novo.gray,at.likewise,the question of whether and to what extent the bills of lading in this case extended the dispositions of cogsa to cover the parties relationship beyond the tackles is a matter of contract interpretation,and thus a question of law that is reviewed de novo.see officemax,levesque,cir contract interpretation,when based on contractual language without resort to extrinsic evidence,is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.citing principal mut.life ins.racal datacom,cir.as we conduct our review,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.gray,at.in doing so,we may consider,in addition to the complaint,any documents such as bills of lading if their authenticity is not disputed by the parties,if they are central to the plaintiff claims,or if they are sufficiently referenced in the complaint.see curran cousins,cir.
extension of cogsa beyond the tackles 
as previously noted,a carrier and a shipper may extend cogsa so that it applies prior to loading and subsequent to the discharge of the goods from the vessel.see cogsa,note previously codified at app.ins.of,at.to determine the extent of any extension of cogsa beyond the scope of the statute,we must look to the parties intent as expressed in the bills of lading.see kirby,at.c ontracts for carriage of goods by sea must be construed like any other contracts by their terms and consistent with the intent of the parties.henley drilling mcgee,cir since the bill of lading is the contract of carriage between shipper and carrier,familiar principles of contract interpretation govern its construction.citations omitted.
greenpack contends that a plain reading of the paramount clause demonstrates that the parties meant to incorporate cogsa solely for the purpose of limiting the carrier liability to,per cogsa limitation of liability provision.see cogsa,note previously codified at app.limiting the liability of a carrier for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods to per package.we find greenpack reasoning unpersuasive.
the paramount clause here has two relevant subsections,i and iv.the first of these sets out the law that will govern the rights of the parties f rom loading of the goods onto the vessel until their discharge,while the second identifies the applicable law p rior to loading onto and after discharge from the vessel,beyond the tackles.as to the latter,subsection iv plainly indicates that,during that time,or if the stage of carriage during which the loss or damage to goods occurred can not be proved,the carrier liability shall be governed under the hague rules,except that the limitation shall be per package or per shipping unit as stated in the bill of lading package limitation clause emphasis added.as we explained supra,cogsa is the united states domestic enactment of the hague rules,see hanover ins,at,and the parties acknowledge the same in subsection i of the paramount clause itself.therefore,a natural reading of the quoted language from subsection iv leads us to conclude that the parties intended a general extension of the provisions of cogsa to govern all issues relating to the carrier liability arising during the period beyond the tackles,which would include the act provision 
greenpack focuses on the phrase in subsection iv of the paramount clause that begins with except and establishes a per package limitation of to the liability of the carrier.according to greenpack,this qualifying phrase was meant to narrow the preceding,more general language incorporating cogsa.as apl argues,however,such language is not unusual in this context.moreover,we do not believe the qualifying phrase was meant to operate as a continuum of the first part of the sentence to confine cogsa application solely to setting the package limitation rule.
the inclusion of a package limitation clause equivalent to the one contained in cogsa,even where the act applies ex proprio vigore,appears to be common in contracts for international carriage.see michael sturley,benedict on admiralty,ch.xvi,at indicating that m ost carriers have decided to include an explicit limitation clause in the bill of lading despite the plain language of cogsa section limiting the carrier liability in a similar manner,t o ensure that courts actually enforce their rights under the act.we note that section itself states that the limit will apply unless the nature and value of the goods in carriage have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.note previously codified at app.thus,the shipper retains the right to avoid the limitation by declaring a higher value,and a carrier who does not provide adequate notice of this possibility does so at his own peril.see,henley drilling,at considering,without embracing,other circuits requirement under cogsa that carriers afford shippers a fair opportunity to declare their cargo value enforcing act limit on liability only after concluding that combination of paramount clause incorporating cogsa and a valuation clause mimicking section in the bill of lading afforded shipper both constructive and actual notice of the provision applicability.
indeed,parties to a contract of carriage governed by cogsa may agree on a higher amount as the limit on liability.see cogsa,note previously codified at app.providing that b y agreement between the carrier and the shipper another maximum amount may be fixed,provided that such maximum is not less than the set by the act see also hanover ins,at concluding that cogsa limitation of liability provision,which mirrors that of the hague rules,is a minimum level of valuation that can not be reduced by contractual agreement second emphasis added.other countries may also impose higher amounts as the carrier minimum liability.see michael sturley,benedict on admiralty,ch.xvi,b c because foreign statutes comparable to cogsa often impose greater liability on the carrier,particularly foreign enactments of the hague visby rules cargo claimants have sometimes argued that the limitation provisions of a foreign statute should apply in preference to cogsa.
in light of this,it seems to us perfectly reasonable for a carrier such as apl to be motivated to set a specific limit on its potential liability in addition to language incorporating cogsa as applicable beyond the tackles that re states the cogsa minimum as its standard.such language would tend to avoid possible confusion and ensure a uniform limitation on liability that would apply regardless of divergences between different countries domestic enactments in every jurisdiction where suit might be brought in connection with apl shipments.see vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,cir noting that passage of cogsa was part of an international effort to achieve uniformity and simplicity in bills of lading used in foreign trade,and also to reduce uncertainty concerning the responsibilities and liabilities of carriers,responsibilities and rights of shippers,and liabilities of insurers.while the except language in subsection iv of the paramount clause operates to qualify the general incorporation of cogsa to the period beyond the tackles,it does so only as an attempt to clarify and make certain the amount of liability per package that apl would be subject to in the event of suit.
greenpack suggests in its briefing that not all of cogsa should be applicable in this case because the bills of lading did not make references to all the provisions of the act,citing to ralston purina company barge juneau and gulf caribbean marine lines,cir per curiam.however,that case in no way supports the proposition that a contract must recite all of the elements of a law that the parties would like to incorporate,where instead as in this case they could make a general reference to the statute in the contract and then specify limited exceptions or clarifications to the same 
greenpack also contends that the language used by apl as the drafter of the bills of lading to extend cogsa beyond the tackles could have been clearer,pointing to language in other cases.see,firestone tire rubber almacenes miramar,contract stated that the bill of lading shall have effect subject to the provisions of cogsa while the goods are in the custody of the vessel or its agents see also gamma plastics,am.president lines,cir ins.of,at fireman ins.of newark,gulf lines,commw.of sea land.we do not see how the language at issue in the cited cases is necessarily clearer than the language apl used in the bills of lading relating to this case,except for the fact that they do not include the same qualifying language regarding the limitation on liability provision that is present here.we have already explained our position regarding the effect of such language supra.moreover,the fact that other contracts for carriage at sea have simply incorporated cogsa over the entire period while the goods are in the carrier custody does not mean that apl and greenpack were precluded in this case from setting up a scheme of coverage that differentiated between the interval and the period beyond the tackles and notably,greenpack does not advance such an argument 
greenpack next appeals to the principle that contracts purporting to grant immunity from,or limitation of,liability must be strictly construed.see boston metals v.the winding gulf.frankfurter,concurring clauses are not to be applied to alter familiar rules visiting liability upon a tortfeasor for the consequences of his negligence,unless the clarity of the language used expresses such to be the understanding of the contracting parties.see also robert herd krawill mach,d refusing to read an extension of cogsa to limit the liability of a negligent stevedore to where neither cogsa nor the bill of lading adverted to stevedores or the carrier agents but kirby,at.noting that herd does not require a special degree of linguistic specificity in contracts for carriage of goods by sea,and only calls for them to be construed by their terms and consistent with the parties intent.whether or not a higher standard applies to the review of contractual limitations on liability in this context,a question we need not answer today,we believe the outcome would be the same here because the contractual language at issue is clear and admits no other interpretation.see kirby,at.w here the words of a law,treaty,or contract,have a plain and obvious meaning,all construction,in hostility with such meaning,is excluded.quoting green biddle,wheat.
finally,greenpack makes a assertion in its brief,unsupported by legal references,that its claim should not be dismissed as untimely because u nder the harter act,the doctrine of laches applies,and apl suffered no prejudice from greenpack delay in presenting suit.it suggests that this is so because greenpack alleged in its complaint that it sent an extrajudicial notice to apl,which it later clarified had been sent within nine months of the delivery of the goods,as required by the notice of loss,time bar provision in the bills of lading at oral argument,greenpack provided a case citation to support its point.see,sedeco servicio de descuento en compras,cir applying principle that i n admiralty case s,maritime law and the equitable doctrine of laches govern the time to sue to determine a limitations period for a suit involving overdue demurrage charges on international shipments to puerto rico quoting,pan am.grain,cir.besides this,greenpack did little to elaborate its theory,explain to the court how it should apply this equitable doctrine to the case at hand,or illustrate why we should bypass both the statutory limitations period that would otherwise apply per the paramount clause,or the contractual notice of loss,time bar provision that greenpack itself references.the argument put forth by greenpack is so undeveloped on appeal that we must consider the same waived.see united states zannino,cir employing settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by developed argumentation,are deemed waived see also barrett ex rel.estate of barrett united states,cir refusing to consider an equitable tolling argument not raised below and developed only perfunctorily on appeal.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
the crates contained,inter alia,cassavas,bananas,plantains,and purple dasheen,which is a variety of tuber known colloquially in puerto rico as malanga.
the first two cargos,which arrived in puerto rico on october,were decommissioned on november of the same year.the remaining two cargos arrived on november and were decommissioned two days later.
see robert force et,admiralty and maritime law abridged edition tackle to tackle has traditionally meant from the moment when the ship tackle is hooked on at the loading port until the moment when the ship tackle is unhooked at discharge.quoting tetley,marine cargo claims ed see,starrag maersk,cir.
the parties do not contest that the harter act applies ex proprio vigore beyond the tackles.see,schramm,shipco,cir noting that t he harter act,which was superseded in large part by cogsa,still applies prior to the time when the goods are loaded on or after the time they are discharged from the ship quoting cogsa,note previously codified at app.see also michael sturley,benedict on admiralty,ch.ii,indicating that section of cogsa explicitly preserves the harter act from implied repeal to the extent that it governs the carrier duties before loading and after discharge.we assume as much for purposes of this appeal.
the cited provision of cogsa states that n othing contained in this act shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement as to the parties responsibility and liability arising from the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by sea.
the hague rules are formally known as the international convention for the unification of certain rules of law relating to bills of lading,august,stat,and were promulgated to standardize the rules governing ocean carriers liability for negligence.see generally hanover ins.shulman transp,cir examining cogsa origins.cogsa is the united states domestic enactment of the hague rules,which the united states ratified in.id.at.
greenpack also suggests that cogsa relates only to issues of seaworthiness,and so can not apply to this breach of contract case.greenpack claim is waived,as greenpack summarily advances the argument,citing to no pertinent authority.see.t mobile llc,cir.in any event,greenpack argument fails on its own terms,as it is evident that cogsa applies to the type of claim greenpack advances.cogsa makes clear that under every contract of carriage of goods by sea,the carrier in relation to the loading,handling,stowage,carriage,custody,care,and discharge of such goods,shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities and entitled to the rights and immunities set forth in the act.cogsa,note previously codified at app.cogsa requires carriers to properly and carefully load,handle,stow,carry,keep,care for,and discharge the goods carried.id.previously codified at app.by its terms,cogsa governs instances of loss or damage to goods that are the subject of contracts of carriage by sea,and precludes liability for such losses and damages unless suit is brought within a year.id.previously codified at app.
even if one were to read the language in subsection iv as extending the hague rules,rather than cogsa,to the period beyond the tackles,the result in this case would be the same,as t he language of cogsa mirrors that of the hague rules,with only a few deviations,none of which are relevant here.hanover ins,at see also in re damodar bulk carriers,cir finding no error in the district court application of cogsa rather than the hague rules,since the two are virtually identical in their language.
the hague visby rules are the hague rules as amended by two protocols,the visby amendments and the sdr protocol.see michael sturley,benedict on admiralty,ch.i,at.these rules were never ratified by the united states,and they impose a higher limitation on the liability of carriers.see id.noting that most major trade partners are now parties to the hague visby rules.
indeed,t
