appellants bring this interlocutory appeal challenging the district court grant of a motion to dismiss and a motion for judgment on the pleadings in appellees favor based on its conclusion that appellant state law claims are preempted by the death on the high seas act dohsa.on september,we granted the petition for permission to appeal under b,giving us jurisdiction to consider this issue.we now affirm.
appellants are the personal representatives and successors in interest to three united states navy crewmen killed in a helicopter crash.in,while performing training exercises from the uss bonhomme richard,the helicopter lost control and crashed into the pacific ocean approximately nautical miles off the coast of catalina island,california.
appellants filed a complaint in the superior court of california,county of los angeles,alleging that defects in the helicopter and its component parts caused the accident,and seeking damages for wrongful death.the complaint asserts causes of action for strict products liability,negligence,failure to warn,breach of warranty,and wrongful death and survival under california law and general maritime law.the case was then removed to federal court by appellees sikorsky aircraft corporation and sikorsky support services,collectively sikorsky.sikorsky filed a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings,asserting that dohsa preempts certain causes of action brought by appellants because the accident occurred on the high seas beyond three nautical miles from the shore of the united states.see fed.civ.pro.c.the remaining appellees filed a rule b motion to dismiss,alleging that certain of appellants claims failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted based on dohsa preemption.
the district court issued a ruling granting these motions,holding that dohsa preempts appellants state law and general maritime causes of action for wrongful death.more specifically,the district court held that dohsa applies to noncommercial aircraft accidents beyond three nautical miles from shore,and that presidential proclamation,proclamation,which extended the territorial sea of the united states from three to twelve nautical miles from shore,did nothing to alter dohsa applicability.in its holding,the district court relied on sotomayor dissent in the seminal case of in re air crash off long island,new york,on july,cir hereinafter the twa flight case,and declined to follow the majority opinion.pursuant to appellants request,the district court certified the decision for interlocutory appeal,as a case of first impression in our circuit.
we review the district court judgment de novo.see knieval espn,cir dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b is reviewed de novo dunlap credit protection ass n,cir dismissal on the pleadings pursuant to rule c is reviewed de novo.
dohsa provides a federal statutory remedy for wrongful death occurring at sea.the current version of the statute reads 
when the death of an individual is caused by wrongful act,neglect,or default occurring on the high seas beyond nautical miles from the shore of the united states,the personal representative of the decedent may bring a civil action in admiralty against the person or vessel responsible.the action shall be for the exclusive benefit of the decedent spouse,parent,child,or dependent relative.
the parties do not dispute that,under this provision,any accident occurring within three nautical miles from the shore of the united states is not subject to dohsa remedial scheme.nor do the parties dispute that dohsa is applicable to all accidents occurring more than twelve nautical miles from the shore of any state.the parties disagree,however,as to whether dohsa applies to the intermediate area between three and twelve nautical miles from united states shores,where the helicopter accident in this case occurred because dohsa has been held to preempt all other remedies for wrongful death occurring on the high seas,dooley korean air lines,this issue is of considerable importance to future victims of accidents occurring in this area.
only one of our sister circuits has squarely addressed the issue of dohsa applicability to this area.in the twa flight case,the second circuit held that high seas as used in dohsa refers to those waters that lie beyond united states territorial waters,that is,international waters,at,and that proclamation,by extending territorial waters from three to twelve nautical miles from shore,effectively changed the of dohsa applicability to twelve nautical miles from shore.id.at.sotomayor,however,dissented,reasoning that congress had no intention of imputing the definition of high seas as it was used for purposes of international law into the statute,but rather used the term in connection with beyond a marine league to make clear the geographical boundary three nautical miles from shore beyond which dohsa should apply.id.at.under sotomayor reasoning,dohsa scope was unaffected by proclamation,and its boundary remains at three nautical miles from shores.
the issue on which the twa flight case majority mainly relied,and which primarily divides the parties in our case,is the definition of the term high seas as it is used in dohsa text.appellants argue that high seas is a political term that excludes all united states territorial waters.appellees,on the other hand,argue that high seas is a geographical boundary referring to all waters beyond the mark.
unfortunately,the text of dohsa does not reveal how high seas is defined for purposes of the statute,leaving it subject to different interpretations.indeed,both sides find support for their proffered definition in the relevant,case law.compare scotland,defining high seas as where the law of no particular state has exclusive force,but all are equal deslions la compagnie generale transatlantique,same old dominion gilmore,stating that high seas are outside the territory,in a place belonging to no other sovereign american banana united fruit,stating high seas are subject to no sovereign with ross mcintyre,noting that the high seas includes waters on the without the boundaries of mark,but also equating the term with the area out of the jurisdiction of any particular state the manila prize cases,same.
we conclude that we need not resolve this disagreement and assign a firm meaning to the term high seas in order to decide the issue of dohsa applicability.instead,the question before us can be solved by looking to the plain text of the current statute.
a plain reading of the statutory text leads to the conclusion that the boundary beyond which dohsa applies remains at three nautical miles from shores.to review,the current version of dohsa reads when the death of an individual is caused by wrongful act,neglect,or default occurring on the high seas beyond nautical miles from the shore of the united states,the personal representative of the decedent may bring a civil action in admiralty against the person or vessel responsible.emphasis added.the intended boundary of dohsa applicability,then,is plainly stated within the statute text dohsa applies beyond nautical miles from the shore of the united states.although the statute also uses the term high seas to describe the scope of the enacted remedial scheme,there is no indication that this term was meant to incorporate into the statute the independent and fluid political concept of territorial waters.instead,a more natural reading indicates that the term high seas is defined for purposes of the statute by the explicitly stated geographic boundary of beyond three nautical miles from shore.because the precise starting point of the high seas was apparently subject to dispute when dohsa was enacted,see supra,it makes sense for us to construe the term in conjunction with the stated geographic boundary,or three nautical miles from shore.high seas,however,has no apparent,independent geographical significance,other than perhaps to emphasize that the boundary beyond which dohsa applies is the point where territorial waters ended at the time of enactment.
recent congressional action amending the text of dohsa lends further support to this interpretation.first,dohsa wa
