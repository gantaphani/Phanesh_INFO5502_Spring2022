background 
on february,the motor tanker ship beffen departed paulsboro,new jersey,carrying a cargo of base oil for delivery to lagos,nigeria.a bill of lading for the shipment issued on that date indicated that the shipper was chemlube international,chemlube and that the cargo was destined for delivery to ibeto in lagos.the bill of lading incorporated the charter agreement between chemlube and bryggen for carriage of the shipment aboard the beffen as follows this shipment is carried under and pursuant to the terms of the charter party dated december between chemlube international,as charterer and bryggen shipping and trading as owner and all conditions and exceptions whatsoever thereto.the charter party fixture incorporated the provisions of two other standard form asbatankvoy tanker charter party and the chemlube terms dated september.
the asbatankvoy provisions included the following 
any and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this charter shall be put to arbitration in the city of new york or in the city of london whichever place is specified in part i of this charter pursuant to the laws relating to arbitration there in force,before a board of three persons,consisting of one arbitrator to be appointed by the owner,one by the charterer and one by the two so chosen.the decision of any two of the three on any point or points shall be final.either party hereto may call for such arbitration by service upon any officer of the other,wherever he may be found,of a written notice specifying the name and address of the arbitrator chosen by the first moving party and a brief description of the disputes or differences which such party desires to put to arbitration.
the chemlube terms included a provision for arbitration to be in london,english law to apply.
the base oil shipment allegedly was contaminated with seawater when the beffen arrived in the port of lagos on march.ibeto,as receiver of the shipment,instituted an action against bryggen and the beffen in the federal district court of nigeria on march.on a later visit to nigeria,the beffen was arrested by ibeto.security was posted for release of the vessel in the form of a bank guaranty issued by the union bank of nigeria on july.it appears that,in december,ibeto claim for its loss was paid by the paul fire marine insurance company,which is now subrogated to the rights of ibeto and is presently acting in the name of its subrogor.settlement negotiations with the defendants thereafter were conducted.while negotiations were proceeding,according to counsel for ibeto,out of an excess of caution and to protect the time for suit,arbitration was demanded in london and suit was commenced in new york.
the london arbitration demand was made by clyde on behalf of ibeto in a facsimile transmission to bryggen dated march.the demand nominated an arbitrator and included the following language 
we now call upon you to join in the appointment of a sole arbitrator in respect of all and any claims arising under the above bills of lading in accordance with the reference to arbitration to be in london at clause of the chemlube terms dated september which form part of the charter note dated december which,in turn,is incorporated into the bills of lading contracts.
the action giving rise to this appeal was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york by the filing of a complaint on march.according to the complaint,the action was brought as an admiralty and maritime claim within the meaning of rule h of the federal rules of civil procedure to recover damages sustained by ibeto in the sum of.an amended answer,filed by defendants on august,included affirmative defenses and two counterclaims.in the first counterclaim,defendant sought an order declaring that plaintiffs claims are required to be arbitrated in london and enjoining further proceedings in other fora inconsistent with the agreement to arbitrate.in their second counterclaim,defendant sought to limit any recovery by ibeto to the sum of in accordance with the carriage of goods by sea act cosga,app.defendant was notified by ibeto on august,that ibeto had closed the arbitration proceeding it had begun in london five months earlier and intended to pursue the action it had commenced in nigeria.to this end,ibeto filed a motion on september,for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the action commenced in the southern district of new york.
in addition to opposing ibeto motion for dismissal,on september,bryggen filed its own motion,seeking an order dismissing or staying plaintiffs claim in favor of london arbitration and enjoining litigation of th eir dispute in nigeria,or,in the alternative,declaring that any recovery shall be limited to the limitation of liability,and granting to bryggen such other and further relief as may be just and proper.the district court opinion and order responding to the motions of the parties was filed on november.ibeto petrochem.indus.beffen,d.
the district court first addressed ibeto motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to.a,which requires court permission to dismiss after service of an answer.in denying the motion,the court observed that t he presence of counterclaims weighs against granting ibeto motion to dismiss,reasoning that the counterclaims would continue to stand if the action were dismissed.ibeto,d at.the court further observed that ibeto intent to litigate this matter in nigeria also counsels against granting the voluntary dismissal,since allowing two actions to go forward could result in inconsistent determinations.id.
the district court next determined that the provision for arbitration made part of the charter party through the asbatankvoy form and the chemlube terms was binding on ibeto as well as the defendants.id.although ibeto was not a subscriber to the charter party,it was bound by the bill of lading to abide by the charter party terms,which included arbitration in london.id.at.in the opinion of the district court,the broad terms of the arbitration provision and the general federal policy favoring that mode of dispute resolution required ibeto to arbitrate its loss claim in london.id.accordingly,the court opinion and order compelled arbitration of the dispute between the parties and stayed this action pending completion of the arbitration.
as to the defendants motion to limit ibeto recovery to under cogsa,the district court determined that b ecause defendants motion to compel arbitration has been granted,it is not necessary to reach the issue of limiting ibeto recovery.id.at.the district court stated while cogsa is contractually incorporated in the asbatankvoy terms,under the chemlube terms the london arbitrator is to apply english law,so it will be for the arbitrator to determine whether and to what extent cogsa applies.id.internal citation omitted.accordingly,the motion to limit recovery was denied.
finally,the district court examined various factors bearing upon defendants motion to enjoin ibeto litigation in nigeria.first,the court determined that the federal policy of promoting arbitration may be frustrated by such litigation.see id.at.second,disparate results might obtain because,according to a declaration submitted by a nigerian barrister,the nigerian court would not recognize the cogsa limitation of liability.see id.at.the district court stated that cogsa may be applied in the london arbitration and that the potential
