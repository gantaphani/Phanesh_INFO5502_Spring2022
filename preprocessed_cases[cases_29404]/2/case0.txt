the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca creates a comprehensive scheme to pay compensation for an eligible employee disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the united states.benefits for most types of disabilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an injured employee is newly awarded compensation.c.the lhwca requires employers to pay benefits voluntarily,without formal administrative proceedings.typically,employers pay benefits without contesting liability,so no compensation orders are issued.however,if an employer controverts liability,or an employee contests his employer actions with respect to his benefits,the dispute proceeds to the department of labor office of workers compensation programs owcp to be resolved,if possible,through informal procedures.an informal disposition may result in a compensation order.if not resolved informally,the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge alj,who conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order.
in fiscal year,petitioner roberts was injured at an alaska marine terminal while working for respondent services.except for six weeks in voluntarily paid roberts benefits until fiscal year.roberts then filed an lhwca claim,and controverted.in fiscal year,an alj awarded roberts benefits at the fiscal year statutory maximum rate.roberts sought reconsideration,contending that the award should have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for fiscal year,when,he argued,he was newly awarded compensation by order of the alj.the alj denied his motion,and the department of labor benefits review board affirmed,concluding that the pertinent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences.the ninth circuit affirmed.
held an employee is newly awarded compensation when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits,no matter whether,or when,a compensation order issues on his behalf.
a roberts contends that the statutory term awarded compensation means awarded compensation in a formal order,while and the director,owcp,maintain that it means statutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.although can be interpreted either way,only and the director interpretation makes a working part of the statutory scheme.under roberts interpretation,no employee receiving voluntary payments has been awarded compensation,so none is subject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.that result is incompatible with the lhwca design.section b caps compensation at twice the applicable national average weekly wage,as determined by the secretary of labor.section b,in turn,directs the secretary to determine that wage before each fiscal year begins,at which time it becomes the applicable national average weekly wage for the coming fiscal year.and c,in its turn,provides that the secretary determination shall apply to those newly awarded compensation during such fiscal year.through a series of,the three provisions work together to cap disability benefits.by its terms,and subject to one express exception,b specifies that the cap applies globally,to all disability claims.because all three provisions interlock,the cap functions as congress intended only if c also applies globally,to all such cases.roberts interpretation would give c no application in the many cases in which no formal orders issue.
using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the lhwca administrative structure.an employer must be able to calculate the cap in order to pay benefits within days of notice of an employee disability,see b,and in order to certify to the department of labor whether the maximum rate is being paid.similarly,an owcp claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the applicable cap.it is difficult to see how an employer or claims examiner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.moreover,applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled advances the lhwca purpose to compensate disability,defined as incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.it also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated employees roberts reading would permit two employees who earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to receive different maximum compensation rates based on the happenstance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years.finally,applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims process.if the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the cap,the fact that the national average wage rises each year with inflation would be unduly significant.roberts rule would reward employees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate,while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments.
b roberts counterarguments are unconvincing.first,although the lhwca sometimes uses award to mean award in a formal order,the presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,readily yields whenever,as here,the variation in the word use in the lhwca reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different parts of the act with different intent.see general dynamics land systems,cline.
second,roberts argues that,because this court has refused to read the statutory phrase person entitled to compensation in g to mean person awarded compensation,estate of cowart nicklos drilling,the converse must also be true awarded compensation in c can not mean entitled to compensation.but cowart reasoning does not work in reverse.cowart did not construe c or award,see,at,and it did not hold that the groups of employees entitled to compensation and employees awarded compensation were mutually exclusive,see,at.
finally,roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the lhwca purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative proceedings.but his remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their employees injuries,because they would owe benefits under the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to file claims.the more measured deterrent to employer delay is interest that accrues from the date an unpaid benefit came due.

justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca or act,ch,stat,as amended,et,caps benefits for most types of disability at twice the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an injured employee is newly awarded compensation.c.we hold that an employee is newly awarded compensation when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits,no matter whether,or when,a compensation order issues on his behalf.
the lhwca is a comprehensive scheme to provide compensation in respect of disability or death of an employee if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the united states.metropolitan stevedore rambo,quoting a.an employee compensation depends on the severity of his disability and his preinjury pay.a totally disabled employee,for example,is entitled to of his preinjury average weekly wage as long as he remains disabled.a b.
section,however,sets a cap on compensation disability benefits shall not exceed twice the applicable national average weekly wage.b.the national average weekly wage the national average weekly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonagricultural payrolls,is recalculated by the secretary of labor each fiscal year.b.for most types of disability,the applicable national average weekly wage is the figure for the fiscal year in which a beneficiary is newly awarded compensation,and the cap remains constant as long as benefits continue.c 
consistent with the central bargain of workers compensation regimes limited liability for employers certain,prompt recovery for employees the lhwca requires that employers pay benefits voluntarily,without formal administrative proceedings.once an employee provides notice of a disabling injury,his employer must pay compensation periodically,promptly,and directly without an award,except where liability to pay compensation is controverted.a.in general,employers pay benefits without contesting liability.see pallas shipping agency,duris.in the mine run of cases,therefore,no compensation orders issue.
if an employer controverts,or if an employee contests his employer actions with respect to his benefits,the dispute advances to the department of labor office of workers compensation programs owcp.see cfr.the owcp district directors are empowered to amicably and promptly resolve such problems by informal procedures.a district director informal disposition may result in a compensation order.a.in practice,however,many pending claims are amicably settled through voluntary payments without the necessity of a formal order.intercounty constr.walter.if informal resolution fails,the district director refers the dispute to an administrative law judge alj.see cfr.an alj decision after a hearing culminates in the entry of a compensation order.c e 
in fiscal year,petitioner dana roberts slipped and fell on a patch of ice while employed at respondent services marine terminal in dutch harbor,alaska.roberts injured his neck and shoulder and did not return to work.on receiving notice of his disability,except for a period in voluntarily paid roberts benefits absent a compensation order until fiscal year.when discontinued voluntary payments,roberts filed an lhwca claim,and controverted.in fiscal year,after a hearing,an alj awarded roberts benefits at the statutory maximum rate of per week.this was twice the national average weekly wage for fiscal year,the fiscal year when roberts became disabled.
roberts moved for reconsideration,arguing that the applicable national average weekly wage was the figure for fiscal year,the fiscal year when he was newly awarded compensation by the alj order.the latter figure would have entitled roberts to per week.the alj denied reconsideration,and the department of labor benefits review board or brb affirmed,concluding that the pertinent maximum rate is determined by the date the disability commences.app.to pet.for cert.the ninth circuit affirmed in relevant part,holding that an employee is newly awarded compensation within the meaning of c when he first becomes entitled to compensation.roberts director,owcp,per curiam.we granted certiorari,to resolve a conflict among the circuits with respect to the time when a beneficiary is newly awarded compensation,and now affirm 
roberts contends that awarded compensation means awarded compensation in a formal order.supported by the director,owcp,responds that awarded compensation means statutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.the text of c,standing alone,admits of either interpretation.but our task is to fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole.ftc mandel brothers.only the interpretation advanced by and the director makes a working part of the statutory scheme supplies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment of similarly situated beneficiaries and avoids gamesmanship in the claims process.in light of these contextual and structural considerations,we hold that an employee is newly awarded compensation when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits under the act,no matter whether,or when,a compensation order issues on his behalf.
we first consider whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil.the lhwca does not define awarded,but in construing the act,as with any statute,we look first to its language,giving the words used their ordinary meaning.ingalls shipbuilding,director,office of workers compensation programs,quoting moskal united states.at first blush,roberts position is appealing.in ordinary usage,award most often means give by judicial decree or assign after careful judgment.webster third new international dictionary see also,black law dictionary ed.grant by formal process or by judicial decree 
but award can also mean grant,or confer or bestow upon.webster third new international dictionary,at see also ibid.ed.same.the lhwca grants benefits to disabled employees,and so can be said to award compensation by force of its provisions.indeed,this court has often said that statutes award entitlements.see,astrue ratliff,slip,at referring to statutes that award attorney fees to a prevailing party barber thomas,appendix to majority opinion slip,at statute awards credits to federal prisoners new energy of limbach,ohio statute awards a tax credit pacific employers ins.industrial accident comm n,california workers compensation statute award s compensation for injuries to an employee see also,connecticut doehr,rehnquist,concurring in part and concurring in judgment materialman and mechanic lien statutes award an interest in real property to workers similarly,this court has described an employee survivors as having been newly awarded death benefits by virtue of the employee death,without any reference to a formal order.director,office of workers compensation programs rasmussen,quoting c predecessor provision,d ed.
in short,the text of c,in isolation,is indeterminate.
statutory language,however,can not be construed in a vacuum.it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.davis michigan of treasury.in the context of the lhwca comprehensive,reticulated regime for worker benefits in which plays a pivotal role awarded compensation is much more sensibly interpreted to mean statutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.
section governs compensation in all lhwca cases.as explained above,see supra,at,the lhwca requires employers to pay benefits voluntarily,and in the vast majority of cases,that is just what occurs.under roberts interpretation of c,no employee receiving voluntary payments has been awarded compensation,so none is subject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.that result is incompatible with the act design.section b caps c ompensation for disability or death other than compensation for death required to be paid in a lump sum at twice the applicable national average weekly wage,as determined by the secretary under paragraph.section b,in turn,directs the secretary to determine the national average weekly wage before each fiscal year begins on october and provides that s uch determination shall be the applicable national average weekly wage for the coming fiscal year.and c,in its turn,provides that d eterminations under subsection b with respect to a fiscal year shall apply to those newly awarded compensation during such fiscal year.through a series of,the three provisions work together to cap disability benefits.
by its terms,and subject to one express exception,b specifies that the cap applies globally,to all disability claims.but all three provisions interlock,so the cap functions as congress intended only if c also applies globally,to all such cases.see,fda brown williamson tobacco,a court must interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme quoting gustafson alloyd.if roberts interpretation were correct,c would have no application at all in the many cases in which no formal orders issue,because employers make voluntary payments or the parties reach informal settlements.we will not construe c in a manner that renders it entirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances.trw andrews.
recognizing this deficiency in his reading of c,roberts proposes that orders issue in every case,so that employers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their employees become disabled.this is a solution in search of a problem.under settled lhwca practice,orders are rare.roberts interpretation would set needless administrative machinery in motion and would disrupt the congressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation and informal dispute resolution.the incongruity of roberts proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a vehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case.section c,on which roberts relies,applies only if an employee has filed a claim.likewise,cfr a applies only in the case of a claim or an employer notice of controversion.see.we doubt that an employee will file a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his employer in securing a lower cap.and we will not read c to compel an employer to file a baseless notice of controversion.a,d providing for assessment of attorney fees and costs against employers who controvert unsuccessfully.roberts suggests that employers could threaten to terminate benefits in order to induce their employees to file claims,and thus initiate the administrative process.construing any workers compensation regime to encourage gratuitous confrontation between employers and employees strikes us as unsound.
using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the lhwca administrative structure.section b requires an employer to pay benefits within days of notice of an employee disability.to do so,an employer must be able to calculate the cap.an employer must also notify the department of labor of voluntary payments by filing a form that indicates,inter alia,whether the maximum rate is being paid.of labor,form,payment of compensation without award,online at.on receipt of this form,an owcp claims examiner must verify the rate of compensation in light of the applicable cap.see of labor,longshore dlhwc procedure manual b hereinafter longshore procedure manual,online at.it is difficult to see how an employer can apply or certify a national average weekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.an employer is powerless to predict when an employee might file a claim,when a compensation order might issue,or what the national average weekly wage will be at that later time.likewise for a claims examiner 
moreover,applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled advances the lhwca purpose to compensate disability,defined as incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.emphasis added.just as the lhwca takes the average weekly wage of the injured employee at the time of the injury as the basis upon which to compute compensation,it is logical to apply the national average weekly wage for the same point in time.administrative practice has long treated the time of injury as the relevant date.see,of labor,pamphlet,workers compensation under the longshoremen act compensation payable under the act may not exceed of the national average weekly wage,applicable at the time of injury online at of labor,workers compensation under the longshoremen act,pamphlet same see also,of labor,lhwca bulletin,national average weekly wage for particular fiscal year applies to disability incurred during that fiscal year 
applying the national average weekly wage at the time of onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated employees.under roberts reading,two employees who earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day could be entitled to different rates of compensation based on the happenstance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years.we can imagine no reason why congress would have intended,by choosing the words newly awarded compensation,to differentiate between employees based on such an arbitrary criterion.
finally,using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims process.if the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the cap,the fact that the national average weekly wage typically rises every year with inflation,see,supra,would become unduly significant.every employee affected by the cap would seek the entry of a compensation order in a later fiscal year.even an employee who has been receiving compensation at the proper rate for years would be well advised to file a claim for greater benefits in order to obtain an order at a later time.likewise,an employee might delay the adjudicatory process to defer the entry of an order.and even in an adjudicated case where an employer is found to have paid benefits at the proper rate,an alj would adopt the later fiscal year national average weekly wage,making the increased cap retroactively applicable to all of the employer payments.roberts candidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such perverse incentives.see tr.of oral arg.we decline to adopt a rule that would reward employees with windfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative proceedings,while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory obligations.
we find roberts counterarguments unconvincing.
first,roberts observes that some provisions of the lhwca clearly use award to mean award in a formal order,and contends that the same must be true of awarded compensation in c.we agree that the act sometimes uses award as roberts urges.section a,for example,refers to the payment of compensation to the person entitled thereto,without an award,foreclosing the equation of entitlement and award that we adopt with respect to c today but the presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.general dynamics land systems,cline,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also,united states cleveland indians baseball.here,we find the presumption overcome because several provisions of the act would make no sense if award were read as roberts proposes.those provisions confirm today holding because they too,in context,use award to denote a statutory entitlement to compensation because of disability.
for example,c provides that p roper and equitable compensation not to exceed shall be awarded for serious disfigurement.roberts argues that c necessarily contemplates administrative action to fix the amount of the liability and direct its payment.reply brief for petitioner.in roberts view,no disfigured employee may receive benefits without invoking the administrative claims process.that argument,however,runs counter to preface,which directs that c ompensation for disability shall be paid to the employee,and to a,which requires the payment of compensation without an award.it is also belied by employers practice of paying c benefits voluntarily.see,newport news shipbuilding dry dock,wl,brb,per curiam evans bergeron barges,wl,brb,per curiam.in light of the lhwca interest in prompt payment and settled practice,awarded in c can only be better read,as in c,to refer to a disfigured employee entitlement to benefits.
likewise,d provides that if an employee who is receiving compensation for a scheduled dies before receiving the full amount of compensation to which the schedule entitles him,the total amount of the award unpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the benefit of his survivors.see also d.roberts interpretation of award would introduce an odd gap only survivors of those employees who were receiving schedule benefits pursuant to orders not survivors of employees who were receiving voluntary payments would be entitled to the unpaid balances due their decedents.there is no reason why congress would have chosen to distinguish between survivors in this manner.and the benefits review board has quite sensibly interpreted d to mean that an employee has a vested interest in benefits which accrue during his lifetime,and,after he dies,his estate is entitled to those benefits,regardless of when an award is made.wood ingalls shipbuilding,brbs,per curiam 
finally,b provides for the purpose of this subsection,the term award with respect to a compensation order means a formal order issued by the deputy commissioner,an administrative law judge,or board.unless award may mean something other than award in a compensation order,this specific definition would be unnecessary.roberts contends that this provision,enacted in,was indeed unnecessary in light of pallas shipping.brief for petitioner see,at the term compensation order in the lhwca refers specifically to an administrative award of compensation following proceedings with respect to the claim roberts argument offends the canon against superfluity and neglects that b defines the term award,whereas pallas shipping defines the term compensation order.moreover,congress definition of award,which tracks roberts preferred interpretation,was carefully limited to b.had congress intended to adopt a universal definition of award,it could have done so in,the lhwca glossary.read in light of the duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,duncan walker,internal quotation marks omitted,b debunks roberts argument that the act always uses award to mean award in a formal order and confirms that award has other meanings.
next,roberts notes that this court has refused to read the statutory phrase person entitled to compensation in g to mean person awarded compensation.see estate of cowart nicklos drilling,a person entitled to compensation need not be receiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his favor in roberts view,the converse must also be true awarded compensation in c can not mean entitled to compensation.but cowart reasoning does not work in reverse.cowart did not construe c or the term award,but relied on the uniform meaning of the phrase person entitled to compensation in the lhwca.see,at.as just explained,the lhwca contains no uniform meaning of the term award.moreover,cowart did not hold that the groups of employees entitled to compensation and employees awarded compensation were mutually exclusive.the former group includes the latter the entry of a compensation order is a sufficient but not necessary condition for membership in the former.see,at.
finally,roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the lhwca purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative proceedings.but roberts remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their employees injuries.these employers would owe benefits under the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to file claims.and roberts remedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiaries entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.
the more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is interest that accrues from the date a benefit came due,rather than from the date of the alj award.matulic director,owcp.the director has long taken the position that interest is a necessary and inherent component of compensation because it ensures that the delay in payment of compensation does not diminish the amount of compensation to which the employee is entitled.sproull director,owcp,see also,strachan shipping wedemeyer.moreover,t imely controversion does not relieve the responsible party from paying interest on unpaid compensation.longshore procedure manual,online at.indeed,the alj awarded roberts interest on each unpaid installment of compensation from the date the compensation became due.app.to pet.for cert,order 
we hold that an employee is newly awarded compensation when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits,no matter whether,or when,a compensation order issues on his behalf the judgment of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is affirmed.

opinion of ginsburg,
dana roberts,petitioner services,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice ginsburg,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
section of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca or the act defines the maximum disability benefit an injured worker may receive under the act.specifically,states that an injured employee may receive,at most,twice the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which the employee is newly awarded compensation.c.the court granted review in this case to answer the following question when is an employee newly awarded compensation 
petitioner dana roberts contends that an employee is newly awarded compensation in the year she receives a formal compensation award.for the reasons cogently explained by the majority,that argument is untenable.see ante,at.unlike the court,however,i do not regard as reasonable respondent services view that an employee is newly awarded compensation in the year she becomes statutorily entitled to compensation.ante,at.applying the common meaning of the verb award and recognizing the act distinction between benefits paid voluntarily,and those paid pursuant to a compensation order,see ante,at,i would hold that an injured worker is newly awarded compensation when the employer voluntarily undertakes to pay benefits to the employee,or an administrative law judge alj,the benefits review board brb,or a reviewing court orders the employer to pay such benefits.
in determining the meaning of a statutory phrase,we look first to its language,giving the words used their ordinary meaning.moskal united states,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.as the court acknowledges,ante,at,the verb award ordinarily means to give by judicial decree or to assign after careful judgment.webster third new international dictionary.see also black law dictionary ed.defining the verb award as t o grant by formal process or by judicial decree giving award this usual meaning,an employee is newly awarded compensation,if not voluntarily paid,in the fiscal year in which payment is directed by administrative order or judicial decree.
under the lhwca,the court recognizes,an employee is provided compensation voluntarily or in contested proceedings.see ante,at.most commonly,an employer pays compensation voluntarily after receiving an employee notice of disabling injury.see pallas shipping agency,duris,describing the form,content,and timing of the necessary notice and requiring employers to designate a representative to receive the notice b.if an employer declines to pay compensation voluntarily,an injured employee can file a claim with the department of labor office of workers compensation programs owcp.for employees with valid claims,owcp proceedings culminate with an administrative or court decision ordering the employer to pay benefits.c.thus,an injured worker is given or awarded compensation through one of two means contemplated by the act either the employer voluntarily pays compensation or is officially ordered to do so.logically,then,the worker is newly awarded compensation when one of those two events occurs.
the court does not take this approach.after acknowledging that it is not relying on the typical meaning of the word award,see ante,at,the court adopts view that awarded compensation is synonymous with became statutorily entitled to benefits,ante,at.as a result,a person is newly awarded compensation in the year in which she becomes entitled to benefits,in the year the employee first becomes disabled.ibid.such a reading is plausible,the court asserts,because this court has often said that statutes award entitlements.ante,at citing cases.
i do not dispute that statutes are often characterized as awarding relief to persons falling within their compass.but a statute must be read in its context.ante,at quoting davis michigan of treasury.section does not address whether the lhwca,as a general matter,awards disability benefits to injured longshore workers.rather,it concerns a more specific question when has a particular employee been newly awarded compensation.in that context,equating awarded compensation with statutorily entitled to compensation is not plausible.a person covered by the act would not likely say he was awarded compensation the moment he became disabled,if,in fact,his employer contests liability.only after some entity the employer,an alj,the brb,or a reviewing court recognizes the employee right to compensation would he comprehend that he had been awarded compensation.to borrow the chief justice example no person who slips and injures herself on a negligently maintained sidewalk would tell her friends the next day,guess what,i was newly awarded money damages yesterday.see tr.of oral arg.
the inconsistency between the court interpretation of newly awarded compensation and my reading of the phrase is best illustrated by contextual example.assume an employee is injured in and the employer refuses to pay compensation voluntarily.then,five years later,an alj finds in favor of the employee and orders the employer to pay benefits to the employee.under the court view,the employee was newly awarded compensation in,even though the employee did not receive a penny and the employer was not obligated to pay a penny until.only the most strained interpretation of newly awarded could demand that result 
the court view,moreover,does not fit the act design.as explained supra,at,the act envisions that an eligible employee will begin receiving benefits in either of two ways.the court interpretation disregards this design,assuming instead that all employees are awarded benefits in the same way by the act at the time they become disabled.
section c legislative history further confirms that congress intended newly awarded compensation to have its commonsense meaning.in describing,the senate committee on labor and public welfare reported 
section c states that determinations of national average weekly wage made with respect to a fiscal year apply to employees or survivors currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits,as well as those who begin receiving compensation for the first time during the fiscal year.emphasis added.
congress therefore believed an injured worker is newly awarded compensation in the year in which she begin s receiving compensation for the first time.ibid.again,an employee begins receiving compensation either when an employer voluntarily agrees to pay the employee benefits or when an alj,the brb,or a court orders the employer to do so.see supra,at.when the employer resists payment,the employee will not necessarily begin receiving compensation in the year in which she becomes disabled.
finally,interpreting newly awarded compensation to mean awarded through an employer voluntary decision or an official order is consistent with the act goal of encouraging employers to pay legitimate claims promptly.see a requiring employers to pay compensation periodically,promptly,and directly estate of cowart nicklos drilling,blackmun,dissenting t he act presumes that employers,as a rule,will promptly recognize their lhwca obligations and commence payments immediately.under my interpretation,an employer who chooses to contest a valid claim,rather than to pay the claim voluntarily,runs the risk that it may ultimately have to pay the injured employee a higher maximum benefit.for example,if an employer refuses to pay benefits to a worker injured in,and an alj issues an order awarding compensation to the employee in,the fiscal year maximum rate would apply to the employee claim.had the employer voluntarily begun paying benefits in,on the other hand,the maximum rate would apply.under the court reading,by contrast,an employer pays the prevailing rate for the year the employee became disabled,regardless of whether the employer in fact pays benefits immediately or years down the road 
in this case,roberts was injured on february,and stopped working two weeks later.app.to pet.for cert.and its insurer paid benefits to roberts from march,until july,at.then resumed paying benefits on september,and continued to pay roberts compensation until may,when it ceased making payments for good.ibid.after roberts filed a complaint with the owcp,an alj,in october,concluded that roberts was entitled to compensation from march,onwards,at.
applying my interpretation of,roberts was newly awarded compensation three times in march when voluntarily began paying benefits in september when resumed making payments after it had stopped in july and in october when an alj ordered to pay benefits to roberts for the uncompensated weeks in and from may onwards.roberts was therefore entitled to the fiscal year maximum rate from march,until july,the fiscal year maximum rate from september,until may,and the fiscal year going forward and for all uncompensated weeks covered by the alj order 
for the foregoing reasons,i would reverse the ninth circuit judgment and hold that an employee is newly awarded compensation when her employer either voluntarily agrees to pay compensation to her or is officially ordered to do so.

compensation for disability or death other than compensation for death required to be paid in a lump sum shall not exceed an amount equal to per centum of the applicable national average weekly wage,as determined by the secretary under paragraph.

justice ginsburg view,not advanced by any party,is that an employee is awarded compensation when his employer voluntarily pays compensation or is officially ordered to do so.post,at opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.but reading awarded compensation as synonymous with receiving compensation is farther from the ordinary meaning of award than the court approach a person who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained sidewalk would not say that she had been awarded money damages if the business responsible for the sidewalk
