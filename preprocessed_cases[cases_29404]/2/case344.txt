deering,employed as a riverboat pilot by national,sued it for injuries he sustained in an accident.national counterclaimed for serious damage that it alleged deering had caused the,sinking it.the district court dismissed the counterclaim,precipitating national interlocutory appeal,which presents questions of admiralty law and of jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in admiralty cases.on the day of the accident march,with the mississippi river at flood stage jim salter,towns along mississippi river prepare for springtime flooding,southeast missourian,visited,deering was having trouble controlling the towboat that he was operating to move barges at a national drydock facility.he claims that as a consequence of national negligence the steering mechanism on the towboat was defective,that he warned his supervisor that the defect made the maneuvers that he had been directed to perform unsafe in conditions,but that the supervisor ordered him to continue.because of the difficulty of controlling a towboat with a defective steering mechanism in such conditions,the boat became wedged at a dangerous angle against the barge that it was towing.another boat approached to offer assistance,but at excessive speed.at the last minute,to avert a collision,its captain threw its engines into reverse,which caused a surge of water that swamped deering boat.the boat sank rapidly with deering still on board and he was swept underneath the adjoining barge.he survived,but suffered injuries that ended his career as a riverboat pilot.
he sued national in an illinois state court under the jones act.the admiralty counterpart to the federal employers liability act,the jones act states that a seaman injured in the course of employment may elect to bring a civil action at law,with the right of trial by jury,against the employer.laws of the united states regulating recovery for personal injury to a railway employee apply to an action under this section.deering also sought relief under the general admiralty law,like common law which however is inapplicable to maritime activities,that unless displaced by statute governs those activities.general admiralty law entitles an injured seaman to maintenance shelter until he recovers and cure treatment,plus lost irrespective of any negligence on his,if his injury was caused by the unseaworthiness of the ship on which he was injured,to damages comparable to those available in a nonmaritime personal injury suit,the osceola,subject to the partial defense of comparative negligence.pope talbot,hawn,churchwell bluegrass marine,cir see generally norfolk shipbuilding drydock garris.the parties ignore deering general admiralty claims we discuss them briefly later.
national filed a petition in federal district court under the limitation of liability act,et,which so far as bears on this case limits a shipowner liability to the ship value.a.national contends that the towboat,though worth before it sank,has a salvage value of only,and it seeks to limit its liability to deering to that amount.we take no position on the merits of either the limitation of liability claim or deering personal injury claim,both of which remain pending in the district court.
the district judge ordered deering state court action stayed,and deering then refiled his jones act and general admiralty law claims in the district court.national counterclaimed,seeking damages of the figure should really,one would think,be,in recognition of the towboat salvage value but we ignore that point,as do the parties.national claims that the accident in which the towboat sank was at least partially attributable to negligence on the part of deering.
deering moved to dismiss the counterclaim.the judge granted the motion on the ground that counterclaims in the nature of setoffs to jones act claims are forbidden.national appeals under a,which allows interlocutory appeals determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.before taking up the merits of the appeal we must satisfy ourselves that it is within our jurisdiction.
the original and still central purpose of section a is to allow the determination of liability to be appealed before relief is ordered.the reason is that relief in an admiralty case is traditionally determined in a separate proceeding before a special master called a commissioner in admiralty,and often that proceeding is protracted and therefore costly,wingerter chester quarry,cir per curiam,though more commonly so in cases involving collisions,salvage,towage,insurance,or general average than in cases of personal the counterclaim does seek damages for the destruction of a ship,albeit a small one.
although section a does not say that all rights and liabilities of the parties must be decided before an appeal can be taken,most cases say that its application should hew closely to the original purpose that we just described,id.at evergreen int l usa standard warehouse,cir.the reason is the disfavor in which interlocutory appeals in federal cases generally are held.but this concern has diminished force in a case in which an interlocutory admiralty order resembles the kind of nonmaritime interlocutory order that would be appealable,albeit only with the consent of the district court,under b which also requires the consent of the court of appeals or.b consent not required by section a.the issue presented by national appeal is a controlling question of law,b,and also an issue that arises from a separate claim within the meaning of.b in both respects it is the kind of interlocutory appeal that is frequently allowed even in nonmaritime cases.
and note that whether national should be allowed to counterclaim for property damage is a separate issue from the merits of either deering personal injury claim or national limitation of liability claim.the facts of the counterclaim and the facts of deering claim are entwined but none of the facts bears on the issue of law presented by national appeal.a number of admiralty cases allow interlocutory appeals in circumstances such as these.continental casualty anderson excavating wrecking,cir shipping paul fire marine ins,cir stewart dutra construction,cir,reversed on other grounds,in re complaint of nautilus motor tanker,and cir kesselring arctic hero,cir.
there is another jurisdictional issue,however national notice of appeal was untimely.but it had filed a rule e motion in the district court within the period for appealing from the dismissal of the counterclaim,and as the motion contained all the information that a notice of appeal is required by rule c of the appellate rules to like the appeal brief held in smith barry,to do service for a notice of motion likewise sufficed.
so we have jurisdiction,and proceed to the merits.
general admiralty law,like common law,creates liability for negligent damage to property.but shipowners,unless they are trying to reduce or eliminate their liability for personal injuries caused by their negligence,do not sue their employees for property damage except in the very rare case in which the employee is so highly paid as to be worth suing.in the case of seamen,even when they are riverboat pilots rather than just deckhands,such suits are,as in this case,the seaman is seeking damages from the employer.as a practical matter,then,a suit or counterclaim by a shipowner against a seaman is a setoff against the seaman personal injury claim the question is whether such a setoff is permissible.
setoffs in personal injury suits by employees are addressed in section of the federal employers liability act,which like the rest of that statute is incorporated into the jones act by reference.section says that any contract,rule,regulation,or device whatsoever,the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this chapter,shall to that extent be void provided,that in any action brought against any such common carrier under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this chapter,such common carrier may set off therein any sum it has contributed or paid to any insurance,relief benefit,or indemnity that may have been paid to the injured employee or the person entitled thereto on account of the injury or death for which said action was brought.national counterclaim,the only purpose of which could be to exempt itself from liability to deering as further shown by its not having sued the pilot of the boat who contributed to the accident by approaching national towboat at an excessive against whom deering has filed a complaint for negligence,is a good description of a device the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable the shipowner to exempt itself from any liability created by the jones act.in a filing in the district court national itself called its counterclaim a setoff.
the setoff proviso in section supports the inference that the word device embraces all setoffs with the exceptions irrelevant to this case specified in the proviso,as otherwise there would be no need for an express exclusion.ordinarily we would put little weight on this point lest we be attributing an unrealistically high degree of precision and care to legislative draftsmen in an era in which congressional staffs were rudimentary.but when the fela was enacted,a railroad right to recover damages from an employee on account of property damage caused by the employee negligence was limited,either in law or as a matter of custom,to setoffs whether or not formally denominated as such against claims by employees for unpaid wages.william murphy,sidetracking the fela the railroads property damage claims.this suggests that the setoff proviso in section may indeed have been based on an understanding that the courts would deem any property claim by a railroad that had the effect of a setoff against an employee personal injury claim to be a forbidden device.hence the need to carve out from the prohibition of setoffs in section those that congress wanted to permit.
moreover,when the fela was enacted most property claims by railroads against their employees were based on the employees having expressly assumed in their employment contracts liability for damaging the employer property,and therefore fell under the contract bar of section.id.it would be surprising if congress had meant to countenance an identical result based on a tort right asserted by employers to which the worker had not waived objections in his employment contract.
national argues that the phrase any device whatsoever must be confined to documents that are just like a contract,rule,or regulation.in so arguing it invokes the rule of interpretation known as eiusdem generis latin for of the same kind.but like most rules of interpretation this one is not so much a rule as an item in a checklist of considerations bearing on the sensible interpretation of a document.words in a string often are intended to bear similar meanings.but not not in this instance.the fact that the statute tacks whatsoever on to any device is a clue that device is a,harrison ppg industries,in recognition of the incentive of employers to get around the fela generous relative both to the common law of torts and workman compensation injured employees.the fact that congress did think to say that a counterclaim for property damage was a forbidden device for extinguishing the employer liability for injuries to his employees confirms the wisdom of including a.
anyway national device is much like the first word in the string contract.national counterclaim has the same effect as would a provision in its employment contract with deering waiving national liability under the jones act if he was injured in an accident that caused property damage to of course such a contractual provision would be unenforceable.so why should a differently named device of identical purpose and consequence likewise be unenforceable 
the destructive effect on an employee personal injury claim of accepting national position would be magnified by two features of admiralty law that have no counterpart in a counterclaim in an fela case comparative negligence and limitation of liability.although the fela substitutes comparative for contributory negligence as a defense to the employer liability to an injured employee,defenses against a counterclaim for property damage are governed by state law,which may or may not substitute comparative for contributory negligence as a defense to the counterclaim defendant liability in this case,deering liability in negligence for causing the towboat to sink,were that proved.but an admiralty counterclaim for property damage would,as we see,always be subject to a defense of comparative negligence.and under comparative negligence national damages would merely be reduced rather than eliminated by proof that its negligence had contributed to the accident.
to appreciate the significance of this point,suppose that national negligence was percent responsible for the sinking of its towboat and deering negligence percent responsible.four percent of the loss from the boat sinking is only.but that more than national liability to deering on account of his liability capped,national claims,at.so deering,although seriously injured and in the present posture of the case we must assume seriously injured because of negligence by national,would end up not with positive damages or even zero damages but with negative damages he would owe national money.that would be like the outcome in cook francisco.an injured railroad conductor was awarded in the railroad,which counterclaimed for property damage,was awarded million in damages,leaving the plaintiff with no recovery and a large,though doubtless an uncollectible,debt.see cavanaugh western,cir dissenting opinion.
ordinarily the effect of the statutory limitation of liability conjoined with a counterclaim for property damages would not be so dramatic.the ship would not be sunk and so the shipowner liability to the seaman would not be limited to a low amount remember the limitation is to the value of the ship and the amount of property damage caused by the seaman would be small and so the offset to the plaintiff personal injury claim would also be small.but rarely in such cases would the shipowner bother to counterclaim for property damage other than as a means of pushing up the seaman litigation costs and so forcing him either to abandon his suit or settle for a nominal amount.this is only the third reported maritime appeal involving a counterclaim to a personal injury claim in the history of the jones act.
in the first,lines,mcmahon,cir,the propriety of the counterclaim was assumed rather than discussed anyway the counterclaim was based on a contract rather than on tort law.the second case is discussed in the next paragraph.there are a few analogous cases,as we see,under the fela,but not many.the poverty of cases should allay anxiety that seamen who damage their employer property will seek immunity by filing trivial jones act claims a claim that the seaman cut his finger and seeks reimbursement for the cost of a,for example.the employer will not sue a seaman for damage to property except as a setoff to a substantial claim of damages for personal injury.
national places all its eggs in a basket called withhart otto candies,cir.the district judge in the present case refused to consider withhart because he mistakenly believed that a judge of this court had criticized him in another case for citing a decision by a court of appeals other than our court of appeals.what is true is that district judges are bound by the decisions of the court of appeals for their circuit unless inconsistent with decisions of the supreme court,but when as in this case there is no controlling decision by their own court of appeals they should of course give respectful consideration to decisions by other courts.
withhart was much like this case though with an important distinction,as we see.the court held that a counterclaim against a seaman for property damages is not a device within the meaning of section of the fela.for this conclusion it relied primarily on cavanaugh western,cir a decision by a divided cited judge hall dissent earlier.cavanaugh in turn had relied
