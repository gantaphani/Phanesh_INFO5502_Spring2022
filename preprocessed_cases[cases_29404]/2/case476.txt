this case calls for us to decide whether an admiralty statute that requires the master of a fishing vessel to make an agreement in writing with each crewmember before a voyage also requires the master signature on the agreement.although the predecessor statute dates from the late,surprisingly,this is a question of first impression in the ninth circuit.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of a seaman who was employed under a contract that the master did not sign.the district court held that the contract was invalid because the statute required this signature.we agree and affirm.
background 
united states seafoods employed joe harper on its fishing vessel seafreeze alaska in early.the seafreeze alaska is a factory trawler that operates out of alaska,in the bering sea.united states seafoods hired harper through its seattle office,and its recruiting and hiring coordinator signed the employment contract on behalf of the company.it is undisputed that the vessel master did not sign this contract.
harper and two other crewmembers filed an action on behalf of themselves and a putative class against united states seafoods in personam,and the seafreeze alaska in rem collectively,primarily claiming that their contracts were defective harper moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether his contract was invalid under.in a carefully considered order,the district court granted the motion,reasoning that the statute unambiguously required the master to sign.order on plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment,harper united states seafoods,no,wl.because there was no evidence that the master had in any way participated in drafting the agreement,the court declined to consider whether the statute could be satisfied by some participation short of signing the agreement.the district court specifically declined to rule on damages,if any.id.at.

discussion 
this case presents a pure question of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.see silver sage partners,city of desert hot springs,cir.following the direction of the supreme court in duncan walker,d,we look first to the text of the statute,which is clear and unambiguous 
a before proceeding on a voyage,the master or individual in charge of a fishing vessel,fish processing vessel,or fish tender vessel shall make an sic fishing agreement in writing with each seaman enployed sic on board if the vessel is 
at least gross tons as measured under section of this title,or an alternate tonnage measured under section of this title as prescribed by the secretary under section of this title and 
on a voyage from a port in the united states.
b the agreement shall be signed also by the owner of the vessel.
c the agreement shall 
state the period of effectiveness of the agreement 
include the terms of any wage,share,or other compensation arrangement peculiar to the fishery in which the vessel will be engaged during the period of the agreement and 
include other agreed terms.
the unambiguous text of,which is supported by its historical development,requires the master to sign the agreement.the written agreement is a street.where there is a valid agreement,wages are determined according to contract and the crewmembers have only six months within which to file suit on in rem claims.and,where there is no controlling written agreement,wages are based on a statutory formula the higher of the amount agreed to or the highest rate of wages at the port where the seaman was engaged.
historical backdrop of written contracts and 
statutory protection of the seafarer right to a written contract dates back to one of the first acts of congress,and descends from that venerable tradition.bank conaway,cir.in,congress provided that cod fishermen would be entitled to a statutory share of the fishing vessel proceeds unless the skipper or master thereof shall,before he proceeds on any fishing voyage,make an agreement in writing or in print,with every fisherman employed therein which agreement shall be endorsed or countersigned by the owner.act of,ch,stat.the legislation went on to provide t hat where an agreement or contract shall be so made and signed,the vessel would be liable for six months to the fishermen for their share.id.this protection was extended to mackerel fishermen in,march,extension act,stat,and the statute was codified as.see caffray v.the cornelia kingsland.this provision was then codified at,the immediate predecessor to.as amended over the years,read,just prior to its repeal in 
the master of any vessel in the cod or mackerel fisheries shall,before proceeding on such fishing voyage,make an agreement in writing with every fisherman who may be employed therein such agreement shall be indorsed or countersigned by the owner of such fishing vessel or his agent.
cases under the predecessor acts refer to the master signature,suggesting that our interpretation of the successor statute,is consistent with the historical interpretation.see,united states atkins,cas,noting that a paper was signed by the master and fishermen and countersigned by the owner crowell united states,cas,holding an agreement invalid because it was not in writing or print,signed by the master,and countersigned by the owner whalen v.the silver spring,cas,noting valid agreements were signed by the captain and three men.the requirement of a master signature was thus assumed in prior case law.
section,which updated the statute language and extended its coverage beyond the cod and mackerel industry to all fishing vessels,was enacted as part of the commercial fishing industry vessel safety act of,titled an act to provide for the establishment of additional safety requirements for fishing industry vessels,and for other purposes,stat.the only legislative history relates to safety and limitation of liability.the history of this statute thus illustrates that the requirement of the master signature was carried forward from the second congress.
ii.construction of 
we next turn to the text of to construe what congress has enacted.duncan.at.in a related context,we have previously held that this provision is perfectly clear facially.bank,at.we again conclude that the plain text is controlling if the language of a statute is clear,we look no further than that language in determining the statute meaning.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the only exception would be for absurd or impracticable consequences,which are not present here.
the requirement in a that the master and the seaman make a fishing agreement in writing facially requires both parties to sign the agreement.more generally,requires that the fishing agreement contain certain substantive provisions.for example,the agreement must include the period of effectiveness and the terms of any wage,share,or other compensation arrangement.c.it is thus consistent to read a as imposing a concrete requirement that the master sign the agreement.
to make an agreement,at least as applied to a written contract,is to execute the agreement in due form.as the district court noted,the pertinent definition from black law dictionary is to legally perform,as by executing,signing,or delivering a document.black law dictionary ed.the most relevant definition in webster also supports a signature requirement,defining make as enact,establish to execute in an appropriate manner draw up awill a deed of transfer.webster third new int l dictionary unabridged.making a written agreement is no different.indeed,the parties agree that executing a contract requires signing it.
our interpretation of this provision is bolstered in the statute second paragraph,which requires that t he agreement shall be signed also by the owner of the vessel.b our analysis of plain meaning includes an examination of the language and design of the statute as a whole.seldovia native ass luja
