selya,circuit judge.in this maritime personal injury case,the district court awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages for past and future harms totaling nearly.adding insult to injury,the court tacked on prejudgment interest at the rhode island state rate of per annum and entered judgment in the plaintiff favor for.the defendant appeals,challenging both the damages award and the prejudgment interest increment.
after careful consideration,we find the award of damages to be unimpugnable.the award of prejudgment interest,though,presents greater complications with respect to that award,we tackle a question of first impression within this circuit and,following the resolution of that question,affirm the interest award in part and reverse it in part.the tale follows.
background 
we rehearse the relevant facts as found by the district court,see nevor moneypenny holdings,llc,wl,consistent with record support.kenneth nevor was once a professional sailor.his experience included sailing,racing,and transporting racing yachts.his skillset extended to maintaining and repairing sailboats,their mechanical equipment,and their electronic gear.
nevor began sailing as a boy and by the age of had participated in a number of elite racing events worldwide.at the time of the mishap giving rise to this action,nevor was an employee of moneypenny holdings,llc moneypenny,which owned a sailing vessel called the vesper and a motor support vessel called the odd job.
in march of,nevor was part of a crew preparing the vesper for a regatta in the caribbean.the vesper was travelling in the british virgin islands when the members of the crew learned that they but not the boat needed to return to thomas to clear customs.to facilitate this process,the odd job met the vesper with a view toward carrying some crewmembers back to shore.when the odd job pulled up alongside the vesper,the vesper captain directed some of the crew including nevor to transfer from the vesper to the odd job.the wind was blowing at between eight and twelve knots normal for that time of year but the sea was choppy.still,the captain did not lash the odd job and vesper together before proceeding with the transfer.
as nevor disembarked the vesper to board the odd job,the boats separated.nevor slipped,grasping the vesper lifeline as he reached for the odd job with his foot.he was able to complete the transfer,but the stress on his right arm caused his bicep to tear from the bone.
nevor stayed with the vesper for two weeks after his injury to assist with race preparations.he then returned stateside to undergo surgery.once the operation was performed,he completed six months of physical therapy.even after he had finished the prescribed course of therapy,his treating physician found residual atrophy in the reattached muscle.several months later,nevor visited another specialist who determined that nevor right arm remained weaker than his left and was unlikely to improve.this specialist concluded that nevor could not do the heavy lifting that his previous job demanded.
in june of,nevor invoked admiralty jurisdiction,see,and sued moneypenny in rhode island federal district court his complaint alleged negligence under the jones act,see,and unseaworthiness under general maritime law.
following a bench trial,the district court wrote a thorough and closely reasoned rescript stating its findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court awarded nevor in damages for loss of earnings and loss of future earning capacity and for pain,suffering,and mental anguish see nevor,wl,at.the court subsequently granted nevor motion to add prejudgment interest to the damages award.this increment,which totaled,brought the aggregate judgment to plus costs.
these consolidated appeals ensued in them,moneypenny concedes liability but challenges several of the monetary components of the judgment.
ii.analysis 
moneypenny claims of error fall into two broad categories.first,it offers various reasons why the award of damages should be deemed excessive.second,it assails the prejudgment interest award as totally inappropriate and,alternatively,says that no prejudgment interest should accrue on damages for future harm.we address these claims sequentially.
as an opening salvo,moneypenny blasts the district court stated basis for awarding economic damages lost wages and prospective loss of earning capacity.in its words,the court factual findings were clearly erroneous and premised on inadmissible speculation.
in the aftermath of a bench trial,we review the district court factual findings for clear error.see reliance steel prods.fire ins,cir.we will set aside those findings only if,on the entire evidence,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.citation omitted.whether we would have reached the same result as the district court is not the issue w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.id.at quoting anderson city of bessemer city.
this deferential standard of review applies with unabated force when a district court findings depend wholly or in part on expert testimony.when judges act as factfinders,they are given considerable leeway in choosing among the views of experts and in determining the weight and value to be assigned to the opinions of each expert.reilly united states,cir.
at trial,the parties presented detailed information about the sailing industry,as well as expert testimony about nevor physical limitations,projected wages,past and future earning capacity,vocational capabilities,and expectancy.with respect to nevor projected wages and lost earning capacity the focal points of the district court economic damages calculation nevor experts testified that at the time of the accident he was at the cusp of joining the ranks of the sailors who earned between and per year.this evidence was consistent with the fact that,in the first three months of the year of his injury,nevor already had earned just shy of working for moneypenny.the experts went on to explain that nevor was one of only maybe a thousand people competing internationally at an elite level and that he had the skills and strength required to advance.similarly,they opined that,but for the injuries sustained in the accident,nevor could have remained employed as a sailor for several decades 
of course,this evidence did not go unrebutted.moneypenny presented expert testimony that nevor sustained virtually no loss in earning capacity as a result of the accident and that,even if not injured,he was unlikely to earn more than per year as a sailor.
the district court sided with nevor experts.it concluded that,but for the injuries sustained in the accident,nevor would have continued to be employed in sailing and would have advanced as a professional sailor in his chosen field if he had not been injured.nevor,wl,at.in reaching these conclusions,the court found persuasive the testimony voiced by nevor witnesses regarding his vocational capabilities,earning capacity,and expectancy.
in this venue,moneypenny asseverates that the compiled record offered no reliable means of predicting the duration of nevor sailing career,the positions which he may have held,or the income which he might have earned.and although moneypenny concedes that it might have been possible for nevor to reach sailing upper echelon and earn the wages commensurate with sailing at that level,it insists that the evidence fell well short of the reliable demonstration benchmark set by the supreme court.see jones laughlin steel pfeifer,explaining that a lthough it may be difficult to prove when,and whether,a particular injured worker might have received wage increases,they may be reliably demonstrated for some workers.
contrary to moneypenny importunings,a reliable demonstration does not demand proof positive.forecasting future losses necessarily requires the trier to sift through the projections of experts,gauge the credibility of witnesses,and draw reasonable inferences from the facts.see johnson watts regulator,cir.reliance steel,at.while robes and gavels,not tea leaves or crystal balls,are the tools of a trial judge trade,some degree of speculation is inherent in any such forecast.a reliable demonstration demands only that the court prediction is reasonable,given the facts in the record.here,we must give due weight to the court determinations of witness credibility,its findings as to the relative persuasiveness of various experts,and its appraisal of competing facts.see reliance steel,at.
viewed through this prism,we find plentiful support in the record for the court determination that nevor had in prospect a racing career that was likely to be long and successful and lost it due to the injuries sustained in the accident.consequently,we decline moneypenny invitation to the district court founded determination that the evidence reliably demonstrated that nevor was likely to move further up the ranks.in the last analysis,that determination depended upon a weighing of conflicting evidence,and such an appraisal falls peculiarly within the trial court ken.see reilly,at.
moneypenny next argues that nevor failure to attend a specialized vocational rehabilitation program constituted a breach of his duty to mitigate damages and should have reduced his damages award.the district court saw the matter differently and did not reduce the award on this account.
at the threshold,we note that mitigation is in the nature of an affirmative defense.see allied int l,int l longshoremen ass n,cir.thus,moneypenny bore the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that nevor failed to take reasonable steps to hold down his losses.id.as the proponent of an affirmative defense,moneypenny also bore the risk of equipoise.mcaninch.
on appeal,moneypenny ascribes two errors to the district court refusal to credit its mitigation defense.we start with its suggestion that the district court was obligated to give a fuller explanation of its ruling.
the civil rules provide that,after a bench trial,the court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately.fed.civ.a.this rule,however,has practical limits.a district court is not required to make findings on every detail,is not required to discuss all of the evidence that supports each of the findings made,and is not required to respond individually to each evidentiary or factual contention made by the losing side.addamax open software,cir.the court findings are adequate as long as they make plain the basis for its disposition of the case.valsamis,cir.
here,the district court explained in considerable detail the basis for its findings on liability,concluding that moneypenny was liable under both the jones act for negligence and general maritime law for unseaworthiness.see nevor,wl,at.it then set forth again,in considerable detail the basis for its calculation of damages.see id.at.those calculations rejected,albeit implicitly,moneypenny mitigation defense the upshot is that the court found the facts with particularity,stated its legal conclusions plainly,and explained in no uncertain terms its disposition of the case.no more was exigible to satisfy the requirements of rule a.see damon sun,cir.see also banerjee bd.of trs.of smith,cir.
the second branch of moneypenny mitigation defense is its claim that the evidence required a finding of failure to mitigate.we disagree the district court implicit conclusion that moneypenny mitigation defense did not hold water is adequately supported in the record.
the relevant facts are susceptible to succinct summarization.moneypenny introduced evidence that one of nevor doctors prescribed a round of vocational rehabilitation sessions that nevor did not attend.nevor countered that he was never notified about this proposed regimen.he also introduced evidence that,even if he had been notified,the therapy was unavailable the rehabilitation center that he was directed to attend treated only injuries unlike nevor arising under state workers compensation law.we think it a commonsense proposition that a plaintiff can not be charged with a failure to mitigate damages when the suggested mitigation measure is unavailable to him.
what is more,the record is replete with testimony that,far from avoiding therapy,nevor avidly sought it out.on one occasion,he asked his doctor to refer him for an additional round of physical therapy.at other times,he sought therapy on his own.
the short of it is that the district court faced a determination on the mitigation issue,couched in evidence that lent itself to multiple interpretations.where,as here,the conclusions of the trier depend on its election among conflicting facts or its choice of which competing inferences to draw from undisputed basic facts,appellate courts should defer to such findings,absent clear error.reliance steel,at alteration in original quoting irons fbi,cir.such deference is appropriate in this instance,and we discern no clear error in the court implicit conclusion that nevor was not guilty of failing to mitigate his damages.
this brings us to moneypenny claim that the award of damages for pain and suffering,mental anguish,and the like is excessive and unsupported by the evidence.the court ultimate conclusion the monetization of nevor harms is assayed for abuse of discretion.see limone united states,cir.describing such a conclusion as a classic example of a judgment call.such an award will stand unless it shock s our collective conscience or raise s the specter of a miscarriage of justice.id.at.
we conclude that the district court damages award finds sufficient purchase in the record.nevor offered ample evidence showing that he underwent significant pain and suffering,that his quality of life was reduced,and that he experienced lasting physical and emotional distress long after the accident.he submitted to a painful surgery,endured a lengthy recovery,attended months of physical therapy sessions,and was forced to limit his physical activities.moreover,nevor faces the prospect of lasting consequences because his injuries including some residual scarring have been found to be permanent.
damages are notoriously difficult to quantify.t here is no scientific formula or measuring device which can be applied to place a precise dollar value on pain,suffering,and other items of intangible harm.limone,at quoting wagenmann adams,cir.given what nevor has experienced and what he predictably faces,we find the district court award to be within the wide universe of reasonable awards.though generous,the award is proportional to the weight of the evidence and is neither nor a harbinger of a miscarriage of justice.indeed,it is consistent with awards in analogous cases.see,bielunas misty dawn,cir.affirming award of over in damages where plaintiff sustained painful foot injury that resulted in disability.
for these reasons,the district court damages award must be affirmed in full.
moneypenny assignments of error can be divided into two tranches.first,moneypenny submits that the successful jones act claim should have precluded any award of prejudgment interest.second,moneypenny submits that even apart from his jones act argument the district court should not have granted nevor any prejudgment interest with respect to damages for future harm.we address these matters one by one,affording de novo review to questions of law and review to judgment calls.see limone,at.
we preface our discussion of specific issues with a synopsis of the applicable legal doctrine.a seaman injured during the course of his employment may recover damages under a variety of statutory and theories,including as pertinent here the jones act and general maritime law.the jones act provides a cause of action for a seaman injured through his employer negligence.see.whether a plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on an award of damages under the jones act,however,is open to question.the prevailing view appears to be that,in pure jones act suits,recovery of prejudgment interest is not permitted see petersen chesapeake ohio ry,cir.our court has not squarely addressed this issue.
the situation is quite different with respect to general maritime law.under that body of law,there is a cause of action for injuries resulting from the unseaworthiness of a vessel on which a seam
