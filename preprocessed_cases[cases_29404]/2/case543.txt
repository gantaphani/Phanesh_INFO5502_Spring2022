plaintiff ned chartering trading,brought this case against the republic of pakistan and its ministry of food and agriculture,contending that pakistan was required to pay it the proceeds of wheat shipments to which plaintiff was entitled as assignee of a maritime contract.the district court granted summary judgment against pakistan for plus interest that pakistan had instead paid to the assignor of the contract.pakistan contends that the district court erred in not delaying its ruling on the motion for summary judgment in order to give it an opportunity to take further discovery.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling without extending the discovery period,we affirm.
in,the republic of pakistan entered into a maritime contract,known as a charter party,with horsebridge enterprises,of gibraltar for the shipment of wheat from turkey to pakistan.ned chartering,a washington,corporation,acted as shipbroker and loaned horsebridge the money to charter the vessels that were to transport the wheat.the loan agreement contained an assignment,whereby in exchange for the loan it received from ned chartering,horsebridge assigned its right to the proceeds of the charter party to ned.pakistan was to make its charter party payments through a letter of credit drawn in favor of ned.
pursuant to the charter party and assignment,as the wheat arrived pakistan paid of the amount it owed horsebridge directly to ned chartering.pakistan retained,pending necessary adjustment for demurrage and additional freight charges.rider clauses to charter party at at.before final payment was made,disputes arose between pakistan and horsebridge concerning the amount of the adjustments,and between horsebridge and ned chartering concerning the amounts due between them.both ned chartering and horsebridge pressed pakistan for payment,and horsebridge assured pakistan that it would indemnify the republic against any claims made by ned.ultimately,horsebridge persuaded pakistan to pay it the amount still owed for the final delivery of the wheat,which totaled.by the time pakistan paid horsebridge,on or about october,the letter of credit had expired.
ned chartering initially sued horsebridge,contending that the latter owed it for payment due under the loan agreement.although ned prevailed,horsebridge turned out to be judgment proof.ned then turned to pakistan.on october,it sued pakistan and its ministry of food and agriculture for failing to pay it the final installment under the assignment agreement.pakistan,in turn,filed a complaint against horsebridge.pakistan,however,was unable to serve process on horsebridge,and the district court struck the complaint on march.in the meantime,the parties conducted some discovery,including the exchange of interrogatories and document requests.
on may,ned chartering filed a motion for summary judgment against pakistan.pakistan opposed summary judgment on two grounds that by the time the final proceeds were paid,the assignment was void because the letter of credit had expired and that it needed time to conduct further discovery.the district court rejected the first contention because,under the unambiguous language of the assignment agreement,pakistan obligation to pay was continuing and the letter of credit was only one means of making payment.the court rejected the second contention for two reasons pakistan had already had sufficient discovery,and had failed to demonstrate how the further discovery it request ed would produce any issues of material fact.ned chartering trading,republic of pakistan,mem.op.at at.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in favor of ned chartering.
in this court,pakistan has abandoned its argument based on the expiration of the letter of credit,and relies instead on its second contention,that the district court should not have ruled against it without permitting time for further discovery we review such claims solely for abuse of discretion by the district court.see,carey canada,columbia cas.we conclude that either of the two reasons given by the district court for denying further discovery was sufficient to justify its decision,and that neither represents an abuse of discretion.
the district court concluded that the more than eighteen months that passed between the date ned chartering filed its complaint and the date it filed its motion for summary judgment were sufficient for the parties to complete discovery.although summary judgment should only be entered after adequate time for discovery,celotex catrett,d,we grant district courts great latitude in determining how much time is adequate,and would be hard pressed to find that limiting discovery to eighteen months was an abuse of discretion in this case.pakistan sought an extension of time in order to identify any defenses horsebridge may have had against ned chartering.ned chartering,mem.op.at at.specifically,pakistan asserted a need to depose the president of ned chartering,nadeem ikramullah.appellants br.at.pakistan offers no reason to believe that it should have taken more than eighteen months to accomplish that kind of discovery.see naartex consulting watt,holding that a district court does not abuse its discretion in denying permission to conduct additional discovery when the party has had ample opportunity to take discovery.
pakistan does note that,at the time ned chartering moved for summary judgment,the court had not yet set a discovery deadline.the absence of a deadline,however,was not a license to delay completion until one was set.moreover,on april,before the filing of the motion for summary parties filed a joint report pursuant to local rule,which requires counsel to meet and discuss a date for completion of all discovery.that joint report established a schedule for the filing of the summary judgment motion ned chartering was to file for summary judgment within the next two weeks,pakistan was to have thirty days to file an opposition,and ned was to have fifteen days in which to reply.see joint of the parties,appellee br.app.at.the report declared that t hese dates are mutually acceptable to the parties,and recited that both parties have already taken some discovery and no material facts remain in dispute.id.at.the court adhered to this schedule,and pakistan therefore has no cause for complaint.
on appeal,pakistan contends that,because attorneys are not clairvoyant,it could not foresee the discovery it would need until it saw ned chartering summary judgment motion.appellants reply br.at.but pakistan did not mention the limits of its attorneys predictive powers when it agreed to the schedule of the joint report,does not now cite anything in ned motion that its attorneys did not anticipate,and suggests no reason why the relevance of any defenses that horsebridge may have had against the plaintiff was not as apparent before ned filed as it was afterwards.
pakistan also notes that the district court did not strike its complaint against horsebridge until march,and contends that i t made no sense for pakistan to conduct discovery concerning ned chartering transactions with horsebridge while there remained a prospect that horsebridge would become a party to the action.appellants br.at.pakistan does not explain why it made no sense to conduct that discovery before learning whether it would be able to join horsebridge.if ned chartering transactions with horsebridge afforded pakistan a defense to ned action on the assignment,presumably they did so regardless of whether horsebridge was a defendant.and even if conducting discovery before the court ruled on the complaint did not make sense,pakistan does not explain why it did not initiate discovery during the six weeks that passed between the time the court struck the complaint and the date ned chartering filed for summary why it failed to seek more time in the joint report.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that pakistan had already had sufficient time to complete the discovery it needed to defend against plaintiff summary judgment motion.
the district court also denied pakistan request for a discovery extension on the g
