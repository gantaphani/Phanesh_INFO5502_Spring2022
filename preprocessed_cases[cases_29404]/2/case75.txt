this appeal arises from a payment dispute between worcester peat company worcester peat and federal marine terminals fmt over a stevedoring contract.fmt contracted to load peat for worcester peat onto a vessel for shipment to europe.after the loading was completed,the parties disagreed about the contract provision regarding the calculation of fmt fee.fmt charged worcester peat for the volume of peat it handled through the port based on the number of truckloads worcester peat had delivered and the volume of peat in each truck.however,worcester peat based its payment on the quantity of peat calculated by reference to the box volume,or total cubic capacity,of the vessel,a sum significantly less than the amount of fmt invoice.the district court found that the contract unambiguously stated that fmt was to be paid by the volume of peat handled,and not by the box volume of the shipping vessel,and entered judgment against worcester peat for nearly.the court also rejected worcester peat counterclaim for peat it alleges was lost during the loading process.
on appeal,worcester peat challenges the district court determination that the contract was unambiguous and argues that the court also erred in not charging fmt for demurrage and for peat worcester peat claims was lost due to fmt negligence in the loading process.finding no error in the district court rulings,we affirm.
worcester peat,a company located in deblois,maine,grows and sells peat moss.in september,worcester peat began exploring the possibility of selling peat to buyers in europe.with the assistance of a finnish broker,mikko valli,affiliated with an estonian company called biomix,worcester peat agreed to sell peat to blumenerdenwerk stender gmbh stender,a german company.the contract provided that stender would be responsible for chartering a ship to load the peat in maine and transport it to europe.stender contracted with another german company,schulte bruns,to secure a vessel.the contract between worcester peat and stender established an anticipated loading time of five days for the shipment of peat.worcester peat contracts with both biomix and stender provided that the cost of the peat would be calculated by reference to box volume of the ship,or its total capacity in cubic meters.
worcester peat then entered negotiations with fmt,the owner and operator of a cargo terminal in eastport,maine,to load the peat onto the vessel chartered by stender from schulte bruns.roland rogers,general manager of fmt,testified that fmt had never worked with peat and was unfamiliar with its properties.the parties exchanged a series of communications in the fall of regarding fmt prices and the plans for loading the vessel.fmt and worcester peat agree that their understanding during this negotiating process was that stender would provide a geared vessel,meaning one equipped with cranes and other machinery for loading the peat.
on december,fmt was informed that the vessel involved would not be a geared vessel as expected,but rather a vessel that would not be carrying the equipment needed to load the peat from the dock onto the ship.fmt attempted to locate cranes and other equipment to load the vessel.after a conversation between rogers and morrill worcester,president of worcester peat,worcester peat agreed to share in the cost of renting a crane up to the amount of.
worcester peat and fmt signed the stevedoring contract on december.that document provides,in relevant part federal marine terminals,eastport hereby agrees to handle your cargo of peat moss totaling cubic meters,approximately,for dollars in funds per cubic meter handled through eastport including the loading of the vessel.the contract also established a sliding fee scale such that the price per cubic meter would be lowered if fmt achieved a specified loading rate.finally,the contract provided,as the parties agreed,that worcester peat would pay up to for the rental cost of the crane.
the vessel charted by stender,the boris lianov,arrived in eastport on the night of december.fmt began loading the peat early the next morning.the weather conditions during the loading of the peat were exceptionally cold and windy.there was also precipitation in the form of both rain and snow,which caused the top layer of the peat to freeze.the wind blew so much peat into the air that visibility was limited at times.the ship captain ordered the doors of the holds closed a number of times due to wind and snow.the ship logs also indicate that loading was stopped on some occasions at the request of worcester peat.
two conveyor belts were used to load the peat into the ship holds.rogers testified that the intense cold created problems with the hydraulics of the conveyors,making it difficult to raise and lower them to align with the ship as the tide rose and fell.one conveyor belt became completely inoperable halfway through the loading process.some of the peat also froze,making it necessary to break up large chunks before the peat was put on the conveyor belts.
after fmt began loading the vessel,worcester peat offered fmt the use of a clamshell bucket,which fmt attached to a crane.the bucket was used to pick up peat from the loading area on the dock and dump it directly into the holds of the ship.fmt experienced fewer problems with the use of the clamshell bucket because the peat in the bucket was not as exposed to the wind as the peat on the conveyor belts.worcester peat also suggested that fmt cover segments of the conveyor belts with tarps to minimize the amount of peat blown away by the wind.
the boris lianov contained seven cargo holds.fmt loaded peat into them one hold at a time,shutting the doors for each hold after the hold had been filled with peat.however,fmt found that the peat settled,or recompressed,in the holds after loading,reducing its volume and requiring fmt to open the holds again and load more peat until the holds were full,a process that further slowed the loading.the work was finally completed on january,six days later than the loading period anticipated by worcester peat and stender.
fmt sent worcester peat an invoice for.rogers testified that he arrived at this figure by using information worcester peat supplied him regarding how many trucks brought peat to the terminal and the average volume per truck cubic yards or cubic meters.multiplying those figures,he concluded that fmt had handled cubic meters of peat at the price of per cubic meter,for a total of.however,worcester peat paid fmt only.this figure relied upon the box volume of the vessel,cubic meters.although worcester peat added as agreed for the rental of the two cranes,it deducted as a rental charge for the clamshell bucket it had offered to fmt,as well as a demurrage charge of that it had paid to stender.
invoking the district court admiralty jurisdiction,see,fmt filed a complaint against worcester peat on june,seeking recovery for the difference between the amount fmt charged and the amount worcester peat paid approximately.worcester peat filed a counterclaim alleging that fmt was liable for peat lost during the loading process.
following a bench trial,the district court found that the contract between fmt and worcester peat unambiguously stated that payment was to be calculated using the volume of peat handled and not,as worcester peat contended,the box volume of the vessel.accordingly,the district court found that fmt was entitled to a total of the court further held that worcester peat was not entitled to deductions either for fmt use of the clamshell bucket or for the demurrage charged to worcester peat by stender.finally,the district court found that worcester peat could not recover on any of its counterclaims because it had not established by a preponderance of the evidence either the amount of peat lost because of wind or the fact that fmt negligence caused that loss,or that any such loss exceeded worcester peat expected loss due to wind in the normal course of handling peat.subtracting the amount worcester peat had already paid to fmt,the district court entered judgment in favor of fmt in the amount of.
