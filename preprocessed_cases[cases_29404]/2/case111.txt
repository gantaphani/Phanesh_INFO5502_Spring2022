this case calls upon us to decide the circumstances in which a court pursuant to rule e or of the supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions of the federal rules of civil procedure the supplemental rules may reduce the amount held by maritime attachment.
transportes navieros y terrestres de tnt is a foreign company organized and operating under the laws of mexico.fairmount heavy transport fht is foreign entity organized under foreign law,with a principal place of business in the netherlands,and can not be found within the southern district of new york.tnt commenced this action on april,by filing a verified complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska,alleging that it had suffered significant monetary damages as a result of fht wrongful arrest of tnt vessel,the caballo azteca the vessel.that same day,the district court granted tnt prayer for an order for process of maritime attachment pursuant to rule b of the supplemental rules,authorizing attachment of fht property in an amount up to.thereafter,on fht motion,the district court reduced the amount of the maritime attachment to.

background 
a.the vessel arrest and tnt claimed damages 
the instant dispute arises from fht arrest of the vessel.at the time of the arrest,fht was engaged in the arbitration of a maritime dispute with oceanografia de osa.on november,fht arrested the vessel in a rotterdam shipyard as security for its claim against osa,believing that the vessel belonged to osa.tnt alleges that fht failed to investigate reasonably the ownership of the vessel and acted with reckless disregard of tnt rights in the vessel.
tnt claims that the vessel arrest prevented it from delivering the vessel as it had promised.according to tnt,it entered into a charter party the charter party with,llc,on december,that required tnt to deliver the vessel to port fourchon,louisiana,on march.when tnt and entered into the charter party,both had knowledge that the vessel was arrested in the rotterdam shipyard.tnt alleges that it brought the vessel to the rotterdam shipyard at some unspecified time prior to the commencement of the charter party for modifications so the vessel could meet the specifications of the charter party fht claims that the vessel had been in the rotterdam shipyard since october.
on may,six months after the vessel arrest and two months after the vessel was allegedly due in port fourchon,tnt first contacted fht to request that the arrest be lifted.fht took immediate action to lift the arrest the relevant authorities were notified on may that the arrest had been lifted.
tnt claims that it suffered in damages from fht wrongful arrest of the vessel.according to tnt,its damages claim is based on liquidated damages of of the charter party value million loss of net earnings under the charter party approximately million and other damages.
district court proceedings 
on april,tnt commenced the present action seeking an order of attachment pursuant to rule b of the supplemental rules,for the purpose of obtaining personal jurisdiction over fht and to secure tnt claim.tnt alleges that a criminal proceeding against fht is pending in mexico and claims that it will be able to recover its claimed damages in that proceeding.
the district court issued an order for process of maritime attachment on april,authorizing attachment of fht property in an amount up to.thereafter,tnt notified fht that of its funds had been restrained on april,pursuant to the order of attachment.on may,on fht motion,the district court issued an order to show cause why the maritime attachment should not be vacated or the amount of the attachment reduced.
by order entered july,the district court denied fht motion to vacate and granted its motion to reduce the attachment.the court refused to vacate the attachment because it concluded that tnt verified complaint alleged a proper admiralty claim against fht and fulfilled all of the other filing and service requirements of rules b and nonetheless,the court found good cause to reduce the amount of the attachment so that it reflect s the amount for which fht may be potentially held responsible to tnt,the amount that might be attributable to legal fees required to lift the wrongful arrest.the court concluded that fht could not be held responsible for the amount claimed by tnt in its complaint because tnt failed in its duty to mitigate its damages after the arrest had been effected.
tnt attempted to file a motion for reconsideration of the order reducing the attachment on july.that filing,however,was rejected because tnt had attempted to file both the motion and the supporting documents as one document.on july,a note was entered on the docket instructing tnt attorney to the motion to reconsider.tnt correctly filed the motion papers and the motion was shown on the docket sheet as filed on july.by order entered august,the district court denied the motion to reconsider.on september,tnt filed a notice of appeal from both the august order denying reconsideration and the july order reducing the amount of the attachment.
motion to dismiss 
fht moves to dismiss this appeal as untimely.tnt notice of appeal was filed within days of the entry of the august,order denying its motion for reconsideration,but more than days after the entry of the july,order,of which reconsideration was sought.under federal rule of appellate procedure a a,tnt notice of appeal is timely as to the july,order if tnt motion for reconsideration was timely filed.and tnt motion for reconsideration was timely filed if it was filed on or before july.e requiring a motion to alter or amend the judgment to be filed no later than business days after the entry of judgment city of hartford chase,cir noting that,however styled,a motion that draws into question the correctness of the district court judgment is considered to be a motion to alter or amend the judgment under civil rule e internal quotation marks omitted.
tnt argues that its motion was filed on july,despite deficiencies in the motion identified by the clerk of the court.fht contends that the motion was not filed until july,when the deficiencies were remedied and the motion complied with the applicable rules.
in contino united states,cir per curiam,we considered a notice of appeal to be timely where the appellant attempted to file the notice of appeal within the required,but it was rejected by the clerk for failure to comply with a local rule.specifically,the attempted filing was rejected because it was not in the prescribed form,having been filed electronically,rather than in hard copy.ultimately,we deemed the notice of appeal to have been filed on the date of the attempted filing where there wa s no indication that the appellant failure to submit the notice of appeal on paper was willful and,if the local rule were enforced,the appellant would lose the right to appeal.id.at citing.d the clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.and.a a local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.
in this case,tnt attempted to file its motion to reconsider within the required,but it was rejected by the clerk for failing to comply with a local rule regulating the motion form.because there is no indication that tnt failure to submit the motion for reconsideration in the proper form was willful and tnt would lose its right to appeal if the local rule regulating the form of the motion were enforced,we consider tnt motion for reconsideration to have been filed on july,the date of the attempted filing.accordingly,tnt notice of appeal was timely filed within days of the court disposition of a timely filed motion for reconsideration and fht motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely is denied.

maritime attachments generally 
the power to grant attachments in admiralty is an inherent component of the admiralty jurisdiction given to the federal courts under article iii of the constitution.id.at.thus,m aritime attachment is a feature of admiralty jurisprudence that antedates both the congressional grant of admiralty jurisdiction to the federal district courts and the promulgation of the first supreme court admiralty rules in.winter storm,at quoting aurora maritime abdullah mohamed fahem,cir.the historical purpose of maritime attachment is first,to gain jurisdiction over an absent defendant and second,to assure satisfaction of a judgment.aqua stoli,at.
the first uniform federal rules for admiralty and maritime proceedings admiralty rules were promulgated by the supreme court in.a revised version of the admiralty rules was released in.in,under the rules enabling act,the supreme court established the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims,a reformed and comprehensive codification of admiralty rules to govern the practice of the federal courts.aqua stoli,at.the supplemental rules have since been amended periodically the amendments are particularly relevant to the availability of maritime attachments.
rule b governs the process by which a party may obtain an ex parte order of maritime attachment.in relevant part,it provides 
if a defendant is not found within the district,a verified complaint may contain a prayer for process to attach the defendant tangible or intangible personal to the amount sued the hands of garnishees named in the process the court must review the complaint and affidavit and,if the conditions of this rule b appear to exist,enter an order so stating and authorizing process of attachment and garnishment.
supp.rule b.
once property has been restrained pursuant to an order of maritime attachment,rule e f provides a mechanism by which a person claiming an interest in attached property may seek to have the property released.rule e f states,in relevant part whenever property is arrested or attached,any person claiming an interest in it shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff shall be required to show why the arrest or attachment should not be vacated or other relief granted consistent with these rules.supp.rule e f.
under rule e,property restrained pursuant to an order of maritime attachment may be released on the giving of security.specifically,rule e provides 
whenever process of maritime attachment is issued the execution of such process shall be stayed,or the property released,on the giving of security t he court shall fix the principal sum of the bond or stipulation at an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the plaintiff claim fairly stated with accrued interest and costs but the principal sum shall in no event exceed i twice the amount of the plaintiff claim or ii the value of the property on due appraisement,whichever is smaller.
supp.rule e a emphasis added see also infra note.if security is taken by the court in lieu of attached property,rule e maintains that the court may,on motion and hearing,for good cause shown,reduce the amount of security given.supp.rule e emphasis added.
finally,a statutory provision also provides for the release of arrested or attached property on payment of a security.section of title of the united states code allows 
w henever a warrant of arrest or other process in rem is issued in any admiralty case,the united states marshal shall stay the execution of such process,or discharge the property arrested if the process has been levied,on receiving from the respondent or claimant of the property a bond or stipulation in double the amount claimed by the libellant,with sufficient surety,to be approved by the judge of the district court where the case is pending 
a emphasis added 
although none of the foregoing provisions provide for a motion to reduce an attachment,the relief sought by fht motion is identical in substance to a motion to set a security for the release of the attached property or to reduce the security.thus,we view the district court decision to reduce the amount of the attachment in this case as being governed by rule e,rule e and.
issuing and vacating maritime attachments 
this court defined the modern standard for the issuance and vacatur of maritime attachments under rule b and rule e f in aqua stoli.in the years immediately prior to that decision,district courts had taken a variety of approaches to the rule e f hearing.some vacated only those attachments that failed to comply with rule others followed a needs test,requiring the plaintiff to show that,even if the requirements of rule b had been met,the attachment wa s necessary to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant or to secure a potential judgment.aqua stoli,at footnote omitted.and the district court in aqua stoli had held that an attachment may be vacated if the defendant shows that the plaintiff sought the attachment to obtain a tactical advantage over the defendant or that the hardship to the defendant caused by the attachment outweighs the benefit to the plaintiff.id.at.thus,the question presented in aqua stoli was to what extent the district court may require a showing by the plaintiff beyond the simple fact that the textual requirements of rule b have been met.id.at.our analysis of this question began with the text of rule e f.because the text of the rule does not explain under what circumstances the district court should vacate the attachment,we considered the intent of the drafters of rule e f,the historical purpose of maritime attachment,and the historical practice of admiralty courts.after reviewing the historical practice and purpose of maritime attachments,w e h e ld that,once a plaintiff has carried his burden to show that his attachment satisfies the requirements of supplemental rule b,a district court may vacate an attachment only upon limited circumstances not present in this case.id.at.
under the admiralty rules of and and the version of rule b promulgated by the supreme court in,a plaintiff could obtain process of maritime attachment ex parte from the clerk of the district court,without the participation of a judge,winter storm,at,and the defendant had no clear right to contest an attachment,aqua stoli,at.
in,the supplemental rules were amended to address concerns that the prior practices were not consistent with the principles of due process.id.at.supp.rule e,advisory committee note amendment rule e f was designed to satisfy the constitutional requirement of due process by guaranteeing to the shipowner a prompt hearing at which he can attack the complaint,the arrest,the security demanded,or any other alleged deficiency in the proceedings.thus,w hile the practice of granting maritime attachments on an ex parte basis remains,rule b now requires the plaintiff to appear before a judge to procure an attachment.winter storm,at.and rule e f was added to provide a prompt hearing at which the defendant could contest the validity of the seizure.aqua stoli,at.
the advisory committee notes on the amendments explain that rule e f is based on local admiralty rules in the eastern,northern,and southern districts of new york.supp.rule e,advisory committee note amendment,which had provided a hearing at which a defendant could contest an attachment,see,for.cls,cited in aqua stoli,at.but while it is indisputable that the rule e f hearing was based on the hearing provided by local rule,it is unclear whether the supreme court meant to adopt the vacatur than simply the former local rule.aqua stoli,at see id.at the advisory committee notes nowhere intimate that the court was also adopting the standards for vacatur that the eastern and southern districts then practiced.thus,in aqua stoli,we rejected an argument that the amendment to rule e f was intended to adopt the standard for vacatur that the southern and eastern districts of new york applied at a hearing under local rule.nonetheless,we considered cases applying local rule for their persuasive value.id.
our review of cases applying local rule indicated that the local practice did not countenance a broad degree of equitable discretion in vacating maritime attachments.id.at.often,the determinative question at the local rule hearing was whether the textual requirements of the attachment rule were met.id.at.
we observed that the narrow standard for vacatur applied under local rule served the policies embedded in supplemental rule b and the historical purposes of maritime attachments.id.at.t he traditional policy underlying maritime attachment has been to permit the attachments of assets wherever they can be found and not to require the plaintiff to scour the globe to find a proper forum for suit or property of the defendant sufficient to satisfy a judgment.id.at.this policy,we explained,has been implemented by a relatively broad maritime attachment rule,under which the attachment is quite easily obtained.id.with this purpose in mind,we concluded that congress chose a determinate rule regarding the availability of attachment rather than a flexible standard to ensure that attachments may be obtained with a minimum of litigation.id.
ultimately,we held that a plaintiff can obtain an ex parte order of attachment of a defendant assets if,in addition to meeting filing and service requirements of rules b and e,the plaintiff shows that it has a valid prima facie admiralty claim against the defendant the defendant can not be found within the district the defendant property may be found within the district and there is no statutory or maritime law bar to the attachment.id.at footnote omitted.once a defendant property has been attached,the defendant can move to vacate the attachment under rule e f.and a district court must vacate an attachment if the plaintiff fails to sustain his burden of showing that he has satisfied the requirements of rules b and id.we suggested,in dicta,that 
a district court may vacate the attachment if the defendant shows at the rule e f hearing that the defendant is subject to suit in a convenient adjacent jurisdiction the plaintiff could obtain in personam jurisdiction over the defendant in the district where the plaintiff is located or the plaintiff has already obtained sufficient security for the potential judgment,by attachment or otherwise.
id.at emphasis added.
reducing the amount of an attachment 
since the supplemental rules were adopted in,our circuit has not addressed how a court should determine the amount of plaintiff claim fairly stated when it releases attached property under rule e a in exchange for the posting of a security.neither have we addressed the circumstances in which a district court may find good cause to reduce a security under rule e.thus,here we are called on to give meaning to those phrases.as in aqua stoli,we must consider to what extent the district court may require a showing by the plaintiff beyond the simple fact that the textual requirements of rule b have been met,aqua stoli,at,in order to sustain the full amount of an attachment in a rule e or proceeding.plaintiffs argue that the same standard should apply to motions under rule e or that apply to a rule e f motion.but our analysis in aqua stoli was focused specifically on the provisions of rule e f and its historical antecedents and purpose.our conclusions regarding rule e f do not apply necessarily to the provisions of rule e and,which have distinct historical pedigrees and implicate differently the purposes of maritime attachment.nonetheless,a similar framework of analysis is appropriate.
whereas rule e f was added to the supplemental rules in in response to a specific concern that the prior practice was not consistent with due process principles,the provisions of rule e providing for the setting and reducing of a security for attached property were included in the supplemental rules adopted in.see.supp.rule e.and those provisions are,in substance,a consolidation of provisions of the and admiralty rules.see.supp.rule e,advisory committee note adoption.as the advisory committee notes on the rules explained 
the limited objective of the supplemental rules is to carry forward the relevant provisions of the former admiralty rules,modernized and revised to some extent but still in the context of history and precedent.accordingly,these rules are not to be construed as limiting or impairing the traditional power of a district court,exercising the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,to adapt its procedures and its remedies in the individual case,consistently with these rules,to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action.
supp.rule a,advisory committee note adoption.specifically,the advisory committee notes explained that rule e restates the substance of admiralty rule,and that rule e was a dapted from admiralty rule.supp.rule e,advisory committee note adoption.because rule e and were intended to adopt and continue the prior practice,the historical practice and precedent are particularly important to our interpretation of these provisions.
practice and precedent prior to the supplemental rules 
before the supplemental rules,a court deciding how to set a security often made a preliminary assessment of the reasonableness of the plaintiff claimed damages.
this practice is especially evident in two district court cases from new york where the district court considered the extent to which its discretion to set a security was limited by a statutory provision the precursor to obliging the marshal to discharge arrested property on the receiving of a bond in an amount double the claimed by the libelant.in peru v.the north america,the district court concluded that it was not obliged under stat.to set bail at twice the amount claimed by the libelant,noting that the statute does not assume to interfere with the powers of a court of admiralty to regulate the execution of its process,and the bail it is authorized to take,conformable to general principles of procedure in those courts,on the particular equities of each case.cas.addressing another statutory precursor to the district court reached a similar conclusion in haakonsen lotosland the lotosland,citing the north america,cas.the court observed that it would work inestimable hardship on the owner of any vessel if the statute were interpreted to permit the release of an attached vessel only if it were secured by a bond double the amount claimed by the libelant.id.such an interpretation,the court stated,would make necessary,for instance,in a libel involving a personal injury case,by setting forth damage in any ridiculous figure whatsoever,the filing of a stipulation or bond in double the amount,no matter how slight the actual injury or damage might have been.id.the court concluded that 
s uch,certainly,could not have been the intention of the framers of the section and,accordingly,it is not surprising to find,as was held in the north america,that this section does not abridge the power of a court of admiralty in a suit in rem to accept bail for less than double the amount of the libelant demand.
id.it appears that rule e adopted this approach to.citing to the lotosland,the advisory committee notes explain that,sic is incorporated with changes of terminology,and with a substantial change as to the amount of the bond in rule e.supp.rule e,advisory committee notes adoption see also grant gilmore charles black,the law of admiralty ed describing the interaction of and rule e.
having rejected the argument that the security must be set at twice the amount claimed by the libelant,the courts in the north america and the lotosland turned to setting the security.in the north america,the government of peru was claiming breach of a charter party and damages of and upwards,but the charter party included a liquidated damages provision setting damages at.the north america,cas.at internal quotation marks omitted.the defendants argued that peru recovery would be limited to and that the bond should be set accordingly.after considering the liquidated damages provision and applicable case law,the court found it ambiguous whether peru recovery would be limited to.thus,the court concluded that it was appropriate to set bail according to the amount claimed by peru,ordering the vessel to be discharged on bail.id.at.
when fixing the amount of the bond in the lotosland,the district court considered both whether the claimed damages were available to the plaintiff as a matter of law and whether the claimed damages were reasonable based on the facts.the lotosland.at noting the claim for care and maintenance can not be disregarded under the relevant case law but observing that t he reasonableness of the amount of the claim is another matter.ultimately,the court set the security at,noting that i t seems to me that the libelant will be amply protected if a stipulation or bond in the amount of is furnished.id.the court did not set the bond at the amount sought by plaintiff because,on the basis of verdicts and awards recorded in other cases,the conclusion is inescapable that the amount sought by this libelant is wholly disproportionate to those heretofore obtained.id.the court reached that conclusion despite its observ ation that the measure of damages resulting in this type of claim is always troublesome because of the numerous uncertain factors involved.id.
other cases from the mid and also suggest that it was the practice under the admiralty rules for a district court setting a security for the release of attached property to assess preliminarily whether the plaintiff damages claim was reasonable.see young v.the cherokee the monarch,had the stipulation been executed under an order emanating from this court,i would feel no hesitation in looking into the amount demanded,and in reducing it if the facts justified me in so doing.the city of hartford,the power to abat e exorbitant security has long been recognized as one of the incidental powers of the court in regulating its practice and proceedings.forbes v.the merrimac,cas,this court will always promptly reduce the stipulation for value required in any case,to such sum as shall seem to be reasonable security for the claim as presented in the libel.but see the archer,cas,i am referred to no statute,rule,or decision which authorizes the bonding of property for less than its actual value however plain the claimant apparent equity may be,it should not be determined on this motion.the fact that the libelant seems to have much more than sufficient security is no reason for depriving him of any part of it.
there are also more recent examples under the admiralty rules of courts assessing preliminarily the reasonableness of a plaintiff damages claim when deciding how to set a security.the district court took such an approach in the fairisle,affirmed sub,waterman dean,cir.in that case,a fter hearing the contentions made on behalf of the respective parties,the court concluded that libellants figures were absurdly excessive,and ruled that a bond or stipulation in the amount of was adequate under the circumstances as they appeared to the court,in advance of a trial on the merits.id.the bond ordered was substantially less than the that plaintiffs sought.and just a few years before the supplemental rules were adopted,our court reviewed a district court decision to release attached property worth on the posting of a bond.konstantinidis denizcilik bankasi,cir per curiam.the district court had fixed the amount of the bond based on the apparent availability in turkey of assets of the respondent sufficient to meet any award made to the libellant in arbitration proceedings pending there and on affidavits of the proctors for both parties concerning negotiations between them for a release of the attachment.id.on appeal,plaintiffs argued that these were inappropriate considerations in determining what was a fair and equitable amount for the bond.id.we found no merit in the argument and affirmed the order setting the bond.id.
finally,treatises describing the practice under the admiralty rules confirm that district courts assessed preliminarily the reasonableness of plaintiff damages claim when setting bail for an attached vessel.see,erastus benedict,the american admiralty ed.the stipulation of bail in a suit in rem is given to procure the discharge of the property proceeded against it is only necessary,therefore,that he give security to pay what the libellant may recover see also gilmore black,supra,at explaining that in case of disagreement between the parties as to the award that could be made in that case,it was the practice under the former admiralty rules that the judge w ould set the stipulation at what seems to him a fair figure.as conkling treatise from described 
as the sole object of the security is the attainment of justice between the parties,the court is bound so to regulate the exercise of the right to exact it,as to prevent its abuse as well as its abridgment and as it is in the power of the libellant,by making an exorbitant demand,to compel the defendant to give excessive bail,or submit to imprisonment for want of it,it is the duty and the practice of courts of admiralty to listen to applications for the reduction of the amount of the bail this practice is accordingly sanctioned and expressly affirmed by rule sixth of the rules of admiralty practice 
conkling,supra,at.
rule e and and the purpose of maritime attachment 
as in aqua stoli,the historical purposes of maritime attachment are an important consideration in defining the standard that applies to a rule e or motion.in aqua stoli,we found those purposes to be served by a rule that allowed courts only limited discretion to vacate an attachment where a valid prima facie admiralty claim had been stated and the requirements for an attachment had been fulfilled.we are not persuaded that similarly curtailing the district court discretion to set or reduce a security serves those purposes.moreover,limiting a district court discretion to set or reduce a security in the same way that we have limited its discretion under rule e f creates a substantial and unnecessary risk that plaintiffs will abuse the maritime attachment power.
allowing district courts to assess preliminarily whether the damages claim is reasonable when setting a security under rule e or weigh this and other equitable considerations when reducing a security under rule e would not frustrate the purpose of maritime attachments in the same way that such inquiries in a rule e f proceeding would frustrate the purpose of maritime attachments.maritime attachments serve two purposes first,to gain jurisdiction over an absent defendant and second,to assure satisfaction of a judgment.aqua stoli,at.the first of these purposes would be undermined were a court to have broad discretion over whether to grant or vacate an attachment.but there is an important distinction between vacating an attachment and reducing the security for attached property such that a court discretion in the former is troubling,but not in the latter.in maritime attachment cases,the court has jurisdiction because the defendant res is within its jurisdiction.winter storm,at the jurisdiction conferred by a maritime attachment is characterized as quasi in rem.thus,when a court either refuses to issue or vacates an attachment,the court deprives itself of jurisdiction.such a problem does not exist where the court merely reduces the value of the res within its jurisdiction.the second purpose of maritime attachments is served by a rule that allows courts to set the security at an amount that fairly reflects the plaintiffs likely recovery.this purpose does not require that property in excess of the amount necessary to ensure satisfaction of the judgment be attached 
absent district court discretion to set a security based on a preliminary assessment of a plaintiff claims or to reduce the security based on a weighing of the equities,there would be no mechanism to ensure that maritime plaintiffs do not abuse the attachment
