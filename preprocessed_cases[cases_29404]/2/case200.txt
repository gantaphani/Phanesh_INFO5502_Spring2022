on december,ward,a welder employed by newport news in the shipyards of eastern virginia,herniated the disc in his back the injury.on march,ward underwent back surgery to repair the injury.in september of that year,ward returned to work at newport news with work restrictions,and he performed light duty work for approximately two months.ward was again unable to work from november,until may,at which point he again returned to light duty work at the.
while at work a month later,however,on june,ward again injured his back while pulling on heavy welding lines the injury.on this occasion,ward herniated an entirely different disc in his back,the disc.the injury required ward to undergo,on august,another surgical procedure.although ward was only partially disabled after his second back surgery,he was unable to find work with newport news that he could adequately perform.consequently,he sought disability benefits under the act.newport news initially agreed to pay benefits to ward,but it later sought f relief from its obligation to compensate ward for his disability 
after newport news filed its claim for f relief on may,the claim was referred to the alj for disposition.during proceedings before the alj,the parties agreed to stipulate certain relevant facts,and neither ward nor the director presented any evidence.as explained below,newport news presented evidence to the alj from two physicians,reid and garner,both of whom had treated ward back injuries.
before seeking f relief,newport news requested a report from reid,the newport news company physician who had treated both of ward back injuries.on may,the day newport news filed for f relief,reid detailed his views regarding ward disability in a letter to newport news,to which he attached six supporting exhibits collectively,the reid report.newport news then submitted the reid report to the alj in support of its claim for f relief.
in the reid report,reid asserted,inter alia,that 
ward disability is not caused by his december,back injury alone,but rather his disability is materially contributed to,and made materially and substantially worse by his aggravation injury on june,
neither the injury,nor the injury,alone would have disabled ward from performing light duty shipyard work 
if ward had a normal back when he suffered the injury,he would have been able to return to light duty shipyard work and 
t he combination of the two injuries and two surgeries,and their cumulative effect,have disabled ward from even light duty shipyard work.
within the exhibits in the reid report were three work restriction reports of reid,plus a letter and two office memoranda of garner.these materials had been prepared during the course of ward treatment and surgeries.
newport news thereafter submitted additional evidence to the alj from garner,who had performed the and back surgeries.on january,newport news forwarded the reid report to garner,accompanied by a transmittal letter the transmittal letter.the transmittal letter provided garner the option of indicating whether he agree d with reid opinion as expressed in his may,report concerning ward.garner indicated his agreement with the reid report by signing and dating the transmittal letter on march,without further explanation,and then returning it to newport news.in further support of its f claim,newport news submitted to the alj a november,memorandum of garner,relating to ward injury.
after analyzing the available evidence,particularly the reid report and the transmittal letter,the alj determined that newport news was not entitled to f relief.specifically,the alj concluded that newport news had failed to quantify the portion of ward disability that was due to his injury alone.in reaching this conclusion,the alj decided that the opinions of reid and garner failed to justify an award of f relief to newport news because they lacked sufficient credibility and failed to provide the alj with an opportunity to examine the logic and evaluate the evidence upon which the opinions were based.alj decision at.in fact,the alj found that with the limited evidence provided by the employer,it was impossible to make an appropriate determination under the controlling standard enunciated in director,owcp newport news shipbuilding dry dock carmines,cir.alj decision at.consequently,the alj denied f relief.
newport news appealed the alj decision to the brb.on july,the brb ruled that substantial evidence supported the alj conclusion that newport news had failed to prove its entitlement to f relief.the brb agreed that newport news did not quantify the disability due to the june injury alone.brb decision at.in so ruling,the brb concluded,as had the alj,that the evidence offered by newport news failed to enable the alj to examine the logic and evaluate the evidence of the reid report.accordingly,it affirmed the alj.on august,newport news petitioned this court for review of the brb decision.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to c.
in evaluating a decision of the brb,we must determine whether the brb observed its standard for reviewing the alj factual findings.newport news shipbldg.and dry dock stallings,cir quotations and citations omitted.pursuant to b of the act,the brb must assess an alj factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.b.
we have consistently described substantial evidence as more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.norfolk shipbldg.and drydock faulk,cir citing elliott adm r,animal plant health inspection,cir.furthermore,the findings of an alj may not be disregarded on the basis that other inferences might have been more reasonable.deference must be given the inferences and credibility assessments,and we have emphasized the scope of review of alj findings is limited.newport news shipbldg.dry dock tann,cir.
our precedent with respect to f claims is pertinent here,and it governs our disposition of this proceeding.in the early,in director,owcp newport news shipbuilding dry dock harcum i,cir,we articulated the test for whether and when f relief is appropriate in a permanent partial disability situation.the harcum i rule was then restated in carmines,when judge murnaghan explained that f limits an employer liability for an employee permanent partial disability benefits to two years,if the employer can affirmatively establish three elements.he defined those elements as follows 
first,that the ultimate disability was not caused solely by the injury,but was also caused in part by a partial disability 
second,that the disability was manifest to the employer prior to the injury and 
third,and of importance here,that the ultimate permanent partial disability materially and substantially exceeded the disability that would have resulted from the injury alone,in the absence of the condition the contribution element.
carmines,at citing harcum i,at.
an employer can satisfy this third element,the contribution element,only if it can quantify the type and extent of disability the employee would have suffered absent the disability.carmines,at in other words,an employer must present evidence of the type and extent of disability that the claimant would suffer if not previously disabled when injured by the same injury.as chief judge ervin observed in harcum i,the quantification aspect of the contribution element provides an alj with a basis on which to determine whether the ultimate permanent partial disability is materially and substantially greater than the disability the employee would have suffered from the second injury alone.harcum i,at,cited in carmines,at.importantly,in assessing whether the contribution element has been met,an alj may not merely credulously accept the assertions of the parties or their representatives,but must examine the logic of their conclusions and evaluate the evidence upon which their conclusions are based.carmines,at.
in harcum i,the brb had determined that f relief was available to an employer when an employee disability and his subsequent injury combine to cause a greater degree of impairment than that caused by the second injury alone.harcum i,at.we held that the alj and the brb had applied an incorrect standard for f relief because they had failed to consider whether harcum ultimate disability was substantially and materially greater than the disability he would have suffered from the second injury alone.therefore,in harcum i,we remanded the f claim to the alj for further consideration regarding the contribution element.id.at.
on remand,newport news presented evidence to the alj through a vocational rehabilitation specialist.this evidence demonstrated that,if harcum had suffered his second injury absent his disability,he would have been capable of earning per hour.however,with both injuries,he was only capable of earning per hour,and he was not capable of performing several jobs for which he would have been otherwise qualified.thus,newport news contended that harcum disability caused his ultimate disability to reduce harcum wage earning capacity by per hour,a percent decrease,and that it was thus entitled to f relief.the alj denied f relief,primarily because newport news did not present any medical evidence.the brb then affirmed the alj decision.
in our review of the brb decision after harcum i remand,we determined that newport news was entitled to f relief.newport news shipbuilding dry dock director,owcp harcum ii,cir.in reaching this conclusion and in reversing the brb,we observed that medical evidence,although often utilized,is not essential for an employer satisfaction of the contribution element.we then decided that the vocational evidence sufficiently quantified what harcum injury would have been absent the injury.id.in fact,in harcum ii,we observed that the evidence presented by newport news was of the type contemplated by harcum i in its discussion of the contribution element.id.at.
then,in,in carmines,we again considered an employer claim for f relief.as in harcum ii,the issue in carmines was whether the evidence presented by newport news had satisfied the quantification aspect of the contribution element.carmines,at.in carmines,callis carmines had been diagnosed with pulmonary asbestosis and was receiving disability benefits from newport news.newport news sought f relief,asserting that the asbestosis was made substantially and materially greater by his condition.newport news had presented evidence from hall,a newport news physician,who determined that carmines ultimate disability was percent.he also opined that carmines condition resulted in a partial disability of eighteen percent.thus,by subtracting eighteen from,hall concluded that carmines disability would have been only ten percent in the absence of his condition.newport news thus asserted that,because carmines ultimate disability was eighteen percent higher than it would have been from his second injury alone,it was entitled to f relief.id.at.the alj agreed that newport news was entitled to f relief,and the brb affirmed.
in our carmines decision,however,we rejected this approach.instead,we ruled that it was not appropriate to simply subtract carmines disability from his ultimate disability to determine whether the ultimate disability was materially and substantially greater than that caused by the second injury alone.judge murnaghan reasoned that,even though carmines condition led to an eighteen percent disability,newport news had failed to establish that his second injury would have resulted in less than a percent disability had it occurred alone.id.at.as judge murnaghan observed,newport news was obliged,in order to satisfy f,to present evidence regarding the degree of disability that would have resulted from the second injury alone.without such evidence,the mere assertion by the employer physician that the ultimate disability was made materially and substantially worse by the conditions is not sufficient to warrant f relief.id.at.thus,we reversed the brb determination that newport news was entitled to f relief.id.
with these controlling principles in mind,we now turn to ward injuries and to whether the alj denial of the newport news claim for f relief is supported by substantial evidence.
we begin our assessment of newport news petition for review by acknowledging that newport news has satisfied the first two elements of the test for f relief.the only remaining issue is whether substantial evidence supports the alj decision that newport news failed to satisfy the contribution element of its f claim 
in assessing whether the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence,we first look to the reid report.the alj concluded that this report failed to satisfy the contribution element of the f test because it did not sufficiently quantify the portion of ward injury that would have resulted in the absence of the injury.alj decision at.to the extent that the reid report compared ward injury to the injury he would have suffered had the injury not occurred,the alj found that he was unable to examine the logic and evaluate the evidence underlying those comparisons.id.hence,the alj was unable to determine whether ward injury was materially and substantially greater than the disability ward would have suffered in the absence of his injury.
newport news contends that the alj could have examined the logic and evaluated the evidence underlying the reid report such that its evidence satisfied the standards for f relief,articulated by harcum i and carmines.thus,newport news maintains that had the alj performed a thorough examination of that report and the other available evidence,he would have found it sufficient to warrant f relief having considered the record as a whole,we disagree with newport news the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence.
in the reid report,reid asserted that n either the injury,nor the injury,alone would have disabled ward from performing light duty shipyard work.reid also maintained that i f he had a normal back when he suffered the injury,he would have been able to return to light duty shipyard work.however,the cumulative effect of the injuries have disabled ward from even light duty shipyard work.like reid opinions in newport news shipbuilding dry dock cherry,cir,his assessments of ward injuries constitute the type of evidence that harcum i and carmines deemed relevant to the quantification aspect of the contribution element.see cherry,concluding that similar statement by reid was correct type of evidence for satisfying quantification aspect 
unfortunately for newport news,however,reid assertions are generalized and his overall conclusion lacks any supporting explanation.in particular,his statement that ward would have been able to return to light duty shipyard work if he had suffered only one of his back injuries,is conclusory and lacks evidentiary support.indeed,reid statements are far different from the objective quantification and clear descriptions that were present in harcum ii,at.as the alj found,reid does not refer to any evidence justifying his conclusion,nor does he explain how he arrived at it.alj decision at 
in attempting to explain reid assertions,newport news points to reid conclusion in the reid report that ward injury and surgery rates a minimum permanent disability rating under the ama guides.however,both the brb and the alj concluded that,although reid believed that ward suffered a five percent disability following his injury,reid failed to assess the level of ward disability that would have resulted from the injury alone.we agree that reid assessment of ward disability rating does not properly quantify the type and extent of disability ward would have suffered absent the disability,and that reid assessment thus does not support the conclusions made in the reid report under these circumstances,the alj was entitled to conclude,as he did,that reid assertions in the reid report fell short of satisfying the quantification aspect of the contribution element.
newport news,in its effort to justify its claim for f relief,also presented the alj with evidence from garner,ward treating neurosurgeon.first,it relied on garner agreement with the reid report,as reflected in the transmittal letter of january.the transmittal letter was authored and sent to garner by a newport news lawyer,who urged garner to sign and return the statement i agree with reid opinion as expressed in his may,report concerning ward.the alj gave no probative weight to garner adoption of this statement,however,because t here is no explanation whatsoever from garner why he agrees with reid.alj decision at.the alj noted that a statement that a doctor agrees with another doctor,if it includes no supporting evidence and no explanation of why and how the doctor arrived at his conclusion,is legally insufficient under carmines.id.at.because garner neither authored nor explained the basis for his adoption of the transmittal letter,the alj was entitled to discount its evidentiary value.see cherry,approving alj skepticism regarding treating physician adoption of similar statement in transmittal letter.
second,newport news sought support for its f claim from the november,memorandum prepared by garner on ward injury.the alj,however,was well within his discretion in deciding that this document did not explain reid assessments in the reid report or garner agreement to the report.alj decision at.in his memorandum of november,garner concluded that ward had reached maximum medical improvement and that he was entitled to a seventeen percent permanent partial disability ratio following his injury.however,that memorandum merely discussed the degree of permanent partial disability resulting from ward second injury in,and it failed to provide an assessment of the degree of disability which would have resulted from the injury alone,absent ward injury.as we have pointed out,an employer seeking f relief must provide a credible quantification of the type and extent of disability that would have ensued from the second injury alone.carmines,at such evidence is necessary before the alj can compare that degree of disability that would have resulted solely from the second injury to the degree of disability ultimately produced by the combination of the second injury and the supposed condition.
finally,we observe that there is nothing before us to indicate that garner and reid are other than qualified physicians.and it is likewise true that,taken together,their opinions could have entitled newport news to f relief,if those opinions had been credited by the alj.the simple fact,however,is that the alj found the evidence insufficient to warrant f relief.although other inferences could have been drawn from the evidence,it is not for a reviewing court to draw such other inferences if the record contains substantial evidence supporting the alj decision.see tann,at.therefore,because substantial evidence supports the alj decision denying the claim of newport news for f relief,we must deny the petition for review.
pursuant to the foregoing,newport news petition for review of the brb decision is denied.
petition for review denied 
i respectfully dissent.
i disassociate myself from the remarks made in the majority decision concerning the weight of the evidence from two physicians involved in this case,reid and garner.the attempt by the majority at the conclusion of its opinion,to resurrect those physicians,indeed emphasizes the correctness of their opinions.garner,a neurosurgeon who had twice operated on ward,for example,obviously knew as much or more than anyone in the world about ward back.the failure to credit his report,and that of reid,a treating physician,is simply not realistic.neither,in my opinion,is it good law.
in the most general terms,i think our court is making a huge mistake in not recognizing that the longshore and harbor workers compensation act is simply a federal substitute for ordinary workers compensation laws which are very nearly universal in this country except under the federal or similar statutes i have just mentioned.those cases,as every practicing lawyer knows,are decided almost wholly upon forms and written reports completed by physicians and like experts,affidavits from those engaged in the occupation of the injured employee,and such evidence.little oral testimony is taken,either before administrative law judges or the courts.deciding these cases on the rules set out in carmines and harcum i and harcum ii,which i suggest are not fully understood by anyone,would do credit to a case complete with judge,jury,discovery,and,the entire legal process,instead of the administrative process which initially,i am sure,was calculated to see that injured employees receive prompt compensation and that employers remain able to assert their statutory rights without the requirement of extended litigation.if we want to impose some kind of a rule that each or all of these successive injuries,which always must be present for f relief,must be quantified under the ama guidelines to the evaluation of permanent impairment,we should just say so,rely on addition and subtraction,and be done with it,instead of relying on the highly technical and little understood carmines and harcum rules which have used as their shelters here a failure to credit two perfectly reliable physicians who were the source of all the medical and related evidence which the record shows could have been gathered about these injuries.with respect to the downgrading of a physician written report because it comes from a company doctor,no more reason exists to downgrade that report than was our close scrutiny of the record justified by findings of fact prepared by an attorney for one of the parties,which the court forbade in anderson city of bessemer city,d.
to get to the case at hand.that newport news met the first two elements required for f relief is undisputed in this court.
at issue here is whether newport news met the third,or contribution,element in its petition for f relief,newport news submitted the opinions of two physicians as evidence that ward injury and surgery made his ultimate disability materially and substantially greater than it otherwise would have been.first,the employer submitted the may,letter report of reid,a newport news staff physician who was an examining and treating physician with respect to each of the injuries involved here.reid report speaks to the contribution element of newport news claim for f relief as follows

dear massenberg 
at your request,i have reviewed ward clinic records,as well as his outside medical records which are contained in his clinic chart.in addition,i have treated ward for his injury.i can provide the following medical history and opinions,stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.
ward had injured his back on december,and he had an aggravation injury on june.
ward first injured his back on december ll.ward missed three weeks of work and then required work restrictions exhibit.ward ultimately in march,required a laminectomy for a herniated disc exhibit.such an injury and surgery leaves the back permanently weakened and thus significantly more susceptible to further injury,and with the resultant disability being substantially greater.for this reason,such an injury and surgery under the ama guides rates a minimum permanent disability rating.indeed,ward missed six more months of work,and required work restrictions exhibit.ward in late and missed more months of work,and returned to work on work restrictions exhibit.ward reinjured his back no approximately june,while pulling on heavy welding lines exhibit.ward had a second herniated disc injury and required a second surgery exhibit.
ward reached maximum medical improvement from his back injury on or before november,when he was permanently passed out of the shipyard due to his back disability.
ward condition of chronic back disability was permanent and serious.a cautions employer would not hire a worker for heavy manual labor,such as at the shipyard,if he had the back injury and surgery he had in.
ward condition of chronic back disability was manifest to the shipyard based on its own records.
ward disability is not caused by his december,back injury alone,but rather his disability is materially contributed to,and made materially and substantially worse by his aggravation injury,on june.ward originally injured his back on december.ward required disc surgery and his back was left in a permanently weakened condition.nevertheless,he was able to perform light duty shipyard work.the june,injury permanently and substantially aggravated and worsened his weakened defective back structure,been able to return to light duty shipyard work.however,the combination of the two injuries and two surgeries,and their cumulative effect,have disabled ward from even light duty shipyard work.
if i may provide you any further information,please do not hesitate to call me.

thus,reid states that ward injury helped cause his injury and that,without ward injury,his injury and surgery would have left ward able to perform light duty at the shipyard,just as ward had returned to light duty after the injury.
the employer also submitted reports from garner,ward treating neurosurgeon,who signed,in addition,a statement,without explanation,stating,i agree with reid opinion as expressed in his may,report concerning ward.more importantly,reid report includes,in addition,a letter and three office memos from garner which were never mentioned by the board and the substance of which was not considered by the alj.
the director did not present to the alj any evidence relating to the contribution element of newport news f claim.
the board,following the alj,found that newport news failed to prove the contribution element of the claim because it did not quantify disability due to the june injury alone.in reaching its conclusion,the board found the alj could not examine the logic and evaluate the evidence under carmines.the alj also disregarded as carrying no probative weight garner letter agreeing with reid.the board agreed and affirmed.
at bottom,the decision of the board is based on the fact that both the alj and the board either did not believe the two physicians whose reports are a part of the record,or they discounted those reports,or both.it is my opinion that they arrived at their conclusions without any careful examination of those reports.
reid was a graduate of the school of medicine of tulane university.he had served as a resident in internal medicine at the national naval medical center and at the naval hospital.additionally,he had served at the naval hospital in what the american medical association refers to as a flexible or transitional year.his major professional activity is that of full time staff at a hospital.
garner was a graduate of the medical school of the university of virginia.his residency included the university of virginia medical center in neurological surgery,university of virginia in neurology,and the university of virginia medical center in general surgery.he is board certified by the american board of neurological surgery.
no one can suggest anyone in the world who was more familiar with ward back than reid and garner.reid was and had been one of ward examining and treating physicians on account of both injuries involved in this case while ward worked for newport news.additionally,garner had operated on ward back twice for the very injuries at issue here,performing a laminectomy for excision of a herniated disc at in march,and another laminectomy for another herniated next lower disc at in august.both surgeries included examinations by garner,so,absent an examination or operation on ward back by some unknown physician whom i am sure the director would have produced,it is safe to say that garner knew more about ward back than anyone in the world.i add that it is not possible to say that garner was not professionally qualified to make the reports which he did.also,garner was perfectly capable of reading the letter report of reid which appears earlier in this opinion and expressing his opinion with respect to that letter.
in director,owcp newport news shipbuilding,cir harcum i,in a similar fact situation involving an initial permanent partial disability followed by a second injury causing additional permanent partial disability,we held that the ultimate permanent partial disability must materially and substantially exceed the disability as would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone.to show this,we held that an employer must present evidence of the type and extent of disability that the claimant would suffer if not previously disabled when injured by the same injury.harcum i,at.we continued o nce the employer establishes the level of disability in the absence of a permanent partial disability,an adjudicative body will have a basis on which to determine whether the ultimate permanent partial disability is materially and substantially greater.harcum i,at.we repeated that direction in newport news shipbuilding director,owcp,cir harcum ii,and in neither of those decisions did we require that which is called quantification be limited to the disability percentages such as appear in the american medical association guidelines to the evaluation of permanent impairment or like medical guidelines.
the record at hand includes a stipulation that ward injured his back in his employment on december,and that he had back surgery and returned to light duty work.it was also stipulated that ward reinjured his back june,in the course of his employment,that the injury aggravat ed his weakened back,required a second back surgery and ward has been unable to return to shipyard work since then.reid report of may,reports that ward missed three weeks of work on account of his first injury and then required work restrictions of no vertical ladders,no lifting over pounds,no work in tight spaces,and no stooping.one of the restrictions was to expire after days and the others days after january,and ward was to return to the clinic on january,for an evaluation.
reid report continues that ward required a laminectomy for that herniated disc which was performed by garner,whose reports appear in the record.that report notes that ward was discharged on the day and notes relief of the leg pain.he was instructed regarding care of the low back and told to return to garner in three weeks after april.reid description of this injury is that 
such an injury and surgery leaves the back permanently weakened and thus significantly more susceptible to further injury and with the resultant disability substantially greater.
reid letter continues that under the american medical association guidelines the injury and surgery described would rate a minimum permanent disability rating.it continues that ward missed six months of work and required work restrictions which are corroborated by the medical report from reid dated september,showing that ward was convalescing and continuing the restrictions of not lifting objects heavier than pounds,no repeated bending or twisting or working in tight or cramped spaces,and no vertical ladders.
ward returned to light work and reinjured his back on june.this june injury was another herniated disc injury for a different disc,and required a second surgery.the second surgery was also performed by garner and three of garner office memos appear in the recor
