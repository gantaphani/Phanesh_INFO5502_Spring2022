background 
plaintiff,a resident of marshall county,kentucky,was employed as a deckhand crew member of a barge operated by defendant.on july,he was injured while on board defendant vessel on a portion of the ohio river near livingston county,kentucky.on june,plaintiff filed a complaint in the circuit court of clair county,illinois,alleging causes of action under the jones act and related admiralty theories.the defendant first filed an answer and jury demand and later filed,pursuant to supreme court rule,a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,to transfer,on the ground of forum non conveniens.
the motion,supported by affidavit,claimed that defendant is an illinois corporation with its principal office in monroe county,illinois that the witnesses were residents of kentucky or illinois working in or around livingston county,kentucky that plaintiff received medical treatment in calloway county,kentucky and that the courts of clair county are more congested than those of the proposed alternative forum,pope county,illinois.the motion was set for hearing on october.plaintiff,in turn,filed a written motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice.the motion was served on defendant counsel and granted ex parte on october.the order made no reference to the pending forum non conveniens motion and did not reserve to plaintiff the right to reinstate the case.
on november,plaintiff filed a jones act complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of illinois.defendant moved to dismiss the action on the ground that it had not been commenced within three years of the accident as required by the jones act.
on november,while the case was still pending in federal court,plaintiff filed a motion in this case to vacate the order of dismissal.the motion was granted,despite defense counsel oral motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.defense counsel dismissal motion was pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure code ilcs west,governing objections to jurisdiction over the person.at the hearing on the motion to vacate,plaintiff counsel stated that he telephoned defendant counsel prior to the hearing on the rule motion and told him he would concede the forum non conveniens issue.defendant counsel disputed that account of the conversation.he contended that plaintiff counsel said that he was either going to move for voluntary dismissal or concede to avoid the delay of an appeal if the forum motion was denied,and that defense counsel replied that it up to you.the trial court found the forum motion was conceded and that the order allowing the voluntary dismissal did not state what was actually done.the trial court noted that the only motion pending at the time of the voluntary nonsuit was the forum motion and that there was no other reason to nonsuit the case.this finding appears in the transcript of the hearing but is not reflected in the order.the order,entered on november,recited 
this cause coming before the court the court being fully advised in the premises and having jurisdiction of the subject matter the court finds both parties present through counsel.arguments heard on plaintiff motion to vacate filed pursuant to ilcs.motion is hereby granted.cause to be reset for status on at in.rm.
on december,the defendant filed,pursuant to supreme court rule,a notice of appeal from this order.plaintiff then filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to supreme court rule,asserting that the appeal was frivolous and filed intentionally for the purpose of delay because the order being appealed was not even final.the sanctions motion was set for hearing on january,with defendant pending forum non conveniens motion.the trial court found that it had jurisdiction,denied the motion for sanctions,and denied the forum non conveniens motion,finding that defendant had refused to waive the statute of limitations defense as a condition of the dismissal order.
fearing that the first notice of appeal may have been premature,defendant subsequently filed a second notice of appeal.defendant also filed,pursuant to supreme court rule,a petition for leave to appeal in the appellate court from the order denying the forum non conveniens motion.that motion was granted,and the appeals were consolidated for hearing.
the appellate court affirmed the vacation of the voluntary dismissal order,but remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings on the forum motion.the appeal before us involves only the order vacating the voluntary dismissal order.
the primary issue before us is whether a plaintiff may move to vacate a voluntary dismissal order when the trial court did not specifically reserve to plaintiff any right to reinstate.defendant asserts that under the rule in weisguth supreme tribe of ben hur,a plaintiff must reserve the right to move for reinstatement following a voluntary dismissal.plaintiff contends,however,the weisguth was subsequently preempted by the enactment of section of the code ilcs west.this issue presents a question of law subject to de novo review.see cameron fiberglas,d.to make this determination,we must examine the interaction between this court prior case law and the subsequent enactment of section of the code.
a.the weisguth rule and its progeny 
the defendant argument hinges on a statement by this court in weisguth.in that case,plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her action at the close of her case in chief to prevent a directed verdict in favor of the defendant.upon her motion,the case was reinstated and tried a second time,with a verdict in her favor.a new trial was then granted,and the case was tried a third time.again,plaintiff prevailed,and a judgment was entered in her favor.the appellate court affirmed,and this court reviewed the record by writ of certiorari.
the first ground urged for reversal before this court was that the trial court erred in setting aside the order of dismissal entered upon the motion for voluntary nonsuit and in reinstating the cause.we observed 
in case of a voluntary upon motion of a plaintiff the court has no power to set aside the order of dismissal and the cause unless at the time the is taken leave is given the plaintiff to move to set it aside.citation.the reason for this rule is apparent.if a plaintiff by his deliberate and voluntary act secures the dismissal of his suit he must be held to have anticipated the effect and necessary results of this action and should not be restored to the position and the rights which he voluntarily abandoned.having taken a,his only recourse is to begin his action anew.weisguth,at.
despite this cautionary pronouncement,the court held that defendant had forfeited the right to complain of the court reinstatement of the complaint.the court stated 
after the cause was the defendant appeared in two trials in the city court and contested the case on the merits.by doing so it conferred upon the court the power to proceed and waived its right to object to the of the cause.herrington mccollum,grand pacific hotel pinkerton.as we said in herrington mccollum,supra the court unquestionably had jurisdiction of the subject matter of litigation,and it has never been questioned that parties may so far control jurisdiction over their own persons,in such a case,as to confer upon the court the right to proceed by voluntarily entering an appearance.the defendants,to avail of the right to question the jurisdiction of the court when the case was,should either have not appeared at all or limited their appearance to the objection against the jurisdiction of the court.weisguth,at.
after a review of the evidence,the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the plaintiff.weis
