it is the longstanding judgment of congress that a sailor,once discharged from his vessel,must upon demand immediately be paid by the ship owner,absent some substantial cause for any delay in payment.if such prompt payment is not made,the owner faces a statutory penalty of two days wages for each day it delays.id.the plaintiff,terry williams,alleges that he demanded and did not receive timely payment for his work aboard the vessel apl korea the korea,and that the defendant,wilmington trust company wilmington,as the putative owner of the korea,is liable for the wage penalty.in proceedings below,wilmington argued unsuccessfully that it was not the owner of the korea for purposes of the statute,because it had chartered the vessel to another entity.wilmington also asserted that the failure to pay promptly was the result of careless errors,which in its view suffices to demonstrate substantial cause for the belated payments.the district court accepted this latter argument.we now affirm on the alternative ground that wilmington is not,in fact,the korea owner for purposes of the wage statutes.
background 
terry williams was the second mate aboard the korea during a voyage from san pedro,california to asia and back again.the korea left san pedro on may of and returned to seattle on june.in seattle,williams received a check for his work from may to june,totaling about.williams remained aboard the korea as it continued on to san pedro,where he debarked on june.at that time williams received a voucher,basically a piece of paper stating that his employer owed him a week wages.
there is some dispute in the record as to why williams was not paid for his last week of work.both sides agree that williams asked before arriving in san pedro to be paid in cash,as he was planning to travel across country with his wife.the defendant claims that williams was offered about of his wages in cash,but that he refused.williams denies that the defendants ever offered to pay him anything.
williams also had a disagreement with the captain of the korea,james londagin,over his overtime hours.williams had claimed that he was entitled to eight hours of overtime,but the captain did not want to authorize any of them.williams submitted his dispute to a union official in california,who filed a grievance on his behalf with the ship management company,american ship management.ultimately,the union official negotiated a settlement for half of the disputed hours.williams received a check for the disputed overtime,amounting to about,promptly after the dispute was resolved.
however,williams outstanding base wages,totaling,were not paid until approximately july,some days after his voyage ended.again,there is a dispute as to the cause of the delay.williams alleges that the korea captain deliberately failed to make the necessary entries in the ship computer,in order to punish williams for disputing the management company policy of paying some of its sailors with worthless vouchers.the defendant asserts that captain londagin failed to make the entry out of an oversight,and that a subsequent,unrelated clerical error in which a data entry clerk failed to notice the captain updated entry caused an additional delay.
although the parties disagree over who is the legal owner of the korea,neither disputes that the korea was only nominally held in trust by wilmington.wilmington simply held title to the ship in order to qualify it for certain subsidies available solely to vessels.wilmington then leased the korea to american ship management asm,which exercised at least some degree of control over the ship and managed its daily operations.asm at times also leased the ship on a basis back to the foreign beneficiaries of wilmington trust.
when williams returned from another foray and discovered that his check had been more than a month late,he filed suit,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york martin,alleging that under the seaman wage statutes,he was entitled to statutory damages of two days wages for every day after the fourth day following the end of the voyage his payment was delayed,which in this case would be about.the defendants moved to dismiss,with defendant asm arguing that the court lacked personal jurisdiction,and defendant wilmington arguing that it is not an owner under the statute.the magistrate judge granted asm motion,but denied wilmington.wilmington then moved for summary judgment,reasserting its ownership claim,and arguing that its clerical errors fell within a statutory safe harbor for late payments having substantial cause.the district court agreed with the latter point,and granted wilmington motion.see williams wilmington trust,wl.
williams now appeals the district court decision,and wilmington the earlier adverse decision by the magistrate judge.
discussion 
the seaman wage statute provides that 
b the master shall pay a seaman the balance of wages due the seaman within days after the termination of the agreement required by section of this title or when the seaman is discharged,whichever is earlier.
c when payment is not made as provided under subsection b of this section without sufficient cause,the master or owner shall pay to the seaman days wages for each day payment is delayed.
these provisions apply to coastwise,or domestic voyages,such as the journey of the korea from seattle to san pedro.an essentially identical provision applies to international voyages.
wilmington argues that it was at most merely negligent in failing to pay williams his wages,and that such negligence can constitute sufficient cause to excuse wilmington from paying the wage penalty.it is clear that where the employer deliberately relies on a reasonable,but ultimately wrong,legal argument to withhold payment,it is not subject to the wage penalty.see pacific mail schmidt.finding penalty inapplicable where employer had strong and reasonable ground for believing the statute ought not to be held to apply chretien exxon,cir conte flota mercante del estado,cir holding that bona fide dispute as to whether wages were due negates penalty.
the supreme court has argued persuasively that negligent failures to pay are not comparable to this intentional,refusal to tender wages.as the court has twice observed,the purpose of the statute,as evinced both by its language and its legislative history,is to secure the promptest possible payment of wages.griffin oceanic contractors,d quoting,at,see collie fergusson.the court concluded from that,we the statute is designed to deter negligent or arbitrary delays in payment.griffin,at.
wilmington,however,asserts that we are bound by our holding in vinieris byzantine maritime,cir,which wilmington believes is to the contrary.it is true that we said in vinieris that b efore the plaintiff could recover under this section there had to be a showing of conscious misconduct on the part of the ship captain,conduct by the captain which was arbitrary,unwarranted,unreasonable,unjust,and willful.id.at emphasis added internal citations omitted.there is little indication,however,that the vinieris court intended to address anything other than deliberate refusals to pay.indeed,the plaintiffs there had never offered a negligence theory they asserted that the owners deliberately withheld this money.id.at.thus,we had no reason to decide whether sufficient cause could be established by negligence 
ultimately,however,this is a knot we need not untie.as the plain text of the statute evidences,if wilmington is not the master or owner,it can not be liable for a wage penalty.madeja olympic packers,llc,cir caldwell solus ocean,cir.wilmington attempts to remove the burden of ownership by arguing that its arrangement with asm,known in nautical circles as a bareboat charter,made asm what we have sometimes termed the owner pro hac vice for this cause,so that under the literal language of the statute it is asm,not wilmington,that would be liable for any penalty.the magistrate judge dismissed this argument,reasoning that even if there are other potential owner s under the statute,wilmington still falls within the plain meaning of that term.in determining the meaning of any act
