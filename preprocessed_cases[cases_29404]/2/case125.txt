petitioners lockheed martin corporation and ace usa,the insurer for lockheed martin corporation,petition for review of the february,decision of the benefits review board of the united states department of labor board,reversing the findings of administrative law judge paul teitler of the united states department of labor alj,holding rocco morganti morganti to have been covered by the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,lhwca or act at the time of his fatal accident,and awarding death benefits to morganti widow,respondent lorraine morganti.we deny the petition and uphold the award of benefits to lorraine morganti.
we agree with the board and hold that cayuga lake is a navigable waterway of the united states because the appropriate test for navigability depends on physical rather than economic characteristics of the waterway in question.we decline to decide whether to adopt a transient and fortuitous exception to the general rule that a person injured on actual navigable waters is engaged in maritime employment because we,like the board,hold that a person on an object floating in actual navigable waters is on actual navigable waters,so that morganti was not transiently and fortuitously on actual navigable waters.finally,we agree with the board conclusion,although not its underlying reasoning,and hold that morganti employment,either in its totality or as performed on actual navigable waters,was not exclusively data processing.we therefore hold that morganti was covered by the act and deny the petition for review.
background 
the underlying facts of this case are undisputed.lorraine morganti seeks benefits under a federal workers compensation act,the lhwca,for her husband tragic death in the course of his employment.lockheed seeks to deny these benefits on the ground that morganti was not covered by the act.
morganti was employed for fifteen years as a test engineer by lockheed martin naval electronics surveillance systems,a division of petitioner lockheed martin corporation collectively,lockheed based in syracuse,new york.his job as a test engineer for lockheed work under contracts with the united states navy required him to spend thirty to forty percent of his time testing equipment on the paganelli,a research barge moored on cayuga lake.on december,morganti suffered a fatal accident on the shuttle boat returning him to shore from the paganelli.while untying the shuttle,he fell into the lake.despite rescue efforts by the pilot of the shuttle,morganti drowned,and his body was not recovered until later.
lockheed manufactures transducers,a component required for sonar equipment used by the united states navy.to test these transducers underwater,lockheed uses equipment on the paganelli.the paganelli has been moored to two mooring buoys since.each buoy is secured by a anchor and a sinker,but the buoys are fully independent of the paganelli,which could disconnect from the buoys within minutes.the paganelli has no independent means of propulsion.access to the paganelli is achieved via a shuttle boat,the little toot ii.
cayuga lake is one of the finger lakes of central new york,and is connected at its north end to the erie canal system,which means that a boat can theoretically sail from cayuga lake to any port in the world.the locks of the erie canal are limited in size,but sufficient for ninety percent of the ships currently used for inland commercial freight shipping and passenger services.the erie canal is closed for the winter months of the year.at trial,lockheed explicitly conceded that the erie canal is a navigable waterway and that cayuga lake can physically support commercial shipping.at this time,no commercial shipping actually takes place on cayuga lake other than commercial tour boats,which entered or exited the lake over three hundred times in.there is no record evidence as to whether these boats traveled interstate.
morganti was responsible for testing lockheed transducers in the waters of cayuga lake and pinpointing and troubleshooting failures in the transducer production process at an office in syracuse.his qualifications for this position are not in the record,but a witness with a similar position held an associate degree in electrical technology.morganti carried a security clearance of secret in order to work with the transducers and evaluate the testing data.he received a salary of approximately per year.
morganti was required to spend to two days per week testing transducers on the paganelli.he was not required to help moor the little toot ii,handle the transducers,or physically connect testing equipment to the transducers,but he frequently did so voluntarily.once a transducer was lowered into the water through an internal well,morganti would use a computer to run tests for an hour,by loading each testing program from disks as needed and inputting information such as water temperature,water depth,and which test to run.once the tests were completed,he would review the test output,consisting of numbers and graphs,for facial validity and reasonableness.typically,further analysis would be carried out in syracuse,not on the paganelli.
on december,morganti was untying the little toot ii to return to shore when he fell into the water and drowned.his widow,respondent lorraine morganti,filed a claim for death benefits under the act with the office of workers compensation programs of the united states department of labor on july.the alj,judge teitler,denied her claim,on the grounds that morganti was not a maritime employee under section of the act,the paganelli was a fixed platform categorized as artificial land akin to an island under herb welding,gray,d,so that morganti was only transiently and fortuitously on navigable waters,and was thus outside the coverage of the act under the fifth circuit holding in bienvenu texaco,cir and morganti job was data processing and thus specifically excluded from coverage under section a of the act.the alj rejected lockheed argument that cayuga lake is not navigable.
lorraine morganti appealed to the board,and was joined in her appeal by the director of the office of workers compensation programs director as a party in interest.the board reversed all of the alj conclusions,except as to the navigability of cayuga lake,and remanded to the alj.the alj resolved the remaining issues on stipulations,and at lockheed request,the board summarily affirmed to make the order final and to permit review by this court.lockheed now brings the instant petition for review of the board decision.

i.the longshore and harbor workers compensation act 
in,the supreme court established that state workers compensation acts could not cover longshoremen who were injured while within maritime jurisdiction,as application of such acts would destroy the uniformity of regulation achieved by the federal government maritime law power.southern pac.jensen,superseded by statute on other grounds.cases following jensen made clear that the line beyond which state regulatory power could not extend was the water edge,a demarcation that became known as the jensen line.see director,office of workers comp.programs perini river,d.in response,congress enacted the act in to provide compensation for injuries occurring on navigable waters in the course of employment by a statutory employer calbeck travelers ins,d.under this regime,any worker,regardless of his or her duties or activities,was protected by the act if injured on navigable waters.perini,at.
in,congress extended this situs requirement by extending the statutory navigable waters to include certain adjoining land areas.section a of the act now provides coverage to employees who suffer disability or death due to an injury incurred on this expanded situs.a.congress simultaneously added a status requirement in section of the act,limiting the act coverage to 
a ny person engaged in maritime employment,including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations,and any including a ship repairman,shipbuilder,and,but such term does not include a individuals employed exclusively to perform office clerical,secretarial,security,or data processing work 
however,the supreme court held in perini that the amendments were not intended to withdraw coverage from any person who would have been covered before.at.the status requirement of section thus limits coverage for injuries on those land areas brought within the statutory meaning of navigable waters,but when a worker is injured on the actual navigable waters in the course of his employment on those waters,he satisfies the status requirement in,unless he is excluded by any other provision of the act.perini,at.thus,coverage under the act still requires both situs and status,but certain kinds of situs,physical presence on actual navigable waters,will fulfill the status requirement.
lockheed first argues that morganti can not meet the situs test because the waters of cayuga lake are not navigable waters under a test of long standing,waterways are navigable in fact when they are used,or are susceptible of being used,in their ordinary condition,as highways for commerce.the daniel ball,wall.lockheed conceded below that the erie canal is navigable,that the erie canal includes locks identical to the one that connects cayuga lake to the erie canal,and that cayuga lake is physically capable of supporting commercial water traffic.
lockheed instead argues that the topography of cayuga lake and the economic conditions of the surrounding areas make commercial shipping unprofitable,and that the lake is therefore not susceptible of being used for commercial shipping,and thus is not navigable.in support of its argument,lockheed relies primarily on leblanc cleveland,cir.in leblanc,we considered whether admiralty jurisdiction extended to a section of the hudson river that ran through nine dams and was not presently used for commercial activity.id.at.the appellant in that case argued that newer artificial obstructions should not be considered because navigability must be judged on the basis of the river historic or natural state.id.at.citing several damming cases from other courts of appeals,we rejected the historical navigability argument,reasoning that in the absence of the potential for commercial shipping,there was no federal interest in providing a uniform body of law to govern activities on the relevant section of the hudson river.id.at see also livingston united states,cir chapman united states,cir adams montana power,cir.we therefore held that navigability is limited to waters presently used or presently capable of being used for commercial activity,and that natural and artificial obstructions prohibiting such activity defeat navigability.leblanc,at.
leblanc undermines rather than supports lockheed contention that economic conditions can render a waterway incapable of being used for commerce.leblanc clearly focuses on physical characteristics of the waterways themselves,holding that obstructions such as dams prevent any possibility of commercial activity.the supreme court,in applying the daniel ball test,interpreted the term natural or ordinary conditions by focusing on physical conditions the volume of water as well as the gradients and regularity of flow.united states appalachian power.the question of whether it would be economically difficult to profitably use cayuga lake commercially is a fundamentally different question that does not affect whether the lake is capable of being used for commerce.
nor are we persuaded that the reasoning of leblanc supports lockheed argument.in that case,we focused on the federal interest in ensuring that events on the waterway in question were governed by a uniform body of law.at citing adams,at.in the instant case,where the waterway is not physically obstructed but only economically inactive,the federal interest remains.because cayuga lake is physically capable of supporting shipping,it is possible at any time for an interstate commercial vessel to enter the lake.indeed,lockheed own evidence indicates that companies located near cayuga lake have seriously considered commercial shipping on the lake in the recent past.any such shipping would give rise to the same federal interests as interstate commercial shipping anywhere else.if we were now to withdraw federal jurisdiction from cayuga lake,we would have to extend it again the moment that an interstate commercial ship entered the lake.in contrast,basing such jurisdictional changes on major events like damming or other physical alterations that make it physically impossible for a commercial vessel to travel on the waterway presents few difficulties.as lockheed conceded below that there are no such physical alterations,we conclude that cayuga lake is navigable for purposes of the act.
iii.status 
lockheed raises two arguments to support its conclusion that morganti was not a covered employee under section of the act.first,lockheed argues that morganti was only transiently and fortuitously on actual navigable waters,and therefore should be excluded from coverage.second,lockheed contends that morganti was employed exclusively to perform data processing work and is therefore explicitly excluded from coverage.we address these arguments in turn.
a.the transient and fortuitous exception 
as discussed above,the supreme court has held that all employees injured while physically on actual navigable waters are maritime employees within the status requirement of section of the act.perini,at.however,the court express ed no opinion whether such coverage extends to a worker injured while transiently or fortuitously upon actual navigable waters.id.at.the court later note d in passing that there was a substantial difference between a worker performing a set of tasks requiring him to be both on and off actual navigable waters,and a worker whose job is entirely but who takes a boat to work.herb welding,at.based on these signals,lockheed now asks us to follow the fifth and eleventh circuits and create a transient and fortuitous exception to the general perini rule.under this exception,for an employee to be covered under the act,a not insubstantial amount of the employee time must take place on the water.bienvenu texaco,cir see also brockington certified,cir denying coverage to a electrician who was injured on a boat en route to a job site.
if we were to adopt this rule,lockheed would still need to demonstrate that morganti presence on cayuga lake was in fact transient and fortuitous in order to prevail.lockheed does not dispute that if morganti substantial time on the paganelli is counted as presence on water,then morganti could not be considered to be transiently and fortuitously on water.see bienvenu,at declining to set exact standards but holding that a worker who spent of his employment time on actual navigable waters did not fall within the transient and fortuitous exception and was covered by the act.lockheed argues instead that the paganelli is a fixed platform akin to an artificial island,and that morganti time on the paganelli should accordingly be considered time on land.only morganti time on the little toot ii would then be considered time on water,and the brief commute time would constitute only a transient and fortu
