patricia wills wills or plaintiff seeks damages under the jones act,a,general maritime law,and new york state law for losses related to the death of her husband,ricky lee wills decedent,from cancer complications.wills alleges that decedent illness and death are attributable to his exposure to hazardous chemicals while working aboard ships owned and operated by amerada hess corporation,star companies,sheridan transportation corporation,and hygrade operators,collectively defendants.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants upon concluding that wills failed to proffer sufficient admissible evidence of causation.see wills amerada hess,civ.rpp,wl,at.
on appeal,wills argues that the district court erred in holding that the burden of proof as to causation rested with her,and that the district court abused its discretion in excluding her proposed experts testimony on the issue of causation.specifically,wills contends that because her suit was brought under the jones act,the rule prescribed by the pennsylvania,wall.the pennsylvania rule or the rule,should apply,and the standards of reliability to which expert testimony is held under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,should be relaxed.for the reasons discussed below,we disagree with both contentions and affirm the district court judgment granting defendants summary judgment on wills claims.
background 
from to,decedent served as a seaman aboard vessels owned or operated by defendants.these vessels transported fuels such as crude oil,jet fuel,kerosene,and gasoline.in december,roughly four months after leaving defendants employ,decedent was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma.although he underwent an aggressive treatment regime,the cancer progressed.he died on october,at the age of.
decedent wife and executrix of his estate,patricia wills,filed this suit in october,alleging that decedent cancer was due,in part,to his harmful exposure to benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs while working aboard defendants vessels.her complaint raised claims of wrongful death,unseaworthiness,and maintenance and cure under general maritime law,negligence and loss of consortium under new york state law,and negligence and wrongful death under the jones act pursuant to a schedule set by the district court,discovery was to be completed by august,and trial was to begin in september of that year.
for purposes of this appeal,we summarize only those aspects of the protracted discovery process that relate to wills proposed experts.defendants first sought to identify wills experts and the nature of the experts anticipated testimony through interrogatories,propounded on april.wills moved to strike the interrogatories.the district court denied her motion and ordered wills to respond by may.in late august,wills disclosed the names of three proposed expert witnesses jesse bidanset,a forensic toxicologist cynthia duffield,a civil engineer and richard rodi,an engineer and basic ship design manager.instead of scientific reports describing the nature of the experts research and detailed descriptions of their anticipated testimony,wills provided defendants with only superficial descriptions of the experts intended testimony.the district court ordered wills to produce more detailed expert reports by november.
at a november,hearing,the district court,in response to defendants assertion that there was no proven link between benzene exposure and squamous cell carcinoma,ordered wills to provide,within two weeks,a scientific report establishing such a causal link.on november,wills produced a preliminary report authored by bidanset the first report,which concluded with reasonable scientific certainty that decedent occupational exposure to various petroleum products was the most probable cause of his squamous cell carcinoma.the brevity of the first report,and,inter alia,its failure to cite sufficient scientific evidence to support its conclusion,prompted the district court to continue its december,order staying further discovery until bidanset could be deposed and the admissibility of his testimony determined.wills amerada hess,civ.rpp,wl,at,
on april,wills provided defendants with another report from bidanset the second report,and bidanset deposition was taken later that year.in the second report,bidanset also advanced the oncogene theory of theory which,by his own admission,is controversial.wills,wl,at.the more scientific theory of that toxins are only carcinogenic when a person is exposed to concentrations over and above a specified threshold level.below the specified threshold level,the effects of the toxins are thought to be benign.in contrast,bidanset oncogene theory suggests that for some toxins there is no safe level of exposure because the cancer can be triggered by the interaction of a single molecule of the toxin with a single human cell.bidanset surmised that decedent cancer had developed in the manner predicted by the oncogene theory.
on january,appellees moved to exclude bidanset testimony,and for summary judgment on all claims.in response,wills moved to apply the pennsylvania rule to her claims,thereby shifting the burden of proof on the issue of causation to appellees.further,wills submitted two additional expert alfred neugut,an oncologist and epidemiologist,and paul haas,an industrial her response papers.the district court refused to consider these additional expert reports,excluding them as untimely.order of.
in an opinion and order dated january,the district court granted defendants motion to exclude the proposed testimony and reports of bidanset,finding them to be without sufficient indicia of reliability as required for admissibility under rule of the federal rules of evidence rule.wills,wl,at.first,the district court rejected wills contention that the standards for admissibility under daubert are relaxed in cases brought under the jones act.id.at.second,applying daubert list of factors to be considered when admitting evidence under rule,the district court found bidanset opinions insufficiently reliable to be admissible under rule.id.at.specifically,the district court found that bidanset first the district court deemed devoid of scientific evidence linking squamous cell carcinoma to exposure to benzene and pahs,the toxins to which decedent allegedly was exposed demonstrate d that bidanset was ready to form a conclusion first,without any basis,and then try to justify it.id.at.further,the district court noted that bidanset conceded in his deposition that he was unaware of any scientific studies that would support his contention,made in the first report,that the aggressiveness of decedent cancer demonstrates that he was intensely exposed to carcinogenic hydrocarbons.id.
with regard to the second report,the district court was skeptical of bidanset assumption that decedent was exposed to benzene,pahs,and diesel exhaust assumption that bidenset based largely on the fact that the vessels on which decedent worked were powered by diesel engines and carried petroleum products.although bidanset was able to document that,on at least some of the defendants vessels,benzene emissions occasionally exceeded levels permitted by the occupational safety and health administration osha,the district court found no evidence that decedent worked on any of those particular vessels at the times when such high levels were recorded.id.at.bidanset also relied on the affidavit of another seaman,mark miller,who,for a period of five months,intermittently worked with decedent aboard defendants ships.miller averred that both he and decedent were exposed to noxious odors,but the district court discounted the value of such statements on the ground that miller lacked the expertise necessary to determine the toxicity of the fumes.id.at.
next,the district court considered the scientific studies upon which bidanset relied,all of which involved animal,rather than human subjects.the district court noted that bidanset failed to establish a link between benzene and pah exposure and squamous cell carcinoma.id.at.the court further noted that,by bidanset own admission,the cancer most linked to benzene exposure is leukemia.id.at.the district court observed that,in failing to establish a nexus between benzene and pah exposure and decedent cancer,bidanset indicated that he is not even sure whether benzene is capable of causing decedent squamous cell carcinoma.id.at.
observing that courts should be cautious in presuming that findings derived from animal studies are applicable to humans,the district court nevertheless scrutinized the animal studies which purportedly established a link between benzene and squamous cell carcinoma.the district court observed that in studies in which mice inhaled the toxin,the causal link between benzene and squamous cell carcinoma was only tenuous.id.although such a link was stronger in studies in which rats ingested large quantities of benzene,the district court doubted the pertinence of those studies because there was no suggestion that decedent ingested benzene,let alone at such high doses or for comparable durations.id.
the district court also expressed dissatisfaction with bidanset failure to account adequately for the possibility that decedent cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption caused his squamous cell carcinoma.id.although bidanset conceded that smoking is the most frequent cause of squamous cell carcinoma,the second report summarily discounted the fact that decedent smoked between one and two packs per day for over twenty years.according to bidanset,smoking was not likely the cause of decedent cancer,because it usually takes decades for cigarette smoking to cause squamous cell carcinoma,and the cancer is then usually found in the lungs rather than the head and neck.the district court,however,found that this statement contradicted a study that bidanset relied upon in the first report,which concluded that smoking is a major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.id.the study further concluded that the latency period for developing squamous cell carcinoma was eight years,rather than decades,as bidanset contended.id.the district court also faulted the second report for not accounting for the possibility that decedent heavy drinking may have caused his squamous cell carcinoma,even though the first report specifically stated that alcohol is a major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma.id.
regarding the second report,the district court held that bidanset oncogene theory failed all of the daubert factors,as it had not been tested or subjected to peer review,and consequently,there was no known potential error rate.id.at.further,the district court found that bidanset reasons for departing from the mainstream understanding of causation to embrace the oncogene theory were wholly unsatisfactory.id.at.bidanset could cite to no epidemiological studies pointing to an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in those exposed to benzene or pahs,and he conceded in his deposition that he was unsure whether pahs conform to the oncogene theory at all.the district court also determined that bidanset conclusion that exposure to diesel fuel contributed to decedent cancer was made without any basis.id.at.
on the basis of these deficiencies,the district court granted defendants motion to exclude bidanset expert testimony and opinions.id.wills nonetheless argued that,even if such evidence were excluded,the defendants motion for summary judgment should be denied because,under the pennsylvania rule,defendants bore the burden of proof on the issue of causation.the district court declined to apply the pennsylvania rule and refused to shift the burden of proof to defendants.id.at.relying chiefly on this court decision in wilkins american export isbrandtsen lines,cir,in which we declined to invoke the rule where a seaman died from a heart attack after working more hours than statutorily allowed,the district court held that the pennsylvania rule should not be extended beyond the chosen area of ship collisions to embrace jones act cases.wills,wl,at quoting wilkins,at.
on wills claim for maintenance and cure,the district court found that,in addition to a failure of proof on the issue of causation,wills had proffered insufficient evidence to establish that decedent illness manifested itself during his employment with defendants.id.at.
finding wills without evidence on the issue of causation,an issue that the district court regarded as essential for her to prevail,the district court provisionally granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.id.sensitive to wills claim that her case had been stymied by her inability to obtain full discovery,the district court permitted wills an additional twenty days to submit an affidavit detailing the evidence sought through further discovery and the manner in which such evidence would assist her in proving causation.id.in response,wills requested an opportunity to depose all of defendants operating personnel and review a host of documents pertaining to the design and cargo of defendants vessels.she also requested permission to conduct environmental and air quality tests aboard defendants vessels.
after considering wills request,the district court declined to discovery.wills,wl,at.according to the district court,wills did not explain how an opportunity to depose all of defendants employees would allow her to remedy the deficiencies identified in bidanset testimony.id.at.as to the documentary evidence sought,the district court concluded that defendants either had complied with wills requests for such materials or that wills previously had been given sufficient access to such records.id.at.the district court was also unpersuaded by wills requests to conduct air quality tests on defendants vessels,because it doubted that the results of such more than seven years after decedent be probative on the issue of his exposure to toxins.id.for the reasons stated in its prior order and opinion,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims.
wills timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
we must first determine whether the district court correctly held that wills bears the burden of proof on the issue of causation and that the pennsylvania rule was inapplicable to her claims.because we answer those questions affirmatively,we then determine whether the court was correct in finding that wills did not satisfy her burden to prove causation and in granting summary judgment to defendants on that basis.we also answer those questions affirmatively and hold that expert testimony on the issue of causation is necessary in jones act cases where a lay juror could not be expected to intuit the causal relationship between the acts in question and the injury such expert testimony must satisfy the daubert standards of reliability to be admissible under rule the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that wills proffered expert testimony either did not meet those standards or was untimely and the district court stay of discovery pending a determination of the admissibility of wills expert testimony was not an abuse of discretion.
lastly,because wills has not established that decedent illness manifested itself while he was in defendants employ,or that decedent illness was causally related to exposure to toxic emissions while aboard defendants ships,her claim for maintenance and cure also fails.

ii.application of the pennsylvania rule 
b ecause of their status as wards of the admiralty,seamen are by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from change of climate,exposure to perils,and exhausting labour.weeks marine,cir internal quotation marks omitted see chandris,latsis,d.the jones act,app,provides seamen with special statutory protections in the area of personal injury suits any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may bring a cause of action against his employer.id.at a.the act therefore places a duty on the shipowner to provide a reasonably safe workplace.oxley city of new york,cir.wills argues that defendants breached this duty by exposing her husband to carcinogenic chemicals 
wills contends that defendants motion for summary judgment was improperly granted because,upon showing that defendants breached their regulatory obligation to protect decedent from exposure to toxins,the pennsylvania rule applies and relieves her of the burden of proving causation altogether.the pennsylvania rule,an oddity of admiralty law,shifts the burden of proving causation from plaintiffs to defendants to show not merely that their fault might not have been one of the causes of the injury,or that it probably was not,but that it could not have been.the pennsylvania,wall.at.wills asserts that she can prove that defendants violated various coast guard regulations requiring shipowners to monitor benzene emissions,see,and that proof of such violations warrants application of the pennsylvania rule presumption that these violations caused her husband cancer.
by shifting the burden of proof to establish causation,the pennsylvania rule creates a drastic and unusual presumption albeit a rebuttable the shipowner who has violated his or her legal duties.dir.of india supply mission maru,cir quoting gilmore black,the law of admiralty,at.nevertheless,such a presumption is appropriate in cases where,in light of wide experience in maritime navigation,t he logical probability is that the fault of the ship is the cause of the disaster.wilkins am.exp.isbrandtsen lines,cir.
collision cases,such as the case that gave the rule its moniker,most clearly illustrate this principle.because a collision is rare in which there is not at least some arguable reason for regarding both vessels at fault,id.internal quotations marks and citation omitted,it is logical to attribute fault to a ship that at the time of a collision is in actual violation of a statutory rule intended to prevent collisions.the pennsylvania,wall.at imposing presumption against sailboat,which,lacking a required foghorn,collided with a speeding steamer.thus under the rule,proof that a maritime safety rule was violated creates a presumption that the violation led to the collision,such that the complaining party is relieved of its obligation to show causation,unless the derelict shipowner can prove that the violation was not the cause of the collision.
wills correctly notes that application of the pennsylvania rule has not been limited to cases involving collisions.see,complaint of tug helen moran,cir applying the rule in the context of allision the aakre,cir applying the rule in the context of ship stranding.nevertheless,we have been cautious not to extend the rule application in ways that would unmoor it from its animating principles.thus,for example,we have held that application of the pennsylvania rule is limited to the violation of a statute intended to prevent the catastrophe which actually transpired.india supply mission,at.accordingly,we have applied the rule against a ship overloaded in violation of the load line act,app.b and c,that sank at sea.see petition of long,cir.we declined,however,to apply the rule against an unlawfully overloaded ship that became stranded in shallow water.india supply mission,at.in distinguishing the two scenarios,we noted that congress prime motivation in enacting the load line act was to prevent loss of life due to overloaded vessels sinking.id.at.absent such a limiting principle,every violation of every statute would call into play the pennsylvania rule irrespective of the purpose of the statute and the danger which it was intended to prevent.id.at.
wills argues that this limitation is satisfied here,because defendants are alleged to have violated coast guard regulations that were enacted for the express purpose of preventing seamen from developing cancer from exposure to toxic emissions while at sea.see fed.regulation,stating that coast guard regulation,incorporate d the lower benzene exposure levels adopted by osha which is expected to result in a lowering of leukemia deaths associated with the inhalation of benzene vapors.even assuming arguendo that wills is correct that her husband cancer was within the scope of harms that these coast guard regulations were intended to prevent,we agree with the district court that the circumstances of this case do not warrant application of the pennsylvania rule.
in addition to requiring a nexus between the injury and the purpose of the legal obligation that was breached,our cases hold that the pennsylvania rule will not create a presumption that the law violation caused a calamity unless common sense or the realities of admiralty prompt that conclusion.in the mabel,cir per curiam,for example,we refused to impose the pennsylvania rule against an anchored ship that was struck by a barge at night,despite the barge owner argument that the collision could have been avoided had the anchored ship complied with its legal obligation to hang cautionary lights at a sufficient distance from one another.id.at.while a ll things are indeed possible,we observed that in applying the pennsylvania rule we are limited to the reasonable probabilities.id.finding it improbable that the anchored ship failure to comply with the regulation was the cause of the collision,the bargeowner application to invoke the pennsylvania rule was denied.
over fifty years later,in wilkins,similar reasoning led us to reject application of the pennsylvania rule in a jones act case.there,a seaman suffered a fatal heart attack after being required to work strenuous amounts of overtime.the seaman estate sued the seaman employer under the jones act,arguing that by forcing the seaman to work so hard,the employer was responsible for the seaman death.id.at.the estate claimed that the pennsylvania rule was applicable because the employer violated a safety statute that limited seaman overtime.id.at.while recognizing that the seaman overtime work was not so devoid of probative value as to forbid an inference that it caused his heart attack,we also found that the nexus between the violation of the statute and the seaman heart attack was not so as to warrant the presumption that violation of the overtime statute resulted in the seaman death.id.at.accordingly,we held that the pennsylvania rule does not apply where proof that the legal obligation was breached does not lead naturally and logically to the conclusion that the breach caused the injury.id.at.
wills contends that it is entirely possible that decedent would not have developed squamous cell carcinoma if defendants had complied with their obligations to monitor benzene.we can not say,however,that it is reasonably probable that defendants and decedent cancer were causally related.see the mabel,at.no reference to our common experience in admiralty,or to authorities with wide experience in maritime navigation,supports the conclusion that the failure to monitor benzene levels led naturally and logically to decedent fatal cancer.see wilkins,at.in this regard,we agree with the third circuit that the pennsylvania rule was not intended to increase the likelihood of liability no matter how remote and unrelated an injury to a statutory or regulatory violation.in re complaint of nautilus motor tanker,cir.
although wills relies heavily on our decision in in re seaboard shipping,cir,our decision to apply the pennsylvania rule in that case does not prompt us to apply the rule here.in re seaboard involved a controversy between a barge owner and a tugboat owner that arose after two bargemen drowned when the tugboat and the barge it was hauling were caught in a violent storm.id.at.together,the owners of the tugboat and the barge advanced the money to settle claims brought by the bargemen survivors thereafter,they sued one another for exoneration.id.although the barge suffered from an inoperative radio and a leaky lifeboat,the barge owner nonetheless argued that he was not partially liable because the tugboat,which negligently steered both vessels into the path of the storm,had not proven that the absence of the barge required safety features caused the bargemen to drown.id.at.in applying the pennsylvania rule,we held that the lack of proof disadvantaged the barge and the parties were jointly liable.id.at.the factual circumstances of that case,however,are wholly distinguishable from the instant case.in in re seaboard,the facts suggested that the tragedy would not have occurred absent the barge statutory violations which left it mute and helpless.id.at.here,there is no indication that decedent cancer would not have occurred if defendants had complied with coast guard regulations.
wills,however,argues that application of the pennsylvania rule in this case is necessary to give effect to the purposes of the jones act to compel defendants compliance with safety obligations.the plaintiff in wilkins raised a similar argument.nevertheless,we were not persuaded that there are broad considerations of policy which require that we extend the admiralty rule of the pennsylvania to embrace jones act cases.wilkins,at see also pierro steel,cir finding application of the pennsylvania rule inappropriate in jones act claim for death of overworked seaman.we are aware that in the years since we decided wilkins,some courts have applied the pennsylvania rule in jones act cases.see reyes vantage,cir marine solution,horton,alaska.the facts of the instant case,however,present no compelling reason to depart from our prior precedents.even if we were persuaded that the pennsylvania rule should be applied in some jones act cases,we would still decline to apply the rule in cases where,as here,it can not be said with confidence that the plaintiff injury resulted from defendants actions.
iii.wills jones act claims 
having determined that wills,rather than defendants,bears the burden of proving causation,we turn to whether the district court was correct in holding that wills failed to carry her burden and that summary judgment in favor of defendants was warranted.in considering defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court first determined that wills was required to proffer expert testimony on the issue of causation.after ruling that wills proffered expert testimony on the issue of causation was inadmissible,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment because wills had not proffered evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that decedent cancer was even partially caused by his alleged exposure to toxins while aboard defendants ships.wills,wl,at.
on appeal,wills reminds us that as a jones act plaintiff,she shoulders a lighter burden for establishing negligence than her counterpart on land would carry.mcmillan marine sulphur shipping,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.she argues that the district court,in excluding her proposed expert testimony on the issue of causation,failed to appreciate her reduced burden to prove causation.wills claims that,by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground that she failed to proffer admissible evidence on the issue of causation,the district court undermined the right of the jury to pass upon the question of fault and causation,a right that in jones act cases must be most liberally viewed.oxley,at internal quotation marks omitted.in reviewing wills claims,we consider whether expert testimony was required to prove causation under the jones act,the standards for the admissibility of expert testimony apply in full force the district court abused its discretion in excluding wills proposed expert testimony and in the absence of admissible evidence on the issue of causation,summary judgment was properly granted to defendants.answering these questions affirmatively,we agree with the district court conclusion that wills failed to satisfy her burden to prove causation and that summary judgment in favor of defendants was warranted.
expert testimony necessary to prove causation 
wills argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because expert testimony was not necessary to satisfy her burden to prove causation.it is well settled that expert testimony is unnecessary in cases where jurors are as capable of comprehending the primary facts and of drawing correct conclusions from them as are witnesses possessed of special or peculiar training.salem united states lines,d internal quotation marks omitted.where,however,the nexus between the injury and the alleged cause would not be obvious to the lay juror,e xpert evidence is often required to establish the causal connection between the accident and some item of physical or mental injury.moody maine cent,cir.in a case such as this,where an injury has multiple potential etiologies,expert testimony is necessary to establish causation,even in view of plaintiff reduced burden to prove causation.see claar burlington,cir affirming district court grant of summary judgment following plaintiff failure to proffer admissible expert testimony on the issue of causation in a case brought under the federal employers liability act moody,at affirming the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants when plaintiff failed to proffer admissible expert testimony linking workplace harassment to emotional trauma.indeed,this court has never held that a jones act plaintiff can survive summary judgment in a toxic tort case without admissible expert testimony on the issue of causation.
wills argues,however,that our holding in ulfik commuter,cir stands for the proposition that a jones act or fela plaintiff may survive summary judgment,even in the absence of expert testimony on the issue of causation.in ulfik,the plaintiff brought a fela action against defendants for an injury suffered as a result of a fall following plaintiff exposure to paint fumes.id.at.we concluded that summary judgment was not warranted because no expert testimony was necessary to establish the causal nexus between inhaling paint fumes and the dizziness that allegedly led to plaintiff fall.id.at.this case is wholly distinguishable from ulfik in that,here,we can not rely on circumstantial,lay evidence alone to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether toxins emitted from defendants vessels caused decedent cancer.as we have noted,the causal link between exposure to toxins and other behavior and squamous cell carcinoma is sufficiently beyond the knowledge of the lay juror that expert testimony is required to establish causation.see claar,at finding that expert testimony was required to establish the causal nexus between plaintiffs injuries and their exposure to harmful chemicals.accordingly,we agree with the district court that wills was required to proffer expert testimony on the issue of causation,and,in the absence of such testimony,that the district court properly granted defendants motion for summary judgment.
daubert standards apply in the context of the jones act 
wills also contends that even if expert testimony on the issue of causation is required to survive summary judgment,she proffered admissible expert testimony,which the district court improperly excluded.specifically,wills maintains that because her burden of proof on the issue of causation is relaxed under the jones act,the standards of reliability and credibility used to determine admissibility of expert testimony under rule and daubert are also relaxed.to support this contention,wills relies on hines consolidated rail,cir.in hines,the plaintiff brought suit against his employer under the federal employers liability act fela,a statute,which,like the jones act,provides plaintiffs with a reduced burden of proof to establish causation in deciding plaintiff claims,the third circuit,in a decision that predates daubert,stated that the standard of proof under fela can significantly influence a determination of the admissibility of expert testimony.hines,at.for the reasons discussed,we find this argument unavailing and hold that daubert standards for determining the admissibility of expert testimony apply regardless of whether the plaintiff burden to prove causation is reduced.
although wills correctly characterizes her burden of proof to establish causation under the jones act,she fails to appreciate that the standards for determining the reliability and credibility of expert testimony are not altered merely because the burden of proof is relaxed.as both the sixth and ninth circuits observed in the context of fela claims,the standard of causation and the standards for admission of expert testimony under the federal rules of evidence are distinct issues and do not affect one another.claar,at see also taylor consol.rail,table,wl,at cir.june,quoting claar,at,and noting that i t is well established that the admissibility of expert testimony is in cases aris ing under fela,which,like the jones act,has a relaxed burden of proof to show causation by the federal rules of evidence and the seminal case of daubert internal citation omitted.we agree that even where,as here,plaintiff faces a relaxed burden of proof with regard to causation,the district court admission of expert testimony is nonetheless governed by the strictures of rule and daubert 
c.the district court exclusion of bidanset testimony was not an abuse of discretion 
wills contends that the district court exclusion of bidanset testimony was an abuse of discretion.first,she maintains that the district court concerns that bidanset failed to establish that exposure to carcinogenic substances while aboard defendants ships was the specific cause of decedent cancer were misplaced.under the jones act,she claims,a plaintiff need not demonstrate that defendant action caused the injury,but rather a plaintiff need show only that defendant actions were one of perhaps many causes of the injury.wills arguments miss the point of the district court conclusions.
rule of the federal rules of evidence,which governs the admissibility of scientific or technical expert testimony,provides 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
in daubert,the supreme court made clear that the district court has a gatekeeping function under rule,and is charged with the task of ensuring that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.at.in fulfilling this role,the district court must consider both the reliability and relevance of the proffered testimony.in gauging reliability,the district court should consider the indicia of reliability identified in rule,namely,that the testimony is grounded on sufficient facts or data that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and that the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.in so doing,the district court must make certain that an expert,whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience,employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.kumho tire,at.
although rule sets forth specific criteria for the district court consideration,these criteria are not exhaustive.the district court may consider a number of other factors in determining the reliability of the proffered testimony,including whether a theory or technique has been or can be tested whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication the technique known or potential rate of error and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique operation and whether a particular technique or theory has gained general acceptance in the relevant scientific community.see daubert,at.in the instant case,the district court rejected bidanset testimony on the grounds that it failed to comport with any of the relevant daubert factors for reliability of expert testimony and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants because wills failed to proffer admissible evidence of causation.
wills first challenges the district court exclusion of bidanset testimony on the grounds that it failed to quantify the dosage of the toxin to which decedent was allegedly exposed.wills maintains that the court misapprehended bidanset oncogene theory of causation and excluded the theory merely because it was not generally accepted in the scientific community.she further argues that the district court requirement that bidanset quantify dosage was unfair,as,she contends,defendants failed to monitor properly the concentration of toxins on ships upon which decedent worked,and she was not permitted sufficient discovery to determine the dosage amount.we find no abuse of discretion.
bidanset oncogene theory of causation,as the district court noted in its comprehensive and thorough discussion,see wills,wl,at,posits that decedent cancer was caused by a single of the quantity of the toxic chemicals such as benzene and pahs.although the district court observed that the oncogene theory was not generally accepted in the scientific community,id.at,this factor was not determinative in the court decision to exclude bidanset testimony.instead,the district court considered the oncogene theory in light of daubert four factors for reliability and concluded that the oncogene theory failed to satisfy any of the relevant factors.id.at.the district court determined that there was no evidence that the theory had been tested or subjected to peer review.id.at.indeed,bidanset admitted that the theory was the product of his own background experience and reading,rather than scientific testing or peer review.bidanset dep.at.further,the court found that bidanset did not state a known or potential error rate for the theory.id.finally,the district court determined that the relationship was the more generally accepted theory of causation in the scientific community,and that the oncogene theory,as bidanset conceded in his deposition testimony,was controversial.id.at.the district court assessment was entirely appropriate for discharging its duty to determine whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the proposed expert testimony is scientifically valid.daubert,at.
bidanset proposed expert testimony on the issue of dosage amount also relied on the affidavit testimony of mark miller,a seaman who worked on the same ships as decedent for a period of five months in.in his affidavit,miller averred that he and other seamen had suffered from various ailments that could be attributed to harmful exposure to toxins.miller also referred to conversations that he had with decedent regarding decedent symptoms of exposure to dangerous toxins.based on these observations,miller opined that decedent was exposed to a harmful dose of toxins while aboard defendants ships.bidanset relied on miller testimony in concluding that exposure to toxins while aboard defendants ships was the cause of decedent squamous cell carcinoma.the district court,however,found miller testimony insufficient to support expert testimony.id.at.
we agree with the district court
