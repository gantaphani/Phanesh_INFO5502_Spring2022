in this appeal we consider whether the safety valve provision of f applies to defendants convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine on board a vessel,in violation of the maritime drug law enforcement act,app.repealed we hold that the safety valve is unavailable to defendants convicted under app.therefore,we vacate the sentences of carlos hernando,jaimen and edgar,and we remand for resentencing without the safety valve.because we find that the government is estopped from arguing that the safety valve is inapplicable in the case of jairo,we affirm his sentence,including the reduction for acceptance of responsibility.
background and prior proceedings 
acting on a tip from a united states coast guard uscg aircraft patrolling the international waters of the pacific ocean approximately nautical miles south of san jose,guatemala,a uscg cutter intercepted a boat which was stalled in the water.the uscg officials questioned the four occupants of the boat in spanish concerning their nationality,their last port of call,their next port of call,and whether they had any documentation for the vessel.one of the four identified himself as the master of the vessel and stated that the occupants were colombian,that the vessel came from the buenaventura port in colombia and that costa rica was their next port of call.although the occupants produced personal identification,they could not produce any documentation for the vessel.the uscg contacted colombian authorities,who were unable to confirm that the boat was of colombian registry.as a result,the uscg officials boarded the vessel.
while on board,the uscg officials observed in plain view bales wrapped in plastic on the floor of the boat.the uscg officials opened one bale on the deck and it positive for cocaine.in total,the uscg officials seized approximately kilograms of cocaine from the vessel.the uscg detained all four occupants of the boat and transported them to san diego,california,where fbi agents conducted interviews with them following their arrests.the four occupants of the vessel were identified as jaimen,carlos hernando,jairo and edgar collectively appellees.
a criminal indictment charged the four appellees with conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute on board a vessel in violation of app.a,c and j and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute on board a vessel in violation of app.a,c a and f.appellees entered pleas of not guilty to both counts of the indictment.at the conclusion of appellees first trial,the jury informed the district court that it was unable to reach a verdict.the district court subsequently granted appellees motion for a mistrial based on a hung jury.appellees were then before a new jury on the same charges.at the conclusion of the second trial,the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts against all four appellees.
contrary to the recommendation of the presentence report,and over the government objection,the district court determined that safety valve relief under f was available to the appellees concerning their criminal convictions under app.accordingly,the government conducted the necessary interviews with appellees pursuant to f,which states that the application of the safety valve is contingent on a defendant truthfully providing the government with all information and evidence that the defendant has concerning the offense.because it determined that the appellees were truthful in their safety valve interviews with the government,the district court concluded that they qualified for the available safety valve relief and the relevant statutory minimum sentence was thus inapplicable.at sentencing,the district court found that appellees played a minor role in the offense and it also determined that appellees had accepted responsibility for their crimes.appellees had no criminal history.after applying the a factors,the district court calculated an adjusted offense level corresponding to an advisory guidelines sentencing range of to months for all four appellees.the district court imposed a sentence on each appellee.we have jurisdiction under to consider the government appeal of the sentences imposed on appellees.
ii.standard of review and jurisdiction 
we review de novo the district court interpretation of a statute as well as its interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.united states kimbrew,cir united states ventre,cir.we review for clear error the district court factual determination that a defendant qualifies for a reduced sentence based on acceptance of responsibility.united states,cir.
iii.discussion 
the government raises three challenges to the appellees sentences.first,the government contends that the safety valve provision in f does not apply to offenses committed under app.second,even assuming,arguendo,that the safety valve applies to app.offenses,the government argues that appellees,and do not qualify for its protection because they failed to satisfy the fifth element of the safety valve provision,which requires appellees to provide truthful information and evidence regarding their crimes to the government.see f.third,the government contends that the district court erred by granting appellees a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.
we agree with the government that the safety valve provision of f is inapplicable as a matter of law to sentences imposed following violations of app.accordingly,with respect to appellees,and,we only reach the government first argument and we vacate their sentences and remand for resentencing without the safety valve.we also find,however,that the government is estopped from raising this argument as to appellee and thus the safety valve is available to him.the government concedes that if the safety valve is available,has satisfied the necessary statutory elements to receive safety valve relief.thus,our only additional inquiry with respect to is whether the district court erred by applying a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.because we find that the district court did not err in this respect,we affirm sentence.
a.the safety valve provision in f does not apply to offenses under app.
we find that the plain statutory language indicates that the safety valve provision in f does not apply to violations of app.first,app.is not listed in the safety valve statute or.second,a plain reading of app.g demonstrates that the safety valve is inapplicable as a matter of law.furthermore,we find that the evidence relating to the statutory history of app.confirms our plain language reading of the statute.
plain statutory language 
historically,defendants convicted of serious drug crimes could only receive a sentence below the applicable statutory minimum if the government filed a motion for downward departure based on the defendant substantial assistance to the authorities under of the united states sentencing guidelines.however,an inequity in the sentencing scheme began to develop as more culpable defendants were able to provide the government with new and useful information that the offenders could not.as a result,the more culpable defendants could avoid the statutory minimum penalties more easily than the offenders,who typically had less knowledge and thus had more difficulty providing sufficient assistance to the authorities to earn a motion from the government on their behalf.see united states shrestha,cir.in order to provide relief to offenders who made a good faith effort to cooperate with authorities but whose knowledge was of little use to the government,congress passed the mandatory minimum sentencing reform act,f.the mandatory minimum sentencing reform act,also known as the safety valve provision,provides relief from otherwise applicable statutory minimum sentences when a defendant satisfies five requirements.the safety valve provision states 
f limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases.notwithstanding any other provision of law,in the case of an offense under section,or of the controlled substances act,or section or of the controlled substances import and export act,the court shall impose a sentence pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the united states sentencing commission under section of title without regard to any statutory minimum sentence,if the court finds at sentencing,after the government has been afforded the opportunity to make a recommendation,that 
the defendant does not have more than criminal history point,as determined under the sentencing guidelines 
the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon or induce another participant to do so in connection with the offense 
the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person 
the defendant was not an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of others in the offense,as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise,as defined in section of the controlled substances act and 
not later than the time of the sentencing hearing,the defendant has truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan,but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.
f emphasis added 
title f states that the safety valve applies to an offense under a limited number of statutes that are specifically listed in the text,namely,and.title does not describe an offense itself,but rather prescribes the penalty for a number of drug offenses prohibited by other statutes.specifically,provides the penalties for violations of,and,all of which are listed in a.accordingly,f reference to an offense under invokes the statutes listed in a,and thus the safety valve also applies to offenses committed in violation of,and.
title app,however,is not included in the offenses listed in f or a.the meaning of this exclusion must be interpreted in light of the entire statutory scheme and legislative purpose.the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius as applied to statutory interpretation creates a presumption that when a statute designates certain persons,things,or manners of operation,all omissions should be understood as exclusions.silvers sony pictures entm t,cir quotation marks omitted.the maxim is a rule of interpretation,not a rule of law,and is properly applied only when it makes sense as a matter of legislative purpose.longview fibre rasmussen,cir.t he expressio unius principle describes what we usually mean by a particular manner of expression,but does not prescribe how we must interpret a phrase once written.id.
here,the omission of app.from the statutes listed in f and a indicates that offenses are excluded from safety valve relief.this conclusion is buttressed by the fact that congress codified the current form of app.in,eight years before deciding which statutes to include on the f list of offenses to which safety valve relief would apply.congress could have included as easily as it included the other statutes specifically listed in f.the timing of congress actions indicates that it consciously chose not to include offenses on the safety valve list.
in a similar context,we have previously held that the safety valve provision in f is only applicable to the statutes specifically enumerated therein.united states kakatin,cir.the issue presented in kakatin was whether the safety valve applied to convictions under,a statute which is not specifically listed in f.id.we stated 
we first note,and defendant concedes,that by its plain terms f does not apply to convictions.nor does the wording of f support the argument that it contains anything other than an exhaustive list of the offenses to which the safety valve applies.under the plain terms of f,the safety valve applies only to convictions under,and.under the general rule of statutory construction that the inclusion of certain provisions in a statute implies the exclusion of others f does not apply to convictions under.
kakatin,at citation omitted emphasis added.other circuits have also held that the safety valve is inapplicable to offenses under because that statute is not explicitly listed in f.see united states phillips,cir holding that the application of f safety valve is explicitly limited to the following offenses,and united states koons,cir holding that the safety valve does not apply to because congress specified particular offenses for which a f reduction may be considered,and is not listed as one of them united states anderson,cir the selection of these five statutes reflects an intent to exclude others united states mcquilkin,cir in clear and unambiguous language,therefore,f does not apply to convictions under.like,app.is not specifically listed in f and we thus hold that the plain statutory text indicates that the safety valve does not apply to violations of app.
to support their position that the plain statutory language does not lead to this conclusion,appellees rely on the reasoning expressed in a recent district court decision,united states,d,which held that the safety valve provision in f does apply to convictions under app.appellees note that f expressly states that the safety valve applies to an offense under.f see,d at.appellees also argue that app,though not specifically listed in,nevertheless constitutes an offense under for safety valve purposes because app.states that a defendant who violates the provisions of shall be punished in accordance with the penalties set forth in.app.g the district court in adopted this argument and found that the text of g indicates that sentences under,just like the punishments under the enumerated statutes in,are not only subject to the applicable mandatory minimums of,but are also entitled to safety valve relief through f invocation of,d at.
this is a misreading of the plain statutory language.the court read app.g as requiring violations of to be treated exactly the same as violations of the statutes listed in a.id.we do not agree that the text of g supports this conclusion.as noted above,app.g states that defendants violating shall be punished in accordance with the penalties set forth in emphasis added.the statutory language does not indicate that violations of shall be punished the same as violations of the statutes listed in a.instead,g unambiguously invokes the penalties set forth in,not the entire text of.accordingly,the relevant inquiry is what are the penalties set forth in the penalties set forth in are found in b and include explicit references to statutory minimum sentences.see b,b.there is no mention of the safety valve anywhere in.accordingly,a punishment in accordance with the penalties set forth in would incorporate the statutory minimum but not the safety valve of f because the mandatory minimum is set forth in and the safety valve is not.app.g.we thus find that the plain statutory language indicates that app.is not an offense under,despite g invocation of the penalties of.accordingly,we hold that the safety valve is unavailable to offenses.
history of app.
having determined that the plain statutory language unambiguously indicates that the safety valve is inapplicable to offenses under app,we would generally end our inquiry here.see bedroc,llc united states,d thus,our inquiry begins with the statutory text,and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.however,we recognize that in the past the government has acted under the assumption that the safety valve does apply to offenses,and thus has not generally challenged its availability.see,united states zakharov,cir the government argued that the defendant did not satisfy the elements of f,but it never argued that the safety valve was legally unavailable united states bravo,cir same.we also recognize that the published district court order in disagrees with our reading of the plain statutory language and relies heavily on an analysis of the statutory history of app.to determine that the safety valve is indeed applicable to offenses.accordingly,we believe it appropriate to examine the history of the statute as well.
despite conclusion to the contrary,we find that the history and purpose of app.demonstrate that the safety valve does not apply to offenses committed under this statute.appellees note that in the district court found that denying safety valve relief to app.offenses would lead to the illogical result of treating violations of app.more severely than violations of.see,d at.in its entirety,states 
it shall be unlawful for any person to bring or possess on board any vessel or aircraft,or on board any vehicle of a carrier,arriving in or departing from the united states or the customs territory of the united states,a controlled substance in schedule i or ii or a narcotic drug in schedule iii or iv,unless such substance or drug is a part of the cargo entered in the manifest or part of the official supplies of the vessel,aircraft,or vehicle.
section is specifically listed in a,and thus violations of trigger mandatory minimums,but they are also protected by the safety valve as an offense under.f.adhering to our plain language reading of and f creates a system in which violations of receive safety valve protection,while violations of app.do not.appellees see this as an illogical result at odds with relevant statutory history and congressional intent.see,d at.
to support their argument,appellees rely on the statutory history detailed in the published district court decision.in,congress passed a statute making it unlawful to import or bring any narcotic drug into the united states or any territory under its control,including the territorial waters of the united states.act of may,act,ch,stat.repealed.violations of the act brought a maximum term of imprisonment.id.in,congress passed a statute governing drug offenses on board united states vessels in international waters.it stated that whoever brings narcotics on board,or has narcotics in his possession or control on board,any vessel of the united states,while engaged on a foreign voyage is subject to a maximum sentence.act of july,act,ch,stat.initially codified at repealed.by,drug possession on board vessels within the territorial waters of the united states was subject to the same penalties as possession on board a vessel in the high seas.see,d at citing the narcotic control act of,ch,stat.repealed.
in,congress repealed and replaced all existing laws pertaining to the importation and exportation of narcotics,including the act and the act.comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act comprehensive act,stat.as part of the comprehensive act,congress enacted as well as the accompanying penalty provision in.see,d at citations omitted.title covers the same offenses originally governed by the act,but the comprehensive act failed to enact a new statute to govern drug possession on the high seas,offenses which were originally governed by the act.id.adopting the reasoning of,the appellees contend that congress filled this statutory void in by passing,which was amended and codified as app.in.id.at citing act of,stat,abuse act of,stat.title app.states in relevant part 
it is unlawful for any person on board a vessel of the united states,or on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,or who is a citizen of the united states or a resident alien of the united states on board any vessel,to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute,or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance.
app.a.appellees argue that the difference between and app.is the same as the original difference between the act and the act governs possession in united states waters and governs possession on the high seas.appellees thus find it illogical to apply the safety valve to violations of and not to violations of app.because such a rule would,for the first time,punish drug possession in domestic waters more severely than possession in international waters,thereby rewarding those who elude capture until they almost reach united states soil.see,d at.
we do not agree that app.merely constitutes the modern formulation of the act.unlike the act,app.retains jurisdiction over certain states vessels in international waters.see app.c.furthermore,app.not only applies to offenses committed on the high seas,but it also covers offenses committed on board united states vessels within the customs waters of the united states,offenses which the act not the act would have historically covered.app.c d.finally,the act governed a different substantive offense than app.the act governed possession or control on board a united states vessel,while app.governs possession with intent to manufacture or distribute.app.a.therefore,given the differences between the act and,we conclude that the relationship between app.and is not analogous to the relationship between the act and the act.
furthermore,appellees and the court operate under the erroneous assumption that the principal difference between and app.is geography.the district court in incorrectly found that only differs from app.in that governs the waters of the united states and governs the high seas.see,d at.the statutory texts unambiguously demonstrate that the true difference between and app.lies in the prohibited conduct described therein.title and app.govern different substantive offenses.under,it is unlawful for someone to bring or possess on board any vessel arriving in or departing from the customs territory of the united states,a controlled substance under app.a,i t is unlawful for any person on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance.section thus governs mere possession of drugs within the customs waters,while governs possession with intent to manufacture or distribute aboard any vessel subject to united states jurisdiction,including vessels within the customs waters of the united states.unlike with,mere possession of drugs on board a vessel does not implicate app,regardless of where the vessel is located.instead,a defendant only violates app.by possessing drugs on board a vessel with intent to manufacture or distribute.it is perfectly logical to apply the safety valve to the lesser offense of possession on board a vessel,but not to the greater offense of possession on board a vessel with intent to manufacture or distribute.see kakatin,at it is a basic principle of criminal justice that those who commit more serious crimes deserve more serious punishment.therefore,we conclude that the statutory history supports our holding based on the statutory language that the safety valve provision of f is inapplicable to violations of app.
b.the government is estopped from arguing the inapplicability of the safety valve as to appellee,but not as to the other appellees.
regardless of the legal merits,appellees and contend that the government is estopped from arguing the legal unavailability of the safety valve in this case to establish grounds for estoppel against the government,appellees must first demonstrate that the four traditional elements of equitable estoppel are met.those elements are the party to be estopped knows the facts,he or she intends that his or her conduct will be acted on or must so act that the party invoking estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended,the party invoking estoppel must be ignorant of the true facts,and he or she must detrimentally rely on the former conduct.united states hemmen,cir.in addition,a party seeking to estop the government must establish two additional factors the government has engaged in affirmative misconduct going beyond mere negligence and the government act will cause a serious injustice and the imposition of estoppel will not unduly harm the public interest.pauly dep t of,cir quotation marks omitted.
appellees and 
appellees and did not raise the estoppel argument in their briefs and thus they have waived it.see united states nunez,cir.therefore,the government was entitled to argue the unavailability of the safety valve as to these two appellees.
appellee urges estoppel against the government because he waived his right to remain silent by giving a safety valve interview,which waiver the government wrongly induced by telling him that the safety valve was available in this case the government claims that appellee has waived this argument by raising it for the first time on appeal.we do not reach the government waiver argument because even assuming that estoppel argument is properly before us,we find that it fails on the merits because his safety valve interview did not constitute detrimental reliance on the government promise and thus he can not establish the necessary elements for equitable estoppel.see hemmen,at.
in his safety valve interview,appellee repeated the same information he previously gave to the government during his extensive interview,which any governmental assurance that the safety valve would apply in this case.during his interview,stated that unknown men blindfolded him,threatened him,and forced him into a taxi that took him to a small town approximately five hours away.the following day,he was transported to the location of the vessel where he met the other appellees.the unknown men told that he would be the captain of the boat.said that he was given a radio with programmed frequencies and told to take the boat along with the other appellees to costa rica.he said that he did not know what they were transporting,but figured it was cocaine.at the safety valve interview,merely reiterated that he did not know the men who blindfolded him and he stated that he did not know that cocaine was on board the vessel.he gave no additional information to the authorities during the safety valve interview.appellee waived his right to remain silent at the interview without any governmental inducement and thus he suffered no detriment by giving a subsequent safety valve interview in which he merely repeated the substance of his statement.had refused to talk during his safety valve interview,the government would still have possessed the same information it presented at trial,and thus reliance on the government promise regarding the safety valve had no impact on the trial outcome.therefore,we find that as a matter of law appellee did not detrimentally rely on the government assurance that the safety was available to him.accordingly,the government is not estopped from arguing that the safety valve is unavailable to appellee.id.
appellee presents an additional argument to support his claim for estoppel against the government.he argues for estoppel based on his waiver of the right to testify at trial.argues that he would have testified at trial if the government had not assured him that the safety valve was legally available to him.unlike with appellee,appellee reliance went beyond merely restating in his safety valve interview what he had already previously voluntarily told authorities.fully cooperated with the authorities before trial,but he also specifically chose not to testify at trial because he did not want to jeopardize the government previous assurance that his initial statement would qualify him for safety valve relief.we thus conclude that appellee has established the necessary elements of equitable estoppel,including detrimental reliance on the government assurance that the safety valve would apply to him.see hemmen,at.in light of the government past acquiescence to the application of the safety valve in cases as well as decision not to testify at trial based on the government assurance that the safety valve would apply to him,we find that the government abrupt change of position regarding safety valve relief in this case goes beyond mere negligence and would cause a serious injustice in the case of.see pauly,at.imposing estoppel against the government has no impact on original sentence and causes no harm to the public interest.id.therefore,we hold that the government is estopped from arguing that the safety valve is inapplicable to appellee 
c.the district court did not err in reducing appellee sentence for acceptance of responsibility.
section of the sentencing guidelines states,if a defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,the district court will apply a reduction.the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt,cmt.in rare situations,however,a defendant can qualify for this downward adjustment even after going to trial and being convicted.id.the district court found that appellees accepted responsibility even though the jury found them guilty.the government contends that this was error.because the safety valve is unavailable to appellees,and,the statutory minimum sentence applies and on remand the district court can not grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility below the statutory minimum for those appellees.however,with respect to appellee,the government is estopped from arguing that the safety valve is unavailable.therefore,we must consider whether the district court erred when it granted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.
at trial,the government charged appellees with violations of app.according to the district court jury instructions,the essential factual elements of guilt with respect to this offense are that appellees were on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,knowingly possessed cocaine,and possessed it with intent to deliver it to another person.neither side challenges the jury instructions,but the government contends that appellees denied the essential factual elements of the offense by claiming duress at trial,cmt.thus,the government argues that appellees did not accept responsibility for their crimes.however,the affirmative defense of duress does not dispute any of the three essential elements of the crime charged.to prove duress,appellees had the burden of showing the existence of an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury if they did not participate in the crime,a fear that the threat of death or serious bodily injury would be carried out,and no reasonable opportunity to escape the threatened harm.see united states,cir.by relying on the defense of duress,appellees did not deny the essential factual elements of guilt,cmt.appellees could admit the elements of the offense under app.without disqualifying their affirmative defense of duress at trial.therefore,we can not say that the district court erred when it determined that and the other appellees accepted responsibility despite electing to go to trial.this is especially true given that the determination of the sentencing judge on this issue is entitled to great deference on review since t he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant acceptance of responsibility,cmt.
we are aware of our previous decisions that limit as a matter of law the availability of a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility when a defendant unsuccessfully presents a defense of duress at trial.however,we find that those decisions do not preclude a finding that appellee accepted responsibility in this case.in united states johnson,cir,we held that the defense of duress is an affirmative defense which negates criminal conduct by the fact of coercion.because the jury guilty verdict demonstrated that it rejected the defendant statements of duress,we held that the defendants were not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility during the trial.johnson,at.however,in johnson we also determined that if in fact the defendants accepted responsibility by statements made after the conviction they are entitled to this reduction.id.at.
in united states,cir,we noted that in light of a amendment to the sentencing guidelines commentary,johnson holding was no longer good law to the extent that a defendant demonstrated acceptance of responsibility through conduct.we stated that johnson was decided prior to the amendments made to the sentencing guidelines in,in which the precise language we relied upon was deleted from b and that our decision in johnson is directly at odds with the amended commentary to,which now directs that acceptance of responsibility be based primarily on statements and conduct,at citing cmt.thus,the
