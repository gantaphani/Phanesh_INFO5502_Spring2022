ppg industries,ppg appeals from an interlocutory order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin,finding ppg solely liable for the explosion and resultant constructive total loss of the dg harmony and its cargo.see a.we reverse the district court determination that ppg was strictly liable under of the carriage of goods by sea act,note cogsa.we also reverse the district court insofar as it held ppg liable under a general negligence theory.finally,with regard to negligence under cogsa,we affirm the district court ruling that ppg had a duty to warn and that ppg breached that duty,as well as the district court factual finding that ppg dangerous cargo caused the explosion.we vacate the judgment,however,because the district court failed to address whether a warning,if given,would have prevented the harm,and we remand for further proceedings on that issue.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,vacated in part,and remanded.
background 
i.the loss of the dg harmony 
the dg harmony harmony was a container ship registered in the isle of man and owned by navigator shipping navigator,a subsidiary of safmarine and cmbt lines scl.capable of carrying approximately standard containers,the harmony was equipped with three separate holds,each of which was designed to carry dangerous goods.at the time of its destruction the harmony was on charter to,inter alia,di gregorio navegacao,cho yang shipping,and lines gmbh.together,these owners and charterers the interests are the in this action.
the harmony final voyage began in new york in late october.bound for points in south america,the harmony made stops in newport news,savannah,and miami.at these ports,the harmony took on containers immuring cargo owned by various entities which,with one important exception,together comprise the in this action the cargo owners.although most of these cargoes proved innocuous,one did not at newport news,virginia,the harmony received and stowed,through its charterer cho yang shipping,ten containers,each of which contained approximately kilograms of calcium hypochlorite hydrated calhypo.the parties agree that this substance,manufactured and shipped by ppg industries,precipitated the subsequent explosion and fire on the harmony 
on november,ten days after leaving miami,the harmony reached a point off the northern coast of brazil.at approximately,an explosion ripped through the third hold.the captain and crew of the harmony,realizing that the third hold had caught fire,mobilized to fight the blaze.for nearly twelve hours,the full crew battled the flames,but their efforts were to no avail.most of the crew abandoned ship at that evening,and they were followed by the captain and the remainder of the crew at the next day.although there were no casualties,the harmony burned for three weeks.the fire resulted in a constructive total loss of both the vessel and its cargo.
ii.the properties of ppg calhypo 
a.the properties of calhypo 
in divining the cause of the fire,the parties focused on ppg calhypo,an industrial bactericide sometimes identified as un,its designation under the international maritime dangerous goods code imdg code.calhypo is an unstable substance that continually decomposes at room temperature.it is an oxidizer,which means that it releases oxygen in most reactions.
most importantly,however,calhypo is prone to thermal runaway,a phenomenon in which the heat naturally produced by the calhypo serves to heat the calhypo further,thus causing it,in turn,to generate even more heat.thermal runaway operates like a feedback loop.as one expert witness explained,t he higher the temperature,the faster the reaction,and the reaction becomes circular inasmuch as it generates the heat,and the heat causes the reaction to go faster.this snowballing reaction runs away,goes critical,and it get s to the point where it just goes so fast that the material explodes,it deflagrates,decomposes and reaches the point where we have a fire ensuing.a number of extrinsic factors can exacerbate this phenomenon.for example,if calhypo is tightly enclosed in a container from which heat can not easily escape,it might more easily succumb to thermal runaway.likewise,calhypo might more readily exhibit thermal runaway if exposed to an external or radiant source of heat.
the most important factor in predicting the decomposition and eventual combustion of calhypo is its critical ambient temperature or cat.as ppg correctly notes,cat is the minimum temperature at which a product will begin to retain more heat than it dissipates.the cat of a given amount of calhypo depends inversely upon the size of the sample as the mass increases,the critical temperature decreases.standard commercial tobacco recife.for example,in recife,the district court found that the cat of a single pellet of calhypo is approximately degrees id.in the instant case,which involves a much larger amount of calhypo,the district court found the cat to be considerably lower.the exact cat is elusive.one expert in this case testified that he did not find any data from which he could ascertain the cat of the specific material carried on the harmony.in re dg harmony,d.nevertheless,the district court believed it could make a rough estimate of the cat of the calhypo onboard the harmony,judging it to be below.id.at.
ppg packaging method 
ppg manufactures its calhypo at a plant in natrium,west virginia.to package the calhypo stowed on the harmony,ppg used thick cardboard drums that weighed kilograms about pounds each when full.ppg loaded the drums on wooden pallets,four drums to a pallet,and immediately shrinkwrapped each bundle.thirty pallets were then packed into each container,stacked up in three layers of ten pallets each.each layer of pallets was divided into two rows of five pallets.for its shipment on the harmony,ppg prepared ten containers in this manner.the district court found that this packaging method was likely to have lowered the cat of the calhypo stacking the drums made it harder for the heat to dissipate while the container walls inhibit ed the ventilation of the drums.id.at.the calhypo was approximately when it was packaged,hours after manufacturing,under circumstances that did not permit it to cool down.id.at.after packaging the calhypo,ppg trucked the containers to baltimore,where agents for cho yang shipping arranged transport to norfolk,virginia.in norfolk,the charterers stevedores facilitated stowage of the calhypo onboard the harmony in neighboring newport news,virginia.
c.the location of calhypo in the hold of the harmony 
the stevedores stowed the containers contiguously on the far port side of harmony third hold.three of the occupying slots,and adjacent to a heated port side bunker fuel tank,and they were separated from the tank wall by twelve inches of empty space.id.at.two of these three occupying slots and directly atop the bunker tank,separated from the tank wall by less than twelve inches of empty space.in other words,two containers were exposed directly to the radiant heat of the bunker tank on two sides,and one container was exposed to radiant heat on one side.the remaining containers lay amidships,contiguously with these three containers.one of these remaining containers,occupying slot,sat three in from the port side bunker tank and two up from the bottom.id.at.as the district court concluded from an exhaustive review of the physical evidence,this container was the source of the explosion and resulting fire.id.at.both the captain and chief mate of the harmony approved this stowage arrangement.
iii.warnings about calhypo 
a.the imdg code 
the international maritime organization the imo maintains a schedule of dangerous materials known as the imdg code.the united states has ratified the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas,which incorporates through amendment the imdg code.recife.at.thus,although the imdg code is not controlling in this tort action,it serves as an important reference for carriers seeking to transport cargo safely and efficiently while complying with international regulations.see harmony,d at.
the code regulates the transport of dangerous goods by sea in order reasonably to prevent injury to persons,or damage to the ship or the marine environment.imdg code.at the same time,however,any regulation should be so framed as not to impede unnecessarily the movement of such goods.id.the code further contains a number of general guidelines that apply to all cargo.for example,the code states that i n view of the high protective advantages,stowage under deck has been recommended wherever possible,except that,for certain explosives whose principal hazard is the production of smoke or toxic fumes,stowage on deck has been recommended.id.at.where it is necessary to prevent pressure,decomposition or polymerization of a substance,the packages should be stowed shaded from radiant heat,which includes protection from strong sunlight.id.at.when stored below deck,substances vulnerable to radiant heat should be stowed away from sources of heat,including sparks,flame,steam pipes,heating coils,id.at.
under the code,calhypo is a class oxidizing substance.in general,all oxidizing substances,although in themselves not necessarily combustible,may,either by yielding oxygen or by similar processes,increase the risk and intensity of fire in other materials with which they come into contact.id.at.in addition to its general rules on substances vulnerable to radiant heat,the code requires that carriers store calhypo in particular a way from sources of heat where temperatures in excess of for a period of hours or more will be encountered.the code further requires that calhypo be s eparated from powdered metals,ammonium compounds,cyanides and hydrogen peroxide.
the imdg code also imposes requirements that apply by implication to the stowage of calhypo.section requires that material with a decomposition temperature or sadt of over be stored at a control temperature of below the sadt.the sadt should be determined in accordance with the latest version of the united nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods,manual of tests and criteria.id.at.the district court did not venture a finding as to the sadt according to this united nations document.
the department of transportation dot regulations largely repeat the general aspects of the imdg code,but they add that for transportation by vessel,shipments are authorized in accordance with the control temperature requirements in chapter of the imdg code.f ii 
recent industry warnings 
in september,before the harmony commenced its voyage from new york,its captain received a box of correspondence,videos,and other materials from leonhardt blumberg,the harmony vessel management company.harmony,d at.the box included a circular from the swedish club,a mutual insurance company.that circular,entitled member alert july calcium hypochlorite hydrated un,stated 
in the course of investigating a serious fire onboard a container vessel,the fire experts appointed by us have undertaken a research of how calhypo reacts to heat exposure.the preliminary results have such serious implications regarding the transportation of this material that we have decided to immediately advise the shipping community of the findings.
the current imo recommendation is that material is not to be exposed to a heat source in excess of for longer than a period.preliminary results of the research indicate,however,that for the type and size of packaging used routinely to ship this material around the world,the temperatures at which the runaway reaction is likely to begin may be much lower than that recommended by the imo 
it is our understanding that the ambient temperature of holds of certain container ships can reach the critical ignition temperature of this material,which preliminary results of our research suggests is considerably lower than that previously published.
accordingly,it is suggested that this material is not shipped in the holds of such ships and if stowage on deck is arranged,heating of this material by direct sunlight must be avoided.
although the captain received this warning prior to setting off from new york,he did not read it.
this swedish club circular reflected warnings that had already begun to circulate in the shipping community.for example,one week prior to the swedish club circular,the same consulting group that was hired by the swedish club shared its preliminary findings with respect to calhypo.these warnings were prompted by the destruction of the contship france,a containership carrying cargo that included calhypo manufactured by ppg.see contship containerlines,ppg,cir,cert.denied,d.
specific notice of dangerous goods issued by ppg 
ppg furnished assorted documentation with its containers of calhypo.a dangerous goods summary accurately identified the contents of the containers as calhypo and provided the relevant imdg classification information.dock receipts also identified the material as calhypo and declared that the packing of the has been carried out in accordance with the general introduction of the imdg code,paragraph.an accompanying material safety data sheet cautioned that the calhypo should be stored in a cool,dry,place away from heat,sparks,flames,direct sunlight,and other sources of heat,including lighted tobacco products.this sheet further warned that the calhypo was u nstable above c and would d ecompose at the remainder of the document focused on first aid,firefighting,and ecological and other general concerns.
iv.the decision of the district court 
after the loss of the harmony,various parties filed lawsuits in the southern district of new york.harmony,d at.most of the parties settled their claims,and eventually only the disputes between ppg and the and cargo interests remained.the and cargo interests alleged that ppg was liable for the loss of the harmony under theories of general negligence,negligent failure to warn,and strict liability.ppg contested these allegations,arguing that the interests bore some responsibility for stowing the calhypo adjacent to a heated bunker tank.after a bench trial,the district court found ppg solely liable for the loss of the harmony under theories of negligent failure to warn and strict liability.id.at.it is unclear whether the district court rendered judgment on a theory of general negligence.in a subsequent clarification of its opinion,the district court also absolved the interests of fault,finding that stowage decisions played no causal role in the explosion and fire that destroyed the harmony.
ppg initiated this appeal.
discussion 
general negligence 
the parties disagree on whether there is an issue of general negligence in this case that was determined by the district court.in its decision,the district court stated that the interests and the cargo owners separately advanced failure to warn and negligence claims.id.at.yet when finding ppg liable,the district court applied what appears to be a single legal test.the court found both that the calhypo was unreasonably dangerous when it left ppg control and that ppg failed to give adequate warnings on the handling and transportation of the product.id.at.as a result,the and cargo interests argue that the district court found ppg liable on both general negligence and for negligent failure to warn,while ppg argues that the district court rested its decision solely on failure to warn.more specifically,the interests argue that ppg was negligent in its packaging of the calhypo,in its certification that the calhypo was safe for transport,in failing to request refrigerated or stowage,and for other oversights in its actions surrounding the calhypo.
at trial,however,the arguments made by the parties indicated that they understood the general negligence claim to be a variation of negligence per se based on ppg alleged violation of f.section f prohibits transport of material which is likely to decompose with a decomposition temperature sadt of or less with an evolution of a dangerous quantity of heat or gas when decomposing unless the material is stabilized or inhibited in a manner to preclude such evolution.for example,when clarifying the different legal theories of the case,an attorney for the cargo interests stated that failure to warn was the principal negligence theory but that the case also raised the issue of v iolation of dot regulations when they shipped the goods.furthermore,in ppg closing arguments it stated that the claim against ppg is grounded in cfr,the assertion that this was a forbidden material and that therefore ppg should not have shipped it unless it did so in refrigerated containers.
the district court opinion,however,does not mention negligence per se,nor does it devote much attention to ppg compliance with f.though the opinion contains broad language suggesting that ppg breached its general duty of due care,see harmony,d at a reasonable manufacturer would have done more than ppg did here,its primary focus was on ppg duty to warn.in its clearest recital of the elements of the claim,the court found that ppg had a duty to provide a warning that would fully inform vessels and others in the distribution chain of all the risks involved in shipping in the manner in which it was shipped here.ppg breached that duty.id.at.we therefore agree with ppg that the district court did not find ppg liable on a general negligence theory.to the extent that the district court opinion can be understood to make such a finding,we reverse because the district court provided no basis for a finding of general negligence other than the incorrect one of unreasonable dangerousness a strict liability doctrine.
ii.strict liability 
relying principally on our recent decision in contship,ppg argues that the interests can not prevail on strict liability in this case.we agree.the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa note,articulates the duty applicable to shippers and carriers of i nflammable,explosive,or dangerous cargo,id.note.by its terms,the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment.id.
our circuit has rendered two decisions on this rule that are particularly relevant here.in senator linie gmbh.kg sunway line,cir,we sought to determine liability in a case where neither the shipper nor the carrier knew of the dangerous properties of thiourea dioxide,a compound that spontaneously combusted when the vessel was en route from korea to the united states.in resolving the subsequent dispute over which party was responsible for the loss,we held that cogsa established a standard of strict liability for shippers of dangerous goods,at least when neither the shipper nor the carrier had actual or constructive preshipment knowledge of the goods dangerous nature.senator linie,at see also id.acknowledging that this case involves the rare circumstance in which neither party had actual or constructive preshipment knowledge that the goods were dangerous.
in contship,we considered the duties of shipper and carrier where both knew of the risks presented by a cargo.the contship france caught fire after drums of calhypo,each weighing pounds,combusted in the hold.id.at.the calhypo was stowed directly above the bottom center fuel tank,the contents of which were,at some point during the voyage,heated to abnormally high temperatures.id.at.confronted with these facts,we held that a carrier can not invoke strict liability if it knows that a cargo poses a danger and requires gingerly handling or stowage,and nevertheless exposes the cargo to the general condition that triggers the known danger,regardless of whether the carrier is aware of the precise characteristics of the cargo.id.at accord apl.pte,uk aerosols,no.c mhp,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.for the purposes of the strict liability inquiry,the question of knowledge was a threshold,binary inquiry a party either will know that such a reaction is possible or it will not the calibrated likelihood of an exothermic reaction under a variety of heat circumstances is not considered.contship,at.a carrier that exposes a cargo to heat with knowledge of its flammability may or may not ultimately prevail but it can not prevail on strict liability.id.thus,if either party knows that such a reaction is possible,liability is determined by reference to negligence principles rather than strict liability.id.
in this case,the interests may not have known the precise characteristics of the cargo,but they knew that calhypo was an unstable substance that became vulnerable to combustion when heated.despite this knowledge,the interests exposed the calhypo to the general induces such combustion.as a result,although they may prevail on a negligence theory,the interests can not prevail on strict liability.id.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court insofar as it found ppg strictly liable for the destruction wrought by its shipment of calhypo.
having found that the interests can not prevail against ppg in strict liability,we must also consider the effect that finding has on the cargo interests ability to bring a strict liability claim against ppg under cogsa.this court has not yet determined whether third parties may bring claims under cogsa.we assume for the moment that they may 
as noted above,in contship,this court held that a carrier could bring a strict liability claim against a shipper under cogsa only if the carrier had no notice of the cargo dangerousness.there,the carrier could not recover because it had notice of the general dangerousness of the calhypo,and it thus had knowledge of the material nature and character.see contship,at in this case,such a nature and character inquiry defeats contship strict liability claim.we reached that holding by reference to the text of,which states that a shipper is strictly liable for damages caused by its dangerous goods only when the carrier has not consented with knowledge of their nature and character.note.a carrier has knowledge,we held,when it has notice of any aspect of the cargo dangerousness.such knowledge defeats the carrier ability to recover against the shipper in strict liability.
the cargo interests argue that this requirement,recognized in contship,does not apply to their strict liability claims.there is nothing in the statute nor in our holding in contship,however,that limits the application of this requirement to claims brought by carriers.based,as it is,on the text of the statute,the requirement applies to any strict liability claim brought under,whether those claims are brought by carriers or by cargo owners.in other words,the language of,which makes shippers strictly liable for damages caused by dangerous goods only when the carrier has not consented with knowledge of their dangerousness,requires that any plaintiff seeking to recover against a shipper in strict liability must first show,as an element of the claim,that the carrier did not have such notice.contship further instructs that the required showing can not be made if the carrier had any notice of the goods dangerousness,even if that notice was incomplete or reflected an underestimation of the danger.
thus,to prevail on the strict liability claim against ppg that we assume though do not hold the cargo interests may bring under cogsa,the cargo interests must show that the carrier did not have notice that calhypo was dangerous.as we concluded above,however,the interests the carrier for the purposes of cogsa had knowledge of the nature and character of ppg calhypo,because they had notice of its instability and heat sensitivity.that knowledge on the part of the carrier prevents the cargo interests from satisfying the without knowledge element of the strict liability claim they seek to bring against ppg under cogsa,and their inability to prove that element is fatal to the entire claim.
iii.negligent failure to warn 
cogsa provides that t he shipper shall not be responsible from any cause without the act,fault,or neglect of the shipper,his agents,or his servants.note.a shipper negligent failure to warn the carrier about dangers inherent in a cargo constitutes such fault or neglect and gives rise to a cause of action for negligent failure to warn.contship,at a shipper failure to adequately inform a carrier of the foreseeable dangers posed by cargo can constitute a negligent failure to warn under cogsa.to prevail on a claim of negligent failure to warn,the plaintiff must demonstrate that ppg failed to warn the carrier about dange
