newport news shipbuilding and dry dock company newport news seeks reversal of a decision of the benefits review board the brb denying relief under section f of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,lhwca.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the decision of the brb.
in january,randall pounders pounders was diagnosed with asbestosis.a pulmonary function test revealed a fifteen percent permanent partial whole person impairment as measured by the ama guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment,ed.his employer,newport news,admits that he was exposed to asbestos during his employment,but contends that he had a lung disease which materially and substantially contributed to his ultimate disability.
as early as,pulmonary function tests performed on pounders revealed restrictive lung disease.this condition continued to appear on such tests conducted from through.in,pounders was diagnosed with diabetes,hypertension and pleural fibrosis.pounders retired on december,more than one year before he was diagnosed with asbestosis.
on july,the administrative law judge alj filed his original decision and order denying the f claim of newport news.almost one year later,on july,the brb reversed and remanded the case for further consideration in view of the standard established in director,owcp newport news shipbuilding and dry dock carmines,cir.on reconsideration,however,the brb reversed itself and affirmed the original decision of the alj.
section f of the lhwca,f,provides in part as follows 
in cases in which the employee has a permanent partial disability,found not to be due solely to that injury,and such disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone,the employer shall provide compensation for one hundred and four weeks only.
after the one hundred period has passed,the office of workers compensation programs owcp,which administers a special fund for that purpose,is responsible for disability payments under f.
an employer who seeks to limit liability for an employee permanent partial disability under f must establish three elements that the ultimate disability is caused in part by a partial disability that the disability was manifest to the employer prior to the injury and that the ultimate disability materially and substantially exceeded the disability that would have resulted from the injury alone,in the absence of the condition.see director,owcp news shipbuilding and dry dock carmines,cir.see also director,owcp newport news shipbuilding and dry dock harcum,cir,aff on other grounds,d.
the lhwca sets out the applicable standard of review for this case in b.when under review by the brb,the alj factual findings are deemed conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.b.this court has held that substantial evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.elliott adm r,animal plant health inspection,cir.additionally,as stated in newport news shipbuilding dry dock tann,cir,the alj findings may not be disregarded on the basis that other inferences might have been more reasonable.rather,deference must be given the inferences and credibility assessments,and we have emphasized the scope of review of alj findings is limited.id.legal determinations are reviewed de novo.this includes the standard by which the alj determines entitlement to f relief.see carmines,at.
there is no disagreement in this case that the first two conditions necessary for relief under f are met.the parties agree that pounders had a disability.the second element,manifestation,is not required in cases where the worker suffers from a occupational disease,as is the case with pounders.the sole issue involves the weight of the evidence with regard to the third requirement,commonly referred to as the contribution element.
to satisfy the contribution element in this case,newport news relied upon the parties stipulation that pounders has a fifteen percent permanent partial disability,which is attributed to both his disability and his asbestosis,and the opinion of james reid,a company doctor,who stated that if pounders had only the asbestosis,his impairment rating would be at least fifteen percent less reid explained his conclusion and the basis for it as follows 
pounders ama rating and disability are not caused by his alleged asbestosis alone,but rather his ama rating and disability are materially and substantially contributed to,and materially and substantially hastened by his pleural lung disease and hypertensive cardiovascular.since the,hypertension has been known to reduce pulmonary function.this is hardly surprising since the blood in the vascular system enters the lungs,and oxygen is transferred to the blood from the lungs.a january,article in chest,a leading medical journal,based on a grant from the national heart,lung and blood institute of nih,documents the effect of hypertension on pulmonary function.hypertension,which pounders had,causes a three percent drop in the fevi and a three percent drop in the fvc.on average,each one percent drop in fevi or fvc results in a one percent increase in the ama rating.of course,the more longstanding or severe the cardiovascular condition,the greater the drop in and hence the greater the increase in the ama rating.pounders shipyard pulmonary function tests as early as showed a ama rating disability.thus,if pounders merely had asbestosis,without his disabilities,his ama rating would be at least less.
the brb concluded that the evidence of contribution fell short of the standard for f relief established by this court in carmines.carmines was exposed to asbestos at the newport news facility over a period.see carmines,at.he was diagnosed with pulmonary asbestosis in and deemed to have a percent to thirty percent impairment of the whole person.see id.he also had substantial scarring of the lungs due to pleurisy.see id.at.hall,a company physician for newport news,opined on the basis of old that carmines disability accounted for about eighteen percentage points of the total disability,which was percent.see id.at.he concluded that carmines asbestosis accounted for the percent.see id.
this court determined in carmines that hall evidence was insufficient to meet the contribution requirement and show the claimant total disability to be materially and substantially greater than the disability resulting from the condition alone.see carmines,at,cir.the court pointed out that carmines asbestosis standing alone could account for all of his disability.see id.at.in the absence of expert evaluation of the degree of disability covered by the asbestosis separate and apart from the impact of the condition,the court said,there was no basis for a comparison which would reveal whether the prior injury materially and substantially contributed to the total impairment.see id.at.to satisfy the third requirement under f,the court held that,an employer must quantify the type and extent of the disability that the claimant would have suffered without the condition.id.at.it is not enough,as hall did in carmines,to simply calculate the total current disability and subtract from it the disability resulting from the condition.
in weighing any application for f relief the court is faced with competing policy goals.the purpose of f is to encourage reemployment of handicapped workers.see lawson suwanee fruit.if employers were charged with the entire cost of second injuries under the lhwca,there would be a powerful disincentive to hire the handicapped.on the other hand,employers should be held responsible for the full cost of injuries and illnesses which occur on their watch and should not be permitted lightly to transfer such burdens to the special fund.
the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the adversarial system breaks down to a degree with regard to f claims.the evidentiary hearing in such cases may involve only the employer and the claimant.the claimant seeks to be compensated for his condition.he probably does not care whether he is paid out of the general fund,with its higher cost to his employer,or out of the special f fund.the employer,on
