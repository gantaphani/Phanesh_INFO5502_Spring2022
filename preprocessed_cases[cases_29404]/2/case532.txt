fishman tobin fishman and macclenny products macclenny,two manufacturers that ship clothing from the caribbean to the united states,appeal the amount of judgment awarded to them when a carrier lost their cargo at sea.in resolving their dispute,this court for the fourth time enters the murky waters of the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,et.more specifically,we endeavor to provide clarity to the reoccurring issue of what constitutes a package under section of cogsa,since the term is not defined in the statute.after thorough review of the record and the proceedings below,we now affirm the district court ruling on the matter.
background 
fishman and macclenny are two out of a number of american clothing manufacturers who have their clothing assembled in santiago,dominican republic and shipped to the united states under the caribbean basin initiative program.
fishman imports children clothing.the company ships its product in a unit referred to in the industry as a big pack.a big pack,which is akin to a pallet,has x dimensions,is slotted at the bottom so that it can be picked up by a forklift,and is partially enclosed in corrugated cardboard with a base and cover made of plastic.inside these containers are bundles of boys pants and the like which are wrapped in paper and sorted by style.
macclenny is an importer of men suits and jackets.for the past ten years,macclenny sent all of its shipments with the same carrier,tropical shipping tropical,until the incident culminating in this suit.on a weekly basis,macclenny routed four ocean containers of cloth,buttons,zippers,labels,hangers,and plastic bags to santiago to be assembled.every week,between seven and twelve containers of assembled men jackets were returned to florida.the assembled suit jackets were shipped in containers to which structural beams are attached to place these packages.nylon ropes were hung from these beams and knotted at certain intervals so that the hangers held during shipping.each container could hold between and hangers.tropical regularly sent its employees to macclenny local partner,fashions,to have these containers cleaned,lining installed,and ropes checked so that the newly pressed suits enclosed in plastic bags did not become wrinkled or soiled during transport.
both shippers regularly dealt with tropical shipping to transport their clothing.a truck owned by tropical would pick up the clothing at the shippers respective warehouses along with a cargo manifest and drive it to port.once the cargo arrived at the port,it would be transferred to the ship containers and a bill of lading would be prepared and sent back to the warehouses in accordance with industry custom.typically,the bills of lading arrived after the ships set sail.
during one such routine voyage,tropical shipping had a number of containers fall overboard due to improper storage on the vessel.tropical admits its liability and asserts that section of cogsa limits its liability to per package lost.the parties disagree,however,on the application of the cogsa definition of package to the units that were shipped 
the parties brought their disagreement before the district court on competing motions for summary judgment.after reviewing the facts before it,the district court decided in favor of tropical,concluding that the fishman package was a big pack and fair recovery was the amount of or big pack packages at per package.macclenny would receive only in compensation for the loss of only one container.both fishman and macclenny now appeal that ruling.
discussion 
the main point of contention between the two sides is how to apply the cogsa definition of package to the units shipped.we previously adopted the second circuit definition of package.see,oriental knight,cir.a package is a class of cargo,irrespective of size,shape or weight,to which some packaging preparation for transportation has been made which facilitates handling,but which does not necessarily conceal or completely enclose the goods.aluminios pozuelo,navigator,cir.there are four basic principles identified in for applying cogsa section to containerized shipments the contractual agreement between the parties as set forth in the bill of lading the term package means the result of some preparation for transportation which facilitates handling but which does not necessarily conceal or completely enclose the goods a container can not be a cogsa package absent a clear agreement between the parties to that effect,and at least so long as its contents and the number of packages or units are disclosed and absent an agreement in the bill of lading as to packaging of the cargo,goods placed in containers and described as not separately packaged will be classified as goods not shipped in packages,at citation omitted quotations omitted we now attempt to apply this less than transparent definition to each of the cases at hand.

a.the fishman dozen 
fishman suggests that the smaller bundles of its pants,referred to as dozens,should be considered packages rather than the big packs used to store those dozens before they go into the containers see mitsui,american export lines,cir cartons,crates and other units that were treated as cogsa packages when they were shipped breakbulk should ordinarily continue to be so treated when they are shipped in containers matsushita aegis spirit,if the individual crates or cartons prepared by the shipper and containing his goods can rightly be considered packages standing by themselves,they do not suddenly loose that character upon being stowed in a carrier container.
any grouping demonstrating some preparation may be considered a package.yet,it is clear that the number of packages should be fully and accurately disclosed and easily discernable by the carrier,otherwise carriers will suffer unforeseen liability.see,at binladen bsb landscaping nedlloyd rotterdam,cir.as a result,the touchstone of our analysis is the contractual agreement between the parties as set forth in the bill of lading.see,at when a bill of lading discloses the number of cogsa packages in a container,the liability limitation of section applies to those packages.the bill of lading made out by tropical states the following 
the customs declaration form made out by fishman includes all the same information but also indicates the value of the items being shipped.neither form refers to the number of dozens of pants being shipped.
fishman contends that the cargo manifest and reembarque are the relevant documents to be examined as they were prepared by fishman and were simply miscopied from fishman form to the bill of lading.see in re belize trading,sun ins.of new york,cir holding that when the bill of lading and the shipping documents do not conform,the bill is construed as having reflected the number of packages designated in the shipping invoices and as such be in conformity with cogsa.in this case,the reembarque states,although not clearly,that dozens of pants are inside the relevant big packs.
as both tropical interpretation of the bill of lading and the reembarque agree as to the type and number of packages shipped,there is no need to look further.recovery will be based on the big packs indicated.
even without such clarification,fishman would be hard pressed to support their claim that dozens are the relevant unit of measurement.by its own admission,fishman acknowledges that dozens as a unit of measurement and packaging in this case could refer to any number of pants from one to twelve.the designation really referred to the total number of pants in the container rather than some common form of packaging that facilitates transportation.as a result,not only is a fishman dozen an inaccurate unit of measurement,it is one not clearly denoted on the cargo manifest,customs declaration,or bill of lading.as such,the fishman dozen can not be used as the measure of packaging referred to by cogsa.accordingly,we find nothing wrong with the district court conclusion that the big packs as opposed to the dozens were the appropriate unit of measurement.
based on this analysis,fishman received a fair settlement from the district court.the cargo manifest and the bill of
