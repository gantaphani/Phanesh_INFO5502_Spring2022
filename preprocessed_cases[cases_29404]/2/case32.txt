background 
on april,at approximately,the united states coast guard uscg cutter dependable found the el conquistador the vessel riding low and dead in the water in international waters nautical miles south of santo domingo,dominican republic.a rigid hulled inflatable boat,the able,was launched from the dependable to approach the vessel.
the able observed that the vessel name was written on its stern,but the vessel did not have a visible registration number,port identification,or country flag.on board the able,officer brian hennessey hennessey,a technician and federal law enforcement officer with the uscg,requested that the vessel indicate its nationality.the vessel master answered that the vessel was registered in colombia.he further claimed that the vessel had been fishing for approximately seven to eight days,but that the vessel engines were broken,and that they had no fish on board and were en route to haiti hennessey testified that he perceived a strong smell of marijuana coming from the vessel.hennessey relayed via radio the information from the vessel master to the dependable and waited for permission to board the vessel.
at,sean connett connett,an employee with the uscg at the district command center in miami,contacted the colombian authorities to confirm the registry of the vessel via a written form entitled action request.the colombian authorities shortly responded with a response to the action form,indicating that they could neither confirm nor refute that the el conquistador was a colombian vessel.the colombian authorities also suggested that the uscg proceed under international law and requested that the uscg inform them of the results of the inspection.
acting on the premise that the vessel was stateless or without nationality,the uscg sought to place the vessel within jurisdiction.the maritime drug law enforcement act mdlea allows the united states to conduct drug law enforcement outside of the united states,and more specifically,exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels.app.c.in accordance with the mdlea,connett requested and received a statement of no objection from the uscg headquarters in washington,granting permission to board el conquistador.connett forwarded the statement to the uscg office in san juan,which then forwarded it to the dependable.
upon boarding the vessel,hennessey observed what appeared to be bales of marijuana,two of which were outside the fish hold,of which were inside the fish hold he then conducted a field test confirming that the bales were,in fact,marijuana.in order to access the bales,uscg officers broke the fish hold,and transferred the bales onto the dependable the vessel five crew four appellants and the captain,joaquín emilio were also brought on board the dependable.the colombian authorities were notified of the uscg findings,and upon arrival in san juan,the appellants were transferred to immigration and customs enforcement ice and detained.
at their joint trial,appellants testified that they were fisherman in their home country of colombia and that in they were recruited in colombia to participate in a fishing expedition by two individuals known to them as paco and roberto.appellants testified that they were unacquainted with each other when they arrived at the vessel.they further testified that when they arrived,paco and roberto,along with others,were armed with weapons,and marijuana was on the vessel.according to appellants,paco threatened that appellants families would be killed if they did not take the marijuana to haiti.appellants testified that they feared for their families.after a few days at sea,the vessel broke down.
on september,a jury found all four appellants guilty of both counts of the indictment.a report psr was then filed on november,recommending that appellants be granted a reduction in their base offense level of due to their minor roles in the offense.martínez and bravo were sentenced individually,and isaa and mancilla were sentenced jointly.at appellants various sentencing hearings,the government opposed the minor role reduction.the court denied the minor role adjustments,indicating that the evidence was such that it could not state who was a major and who was a minor participant in the case.
at his sentencing hearing,appellant martínez raised no objections to the psr,and accordingly,was not granted any adjustments,and was sentenced to months imprisonment.in the other sentencing hearings,appellants bravo,isaa and mancilla objected to the psr and requested a benefit,as well as a downward departure for duress.appellants participated in a government debriefing in order to qualify for the benefit,but they each received a sealed motion from the government stating that the would not be recommended because the government did not believe that appellants had provided all available information in a truthful manner 
isaa and mancilla joint hearing was held on december.the court granted them an immediate hearing to determine their entitlement to the benefit.a dea special agent testified that,although appellants stories coincided in certain aspects,it was abnormal that appellants did not know the details of how the drug transfer was going to take place.he explained that the scenario was too risky to be believable he had never investigated a case in which a drug trafficker had placed unknown individuals against their wills on a vessel loaded with contraband of such value without providing information about the transfer,or without agreeing to any payment.the agent also noticed that,based on his experience and training,appellants appeared to easily answer questions about their families and colombia,but that a level of stress or deception was perceptible in appellants answers to questions regarding the smuggling venture,the drugs,and payments.
the court denied isaa and mancilla the benefit,indicating that the consistency of appellants statements did not overcome the gaps in the logic of their story.the court also denied their requests for a downward departure for duress.again,the court indicated that it did not find appellants stories to be totally truthful.both appellants were then sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum term of months of imprisonment.
bravo was sentenced a week later,on december.the district court denied bravo request for a hearing,and subsequently denied him the benefit.neither denial was explained by the court.the court also denied bravo request for a downward departure for duress,and sentenced him to the statutory mandatory minimum term of months of imprisonment.
appellants now appeal a variety of issues regarding their convictions and sentences.
ii.issues on appeal 
a.the united states jurisdiction over the vessel 
appellants are neither citizens nor resident aliens of the united states and the vessel involved was not a vessel of the united states.thus,for appellants to be prosecuted under the mdlea,the vessel must be subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.app.a.whether the district court erred in determining that it had jurisdiction over the vessel,and therefore over appellants,is a question of law subject to de novo review.see id.f all jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law see also united states gonzález,cir the term jurisdiction evidently refers to the substantive reach of the to some vessels but not not to subject matter jurisdiction of the court.
under the mdlea,a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states includes a vessel without nationality.app.c a.additionally,a vessel without nationality includes a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.id.c c.here,the vessel master claimed registry in colombia,and after contacting the appropriate colombian authorities,the uscg received a response to the action form from colombia neither confirming nor refuting the vessel registration in colombia.since colombia,as the nation of alleged registry,could not confirm the vessel registration,the vessel qualifies as a vessel without nationality under the mdlea,and is within the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the united states.
under the plain language of the mdlea,appellants argument that jurisdiction includes a nexus,a requirement that the government show that the marijuana transported in the vessel would affect the united states,fails.the appellants reliance on united states hayes,cir finding a jurisdictional nexus requirement for the application of the comprehensive drug abuse and control act of,to a vessel apprehended in international waters and united states cafiero,d finding a jurisdictional nexus requirement for the application of the comprehensive drug abuse and control act of,to an italian citizen aboard a flight that made an unplanned diversion into united states territory,is misplaced.those cases find a jurisdictional nexus requirement in the comprehensive drug abuse and control act of.we do not read the mdlea to require a jurisdictional nexus.see,united states cardales,cir d ue process does not require the government to prove a nexus between a defendant criminal conduct and the united states in a prosecution under the mdlea united states rendon,cir t his circuit ha s not embellished the mdlea with a nexus requirement.united states,cir holding that congress did not act under its commerce clause authority in enacting the mdlea and,thus,no nexus between the activities proscribed by the mdlea and interstate or foreign commerce is required united states suerte,cir t o the extent the due process clause may constrain the mdlea extraterritorial reach,that clause does not impose a nexus requirement.united states,cir finding no nexus requirement in the mdlea to search stateless vessel in international waters.
equally misplaced is appellants contention that the united states disregarded the recommendation of the colombian authorities to follow international law when apprehending the vessel.the uscg acted within both international treaty law and customary international law.the agreement to suppress illicit traffic by sea,ratified and brought into force by the united states and colombia in,is the treaty governing the apprehension of the vessel and its crew.see agreement between the government of the united states of america and the government of the republic of colombia to suppress illicit traffic by sea.the treaty authorizes the country requesting verification of a registry to proceed in accordance with international law in the event that neither party can confirm or refute a flag claim of a vessel in international waters,id,and the mdlea is in compliance with international law.the jurisdiction authorized in the mdlea is consistent with the protective principle of international law,see cardales,at explaining that the protective principle permits a nation to assert jurisdiction over a person whose conduct outside the nation territory threatens the nation security quoting united states robinson,cir,and is supported by numerous international treaties and agreements,including the single convention on narcotic drugs,and its protocol,amendment of the single convention on narcotic drugs,the convention on narcotic drugs psychotropic substances,the united nations convention on the law of the sea,treaty doc,and the united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,
our conclusion is without doubt or reservation the united states had jurisdiction over the vessel,and was correct to apply the mdlea to appellants.
lack of determination of jurisdiction 
the appellants assert that the district court erroneously allowed the jury to hear testimony regarding jurisdiction.we agree.all jurisdictional issues arising under the mdlea are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.app.f.the exposure of the jury to the jurisdictional testimony nonetheless was harmless.evidentiary error is harmless so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.united states flemmi,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,that standard is met because the jury was presented with ample evidence that the appellants possessed marijuana,and that they did so with the intent to distribute it.moreover,the jury was instructed on the issues that it had to determine,and instructed that jurisdiction over the vessel was not an issue in the case,making it even more unlikely that the error affected the jury verdict.see id.finding that a evidentiary error was harmless because the jury was presented with ample evidence of the defendant guilt,and the judge correctly instructed the jury.
motion to suppress 
appellants challenge the denial of their motion to suppress the bales of marijuana seized from the vessel on the grounds that the uscg lacked reasonable suspicion to stop and search the vessel,in violation of the fourth amendment.we apply a mixed standard of review to the district court denial of the suppression motion,reviewing the court findings of fact for clear error and the application of the law to those facts de novo.tinoco,at.
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures whether or not the evidence is sought to be used in a criminal trial,and a violation of the amendment is fully accomplished at the time of an unreasonable government intrusion.united states calandra,d see also united states leon,d.for purposes of this case,therefore,if there was a constitutional violation of the fourth amendment,it occurred solely in international waters,where the search and seizure took place.but the fourth amendment does not apply to activities of the united states against aliens in international waters.see united states,d.the supreme court holding in is clear that the actions of the united states directed against aliens in foreign territory or in international waters are not constrained by the fourth amendment.at.there is no indication that the fourth amendment was understood by contemporaries of the framers to apply to activities of the united states directed against aliens in foreign territory or in international waters.see also united states,d,in light of the supreme court holding in,it is pellucid that the fourth amendment does not apply to the search of aliens on a ship in international waters.accordingly,the district court was correct in denying appellants motion to suppress because the fourth amendment was inapplicable to the uscg search of the vessel.
sufficiency of the evidence to convict 
appellants moved for judgment of acquittal,pursuant to,after the conclusion of the government case in chief and again after the close of all the evidence.the district court denied both motions.here,appellants claim that the evidence is insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that they had the required intent to violate the laws of the united states.specifically,appellants allege that the evidence is insufficient to establish that they intended to distribute the marijuana,as required by app.a,see united states guerrero,cir,or that they sought by their actions to make the trafficking venture succeed,as required by,see id.at.we review rule determinations de novo,resolving any evidentiary conflicts or credibility issues in the government favor.id.at.if the evidence,viewed under this lens,permits a rational jury to find the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt,then the evidence is legally sufficient.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in circumstantial cases such as this one,the evidence is sufficient to convict if it adequately supports the the requisite inference that the vessel was engaged in obviously illegal activity,and that each appellant was ready to assist in the criminal enterprise.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the government argues that the jury could have reasonably drawn this inference from the evidence i that the appellants admitted to knowing that marijuana was on the vessel before or shortly after the vessel departed,ii that the appellants did not seek to return to colombia nor destroy the marijuana,and iii that although the appellants claimed that they thought they were going on a fishing expedition,the vessel lacked fish,usable fishing nets,line gear or refrigeration.see united states,cir holding that the evidence may be entirely circumstantial.appellants respond that their presence on the vessel or even their knowledge that they were transporting marijuana is insufficient to establish their intent,see guerrero,at mere presence at the scene or even knowledge that the crime is being committed is generally insufficient internal quotation marks omitted,particularly since they claim to have only participated under duress.
resolving all credibility issues in favor of the government,we find the record sufficiently complete to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that appellants committed the crime charged.the circumstantial evidence supports the inference of drug trafficking,and there is no evidence opposing the jury determination that appellants testimony in support of their duress defense was incredible.united states spinney,cir affirming where a jury inferences derive support from a plausible rendition of the record and their conclusions flow rationally from those inferences see also united states,cir,cert.denied,d quoting united states smith,cir,cert.denied,d concluding that it is the province of the jury,not the court,to determine credibility of the witnesses,and noting that n either juries nor judges are required to divorce themselves of common sense,where,as here,the appellant s portrayal of himself as an innocent bystander s is inherently unbelievable.
ruling on the defense of duress 
prior to trial,appellants sought to present a defense of duress.the district court stated that it would not rule on a duress instruction to the jury until after appellants had testified,if they were willing to do so,and only if the court determined that appellants met the standard for the submission of the charge to the jury.
the burden of proof to demonstrate duress is on appellants.united states amparo,cir.in order to establish a claim of duress,the defendant must show that he acted under an immediate threat of serious bodily injury he had a belief that the threat would be carried out and he had no reasonable opportunity to escape or otherwise frustrate the threat.united states arthurs,cir.a trial court may refuse a duress instruction if insufficient evidence is presented.id.
after appellants presented their case for duress,the court found that the appellants met the requisite burden of proof and instructed the jury as to a defense of duress.the jury,however,did not find that appellants were acting under duress.appellants bravo and martínez now claim that,because the court did not rule on the applicability of a duress offense until after the close of all evidence,they were denied the opportunity to choose a defense strategy in advance and participate in a fair trial.
the district court clearly has the discretion to either employ a hearing or to wait until after all evidence has been heard at trial,to determine whether the evidence of duress is sufficient as a matter of law to warrant an instruction.see,united states bailey,d upholding the convictions of four defendants,three of whom,at their joint trial,were denied a duress instruction after the close of evidence,and the fourth defendant who,at a separate trial,was denied a duress instruction prior to trial.indeed,we are unaware of any case mandating a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence for a duress defense.moreover,the record indicates that appellants were not prevented from arguing at trial that appellants were acting under duress,or from presenting evidence to the jury,including the testimony of each appellant,allegedly demonstrating that they acted under duress.thus,the district court did not err by denying appellants a determination on their duress defense.
sentencing 
adjustment for minor participation 
appellants claim that the district court erred in failing to grant them a downward adjustment in their base offense level due to their alleged minor participation in the offense,as compared to,the captain of the vessel.we will only reverse the district court finding that appellants were not minor participants if that finding is clearly erroneous.united states,cir.appellants bear the burden of proving that they are entitled to downward adjustments for their roles in the offense.united states tom,cir.if the record supports at least two permissible inferences,the factfinder choice between or among them can not be clearly erroneous,at.accordingly,we rarely reverse a district court decision regarding whether to apply a minor role adjustment.tom,at.
a downward adjustment for a defendant minor role in an offense is permitted for a defendant who is less culpable than most other participants,but whose role could not be described as minimal.b.here,although the psr recommended that a adjustment be granted,the government objected to the recommendation,arguing that appellants were culpable to the same degree because they were all members of the vessel crew,equally advancing the same venture.appellants argued that because none of them were the captain of the vessel,but rather crew members,with less significant functions than the captain,they held minor roles.in denying the adjustment,the sentencing court ruled that it could not differentiate the major from the minor participants in the case.
while we acknowledge that the record indicates that was the captain of the vessel,and that appellants were the crew,it is not clear that the sentencing judge erred in denying the adjustment.appellants failed to demonstrate that any of them were less culpable than the others,united states brandon,cir affirming denial of minor participant adjustment where defendant was less culpable than the major participants,but not less culpable than most of the other defendants,or that their participation was less than the average participation in the venture,united states osorio,cir.accordingly,we can not find that the district court denial of the adjustment was in error.
the safety valve benefit 
bravo,isaa and mancilla each appeal the district court denial of their petitions.a defendant bears the burden of demonstrating his entitlement for the reduction.united states,cir.to qualify for this benefit,the defendant must demonstrate,among other things that he truthfully provided the government with all the information and evidence he possesses concerning the offense.f indeed,nothing short of truthful and complete disclosure shall suffice.united states bermúdez,cir quoting united states matos,cir united states richardson,cir not clearly erroneous to deny safety valve benefit where the defendant failed to divulge information he possessed concerning the crime at the proffer session.
the district court finding on eligibility must be an independent determination,united states white,cir,resting on more than bare conclusions,united states,cir.although it is preferable that the court support its decision with specific factual findings,a district court may rest its decision on conclusory statements if those conclusions have easily recognizable support in the record.see id.at.
unfortunately,the district court failed to make even conclusory statements as to why bravo did not merit relief.the record shows that bravo repeated attempts to discuss his eligibility were rebuffed by summary denials of his eligibility by the district court.the district court failure to provide any explanation of its reasoning for denial falls well below the standard set in,at.accordingly,we remand bravo determination for reconsideration by t
