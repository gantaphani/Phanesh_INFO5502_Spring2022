boats owned by joseph and barbara sander,ivy and ruby smith,and lawson and mary burford collectively the boat owners were destroyed while moored at the yacht club of louis yacht club when another boat caught fire.the boat owners sought recovery from the yacht club,which defended based on an exculpatory clause in the boat space rental agreement slip agreement that the yacht club had with each of the boat owners.the district court granted recovery to the boat owners,from which the yacht club appeals.siding with the fifth and ninth circuits in an existing circuit split concerning the enforceability of exculpatory clauses in marine contracts,we reverse the district court judgment.
ronald and martha jessup owned the motor vessel,a houseboat,which they moored at the yacht club marina.after noticing a fuel leak near the starboard engine fuel pump,jessup approached the yacht club service department to discuss needed repairs.the service manager informed jessup that he would be unable to repair it in the time frame jessup requested.the yacht club general manager suggested to jessup that he hire charlie shulte,a yacht club maintenance worker,to repair the fuel leak,assuring jessup that shulte was qualified to perform the repair work.jessup hired shulte,who determined that the fuel pump needed to be replaced and installed a new pump.
jessup returned to the boat three days after shulte replaced the fuel pump to show the boat to an interested buyer.after starting the boat and letting it run for a period of time,jessup heard a loud thud that was later described as an explosion.flames engulfed the hatch area where the engines were located.jessup was unable to extinguish the flames with a fire extinguisher and the boat became engulfed.the fire spread to other docks of the marina and ultimately destroyed the never better,owned by the sanders,the my prerogative,owned by the smiths,and the lady ellen,owned by the burfords.
the jessups brought an action in federal district court seeking exoneration from,or limitation of liability for,all claims arising from the incident.each of the boat owners filed claims within the suit against the jessups and the yacht club,and the yacht club and the jessups filed claims against each other.the claims against the yacht club were premised on a negligence theory,alleging that shulte improperly installed the fuel pump,which caused the fire,and that the yacht club was liable for assuring jessup that shulte was qualified to perform the repair,when in fact he was not.
the yacht club defended against the boat owners by asserting that an exculpatory clause printed on the back of each boat owner slip agreement exonerated it from any liability for damages caused by the fire.the clause read as follows 
insurance tenant agrees that he will keep the boat fully insured with complete marine insurance,including hull property coverage and indemnity liability insurance.
the landlord does not carry insurance covering the property of the tenant.the landlord will not be responsible for any injuries or property damage resulting,caused by or growing out of the use of the dock or harbor facilities that the tenant releases and discharges the landlord from any and all liability for loss,injury including death,or damages to person or property sustained while in or on the facilities of landlord,including fire,theft,vandalism,wind storm,high or low waters,hail,rain,ice,collision or accident,or any other act of god,whether said boat is being parked or hauled by an agent of landlord or not.
app.of,tab.the case was tried to the bench and the district court found that the jessups were not negligent.the court also found that the fire resulted from the improper installation of the fuel pump by shulte,an agent of the yacht club,and that shulte actions constituted negligence on the part of the yacht club.the district court found that the exculpatory clause did not release the yacht club from liability for its own negligence because exculpatory clauses that completely absolve a party from all liability are invalid.add.at.the court found alternatively that the exculpatory clause did not clearly and unequivocally indicate that it released the yacht club from liability for its own negligence,and that the provision was overreaching because of the unequal bargaining power of the parties.id.the court ordered the yacht club to pay to the sanders,to the smiths,and to the burfords as the value of their respective boats.
the yacht club appeals,arguing that the clause is sufficiently clear to release it from liability stemming from its own negligence,and urging us to adopt the views of the fifth and ninth circuits,which enforce exculpatory clauses that fully exonerate a party from liability for its own negligence.the yacht club does not dispute the district court finding that it was negligent.the jessups are not parties to this appeal.

is the exculpatory clause sufficiently clear 
the clause at issue here required the boat owner to carry full property insurance on the boat and informed the boat owner that the marina did not carry insurance that covered the boat owner property,including the boat.it further provided that the landlord will not be responsible for any injuries or property damage resulting,caused by or growing out of the use of the dock or harbor facilities that the tenant releases and discharges the landlord from any and all liability for loss,injury including death,or damages to person or property sustained while in or on the facilities of landlord,including fire app.of,tab.the boat owners argue that it is not enough that the clause released the marina from all liability,it must do more by specifically referring to liability caused by the marina own fault.the boat owners made clear during oral argument that they do not suggest that the clause is deficient for not using the magic term negligence,but argue that it must refer to liability arising from the marina fault in some manner.we recognize that the supreme court of missouri requires something more,see alack vic tanny int l of,en banc holding that exculpatory clause in health club membership did not exculpate the facility from liability for a personal injury stemming from the facility negligence because the clause did not use the term negligence,fault,or equivalents,but we are applying federal maritime law,which must control our construction of the contract at issue.
despite the alleged shortcomings,we hold that the clause releasing the yacht club from any and all liability for damages to property,including fire app.of,tab emphasis added,unambiguously released it from liability stemming from its own negligence.even in maritime law,we construe contracts by giving their terms their normal and everyday meaning.we look to the contract as a whole to determine whether it unambiguously states the parties intentions.the slip agreement clearly shifted the risk of loss to the boat owners by requiring the boat owners to fully insure their boats,including hull coverage.the agreement informed the boat owners in capital letters that the marina did not carry insurance that would cover the property of the boat owners.the term any and all used in the exculpatory clause is and leaves little doubt as to the liability from which the boat owners released the yacht club.in short,all means all.knott mcdonald,cir enforcing clause in which franchise seller assigned all their right,title and interest to the buyer,including cause of action for breach of franchise agreement.
we decline to accept the boat owners invitation to require more than all when the liability at issue stems from the yacht club own negligence.the agreement as a whole clearly shifted the risk of loss to the boat owners and exculpated the marina from liability for damage resulting from the fire.when language is this explicit,it is beyond the province of this court to imply limitations or conditions on the exercise of a power to allocate risks so unmistakably expressed.morton zidell explorations,cir construing clause providing that all risk of loss of or damage to the vessel shall be upon first party and second party shall not,under any circumstances whatsoever,be chargeable with or liable for damages,cert.denied,d.even those circuits that are hostile to exculpatory clauses have found similar language equally unambiguous.see la esperanza,at holding a contract clause stating that t he yard shall in no case be held responsible for the damages resulting from any loss of use or profit of the vessel to be unambiguous.but see randall,at holding that clause indemnifying party for losses howsoever arising was not sufficiently clear and unequivocal to shift liability for chevron negligence onto sea savage.having determined that the exculpatory clause unambiguously included liability for damage caused by a fire stemming from the yacht club negligence within its exclusion,we must determine whether the clause is enforceable.
does the exculpatory clause contravene public policy 
this case pits two competing public policy doctrines against each other holding parties responsible for their actions by limiting their ability to absolve themselves from liability for their own negligence versus recognizing the liberty to contract.the circuits are in agreement that while exculpatory clauses were generally disfavored by admiralty courts,such clauses are routinely enforced today based on the consideration that businessmen can bargain over which party is to bear the risk of damage and set the price accordingly,thus achieving a more rational distribution of the risk and allocation of price than the law would otherwise allow.see la esperanza,at internal quotations omitted edward leasing,at same.the rub comes from whether a party should be allowed to absolve itself from all liability for its own negligence 
the boat owners urge us to adopt the reasoning of the first and eleventh circuits.both of those circuits have stated that exculpatory clauses in maritime contracts are valid and enforceable if the limitation of liability is clear and unequivocal,the clause does not absolve a party from all liability for its own negligence,the liability risk provides a deterrent to negligence,and the parties are of equal bargaining power.see diesel repower,at upholding warranty in ship repair contract that limited liability to the purchase price of the parts purchased la esperanza,at upholding ship repair contract that limited liability to cost to repair and excluded recovery for loss of use or profit of vessel.the rationale for the limitation on exculpatory clauses stems from the supreme court case of bisso inland waterways,which held that an exculpatory clause in a towage contract violated public policy.see.
the ninth circuit has distinguished bisso and limited it to cases involving towage contracts,see morton,at bisso merely reaffirmed the rule applicable to tugboat towing,and we think rightly so.see also law,cir enforcing exculpatory clause in private carriage contract and noting that both before and after bisso,exculpatory clauses in private contracts of affreightment have been upheld against public policy attacks.the bisso court explained,this rule that clauses in towage contracts are unenforceable is merely a particular application to the towage business of a general rule long used by courts and legislatures to prevent enforcement of contracts in many relationships such as bailors and bailees,employers and employees,public service companies and their customers.bisso,at.internal footnotes omitted.the purpose of the rule in towage contracts is to discourage negligence by making wrongdoers pay damages,and to protect those in need of goods or services from being overreached by others who have power to drive hard bargains.id.at.the supreme court explained that the rule was first articulated during an era of manifest judicial hostility toward contracts particularly those made by businesses dealing widely with the public and having potentially monopolistic powers.id.at.discussing the wash gray.and the steamer syracuse,wall.
during that same period of judicial hostility toward exculpatory clauses,the supreme court upheld a liability exemption clause between a railroad and a construction company because the railroad was not acting as a common carrier.see santa fe,prescott,phoenix ry.grant.const.the railroad had contracted with the construction company to extend the railroad rail lines and agreed to haul the equipment and men necessary to perform the work to the end of the existing line.the contract provided that a ll risk of loss or damage to be borne by the contractor.id.at.following a fire on one of the rail cars,the construction company sued the railroad to recover damages for property lost in the fire.the court explained the long standing doctrine that common carriers can not secure immunity from liability for their negligence by any sort of stipulation based on broad grounds of public policy.id.at.the court noted that the rule,which restricted the liberty to contract,was justified by t he great object of the law governing common carriers which was to secure the utmost care in the rendering of a service of highest importance to the community and the fact that the carrier and the individual customer are not on equal footing.id.at.the court went on to hold,however,that t he rule extends no further than the reason for it,id.at,and that because the railroad was not acting in its capacity as a common carrier,the contract clause was enforceable.
the reasoning of santa fe convinces us that bisso limitation on exculpatory clauses should be limited to towage contracts,which have been likened to common carriers.in fact,justice douglas concurred on the basis that tugboats are common carriers when they so hold themselves out.bisso,at.int
