in this maritime action arising from cargo damage sustained during a voyage from spain to china,shipper foster wheeler energy corporation foster wheeler appeals from a final judgment entered in its favor,challenging the district court summary judgment ruling that terms in the relevant bills of lading entitled the carrier to limit its liability to per package under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa.because we find that in this case that the rules as enacted in spain,not cogsa,apply ex proprio vigore and can not be overcome by any terms in the bills of lading at issue here,we affirm the district court judgment on liability,reverse the district court ruling that cogsa governs the quantum of damages owed,and remand the case for a proper calculation of damages in accordance with the spanish rules.
factual and procedural background 
foster wheeler brought this maritime suit against the an ning jiang,in rem,and carrier industrial maritime carriers bahamas,imc,in personam,seeking relief for damage to a shipment of packages containing equipment for two generation units carried under bills of lading from tarragona and gijon,spain to xingang,china.the underlying facts are not in dispute.foster wheeler is a corporation which is principally domiciled in the united states and is engaged in a wide variety of manufacturing and shipping endeavors.imc,a corporation organized under the laws of the bahamas with its principal place of business in new orleans,louisiana,is engaged in the operation of vessels for the carriage of goods for hire.in february,foster wheeler retained imc to ship the generation equipment from spain to china aboard the an ning jiang,operated under charter by imc at all times pertinent to this litigation.accordingly,imc,through its agent intermarine incorporated intermarine,issued three identical conlinebill form bills of lading in hamburg,germany,listing foster wheeler as the shipper,tarragona and gijon,spain as the ports of loading and xingang,china as the port of discharge.in late may,the equipment was delivered in good order to the ports of tarragona and gijon and loaded aboard the an ning jiang.unfortunately,the vessel encountered heavy weather conditions during the voyage,causing a number of the packages to shift and become damaged before being discharged in china.
on december,foster wheeler filed suit against the an ning jiang,in rem,and imc,as the carrier in the eastern district of louisiana seeking to recover damages in the amount of as a result of imc alleged breach of its duties under cogsa,app.et,the harter act,app.et.imc answered that pursuant to the terms of the bills of lading,the quantum of its liability,if any,should be limited in accordance with cogsa per package limitation,which in this case would cap imc exposure for cargo damage at the three bills of lading at issue bore no explicit reference to any liability limitation.instead,each of the three bills of lading contained the following pertinent conditions of carriage 
general paramount clause 
the hague rules contained in the international convention for the unification of certain rules relating to bills of lading,dated brussels the of august as enacted in the country of shipment shall apply to this contract.when no such enactment is in force in the country of shipment,the corresponding legislation of the country of destination shall apply,but in respect of shipments in which no such enactments are compulsorily applicable,the terms of the said convention shall apply.
trades where rules apply 
in trades where the international brussels convention as amended by the protocol signed at brussels on february,hague visby rules apply compulsorily,the provisions of the respective legislation shall be considered incorporated into this bill of lading.the carrier takes all reservations possible under such applicable legislation,relating to the period before loading and after discharging and while the goods are in charge of another carrier,and to deck cargo and live animals

any lawsuit arising under this bill of lading shall be filed at new orleans,the carrier principal place of business,in the district court for the eastern district of louisiana.law shall apply.
on april,imc filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that,pursuant to the jurisdiction clause,cogsa and its per package liability limitation governed this action rather than the rules referenced in the bills general paramount clause foster wheeler opposed imc motion,contending that the rules as enacted in spain and their higher provision,not cogsa,governed this carriage by operation of law and by incorporation into the bills of lading,entitling it on the facts of this case to a full recovery foster wheeler further asserted that because spain rules applied compulsorily by force of law,article iii of these rules nullified any contractual term in the bills of,the jurisdiction the extent that it invoked cogsa lower per package limitation foster wheeler uncontroverted summary judgment evidence included the affidavit testimony of an expert on spanish maritime law attesting that a voyage from spain to china is a trade line to which the spanish enactment of the rules applies compulsorily.nonetheless,on september,the district court granted imc motion,reasoning that the jurisdiction clause designating law was a forum selection and clause call ing for the application of cogsa and,as such,was entitled to a presumption of validity that foster wheeler failed to overcome.the district court also found that,as a matter of contractual interpretation,the jurisdiction clause was specific,and therefore could not be trumped by the terms of an amorphous general paramount clause that merely suggest ed that in some circumstances the rules might apply.
on october,foster wheeler filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court grant of partial summary judgment,which the district court denied.by december,only the proper quantum of damages remained at issue between the parties.in order to expedite foster wheeler ability to appeal the district court summary judgment ruling,the parties filed a joint notice of consent to entry of judgment.accordingly,on december,the district court entered final judgment in favor of foster wheeler,calculating the quantum of damages owed under cogsa.foster wheeler timely filed notice of appeal.
discussion 
on appeal,foster wheeler contests the amount of its damages award,arguing that the district court erred in determining that cogsa,rather than spain rules,govern the extent of imc liability for the cargo damage.imc does not dispute its liability for damage to the cargo thus,the sole issue before this court is whether cogsa or the rules as enacted in spain govern the carriage and hence,the quantum of damages owed by imc.

ii.the contract of carriage and limitation of liability under the hague rules 
foster wheeler challenges each of the district court reasons for declining to rule that the spanish rules higher limitation of liability governs the calculation of damages available in this case.in support of its position,foster wheeler first contends that because the spanish rules and its higher limits on liability govern this carriage compulsorily by force of law and cogsa does not,article iii of the rules invalidates the jurisdiction clause designating law to the extent it contractually incorporates cogsa inconsistent,lower limitation of liability provision.foster wheeler asserts in the alternative that as a simple matter of contractual interpretation,a reading of the parties contract of carriage as a whole reveals that the jurisdiction clause contractually invoked cogsa and its liability limitation only during periods and for claims not governed by the rules referenced in the general paramount clause.according to foster wheeler,under either rationale,the only way to avoid rendering provisions of the bills of lading meaningless or superfluous is to enforce the general paramount clause,which designates spain rules as the governing law of this shipment.because we agree with the contractual interpretation advanced by foster wheeler,we need not address foster wheeler first argument concerning the interplay between the rules article iii and cogsa liability limitation in order to dispose of the issue presented.
federal courts sitting in admiralty adhere to the axiom that a contract should be interpreted so as to give meaning to all of its that every provision was intended to accomplish some purpose,and that none are deemed superfluous.mannesman demag concert express,cir quoting transitional learning community,office of personnel,cir.moreover,it is well established that a freely negotiated private international agreement,unaffected by fraud,undue influence,or overwhelming bargaining power should be given full effect,afram carriers,moeykens,cir quoting bremen zapata,d.the necessary corollary is that w here parties specify in their contractual agreement which law will apply,admiralty courts will generally give effect to that choice.hawkspere shipping intamex,cir quoting chan soc y expeditions,cir.
the contractual agreements at issue here are the three bills of lading before us,which facially appear to be simultaneously governed by two jurisdiction clause selecting law,and a general paramount clause containing the following essential provisions t he hague rules as enacted in the country of shipment shall apply to this contract if the hague rules are not enacted in the country of shipment,the corresponding legislation of the country of destination applies or,if there is no such legislation,the terms of the convention containing the hague rules apply and if the rules are compulsorily applicable to the trade in question,then the legislation enacting those rules applies.
it is undisputed that in this case the rules as enacted in spain,the country of shipment,applied ex proprio vigore,or compulsorily by force of law.the rules compulsorily govern a carriage from the time the ship tackle is hooked onto the cargo at the port of loading until the time the cargo is released from the tackle at the port of discharge whenever either the bill of lading is issued in a signatory nation carriage is from a port in a signatory nation or the bill of lading references the rules.see rules,art.x,reprinted in william tetley,international maritime and admiralty law.in this case,both germany,where the bills of lading were issued,and spain,the location of the ports of departure,are signatory nations.moreover,for t rades where the rules apply compulsorily,the general paramount clause expressly incorporates the rules into the bills of lading.
the parties also agree that,absent the jurisdiction clause designating a specific forum and providing that law shall apply,cogsa,the united states statutory enactment of the hague rules,would not apply to this shipment.cogsa only applies compulsorily during the period to contracts for the carriage of goods to or from ports in foreign trade.app.a carrier and a shipper may extend cogsa application,for example,to and periods or to carriage between two ports,but the extent of any application beyond the scope of the statute is a matter of contract.hartford fire ins.orient overseas containers lines,cir citing app.consequently,if cogsa governed this carriage from spain to china,it would do so only by contract and would not apply ex proprio vigore.see cogsa,app.craddock intern.wilson son,cir concluding that because carriage from venezuela to peru did not involve shipments to or from the united states,cogsa did not govern the underlying bills of lading ex proprio vigore citation omitted croft scully skulptor vuchetich,cir benedict on admiralty ch.under these circumstances,a s a rule adopted by and in a contract,cogsa provisions are merely contract terms that are modifiable by other language contained in the bill of lading.hartford fire ins,at citing pannell united states lines,cir.
the district court resolved what it perceived as a conflict between the jurisdiction and general paramount clauses by concluding that the jurisdiction clause constituted a combined and clause that commanded the application of the whole body of law,including cogsa and its limitation of liability provisions,at all periods of time during this carriage.in defense of this ruling,imc it did before the district forum selection and clauses in international contracts must be enforced absent a showing by the opponent that the clause is the product of fraud or overreaching or is otherwise unreasonable under the circumstances,primarily relying upon bremen zapata,d,vimar seguros y reaseguros sky reefer,d,carnival cruise lines,shute,d,and this court opinion in mitsui usa mira,cir.according to imc,foster wheeler never alleged facts nor adduced any evidence necessary to overcome this burden.this argument is unavailing.
while it is true that this court has recognized that the presumptive enforceability rule of the bremen and its progeny extends equally to cases involving challenges to the enforceability of arbitration clauses and combined forum clauses,see mitsui,at,in this case,foster wheeler acquiesced to the forum selected in the bills of lading,and does not argue that the aspect of the jurisdiction clause is unenforceable in toto.rather,foster wheeler argues that the statement in the jurisdiction clause that law shall apply means that law applies to the extent that it does not contravene the rules referenced in the general paramount clause.imc has not cited,nor has our researched revealed,any authority supporting the application of this presumption to resolve a purported conflict between two clauses in any context,let alone in the absence of a challenge to the choice of forum.sky reefer,the case most on point of the trilogy of supreme court opinions cited by imc,nonetheless provides little guidance in the instant matter.see at.sky reefer involved a challenge to the enforceability of a clause calling for arbitration in japan and the application of japanese law in a bill of lading to which cogsa would otherwise compulsorily apply by operation of law.id.in that case,the shipper insisted that the combined arbitration and clause was void pursuant to cogsa because a japanese arbitrator would likely apply japanese law under which the respondents liabilities might have been less that they would have been under cogsa.id.the supreme court,however,never reached the issue.id.declining to speculate as to whether a japanese arbitrator would or would not apply cogsa,the court concluded that the proper course in the interest of international comity was to enforce the arbitral clause to allow the foreign arbitrator to resolve the issue in the first instance.id.at.noting that w hatever the merits of petitioner comparative reading of cogsa and its japanese counterpart,its claim is premature.
moreover,we find that the bremen,carnival cruise,and sky reefer are to resolution of the issue presented in this case for another reason.although imc correctly refers to the general paramount clause as a clause,imc fails to recognize that to the extent that these cases demand,as it asserts,that the language in the jurisdiction clause be accorded presumptive validity,the general paramount clause,too,would be entitled to benefit equally from this presumption.the result,at least initially,would be a stalemate between the two clauses.thus,even if we were to accept imc argument that this line of precedent supplies the appropriate standard in the instant matter,we would nevertheless remain unpersuaded that the rule of presumptive enforceability articulated in these cases dictates the contractual interpretation advanced by,that the language in the jurisdiction clause governs to the exclusion of and without regard to the general paramount clause.
