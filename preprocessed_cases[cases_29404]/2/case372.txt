on april,a barge being towed by the jamie leigh struck and damaged miter gate number two of mississippi river lock,located near winfield,missouri.the corps is responsible for maintaining and operating lock.after the allision with the jamie leigh,the corps assessed the damage to miter gate number two and determined that repairs were needed.
the process of repairing a miter gate is extensive and requires that the damaged gate be pulled from the lock,that a temporary replacement be installed,and that the original gate be repaired and then reinstalled.the corps determined that it would do the necessary repair work itself and that it would undertake repairs to miter gate one at the same time that miter gate two was being repaired miter gate one had been damaged in an allision in but did not require immediate repair at that time.
repairs were completed to both miter gates on february,and the corps then apportioned the costs to pull and repair the gates between the two allisions.the initial estimate for the cost of repairs related to the jamie leigh allision was between and.the government determined that the actual share of the damages owed by capital sand as the owner of the jamie leigh was,and a bill was sent for that amount.capital sand did not make any payments to the government,and the government filed suit in the southern district of illinois.the case was later transferred to the eastern district of missouri upon the defendants motion.after the transfer,the government recalculated the amount of damages to conform to the rule of and reduced its claim to.this amount included charges for labor including overhead,plant rental,travel,general overhead,supplies,and other various expenses.

the corps has an obligation to recover its overhead costs,which arises directly from an act of congress codified at.that statute establishes a revolving fund for necessary expenses related to the maintenance and repair of facilities and equipment used in the corps civil works functions which include the repair and operation of the locks and dams on the mississippi river,specifically including the furnishing of facilities and services for private persons as authorized by law.the statute further requires the fund to be credited with reimbursements for the cost of equipment,facilities,and services furnished,at rates which shall include charges for overhead and related expenses and accrued leave.the corps has implemented the statute requirements by regulation.in this case,the corps used its own equipment,its shops and facilities,and the services of its employees to repair the damage caused by the appellants.
the appellants rely on gopher state to contest the in overhead damages awarded to the government.in gopher state,our court upheld the district court judgment denying the award of additional overhead charges to the government,holding that the government failed to prove the reasonableness of the amount claimed above its original estimate for the repairs,particularly regarding the increased overhead charges.id.at.the district court had found that the method used to calculate overhead,which resulted in overhead on overhead,basically amounted to double recovery for the government,a finding our court found to be not clearly erroneous.id.at.in addition,our court noted the district court concern with the fact that the actual bill for overhead was greater than the original estimated cost for overhead.id.at.in the case at bar the amount sought,is somewhat less than the low end of the original estimate range of to,thus eliminating the problem of an increase that was ridiculous on its face present in gopher state.id.at.
in gopher state,the original estimate for the work included overhead of.the government submitted a final invoice that included overhead of.the district court disallowed the additional overhead because it was arbitrary and a result of overhead on overhead.the issue was whether the additional overhead was justifiable.there was no question that overhead was allowable as long as it was justified.the court discussion about overhead not being related to the accident and not being specifically related to the gopher state job,is a recitation of the testimony before the district court.our court held in gopher state,as stated supra,that i ncreased overhead and indirect expenses are compensable,but only where there exists justification for awarding these costs.id.under the appellants interpretation of gopher state,overhead is only recoverable if it is directly linked to a particular repair project.we do not read the gopher state case to be as limiting as the appellants argue.to do so ignores the definition of overhead,which requires only an indirect connection by definition,and ignores the outcome of gopher state,which allowed the recovery of justified overhead.we hold that the corps need not establish a direct connection between overhead charges and a particular repair project,but may recover overhead charges that are justified by a reasonable relationship to the repair work.see peavey barge line,at gopher
