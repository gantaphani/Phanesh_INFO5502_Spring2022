this admiralty case involves a seaman efforts to recover damages as well as maintenance and cure arising from an accident he suffered while aboard a ship.although the district court awarded him damages,it reduced the damages award on the grounds that the seaman was comparatively negligent for the accident.having awarded him damages,it denied his claim for maintenance and cure.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
facts and procedural history 
at the time of boudreaux injury,he was working as a merchant seaman on the american osprey the osprey,a public vessel that was operated by bay ship management,bay ship.by,when he accepted the job on the osprey,boudreaux had worked on and off as a seaman for years.several years earlier,in,he had injured his back while working on another ship.the injury necessitated two surgeries involving fusions in the lumbar region of his spine.after the surgeries,boudreaux was limited to light industrial work,as he could only safely lift heavy objects in a certain manner,using his legs and shoulders rather than his back.
when boudreaux showed up for work on april,his supervisor,chief mate james parker parker,instructed him and another pumpman,william dunklin dunklin,to perform two jobs involving pump repair and maintenance.the first job was to replace an eductor valve,and the second job entailed repairing a suction line that connected to one of the main cargo pumps by a dresser coupling.although parker did not specifically instruct boudreaux and dunklin on the order of these tasks,he did indicate that they needed to be completed with all deliberate speed.working alone,boudreaux and dunklin removed the deck plating in order to access and repair the suction line.after removing the deck plating,they began to work on the old eductor valve.they disconnected the old valve and manually carried it across the opening in the pumproom deck caused by the removal of the deck plating.boudreaux and dunklin then exchanged the old valve for the new,replacement eductor valve.this new valve was extremely heavy,weighing about pounds.to install the new valve,they had to retrace their course across the opening in the deck.as they carried the heavy new valve,each person was required to place one foot on the solid plating and the other foot on the exposed piping below the level of the deck plating.at some point during this traverse,one of the seamen slipped the fall caused the entire weight of the new valve to shift to boudreaux in such a way that strained boudreaux right knee and cervical spine.
on april,boudreaux was taken to an orthopedic doctor in singapore,who diagnosed a tear of the medial meniscus in boudreaux right knee.during his return to the united states,boudreaux also began to notice a growing pain in his neck.in february,he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his knee,which reduced the pain to a tolerable level.he did not have neck surgery,however,because he responded negatively to a discogram,making surgery inadvisable.according to stuart phillips phillips,boudreaux most recent treating physician,boudreaux will live in pain for the rest of his life.to help him cope with the effects of this pain,phillips referred boudreaux to david mielke mielke,a psychologist at tulane university.mielke determined that boudreaux was suffering from moderate depression and anxiety,which he characterized as an adjustment disorder.in addition to the psychological treatment with mielke,boudreaux participated in six physical therapy sessions between june,and july.
on may,boudreaux filed suit against the government and bay ship under general maritime law,the jones act,app,the public vessels act,app,and the suits in admiralty act,app.alleging that his accident was caused entirely by the negligence of the defendants and the unseaworthiness of the osprey,he sought damages as well as maintenance and cure.on march,the court entered summary judgment in favor of bay ship following submission and approval of a order,which did not include a claim for maintenance and cure,the case went to trial january.on march,the court issued its opinion,finding that the government was negligent,but that boudreaux was comparatively negligent to the extent of.it therefore reduced boudreaux actual damages from to.this figure included past and future medical expenses,past and future wage loss,and other general damages,including pain and suffering,disfigurement,disability,mental anguish,and loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life.the court also held that the vessel was not unseaworthy.
on february,boudreaux filed a motion for maintenance and cure.he noted that the government had not paid him maintenance and cure since december.the government responded that no such payments were being made because boudreaux still had not completed the treatment recommended by his physicians and that there was no indication that he intended to do so in the immediate future.on march,boudreaux filed a supplemental motion for maintenance and cure,attaching a letter from mielke stating that boudreaux had not reached maximum medical cure and that he needed further orthopedic and psychiatric treatment.the court dismissed boudreaux request for maintenance and cure as moot in light of its march,opinion,which included future medical expenses.
boudreaux also filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and findings,which the court partially granted and denied.specifically,it granted boudreaux request for interest and costs,but denied all other relief.boudreaux timely appealed from the judgment and ruling,and his appeal was docketed as case.on june,boudreaux filed a new lawsuit seeking maintenance and cure relating to the same april,accident.the complaint focused as well on the government failure to pay the future medical expenses ordered by the court in its opinion.the government moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of res judicata.the court granted the motion,holding that although it did not explicitly make an award for maintenance and cure,its award of future medical expenses was intended to cover such costs.boudreaux timely appealed this judgment,and that appeal was docketed as case.on january,the two appeals were consolidated.
ii.discussion 
boudreaux contends that the court erred in attributing comparative negligence to him,including negligence for his use of unsafe procedures in performing the tasks and for doing heavy lifting in spite of his previous back injury holding that the osprey was not unseaworthy rejecting boudreaux claim for maintenance and cure by denying his motion in the first suit and dismissing his second suit.we address these issues in turn.
comparative negligence 
in general maritime law,comparative negligence bars an injured party from recovering for damages sustained as a result of his own fault.miles melrose,cir.the standard of care for a seaman under the jones act is to act as an ordinarily prudent seaman would act in similar circumstances.jackson omi,cir.findings by the district court on this issue are considered findings of facts and reviewed for clear error.id.a finding is clearly erroneous if a review of the record leaves a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.quoting mcallister united states.
regarding the court allocation of fault for his injuries,boudreaux dissects the court figure,claiming that the court determined that he was negligent,along with dunklin,for the way they performed the tasks,and then added an extra for boudreaux decision to lift the heavy valve despite his prior back injury.the court,however,did not explicitly bifurcate its analysis in this way.rather,it described its finding as based on the totality of the circumstances,taking into account boudreaux knowledge of his back limitations.the court reasoning,nevertheless,supports boudreaux interpretation of the findings.the court concluded that both boudreaux and dunklin were at fault for the unsafe way in which they performed the tasks,and that boudreaux was additionally negligent for attempting the work despite his prior back injury.id.at.given this analysis,the most reasonable explanation for the figure is that the court fi
