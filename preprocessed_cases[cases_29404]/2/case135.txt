background 
a.the arrest of the big red boat ii 
on september,patricia hayes associates,hayes and smithall electronics,smithall filed complaints against the brbii,international shipping partners isp,premier cruises,premier and the master of the brbii collectively the defendants.hayes and smithall alleged that they possessed maritime liens against brbii and therefore were entitled to a warrant of arrest pursuant to supplemental rule c admiralty rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure frcp.on september,two other plaintiffs,southern marine electric company,southern marine and alpha marine,alpha marine,filed similar complaints against the defendants.
on september,the district court signed the warrants of arrest requested by hayes,smithall,southern marine and alpha marine,and ordered the clerk of the court to issue a warrant of arrest and a writ of maritime attachment against brbii.although brbii was out of the jurisdiction at the time of the warrant was signed,the vessel arrived in the district on saturday,september.when brbii entered the district,the united states marshals seized it.
after the arrest of the vessel,numerous other complaints and intervening complaints were filed against defendants.the various complaints allege that each plaintiff provided goods or services that were defined as necessaries under maritime law and were therefore entitled to a maritime lien against brbii,as well as other relief.sureties filed their motion to intervene at this time.
on september,the district court signed an order consolidating all claims filed against defendants and granting motions to intervene as to those claims uncontested by defendants.after the bulk of the claims against brbii were settled,and brbii owners arranged for security to satisfy the remaining contested claims against the vessel,the district court signed an order releasing brbii from arrest on november.
sureties claims against the big red boat ii 
sureties claims against brbii were based on and related to a bond sureties issued to premier.premier did not own brbii it had chartered brbii from the boat owners big red boat two and operated brbii as part of its own fleet of vessels.in order to carry passengers for hire from ports,premier was legally obligated to provide evidence of financial responsibility to establish that it could refund any unearned passenger deposits.see.to fulfill this legal requirement,premier arranged for sureties to post a federal maritime commission passenger vessel surety bond the fmc bond.the fmc bond covered premier whole fleet of six vessels,and was limited to a total coverage amount of million.coverage for any individual ship was limited to million.as consideration for the issuance of the fmc bond,premier agreed to pay a premium and to indemnify sureties for all losses,costs and expenses,including reasonable attorney fees incurred under the fmc bond.premier posted cash collateral in the amount of million as security for the indemnification provision.
in the fall of,premier ceased operations.at the time,premier had collected passenger ticket deposits of for future trips of brbii which were canceled when premier ceased operations.in addition,several brbii voyages which had been scheduled for the summer of were never performed due to operational or mechanical difficulties.sureties claimed,in their complaint,that they were exposed to potential liability of up to coverage limit for any single boat under the fmc bond.however,at no point prior to the district court denial of sureties motion to intervene in june did sureties actually pay any claims under the fmc bond 
in their intervening complaint,sureties contend that they had claims against brbii because they were subrogated to the maritime lien rights of any passengers who made claims against the fmc bond and they were entitled to a maritime lien because the fmc bond was a maritime contract a necessary provided to brbii.the district court denied sureties motion to intervene after concluding that the bond between sureties and premier is not a maritime contract and,thus,sureties can not assert a maritime lien against the vessel.hayes big red boat ii,civ.gbd,wl,at may.the court also concluded that 
e ven if this court were to find that the bond is a maritime contract,sureties could not prevail.sureties have not demonstrated that they have actually paid out any claims,nor that the claims against the brb ii exceed the million collateral provided by premier.
ii.discussion 
in their briefs and at oral argument,the parties focused primarily on the question of whether the fmc bond is a maritime contract,and whether a maritime lien may attach as a result of payments made under such a bond.however,in the present case it is not necessary to therefore we do not issues,because nowhere in the motion to intervene,or in any of sureties subsequent filings and communications with the district court up until the time the district court denied the motion,did sureties ever allege that they had paid any claims under the fmc bond.therefore,it was within the district court discretion to decide whether or not to exercise jurisdiction over sureties claims,and the district court decided not to exercise jurisdiction.sureties contend that,to the extent that the district court relied upon the prematurity of sureties claims as the basis for the court denial of the motion to intervene that reliance was error.we disagree and,accordingly,affirm the district court order.
