opinion of the court 
this case presents important questions about the scope of our appellate jurisdiction over the order of a district court sitting in admiralty denying a motion to dismiss a suit and to vacate a warrant of arrest in an in rem proceeding.here,appellee petroleos mexicanos refinacion pemex,the mexican oil company,brought an action in rem against the king a,an oil tanker over which it claims to hold a maritime lien.the district court granted a warrant of arrest for seizure of the res the vessel.king david shipping king david claims ownership of the king a and responded on its behalf,moving under supplemental rule e f of the federal rules of civil procedure to dismiss pemex suit and to vacate the warrant of arrest for the king a on subject matter jurisdiction and statute of limitations grounds.the district court denied the motion,and king david appeals on behalf of the king 
we conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the district court order under or the cognate collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial industrial loan.we similarly conclude that we do not have appellate jurisdiction under the provisions for appellate review of certain interlocutory orders found in a and.we therefore do not reach the merits of the appeal,which we will dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
facts and procedural history 
background facts 
in late,pemex chartered a tanker,the tbilisi which has since been renamed the king a,from tbilisi shipping tbilisi shipping.in a voyage in december,a defect in the ship somehow caused the two types of petroleum carried by the ship diesel and unleaded gasoline to.this allegedly tortious event arguably gives rise to a maritime lien on the ship in favor of pemex.as security for the damages,pemex also withheld some of charter hire that it otherwise owed to tbilisi shipping.
tbilisi shipping conceded liability but not the amount of damages.in,however,tbilisi shipping commenced an arbitration under the charter to recover the withheld hire.tbilisi shipping p i club issued a letter of undertaking lou for our purposes here,a bond to secure any arbitral award in favor of pemex including costs and fees awarded by the arbitration panel.in return,pemex promised to pay the withheld hire and refrain from arresting the tbilisi.
as the parties confirmed at oral argument,the arbitration has been protracted for reasons not at all relevant here,and it continues to this day.at some point,the tbilisi was renamed the king a,and it is now owned by king david.pemex,wanting additional security for its claim in case the lou from tbilisi shipping p i club proves insufficient to cover any arbitral award sought to arrest the king a,on the theory that the tortious event created a maritime lien on the ship,irrespective of its owner.
proceedings before the district court 
pemex applied in to the united states district court for the district of new jersey for,and was granted,a warrant of arrest for the king a,which was scheduled to call at port newark a few days later,king david p i club issued a lou to secure any in rem award,so the warrant of arrest was withdrawn and was not actually served on the king 
in september,king david submitted an application under.supp.rule e f,which provides whenever property is arrested or attached,any person claiming an interest in it shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff shall be required to show why the arrest or attachment should not be vacated or other relief granted consistent with these rules.the application was in substance a motion to dismiss the complaint,and as the logical consequence thereof to vacate the warrant of arrest and discharge king david p i club lou.
the district court ruled on three issues in denying the rule e f application.first,it held that pemex has standing to pursue the in rem action,over king david objection that pemex had been paid in full for its loss by its insurers,and so had no lien on the ship,and hence no standing to sue.second,the district court held that there was a valid maritime lien against the ship,and so the warrant of arrest was proper,over king david objection that pemex failed to properly plead the existence of a maritime lien in its complaint.third,the district court held that there was no statute of limitations bar to pemex claim,over king david objection that this action was subject to a limitations period that had not been tolled,and had thus long ago expired.thus,the district court denied king david motion to dismiss,and refused to vacate the warrant of arrest for the king 
c.this appeal 
king david argues on appeal that the district court holdings on subject matter jurisdiction,the existence of a maritime lien,and the statute of limitations were incorrect.viewing these matters as immaterial here,pemex moved this court to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.in response,king david moved for a summary remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.these motions were referred to the merits panel.see third circuit iop.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
a rule e f motion actions in rem and quasi in rem general provisions procedure for release from arrest or attachment is similar at least here to a motion under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in the case of pemex alleged lack of standing,it is similar to a motion under.b to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.however,in view of its practical effect here,the rule e f motion belongs to the class of motions touching upon interim measures or provisional relief,such as motions to attach property or release an attachment,or motions for temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions.as such,in the discussion that follows,we are constrained to look at it both as a motion to dismiss and as an order similar to those touching upon interim measures or provisional relief.
four possible sources of appellate jurisdiction command our attention first,the familiar provision of second,the collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial industrial loan,which allows appeals under from certain collaterally final orders third,a,which expressly allows appeals from certain interlocutory orders of district courts sitting in admiralty and fourth,a,which authorizes interlocutory appeals from orders granting or refusing certain forms of interim or provisional relief.we address each jurisdictional provision in turn 
with the exception of the cohen collateral order doctrine,see infra part,an appeal under lies only from a final decision.as the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized,a decision is not final,ordinarily,unless it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.cunningham hamilton county,d quoting van cauwenberghe biard,d quoting catlin united states.see also gov t of rivera,cir quoting catlin,at.the denial of a motion to dismiss does not end the litigation and ordinarily is not a final order for purposes.bell atlantic.pub.util.comm n,cir citing charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure at orders refusing to dismiss an action almost always are not final.the district court decision denying king david motion to dismiss plainly does not meet the catlin finality standard but for this appeal,litigation on the merits would have continued,and there was no judgment to execute.
likewise,the status of the warrant of arrest has no bearing on the merits,and while the arrest of the ship metamorphosed into the lou may in the future be used to satisfy a judgment,the arrest itself is not the immediate precursor to execution of a judgment.the court of appeals for the second circuit has cataloged a long and distinguished line of authority that an order denying a motion to vacate an attachment is not a final order within the meaning of.drys shipping freights,sub freights,charter hire,cir.we agree in its ordinary sense does not confer jurisdiction on this court in this appeal.
