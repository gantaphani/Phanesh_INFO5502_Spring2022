daniel doyle suffered injuries while he was a passenger on a boat owned and operated by leland graske.doyle brought an action in nebraska state court,claiming that graske was negligent in his operation of the boat.graske removed the case to federal district court,invoking admiralty jurisdiction.the district court,sitting without a jury,found that doyle injuries were caused by graske negligence,and awarded compensatory damages to doyle,as well as damages to his wife,anne.we affirm the district court judgment in favor of daniel doyle,but reverse its award of damages to anne doyle.
on october,graske and two friends,daniel doyle and robert van hook,decided to go fishing in the waters off the coast of grand cayman island,where graske owned a vacation home.the three set out on graske inflatable boat at around.the boat was fourteen feet long,with a engine and room for six passengers.it featured two seats at the stern or rear,two more at midship,and a cushion for two passengers at the bow or forward end.both seats at the stern faced forward and included backrests.the stern seat on the starboard side,the right side while looking forward was known as the helm seat because of its position opposite the boat steering wheel,located on a console at midship.the forward side of the console functioned as a backrest for the starboard midship seat.the other midship seat on the port,or left,side and the bow cushion seats did not have backrests,and passengers sitting on the latter had to ride facing the rear.an inflatable tube formed most of the boat hull,and there were hand straps along the top of the tube for passengers sitting at midship or in the bow.
from the helm seat,graske steered the boat slowly through the zone extending two hundred yards from shore in which boats are prohibited from traveling above five miles per hour.when the boat was past the zone,graske said,here we go,or words to that effect,and began accelerating.as the boat came on is,reached a speed at which its hull was no longer displacing the water,but skimming across nylock nut came loose from the boat steering system,causing the system to malfunction and the boat to turn abruptly and sharply to the left.
despite the sudden turn,graske was able to maintain his position behind the steering wheel.van hook,who was sitting on one of the midship seats,managed to remain on the boat as well.doyle,however,was thrown overboard.accounts differ concerning where doyle was located when he was ejected.according to graske,doyle was sitting on the inflatable tube,with his feet between the starboard midship and bow seats,and with at least one hand on a hand strap.according to van hook,doyle was seated on the bow cushion having moved there from the tube,and was not holding any hand strap.doyle himself can not remember.
wherever he was sitting,doyle was thrown into the water,and as the boat continued turning counterclockwise,it struck him in the back and on the head.graske immediately put the boat in neutral.doyle was some distance from the boat,injured but conscious.graske brought the boat closer to doyle,and van hook grabbed hold of him,eventually pulling him onto the inflatable tube.
graske guided the boat to shore.from there,doyle was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to medical facilities in the united states.doctors diagnosed him with a flail chest,his respiration hindered by multiple rib fractures.because of difficulties breathing,doyle suffered permanent brain injury while hospitalized.
doyle brought an action against graske in nebraska state court,claiming negligence in graske operation of the boat.graske removed the case to federal district court,invoking admiralty jurisdiction under.he sought to implead several defendants,including a mechanic who repaired and reassembled the boat steering system just days before the accident.graske,however,was unable to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendants,and his claims were ultimately dismissed without prejudice.doyle filed an amended complaint,adding his wife,anne,as a plaintiff.
following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the doyles.applying general maritime law,the court found that graske was negligent in his operation of the boat,and that graske negligence was a proximate and substantial cause of doyle injuries.it also determined that doyle own negligence contributed to his injuries,because he should have been more aware of the dangers around him.the court apportioned ninety percent of the fault for doyle injuries to graske and potential tortfeasors,including the mechanic,and the remaining ten percent to doyle himself.taking account of doyle comparative negligence,the court awarded in compensatory damages to doyle.it also awarded in damages for loss of consortium to anne,but that amount did not reflect any proportional reduction for doyle comparative fault.graske appeals.
graske first challenges the district court finding that he was negligent in the operation of the boat.because negligence in admiralty is a factual determination,we may not set aside the district court finding unless it is clearly erroneous.mcallister united states.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.internal quotations omitted.
under general maritime law,a boat owner owes a duty of reasonable care to passengers lawfully aboard his boat.kermarec compagnie generale transatlantique,d.the district court found that graske breached this duty by bringing the boat on plane while doyle was seated in a position of danger.the court acknowledged that according to graske,doyle was sitting on the tube when the accident occurred,whereas according to van hook,doyle was sitting on the bow cushion.but the court determined that this difference of opinion was immaterial,because both the tube and the bow cushion seat are positions of danger while accelerating a small watercraft on the open ocean.given that doyle was sitting at either one position or the other,the court reasoned that graske should have known that it was unsafe to accelerate.accordingly,the court concluded that by bringing the boat on plane,graske failed to exercise reasonable care for doyle safety,and was thus negligent in his operation of the boat 
graske does not dispute that his actions were negligent if doyle was sitting on the tube.indeed,various boating experts testified at trial that sitting on the tube was unsafe while the boat was planing,and there was no testimony to the contrary.graske focuses instead on the district court finding that his operation of the boat was negligent if doyle was sitting on the bow cushion.graske argues that this finding is clearly erroneous.we disagree.
at trial,michael sampsel,a mechanical and marine engineer,testified that the bow cushion was an unsafe position while the boat was on plane.sampsel noted that the cushion was naturally subject to greater motion at higher speeds,given its location in the boat bow.according to sampsel,however,the cushion design did not account for such increased motion.quite the opposite,he explained,the cushion short inches above the that passengers would be sitting in an unusual posture,with their knees higher than normal.he also noted that the lack of thigh restraints or backrests meant that passengers would be prone to sliding across the cushion.sampsel acknowledged the presence of nearby hand straps,but maintained that they were meant for use in lifting the boat,not for use by passengers.in sampsel opinion,therefore,the bow cushion location and design rendered the seat unsafe while the boat was on plane,and graske violated safe boating practices if he proceeded to accelerate with doyle sitting there.
the testimony of two other experts was not inconsistent with sampsel conclusion.paul larson,a marine surveyor and investigator,testified that when the boat was planing,a seat at midship was a better and safer position than one in the bow.he did not rule out the possibility that if doyle was seated on the bow cushion when the accident occurred,then gras
