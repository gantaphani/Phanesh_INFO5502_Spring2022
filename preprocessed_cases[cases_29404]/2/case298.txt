bargecarib,bargecarib appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of bank one,louisiana bank one establishing that bank one preferred ship mortgage had priority over bargecarib maritime lien for breach of charter.because maritime liens for breach of charter attach at the moment the owner places the vessel at the charterer disposal,we vacate and remand.
background 
bargecarib,a subsidiary of american rice,sells rice to haiti and transports it there by an oceangoing barge called the laurikristi.to provide propulsion for the laurikristi,bargecarib executed a time charter agreement with offshore supply ships,offshore,owner of the towboat sovereign,to hire the sovereign for a period of one year,beginning august.bargecarib began using the sovereign under this charter and later,in july,timely exercised its contractual right,provided for in the charter,to extend the charter for another year.
on may,offshore sold the sovereign to global towing,llc global.to finance this purchase,global received a line of credit from first national bank of commerce fnbc and in return gave fnbc a preferred ship mortgage as security.global completely satisfied the sovereign existing mortgage of record and fnbc duly recorded its preferred mortgage on may.on october,global owner michael blake executed an guarantee of the global indebtedness.
after the sale of the vessel and recording of the mortgage,offshore and global reassured bargecarib that the sovereign,now renamed the dean,would sail on time for a scheduled trip to haiti.nevertheless,global delivered neither the dean nor a substitute suitable under the charter.bargecarib immediately filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of texas against the dean in rem and global in personam for breach of the charter.this court held that the charter had indeed been breached.bargecarib offshore supply ships,cir.on remand,the district court held that the date of breach was july.
global defaulted on the loan and blake refused to pay under the terms of his guarantee.on march,bank one successor by merger to fnbc responded by filing the present lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana against the dean in rem and against global and blake in personam.on june,bargecarib intervened in the lawsuit and asserted a maritime lien based on the breach of charter.bargecarib and bank one disputed the priorities of their claims to the dean,a critical issue because the proceeds of sale of the dean would be unlikely to satisfy both interests.they filed cross motions for summary judgment,and by order dated september,and entered october,the district court denied bargecarib motion and granted summary judgment to bank one,determining that bank one mortgage had priority over bargecarib maritime lien.bargecarib has timely appealed the september order.

threshold issues 
this court takes jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to a,allowing for review of interlocutory decrees of district courts determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases.because the grant of summary judgment disposed of bargecarib case on the merits,we have jurisdiction even without rule b certification.see walter heller and sonny,cir.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court,while viewing all disputed facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.mcclendon city of columbia,cir quotation omitted.
ii.attachment of a maritime lien 
under the ship mortgage act,bank one mortgage takes priority over all other claims against the vessel except for preferred maritime liens.b.under the facts of this case,bargecarib lien could only be preferred if it arose before the mortgage was filed.a.the time charter commenced before the mortgage was filed,but offshore and global breached the charter twenty days after that date.thus,this case presents the purely legal question of when a maritime lien for breach of charter arises.bank one prevails if maritime liens arise at the time of breach,while bargecarib prevails if they arise at the inception of the charter.
we begin our analysis,as we must,with a recognition of the unique qualities of the maritime lien.rather than arising from the english common law,maritime liens are based on principles of civil law.the young mechanic,cas,curtis,circuit justice.as a result,a maritime lien,is not a lien at all in the sense of the term.grant gilmore charles black,the law of admiralty ed hereinafter gilmore black.a lien is a lien is a lien,but a maritime lien is not.id.at.this case concerns the maritime lien unique power to confer the right to sue the vessel itself in rem,almost as if it were a person.see id.at when the vessel is sold under an in rem proceeding to satisfy a maritime lien,the owner takes the vessel free of all liens imposed anywhere in the world.id.at.accordingly,we take note that our analysis should not be primarily guided by reference to the commercial law of secured credit or the common law of liens.instead,we find our guidance in the ancient and peculiar case law of admiralty.while recent cases cast only a dim glow,we find our lighthouse in the supreme court of the.
older case law 
a wealth of authority from the nineteenth century exists to guide us in our resolution of this case.we discover that courts have long understood that maritime liens for charters and shipping contracts attach at the beginning of the contract and remain inchoate until breached.
the supreme court first examined the timing of charter liens in the freeman,how,observing in dictum that charterparties,must,in the invariable regular course of that business,be made,for the performance of which the law confers a lien on the vessel.id.at.the court added that third persons,who have shipped merchandise and taken bills of lading therefor,would thereby acquire a lien on the vessel.id.this use of thereby implies that the lien attaches at the delivery of the merchandise,a point made explicit in when justice nelson held that 
the goods were put on board of the vessel,and,if the lien attached at all,it attached as soon as they were laden on board.so far as the form of the remedy is concerned,it is the same as if the voyage had been broken up by the charterers at any other point in the course of the voyage,after the vessel had been out a week,a month,or longer.the hermitage,cas,nelson,circuit justice.
the entire court agreed that same term,holding that we do not see why the lien may not attach,when the cargo is delivered to the master for shipment.the edwin,how.the court reaffirmed the principle six years later.t he better opinion is,that the lien for freight commences as soon as the goods are delivered into the control of the master,or certainly as soon as they are put on board.the bird of paradise,wall.these holdings were reiterated by district and circuit courts.a s soon as the performance of the contract is commenced a lien exists on the vessel in favor of the shipper or charterer,and a suit in rem may be maintained against the same for any liability of the master or owner arising on or growing out of such contract.the director.see also the oceano,quoting same the esrom,cir t he lien of the vessel upon the goods and of the goods upon the vessel attaches from the moment the goods are laden on board.
soon after the bird of paradise,the supreme court elaborated further by adopting the privy council classic exposition of the maritime lien 
a maritime lien is the foundation of the proceeding in rem,a process to make perfect a right inchoate from the moment the lien attaches and whilst it must be admitted that where such lien exists,a proceeding in rem may be had,it will be found to be equally true,that in all cases where a proceeding in rem is the proper course,there a maritime lien exists,which gives a privilege or claim upon the thing,to be carried into effect by legal process.the bold buccleugh,eng,quoted in the rock island bridge,wall.emphasis added.
this statement explains how a maritime lien can attach at the beginning of the charter,yet only be enforceable at the time of breach the lien remains inchoate until perfected.the lien exists from the beginning of the charter to provide security for the parties 
shipowners contract for the safe custody,due transport,and right delivery of the cargo,and for the performance of their contract the ship,her apparel and furniture,are pledged in each particular case,and the shipper,consignee,or owner of the cargo,contracts to pay the freight and charges,and to the fulfillment of their contract the cargo is pledged to the ship,and those obligations are reciprocal,and the maritime law creates reciprocal liens for their enforcement.the maggie hammond,wall.
judge hough later clarified the true purpose of the rule 
the ancient and customary lien of the sea is not maintained,nor was it created so far as history reveals its origin for the convenience or assurance of parties,but for the encouragement of commerce and shipping as a presumed benefit to the public,in respect of an occupation hazardous and uncertain beyond most land ventures.the saturnus,cir.
even though the lien attaches at the beginning of the venture,the inchoate lien can not permit suit against the vessel in rem until perfected by a breach of the charter.this principle was best stated in 
from the moment,therefore,that the cargo was aboard the paul,the lien attached.it is argued,however,that this lien was inchoate,in the meaning of not being perfected it is inchoate only in the sense of enforceability.in other words,the lien is discharged,ipso facto,when the ship performs its duty to the cargo.if it does not,then the enforcement relates back to the period when it first attached for the lien is born and exists,until discharged,from the moment the cargo is aboard.the paul.
thus,the maritime lien attaches at the commencement of the undertaking and any subsequent breach perfecting the lien relates back to that time.bargecarib maritime lien arose when the dean then called the sovereign was delivered under the time charter agreement,and it was perfected when global and offshore breached the contract.
b.the executory contract doctrine 
the above cases require that the cargo be aboard the vessel in order for the lien to attach.this comes from the executory contract doctrine,the principle that a maritime lien does not attach if the contract has not,by the actual loading of cargo,ceased to be wholly executory.though it can be seen in earlier cases,the court stated the rule clearly in 
t he law creates no lien on a vessel as a security for the performance of a contract to transport a cargo until some lawful contract of affreightment is made,and the cargo to which it relates has been delivered to the custody of the master or some one authorized to receive it.the keokuk,wall.
bank one characterizes the executory contract doctrine as an exception to the general rule that breach of contract gives rise to a maritime lien,not as an indication of when the lien attaches.thomas schoenbaum intimates the same in his treatise admiralty and maritime law.see thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed.
we choose instead to rely upon the above case law and on other treatises.see benedict on admiralty,at ed.michael wilford et,time charters ed.the executory contract doctrine encompasses the earlier case law and merely restates the fact that an inchoate maritime lien attaches once the cargo is loaded.this is the meaning of our more recent statement that under the executory contract doctrine,a maritime lien for breach of charterparty arises once and to the extent that cargo is loaded on board.cardinal shipping seisho maru,cir.
we must also note the application of this doctrine to the present case.the asserted maritime lien arises from a time charter and not a contract of affreightment,a distinction we made in,of stamford,connecticut alaia,cir.a time charterer does not pay freight to the vessel owner for the safe transport of a specific cargo to a specific destination,but pays instead for the use of the vessel for a specified period of intended use of the vessel may not include the transportation of any cargo at all or may be to make a series of voyages,carrying different cargo to various destinations.id.at.for that reason,even though a contract for affreightment ceases to be executory only when the cargo is loaded,the vessel begins performance of the time charter contract when it is placed at the charterer disposal and ceases to be executory at that point.id.at.under the logic we expressed in alaia,then,a maritime lien for breach of a time charter attaches when the owner places the vessel at the charterer disposal.in the present case,the vessel had already been delivered to bargecarib and bargecarib had made several voyages with it bargecarib maritime lien thus arose before the preferred ship mortgage was recorded.
recent case law 
very few recent cases even hint at when a maritime lien arises the supreme court has not discussed the priority of maritime liens since,no recent circuit court case addresses the issue before us,and district courts have addressed the issue but split in their results.though this confusion means we can not rest upon recent holdings,it also means that nothing has altered the precedent laid down in the last century.
bank one most heavily relies upon our decision in cardinal shipping seisho maru,cir,quoting our statement that a maritime lien typically arises when the owner has breached its contract with the charterer.id.at.yet,in cardinal shipping we were discussing whether a confers the right to sue the vessel in rem or whether the litigant must be satisfied with the usual in personam and quasi in rem approaches.id.at.placed within its context,the statement merely addresses the existence of a maritime lien and not when that lien attaches.this reading gains support from our later statement in cardinal shipping that under the executory contract doctrine,a maritime lien for breach of charterparty arises once and to the extent that cargo is loaded on board.id.the fanciful courts have envisioned a union of ship and cargo marking the commencement of the lien.id.as we explained above,these later statements delineate the exact point at which the lien attaches and undermine bank one interpretation of the earlier sentence.at any rate,cardinal shipping would not bind us because it addressed a breach at the beginning of the charter.id.at.any statement regarding the timing of the lien would therefore be dictum.
for the same reason,we find inapposite the second circuit treatment of maritime liens in rainbow line,tequila,cir.the second circuit held in rainbow line that there is a maritime lien for the breach of a charter party,a holding we followed in international marine towing southern leasing partners,cir.though the rainbow line court states that a maritime lien for breach of charter has priority over the mortgagee only if it has attached before the mortgage was recorded,rainbow line,at,this only begs the question before us.moreover,just as in cardinal shipping,the rainbow line court was considering a breach of charter that occurred before the mortgage was recorded.any inference regarding the time of attachment would thus be dictum.
finally,we note that our opinion in international marine towing southern leasing partners,cir implies in several places that the breach of the charter gives rise to the maritime lien.see,id.at iii.maritime liens arising from breach of the charter party id.at the clause does not speak to the issue of liens created by the owner breach.we also note,however,that international marine towing only discussed the existence of the maritime lien and declined to go any further.id.at.as with rainbow line and cardinal shipping,this court did not have before it the question we consider today.therefore,while we were apparently under the impression that breach of charter confers a maritime lien at the moment of breach,we do think our passing dicta should lead us to disregard supreme court precedent.
some district courts have,of late,directly ruled on the question presented here.in kopac international,bold venture,the court held that a mortgage took priority over a lien for breach of charter because the mortgage w
