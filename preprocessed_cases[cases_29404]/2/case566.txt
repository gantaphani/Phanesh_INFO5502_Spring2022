melvin spears was injured while he was working aboard a derrick barge owned and operated by his employer,kajima engineering construction.spears applied for and apparently has received benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca he filed this action against kajima alleging he is a seaman entitled to recover damages under the jones act and general maritime law.he filed a first amended complaint further alleging he is entitled to recover damages under the lhwca,even if he does not meet the test for seaman status,because kajima breached its duty as a vessel owner not as spears employer to turn over a seaworthy barge to spears and others working on a waterfront construction project.the trial court granted kajima motions for summary adjudication and summary judgment.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
the following facts are undisputed.
on or about april,the international union of operating engineers,local dispatched spears to work for kajima as a heavy duty repairman on a job called the berth project.kajima was constructing a wharf at terminal island.spears reported for work at todd shipyards where a crew was refurbishing a derrick barge kajima owned,named the guy.the barge is approximately feet long and feet wide and has a clyde crane attached to it.during this mobilization phase of the project,the guy remained tied to a pier at todd shipyards.spears performed construction repair work on the barge,such as cutting and welding on the crane.he also assisted in running or changing the guy towing cables.
on or about may,a tugboat towed the guy to the waterfront construction site.none of kajima employees rode the tugboat or assisted in the movement of the guy from todd shipyards to the construction site.the site was located at the southwestern end of pier on terminal island.it was inside the breakwater in the los angeles harbor,over one and a half nautical miles from the open waters of the pacific ocean.according to spears,the guy was positioned between and yards off shore during this phase of the project.according to kajima and other members of the crew,the barge was never more than feet from shore.the crew took a boat to reach the guy and wore life vests while on board.the barge was exposed to vessel traffic,swells and wakes.
spears worked at the construction site when the crew was engaged in pile driving operations.he worked as a mechanic,responsible for maintenance and repair work on the guy and its equipment.he also assisted in pulling lines or,in other words,making fast and letting go lines to other barges which brought materials to the crew.he sometimes went on board the materials barges to assist in the transfer of equipment.he also did some work on land during this phase of the project.
spears did not consider himself to be a seaman while he was working aboard the guy.the members of the crew were all dispatched from unions,such as operating engineers and pile drivers unions.spears did not receive any training on what to do if a man went overboard,or the barge caught fire or there was bad weather.kajima refers to this type of training as perils of the sea training.
during the pile driving operations,the guy was secured by four anchors and a headline,which ran from the bow of the barge to an anchor on shore.the barge moved by fleeting on its anchor wires.to move the barge farther away from shore,the crew manipulated the winches to pull in on the stern anchor and let out on the bow anchor.occasionally tug crewmen repositioned the barge by moving its anchors one at a time.there also were times when a tugboat repositioned the barge.at all times when spears was aboard the guy,it was anchored to the harbor bottom and secured by a headline to shore.
spears sustained an injury on august,while he was working aboard the guy.that morning,the crew captain,raul contreras,commented the swing locks also referred to as the swing stops on the crane would have to be fixed.the crew had to disengage the swing locks in order to use the crane during pile driving operations.an mechanism was supposed to move the locks from the engaged to the disengaged position when the crane operator pushed a button.the crew had experienced problems with the locks sticking since the mobilization phase of the project.therefore,the crew had been using a sledgehammer to pound the locks and move them into the disengaged position.
spears told contreras he would inspect the locks when he had some time.later that morning,he decided to take a look.spears says he told contreras he was going up to inspect the locks and he expected contreras to notify the crane operator.contreras claims he did not hear spears say that.spears climbed up on top of the platform on the crane.apparently the crane operator did not know spears was there.while spears was inspecting the locks,the crane operator rotated the crane.two fingers on spears right hand were caught in a pinch point and amputated.
in july,spears filed this action against kajima.the original complaint alleges three causes of action,all based on the assumption spears meets the test for seaman status.the first cause of action for violation of the jones act alleges as a result of kajima negligence,the crane aboard the guy was dangerous,unsafe and hazardous to crew members and spears was injured because kajima failed to furnish him with a reasonably safe place to work.the second cause of action for maintenance and cure alleges after spears became disabled,kajima failed and refused to furnish spears all expenses of his maintenance and cure as required by law.the third cause of action for unseaworthiness alleges kajima breached its warranty and representation its vessels and their appurtenances were reasonably safe and seaworthy.
the parties conducted discovery.on august,kajima filed a motion for summary kajima argued the causes of action in the complaint fail because spears can not meet the test for seaman status set forth by the united states supreme court in chandris,latsis kajima argued spears is a mechanic,not a seaman,and the guy is a stationary work platform,not a vessel in navigation.kajima relied on deposition testimony from spears and other crew members and also submitted a declaration from john seery,the project manager on the berth project.
in opposition to the motion,spears argued he meets the test for seaman status because he is an experienced marine mechanic who performed deckhand duties aboard the guy.he also argued the guy is a vessel in navigation within the meaning of the supreme court test.spears relied on his own deposition testimony and that of other crew members.he also submitted his own declaration and that of his expert witness,captain mitchell stoller.
spears objected to seery declaration submitted by kajima on several grounds,including the declaration lacks foundation because seery was not regularly aboard the guy.kajima objected to spears declaration on the ground it contradicts his deposition testimony.kajima objected to stoller declaration on several grounds,including it states legal conclusions and lacks foundation.
before the hearing on kajima motion,the trial court granted spears request for leave to amend his complaint to state a fourth cause of action for vessel owner negligence under the lhwca this cause of action is not based on the assumption spears meets the test for seaman status.it is based on allegations kajima had constructive knowledge of the defective swing locks on the crane aboard the guy and was negligent in its capacity as a vessel owner in failing to turn over a seaworthy barge to spears and the others working on the project.
on october,the trial court heard kajima motion for summary on the three causes of action in the original complaint.in ruling on the parties evidentiary objections,the court overruled spears objections to seery declaration,sustained kajima objections to spears declaration to the extent that it contradicts spears deposition testimony and sustained kajima objections to stoller declaration as to statements based on inadequate foundation and as to conclusions of law.the court denied the summary judgment motion because it did not address the fourth cause of action in the first amended complaint and granted the summary adjudication motion as to the first,second and third causes of action.
on november,kajima filed a motion for summary judgment on the fourth cause of action for vessel owner negligence under the lhwca.kajima argued this cause of action fails because spears injury occurred when kajima was acting in its capacity as spears employer.kajima maintained spears was not injured as a proximate result of some breach which occurred when kajima was acting in its capacity as a vessel owner.therefore,kajima argued spears exclusive remedy for his injury is an application for workers compensation benefits under the lhwca.
spears opposed the motion,arguing the accident was not caused by negligence,but was caused by kajima failure in its capacity as a vessel owner to turn over a seaworthy barge.spears also argued,at the time of the accident,he was not a ship repairman excluded under lhwca from pursuing an action for vessel owner negligence.he claimed during the construction phase of the project his maintenance and repair duties were limited to routine maintenance on the vessel defective equipment and he was not authorized to perform actual repairs or refurbishing in connection with the defective vessel equipment.
the trial court heard and granted kajima summary judgment motion on the fourth cause of action 
discussion 
standard of review.
summary judgment is proper where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.in the trial court,once a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action 
ii.spears has not shown a triable issue of material fact on whether he meets the test for seaman status.
state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction in jones act,lhwca and general maritime law cases in deciding such cases,state courts apply federal substantive law 
spears does not dispute he can not recover damages based on his first three causes of action unless he meets the test for seaman status.in chandris,latsis,the united states supreme court set forth the applicable test t he essential requirements for seaman status are twofold.first,an employee duties must contribut e to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission second,a seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or to an identifiable group of vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.the seaman inquiry is a mixed question of law and fact,and it often will be inappropriate to take the question from the jury.nevertheless,summary judgment or a directed verdict is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.
spears and kajima focus on whether spears can satisfy the second prong of the chandris test.the purpose of this part of the test is to separate the maritime employees who are entitled to jones act protection from those workers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation,and therefore whose employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea.the cases interpreting the chandris test split the second prong into separate elements.we discuss first whether spears had a connection to a vessel in navigation and second whether the connection was substantial in duration and nature.
spears can not show he had a connection to a vessel in navigation.
a vessel is in navigation if it is engaged as an instrument of commerce and transportation on navigable waters.in support of its position the guy was not a vessel in navigation,kajima relies on digiovanni traylor brothers,in that case,the first circuit determined whether a spud barge qualified as a vessel in navigation.the barge was similar to the guy in material respects.it had no means of,except that positional movement could be achieved by manipulating its spud anchors.its current use was to float at the jamestown,rhode island,bridge,bearing a crane that was being used for bridge construction.the plaintiff,a member of a carpenter union,was responsible for handling the crane tag line.he also performed maintenance work and tended the barge lines.he was injured when he fell down on a supply barge while he was manipulating one of the spud barge lines.
the digiovanni court explained a worker becomes a seaman not by reason of the physical characteristics of the structure to which he is attached,but because its being operational in navigation exposes him to a seaman hazards.the court concluded if a barge,or other float purpose or primary business is not navigation or commerce,then workers assigned thereto for its shore enterprise are to be considered seaman only when it is in actual navigation or transit.the court found the spud barge was not a vessel in navigation the barge had transported nothing for a month since it left defendant headquarters in davisville.since then it was simply moved about the piers for working convenience,and at night for safety.this was hardly navigation or commerce,and did not diminish the primary nature of the platform shore use and purpose.citation.correspondingly,that plaintiff occasionally adjusted lines for pier movement and the rise and fall of the tides,did not expose him to the risks of a voyage.
in gipson kajima engineering and construction,the district court for the central district of california applied digiovanni primary purpose test in granting summary judgment in favor of kajima the plaintiff in that case was dispatched from a pile driver union to work for kajima on a bridge construction project.he performed some of his duties aboard a barge,which never left the job site although it moved around and between the two bridge footings as necessary to allow access to the cofferdams.the barge was always secured,even when it moved around the work site.the plaintiff never rode the barge to the site.instead,he moved about the work site by boat a skiff even though he could have accessed the barge by land.he was injured when a hose aboard the barge used for evacuating the cofferdams broke and fell on his leg finding the use of the barge was nearly identical to the use of the digiovanni barge,the district court concluded the barge was merely used as a work platform during the plaintiff connection to it,and,therefore,was not a vessel in navigation under the second prong of the chandris standard.
like the plaintiff in gipson,spears argues this case is similar to gizoni southwest marine,the plaintiff in that case was a rigging foreman employed by the defendant.he worked on the platforms supervising other riggers and riding the platforms as they were used to move equipment,materials,supplies,and vessel components around the shipyard and on to and off of vessels being repaired.he occasionally served as a lookout and gave maneuvering signals to the tugboat operator when the platforms were moved.he also received lines passed to the platforms by the ships crews to secure the platforms.he was injured when his foot broke through a thin wooden sheet covering a hole in the deck of a platform being used to transport a rudder from the shipyard to a floating.the ninth circuit reversed the summary judgment,finding a triable issue of material fact existed on whether the floating platforms qualified as vessels in navigation.the appellate court discussion on this issue was brief and the court did not set forth any standard for determining when a vessel is in navigation.
when the gizoni case came before the ninth circuit again after a jury trial,the court of appeals fo
