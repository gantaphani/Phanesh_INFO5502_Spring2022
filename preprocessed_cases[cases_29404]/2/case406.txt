dense fog off of point reyes,california,the foggiest point on the pacific coast.goodwin,point reyes visions.a covey of fishing vessels trolling for salmon in the fog.afternoon,july,eva danielsen departs san francisco loaded with cargo destined for portland.the eva danielsen is feet in length and has a dead weight of tons.among the covey of fishing vessels is the marja,owned and operated by brian stacy.at,the radar of the marja picks up the eva danielsen,one mile away,headed to the marja on a collision course.the marja signals the danger to the freighter.the eva danielsen avoids hitting the marja but comes close enough for stacy to hear her engine and machinery and to feel the vessel wake.she passes at close quarters.
having passed the marja,the eva danielsen collides with the buona madre.the collision destroys the fishing vessel and results in the death of her captain,paul alan wade.this lawsuit followed from these events.
proceedings 
brian stacy brought this suit against the owners and operators of the eva danielsen for the negligent infliction of emotional distress.stacy alleged that the freighter was proceeding at an unsafe speed without a proper lookout,proper radar equipment,or proper signals in violation of the international navigation rules act.stacy alleged that this action put him in grave and imminent risk of death or great bodily harm,impacting him emotionally so that he could not work and needed psychiatric help.
on motion of the defendants,the district court dismissed stacy first amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action.the court stated 
the court concludes that,because very few jurisdictions employ a zone of danger test that lacks a witnessed harm requirement,even if a maritime negligent infliction of emotional distress nied claim may be brought under a zone of danger theory,the claim must be premised on the plaintiff having experienced a psychic injury by witnessing another being seriously injured or killed,chan soc y expeditions,cir emphasis omitted,while simultaneously being threatened with physical injury to him or herself.the court will thus evaluate plaintiff allegation of nied under chan formulation of the zone of danger test.
stacy appeals.
jurisdiction is based on federal maritime jurisdiction of torts committed on the high seas.we disregard as erroneous and irrelevant stacy alternative jurisdictional theory of diversity of citizenship.
we review de novo the dismissal.barker riverside county office of,cir.we accept as true facts alleged and draw inferences from them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.the sufficiency of the complaint is governed by the general maritime law of the united states.chan soc y expeditions,cir.the federal standard for the negligent infliction of emotional distress is provided by consolidated rail gottshall.
under this test,applicable in the maritime jurisdiction of the united states,a tort is committed by a defendant subjecting a plaintiff to emotional harm within the zone of danger created by the conduct of the defendant.id.in gottshall,the supreme court held that the zone of danger test allowed recovery for those plaintiffs who sustain a physical impact as a result of a defendant negligent conduct,or who are placed in immediate risk of physical harm by that conduct.id.the supreme court went on to quote a law review article exposition that is,those within the zone of danger of physical impact can recover for fright,and those outside of it can not.id.at quoting richard pearson,liability to bystanders for negligently inflicted emotional harm.
stacy alleged that he was within the zone of danger and that he suffered emotional distress from the fright caused by the negligent action of the defendants.nothing more was required to assert a cause of action cognizable under maritime law 
the supreme court has not abandoned its statement of the tort inflicted by creating a zone of danger.commuter buckley,immediate risk of physical harm created by the defendant conduct norfolk ry.ayers,those who escaped instant physical harm,but were within the zone of danger of physical impact.as would be expected,the ninth circuit has followed this standard.rivera passenger,cir.
the dissent cites cases in which various state courts defined the zone of danger by reference to the plaintiff being the witness of an accident to someone else.gottshall cited those cases.it did not endorse them.gottshall explicitly stated that the zone included a plaintiff placed in immediate risk of physical harm.
chan tells us how we have maritime jurisdiction of a claim for the tortious infliction of emotional injury.it is otherwise not instructive here.judge goodwin,writing for the panel in chan,stated at issue here is the psychic injury that comes from witnessing another being seriously injured or killed.at emphasis omitted.after setting out its understanding of the various tests for the tort at issue,the court declared it is clear that we need not decide which test to adopt today to decide this appeal.none of these theories allows recovery for emotional distress when the plaintiff was not present at the accident scene.id.at.
nothing in chan addresses a claim of emotional damages by a person directly endangered by a vessel.nothing in chan purports to refine or reject the teaching of the supreme court in gottshall.nothing in chan is relevant to the adequacy of stacy complaint.
for these reasons,the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
the majority dramatic rendering of the events that led to the tragic death of plaintiff brian stacy fellow fisherman,paul wade,omits certain important facts.the majority also refuses to follow binding circuit precedent,chan society expeditions,cir,in which a panel of this court defined the contours of the zone of danger test for claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress nied under general maritime law,and announced a formulation of that test which is well grounded in state common law,appropriate to the maritime context,and consistent with supreme court precedent regarding claims of nied under federal common law.id.at.
under the chan formulation of the zone of danger is the only one of the three major common law tests defining the class of plaintiffs who can recover damages for nied that even arguably applies in this of damages for nied is allowed without proof of any physical impact or injury to the plaintiff,so long as he or she witnessed peril or harm to another,and was also threatened with physical harm as a consequence of the defendant negligence.id.at.i believe we are bound by chan,and that stacy has not stated and can not state a claim for nied under the chan zone of danger test.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
first the material facts of this case,as alleged in stacy first amended complaint on the afternoon of july,stacy was alone on his commercial fishing vessel,the marja,fishing for salmon in the waters off point reyes national seashore just outside of the san francisco bay.stacy had his trolling gear deployed,which restricted maneuverability,and was underway at a speed of approximately knots.other vessels,including wade buona madre,were fishing nearby.dense fog restricted visibility in the area to near zero.
at about the same time,a commercial freighter named eva was owned and operated by san francisco,bound for portland,oregon.at approximately,the eva danielsen entered the fishing grounds,traveling at excessive speed,without appropriate lookouts,without sounding proper signals,without keeping proper radar watch,and otherwise proceeding in violation of international navigation rules that govern vessel traffic in the area.
using radar,stacy observed that the eva danielsen was within one mile of his vessel and appeared to be on a collision course.he established radio contact with the eva danielsen,which subsequently altered its course to avoid stacy vessel.again using radar,stacy watched as the eva danielsen passed by his vessel and continued on into the rest of the fishing fleet.the fog was too dense for him to actually see the ship,but stacy felt the eva danielsen wake and heard its engine as it passed at close quarters.
although the eva danielsen avoided stacy vessel,it collided with the buona madre.stacy alleges that the buona madre was near the marja at the time of the collision,but he does not alleged that he saw,heard,felt,or otherwise perceived the collision contemporaneously with its occurrence.
the eva danielsen reported a collision to the coast guard by radio,and conducted a brief search.following this report,stacy proceeded north of his position to assist in the search for persons in the water.during this period,stacy heard radio traffic expressing a belief that it was his vessel,the marja,that was run down by the eva danielsen.stacy advised all concerned that he was safe,and that the marja had not been struck by the freighter.following this report,the search was suspended and stacy resumed fishing.
it was not until four days later,on or about july,that stacy learned from other fishermen that the buona madre had been run down by the eva danielsen,and that its captain,wade,had died after the collision.stacy also learned that wade had been alive after the collision,floating in the water near where stacy had been fishing.there is no indication that stacy knew wade.nor is there any allegation that stacy knew the buona madre was among the vessels in the fishing grounds on the fateful day as the eva danielsen passed through.
stacy filed his complaint against the owners and operators of the eva danielsen in federal court,alleging a single claim for nied under general maritime law.stacy alleged that,as a result of the events described in his complaint,he was placed in grave and imminent risk of death or great bodily harm,and as a result suffered and continues to suffer great physical,mental,and nervous pain and suffering,stress and anxiety.he further alleges that he was required to and did employ physicians and surgeons to examine,treat and care for him,and that he was also prevented from attending to his usual occupation and thereby has lost earnings and benefits.
relying on chan,the district court acknowledged that a claim for nied is cognizable under maritime law,but it nevertheless granted the appellees motion to dismiss stacy complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.after finding both the physical impact test and the relative bystander rule inapplicable in the context of this case,the district court carefully considered whether stacy might be able to state a claim under the zone of danger theory as articulated in chan.faithfully applying the limiting test announced by this court in chan,the district court concluded that he could not.citing chan,at,the district court explained 
b ecause very few jurisdictions employ a zone of danger test that lacks a witnessed harm requirement,even if a maritime nied claim may be brought under a zone of danger theory,the claim must be premised on the plaintiff having experienced a psychic injury by witnessing another being seriously injured or killed,while simultaneously being threatened with physical injury to him or herself.
the district court granted stacy leave to amend his complaint,but stacy declined.accordingly,the district court dismissed his complaint with prejudice.
in chan,a panel of this court was called upon to decide whether a claim for damages for nied is cognizable under general maritime law,and,if so,to determine the threshold standard for such claims under federal common law.at.a brief synopsis of the facts and holding of chan is called for here,as the majority suggests the zone of danger test adopted by the panel in that case was mere dictum,or is somehow inapposite in the factual circumstances of this case.
in chan,two members of the chan family,father benny and daughter samantha,were injured during a cruise on a ship chartered by the father employer,society expeditions.at.on the second day of the cruise,benny and samantha were among a group of passengers being ferried from the ship by an inflatable raft to a coral atoll when the raft turned broadside to a wave and capsized.id.at.benny and samantha were thrown into the surf,and the pilot of the raft and another passenger died in the capsizing.id.benny sustained severe brain and head injuries,as well as other physical injuries,and samantha sustained both physical and emotional injuries.id.
the chans filed a complaint against the owners of the ship and society expeditions,including claims seeking damages for emotional distress under general maritime law on behalf of samantha,her two siblings who were not with the family on the cruise,and her mother,victoria.citing service gaudet,and cook ross island sand gravel,cir,the district court in chan dismissed all of the emotional distress claims,concluding that the mental pain and anguish of an injured party family is not compensable in an action under general maritime law.at.
while the chan case was pending on appeal,the supreme court decided consolidated rail gottshall,and for the first time recognized a federal common law claim for that case for a railroad worker subject to the federal employers liability act,fela.gottshall,at.however,because it was concerned that recognition of such claims poses the very real possibility of nearly infinite and unpredictable liability for defendants,the supreme court evaluated the three major theories that limit the class of plaintiffs who can recover damages for nied under state common,the physical impact test,the zone of danger test,and the relative bystander test.id.at.after a lengthy discussion of the evolution of the nied tort and the policy underpinnings of the three common law tests,the supreme court adopted the zone of danger test for nied claims brought pursuant to fela.id.at.
as articulated by the supreme court in gottshall,recovery of damages for nied is available under the zone of danger test to those plaintiffs who sustain a physical impact as a result of a defendant negligent conduct,or who are placed in immediate risk of physical harm by that conduct.the court explained that is was adopting that test because it is the one that best harmonizes the statute central focus on physical perils,its intent to encourage employers to improve safety measures in order to avoid such claims and to provide compensation for injuries and death caused by the physical dangers of railroad work,and its broad remedial goals,with the countervailing policy concerns about the potential for a flood of trivial suits,the possibility of fraudulent claims that are difficult for judges and juries to detect,and the specter of unlimited and unpredictable liability.id.at.
following the lead of gottshall,the chan panel held that a claim for nied is cognizable under general maritime law.at.but,contrary to the majority assertion,that is not all the chan panel decided.declaring that w e next must decide the threshold standard that must be met by plaintiffs bringing claims for nied under general maritime law,the chan panel looked to state common law,as instructed by the supreme court in gottshall,and proceeded to discuss the same three theories limiting recovery for nied identified by the supreme court in gottshall.at.
in describing the most restrictive theory,the physical injury or impact test,the chan panel stated that it allows a plaintiff to recover emotional distress damages only if he or she suffers an accompanying physical injury or contact.id.at citing plaisance texaco,cir,aff on other grounds,cir,cert.denied.turning to the next most restrictive theory,the chan panel articulated the zone of danger doctrine as follows 
under the zone of danger doctrine,plaintiff may recover even though there is no physical contact,so long as the plaintiff witnesses peril or harm to another and is also threatened with physical harm as a consequence of the defendant negligence.
at citing plaisance,at,and nelsen research of of.hawaii.finally,the chan panel described what it called the bystander proximity test for nied as follows 
the bystander proximity rule permits recovery,even if one is not in the zone of danger,provided the complainant is physically near the scene of the accident personally observes the accident and is closely related to the victim.
at citing dillon legg,cal d.
after outlining the three tests,the chan panel decided that it did not need to select one of the common law limiting tests for nied to be controlling in all cases arising in the maritime the gottshall court had done in the fela none of those theories would allow recovery by the two chan children who were not physically present on the cruise with their parents and samantha,and because the facts alleged as to samantha would allow her to recover under all three of the theories.at.what the majority overlooks in suggesting that the zone of danger theory articulated in chan is mere dictum,however,is that the panel in that case apparently believed it was necessary to define the legal contours of a claim of nied under each of the three theories,to be applied by the district court as to victoria chan nied claim after affording her a chance to amend her complaint in light of the panel decision.id.thus,i believe the zone of danger test articulated in chan has binding precedential force in this circuit,provides the rule of decision for this case,and we are not free to ignore it.see miller gammie,cir en banc 
the majority implies,however,that the chan panel formulation of the zone of danger test is inconsistent with the test adopted by the supreme court in gottshall and subsequently applied by the court to nied claims arising in fela cases,albeit in very different factual contexts.see.commuter buckley,no right to recover damages for fear of cancer under zone of danger test for nied based on mere exposure to asbestos without evidence of any physical impact,that the plaintiff has developed disease norfolk ry.ayers,recovery allowed under zone of danger test for nied where the plaintiff has been diagnosed with asbestosis,and damages for fear of cancer are alleged as part of the pain and suffering associated with existing disease.for reasons i will explain,i disagree.
ignoring the reasoning in justice thomas majority opinion in gottshall,the majority here quotes only a preliminary statement of the zone of danger test recited by the gottshall court,as follows 
perhaps based on the realization that a near miss may be as frightening as a direct hit,the zone of danger test limits recovery for emotional injury to those plaintiffs who sustain a physical impact as a result of a defendant negligent conduct,or who are placed in immediate risk of physical harm by that conduct.that is,those within the zone of danger of physical impact can recover for fright,and those outside of it can not.
at quoting pearson,liability to bystanders for negligently inflicted emotional comment on the nature of arbitrary rules,emphasis added.based upon a more careful reading of gottshall,however,i believe it is reasonable to conclude that the chan test is consistent with gottshall,at least in cases in which the plaintiff alleges a claim for as the one stacy on a threat of immediate traumatic harm which does not result in any actual physical impact or injury.see ayers,at gottshall and buckley describe two types of claim for negligently inflicted emotional distress claims not provoked by any physical impact or injury,for which recovery is sharply circumscribed by the test and claims for emotional distress brought on by a physical injury,for which pain and suffering recovery has been traditionally permitted.
first,there are the facts of gottshall,on the basis of which the supreme court found a potentially viable claim for nied for one of the plaintiffs,gottshall,but not for the other,carlisle.gottshall alleged that he suffered stress disorder as a result of seeing and being forced to participate in the events surrounding the collapse and death of his close friend and,richard johns,while they were working together on a railroad crew at a secluded job site,on an extremely hot and humid day,at an unreasonably fast pace,without any means of summoning emergency medical services after johns suffered an apparent heart attack.id.at.
carlisle,on the other hand,alleged a claim for nied based on his own stress from working as a train dispatcher,and later as a trainmaster,who was responsible for ensuring the safe and timely movement of passengers and cargo under very difficult working aging railstock and outdated equipment,and reductions in the work force that required him to take on additional duties and to work extremely long,erratic caused him to experience insomnia,headaches,depression,weight loss,and eventually a nervous breakdown.id.at.
in rejecting the more flexible and expansive foreseeability test the third circuit applied to evaluate gottshall and carlisle claims for nied,and specifically discussing the need to limit the class of plaintiffs eligible for recovery of damages,the supreme court made the following observations regarding gottshall claim 
if emotional injury to gottshall was foreseeable to conrail,such injury to the other seven members of his work crew was also foreseeable.because one need not witness an accident to suffer emotional injury therefrom,however,the potential liability would not necessarily have to end there any conrail employees who heard or read about the events surrounding johns death could also foreseeably have suffered emotional injury as a result.of course,not all of these workers would have been as traumatized by the tragedy as was gottshall,but many could have been.under the third circuit standard,conrail thus could face the potential of unpredictable liability to a large number of employees far removed from the scene of the allegedly negligent conduct that led to johns death.
at thus,while not explicitly requiring that a railroad worker had to have witnessed his death in order to bring a claim for nied,this passage suggests that the supreme court intended to limit recovery to,at most,those members of the work crew who were working under the same conditions,were at the scene when johns died,and suffered serious emotional injuries as a result of the negligent conduct of their employer that caused johns death.
there are also several annotations that compile the numerous state and federal cases on nied,and support the district court observation that in nearly all of the cases the gottshall court cited as using the zone of danger test,the plaintiffs sought to recover for nied on the basis that they had witnessed another person be injured.see,recovery under state law for negligent infliction of emotional distress due to witnessing injury to another where bystander plaintiff must suffer physical impact or be in zone of danger,recovery for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress under jones act appx.or under federal employers liability act et,fed.indeed,some of the cases cited by the gottshall court explicitly formulate the zone of danger test as including a witnessed harm,a requirement that the plaintiff witnessed harm to another.see,asaro cardinal glennon mem l,holding that a plaintiff states a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress upon injury to a third person only upon a showing that the defendant should have realized that his conduct involved an unreasonable risk to the plaintiff,that plaintiff was present at the scene of an injury producing,sudden event,and that plaintiff was in the zone of danger,placed in a reasonable fear of physical injury to his or her own person emphasis added rickey,at u nder the zone of danger rule,a bystander who is in a zone of physical danger and who,because of the defendant negligence,has reasonable fear for his own safety is given a right of action for physical injury or illness resulting from emotional distress.this rule does not require that the bystander suffer a physical impact or injury at the time of the negligent act,but it does require that he must have been in such proximity to the accident in which the direct victim was physically injured that there was a high risk to him of physical impact.emphasis added in light of this sizeable body of common law authority,i would conclude that the chan panel formulation of the zone of danger test,requiring the plaintiff to prove that he witnessed harm or peril to another,is consistent with both the holding an
