this appeal presents the question whether title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada applies to cruise ships.see et.as a matter of first impression in this circuit,we hold that it does not.we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court interlocutory orders that formed the basis of this b appeal.
background 
at various times in and,the plaintiffs took cruises on norwegian cruise line ncl ships,the norwegian sea and the norwegian star.the cruises originated in the port of houston,texas,and traveled to foreign ports of call.both ships sail under the bahamian flag.afterwards,the plaintiffs filed suit asserting that they were discriminated against in violation of title iii of the ada.
the plaintiffs comprise disabled plaintiffs and companion plaintiffs.the disabled plaintiffs allege that physical barriers on the ships denied them access to emergency evacuation equipment and emergency programs facilities such as public restrooms,restaurants,swimming pools,and elevators and cabins with a balcony or a window.the disabled plaintiffs also allege that ncl charged them a premium for use of the four cabins and the assistance of crew members.the companion plaintiffs allege that they were discriminated against and denied access to the ships facilities and amenities because of their known association with the disabled plaintiffs.
alleging their intent to take future ncl cruises,the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and reasonable attorneys fees and costs.more specifically,the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief requiring ncl to remove certain barriers,some temporary and some permanent,that obstructed their access to the ships facilities.ncl moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.b.after considering the motion,the district court ruled that cruise ships are subject to title iii of the ada dismissed the plaintiffs claim concerning removal of physical barriers because the federal government failed to promulgate the necessary regulations and ruled that the companion plaintiffs stated a claim for associational discrimination the district court certified the matter for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,and we accepted the certification 
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court grant or denial of a federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss.see frank delta airlines,cir.the complaint must be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff,and all the facts pleaded in the complaint must be taken as true to determine whether the plaintiff has stated a valid claim for relief.haynes prudential health care,cir citations and quotation omitted.the dismissal will be upheld only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.id.the district court interpretation of a statute,the primary issue in this case,is also subject to de novo review.lara cinemark usa,cir.
iii.discussion 
ncl challenges the district court conclusion that title iii of the ada applies to cruise ships.ncl asserts that there is no evidence that congress intended title iii to apply to vessels or that congress even considered the issue.although,as will be seen,arguments can be made both ways concerning the interpretation of congressional intent,we are persuaded that ncl is correct.
title iii of the ada provides that n o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.a.title iii also prohibits discrimination against disabled individuals on specified public transportation services provided by a private entity that is primarily engaged in the business of transporting people and whose operations affect commerce.a.both public accommodations and specified public transportation services are subject to the barrier removal requirements of title iii.see b a c 
it is settled that a ship voluntarily entering the territorial limits of another country subjects itself to the laws and jurisdiction of that country.benz compania naviera hidalgo,d citing wildenhus case.however,the local sovereign is under no obligation to exercise its authority to the outer limits of its jurisdictional reach.benz,at.since the exercise of that jurisdiction is not mandatory but discretionary,the supreme court held,to apply domestic law to foreign vessels entering united states waters,there must be present the affirmative intention of the congress clearly expressed.id.at.absent an affirmative intention,such appeal should be directed to the congress rather than the courts.id.
in benz,the supreme court considered whether the labor management relations act of lmra applied to a dispute involving a foreign ship operated entirely by foreign seamen under foreign articles while the vessel is temporarily in an american port.at.the court answered that question in the negative.id.if congress had so chosen,it could have made the act applicable to wage disputes arising on foreign vessels between nationals of other countries when the vessel comes within its territorial waters.id.at.but given the dearth of legislative history evincing congress intent to apply the lmra to vessels,id.at,the court concluded that congress had not fashion ed itself to resolve labor disputes between nationals of other countries operating ships under foreign laws.id.at.
likewise,in mcculloch sociedad nacional de marineros de honduras,d,which addressed whether the national labor relations act nlra applied to the maritime operations of ships employing alien seamen,id.at,the court again emphasized that the decisive question was not whether congress had the power to apply the nlra to ships,but whether congress had chosen to do so.see id.at.the mcculloch plaintiffs asserted that their case,unlike benz,involved a fleet of vessels not temporarily in the united states waters but operating in a regular course of trade between foreign ports and those of the united states.mcculloch,at.the court found the distinction unavailing.
as in benz,the mcculloch plaintiffs were unable to point to any specific language in the act itself or in its extensive legislative history that reflect ed such a congressional intent.mcculloch,at.accordingly,the court held that the nlra did not apply to ships,and it reiterated that the plaintiffs should petition to the congress rather than to us.id.at.citation omitted.
eeoc arabian american oil,d aramco,amplifies the supreme court adherence to established principles of statutory construction and fundamental tenets of international law.in aramco,the court considered whether title vii applied extraterritorially to regulate the employment practices of united states employers who employ united states citizens abroad.id.at.the court stated that i t is a longstanding principle of american law that legislation of congress,unless contrary intent appears,is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.id.at.citations and quotations omitted.it serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.id.citing mcculloch,at.therefore,w e assume that congress legislates against the backdrop of the presumption against extraterritoriality.aramco,at.quoting benz requirement of clear expression by congress,at.
the eeoc,relying on two statutory provisions,contended that congress did intend for title vii to apply abroad.first,the eeoc argued that title vii definitions of employer and commerce were sufficiently broad to include american companies located beyond the united states.despite conflicting plausible interpretations of the relevant language,the court found that it need not choose between these competing interpretations as we would be required to do in the absence of the presumption against extraterritorial application.aramco,at.moreover,under the eeoc interpretation,t he intent of congress as to the extraterritorial application of this statute must be deduced by inference from boilerplate language which can be found in any number of congressional acts,none of which have ever been held to apply overseas.id.at.citing americans with disabilities act of,et other citations omitted.
second,the court rejected the contention that the alien exemption provision created a negative inference supporting application of title vii abroad.without clearer evidence of congressional intent to do so than is contained in the clause,we are not willing to ascribe to that body a policy which would raise difficult issues of international law by imposing this country regime upon foreign corporations operating in foreign commerce.aramco,at.
the court also found that other aspects of title vii belied the eeoc position.title vii only addressed issues of state sovereignty,and congress failed to provide any mechanisms for the statute overseas enforcement.moreover,unlike the age discrimination in employment act adea,a parallel statute,congress did not address conflicts with laws of other nations 
together,benz and mcculloch prohibit united states courts from applying domestic statutes to ships without specific evidence of congressional intent.under the supreme court framework,congress may enact legislation that governs cruise ships operating within united states waters,but it must clearly indicate its intention to do so.see benz,at.aramco applies the same requirement to gauge the extraterritorial application of statutes.
there is no indication,either in the statutory text or in the ada extensive legislative history,that congress intended title iii to apply to cruise ships.if congress had so intended,it would have addressed the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.aramco,at.congress silence can not be read to express an intent to legislate where issues touching on other nations sovereignty are involved 
furthermore,an act of congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations,if any other possible construction remains.murray v.the schooner charming betsy,cranch.see also weinberger rossi,d sampson federal republic of germany,cir recognizing that the charming betsy canon has traditionally justified a narrow interpretation of ambiguous legislation to avoid violations of international law.thus b ecause congress legislates against the backdrop that includes those international norms that guide comity analysis,absent a contrary legislative direction the doctrine may properly be used to interpret any statute.in re maxwell communication,cir.because the title iii barrier removal provisions may govern the finest details of maritime architecture in the quest to render ships fully accessible to disabled passengers,those provisions pose a stark likelihood of conflicts with the standards set out in the international convention for safety of life at sea solas therefore,as a matter of statutory construction,title iii must be narrowly construed in a manner that avoids these potential conflicts.see trans world airlines,franklin mint,d there is,first,a firm and obviously sound canon of construction against finding an implicit repeal of a treaty in ambiguous congressional action.
nevertheless,the plaintiffs offer several.first,the plaintiffs contend that because the ada applies to cruise ships generally,it presumptively applies to cruise ships,absent a specific exemption.plaintiffs rely primarily on cunard mellon,to support this argument 
in cunard,the supreme court held that the national prohibition act,enacted to enforce the eighteenth amendment,applied to vessels in united states ports.id.at.based on the statute terms,the court found that congress intended the act to be operative throughout the territorial limits of the united states including all merchant vessels,whether foreign or domestic,when within those limits.id.at.the court noted that the act contains no exception of ships in either class and the terms in which it is couched indicate that none is intended.id.at.any exception for ships,the court said,would defeat the attainment of the act obvious prevent the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage.see.last,the act specific exemption for transportation of liquor through the panama canal expressed congress intent to apply the statute to all vessels within the territorial waters of the united states.id.at.
cunard does not control.first,the supreme court premised cunard on the reach of the eighteenth amendment and its enforcing statute on specific inferences from the panama canal provision.second,unlike benz,mcculloch,and aramco,cunard did not involve the possibility of extraterritorial application,but instead regulated only the commercial transport of liquor into united states ports.as the court noted,the national prohibition act discloses that it is intended only to enforce the eighteenth amendment and limits its field of operation,like that of the amendment,to the territorial limits of the united states.cunard,at.
this second distinction is significant.extraterritorial application of any statute is impermissible absent the affirmative intention of the congress clearly expressed.benz at.aramco,at.smith united states,d recognizing that the presumption is rooted in a number of considerations,not the least of which is the commonsense notion that congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.this rule serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.aramco,at.
in the present case,many of the structural changes required to comply with title iii would be permanent,investing the statute with extraterritorial application as soon as the cruise ships leave domestic waters.the plaintiffs insist,however,that title iii need not be enforced beyond united states waters.they argue that this suit seeks enforcement within the united states only,or in the alternative,that courts can choose to enforce those aspects of title iii that do not conflict with international law or are not permanent in nature.this approach is inconsistent with the supreme court pronouncements in benz,mcculloch,and aramco.in none of those cases did the court examine each proposed application of domestic law to determine whether it might conflict with other nations laws.whether title iii barrier removal provision,if applied to cruise ships,would have extraterritorial impact is a matter of statutory construction,not a inquiry.thus,potential conflicts with transnational or international law mandate that we construe the statute narrowly to avoid international discord 
the plaintiffs next rely upon the eleventh circuit decision in stevens premier cruises,cir,reh g denied,cir.in stevens,the court found that title iii applies to those aspects of cruise ships restaurants,retail stores,health spas,that qualify as public accommodations.id.at.further,since congress did not exclude coverage of cruise ships while in domestic waters,the court reasoned that the ada must apply to them.in this connection,the court viewed aramco presumption against extraterritorial application of domestic law as inapposite,because it did not consider title iii requirements to apply outside united states waters.id.at 
stevens limited the benz and mcculloch presumption against application of american law strictly to the internal management and affairs,specifically relations,of a ship.given congress intent to apply title iii broadly,the stevens court concluded instead that cunard controlled.
with due respect,we find stevens unpersuasive.in stevens,the court maintained that congress silence as to cruise ships meant not only that title iii applied to cruise ships,a contention we do not comment upon,but that the coverage of cruise ships necessarily implied coverage of cruise ships.this latter inference disregards the supreme court admonition that before applying domestic law in the delicate field of international relations,congress must clearly express its intent.mcculloch,at.
that congress intended title iii to have broad reach is insufficient to warrant application to cruise ships.title vii and the adea,remedial statutes comparable in breadth and purpose to the ada,were also intended to have broad reach.see miller pub.storage,cir recognizing that the ada is part of the same broad remedial framework as th
