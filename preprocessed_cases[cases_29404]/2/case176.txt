the central america,loaded with tons of gold en route from san francisco to new york,sank in a hurricane off the coast of south carolina in.columbus america discovery group columbus america,acting as the agent for recovery limited partnership recovery limited,discovered the wreck in the,and the district court subsequently granted columbus america salvage rights.
for over two decades,richard robol and robol law office,llc collectively,robol represented columbus america in the proceedings to establish its salvage rights.during the same period,robol also defended columbus america,recovery limited,and several other related business entities,including ezra,against claims made by others for portions of the gold recovered from the sunken vessel.in addition,robol leased commercial property in columbus,ohio,to ezra,where documents relating to the salvage operation were stored.
in june,an ohio court placed several of the companies into receivership and ordered the receiver to collect their property from all persons holding such property,including the companies attorneys.the receiver gave notice of the order to robol,and thereafter in july and august robol turned over file cabinets of materials that he had accumulated as counsel and landlord.robol also encouraged milton butterworth,an officer of columbus america,to turn over to the receiver photographs,videos,and other materials related to the salvage of the central america.
after robol withdrew as counsel for the companies,he filed a claim in this in rem admiralty action to obtain a salvage award for himself,alleging that he had provided voluntary assistance to the receiver in turning over files and documents related to the salvage operation,which proved useful in the continuing salvage of the sunken vessel.
the district court dismissed robol claim for failure to state a claim,concluding that robol had been obligated to return the files and documents to his former clients under the applicable rules of professional responsibility and principles of agency law and therefore that his act of returning the materials to his former clients was not a voluntary act,as would be required for him to obtain a salvage award.
we agree with the district court and affirm.
in the mid,thomas thompson undertook to locate the wreck of the central america and to recover its cargo of gold,valued at approximately million in.to that end,he set up a series of related business entities,including recovery limited,which he created to finance the project columbus america,which he formed to locate and salvage the ship on recovery limited behalf columbus exploration,llc,which he set up to market the recovered gold and ezra,which he set up to pay labor costs associated with recovery limited employees and consultants.
after several years of searching,columbus america located the wrecked ship miles off the coast of south carolina.in,with robol as counsel of record,it commenced this in rem action in admiralty,and the district court subsequently granted columbus america salvage rights in the ship and its cargo.continuously from until,columbus america conducted salvage operations,recovering large amounts of gold and other artifacts.following two trials and two appeals,we determined in that columbus america was entitled to a salvage award of of the value of the gold and artifacts recovered and that various insurance companies that had paid claims for portions of the lost gold were entitled to the remainder.see columbus am.discovery grp.atl.mut.ins,cir.columbus america and the insurance companies thereafter divided the treasure in specie,and,in july,the district court closed the case.
several years later,minority investors and former employees who had assisted in locating the central america and recovering its cargo initiated legal actions in ohio state court against thompson and the related business entities to obtain portions of the award.robol represented all of the defendants,including recovery limited,in these actions until he withdrew as counsel in june.during the course of the proceedings,which were consolidated and removed to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,it was discovered that gold coins belonging to the related business entities had disappeared.see williamson recovery,cir.the district court ordered thompson to appear to explain the coins whereabouts,but thompson failed to do so,and,in august,the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest.thompson then fled and became a fugitive.in april,after the marshals service finally located and arrested thompson in a hotel room in florida,he pleaded guilty to criminal contempt for failing to appear in federal court.his assistant later testified that thompson had smuggled the missing gold coins to belize.
because of thompson disappearance,the court of common pleas of franklin county,ohio,placed recovery limited and columbus exploration into receivership in june,appointing ira kane as the receiver.by order dated june,the court directed a ny person who has or,as of the time of the filing of this entry,had any fiduciary duty towards the companies,by virtue of being either an officer,former officer,or person holding any asset,object or thing that is,or at the time of the filing of this entry was,the property of the companies,or either of them,to surrender to and transfer to said receiver any and all such property.the court also directed the receiver to conduct such maritime operations that are designed to make a positive financial return for the companies.
pursuant to the court order,the receiver served notice on all of the companies attorneys,including robol,to turn over all company files and other property in their possession.williamson recovery,cv,wl,at may,appeal docketed,cir.thereafter,during the period between july and august,the receiver retrieved file cabinets of records from robol that had been stored at robol property at west sixth avenue in columbus,ohio the west sixth avenue property,a portion of which robol had leased to ezra.id.
before robol turned over the records to the receiver,the ohio district court had ordered robol and his clients to provide the plaintiffs accountant with various categories of documents,including inventories of the recovered gold and records of downstream sales of the gold,which the accountant needed in order to prepare a report on the financial condition of the.williamson,wl,at.because the court found that robol clients had repeatedly failed in good faith to comply with its order,it twice held them in contempt.id.robol similarly failed to turn over inventories and records of downstream sales that he had possessed,repeatedly telling the court incorrectly that he had already provided all of the relevant documents in his possession,when,in fact,there were multiple unproduced documents among the files that the receiver retrieved from robol in july and august.id.at.the ohio district court consequently granted the plaintiffs motion for sanctions,finding that robol had acted in bad faith and additionally that his conduct rose beyond mere bad faith to the level of fraud on the court.id.at.the court ordered robol to reimburse the parties for the costs incurred in discovering the missing inventories,and the amount expended in prosecuting the motion.id.at.
also in furtherance of the ohio court of common pleas june,receivership order,recovery limited,through the receiver,resumed salvage operations in the central america.between january and may,recovery limited filed motions in this in rem action,which had been closed for nearly years,seeking to reopen the case,to substitute it for columbus america as the real party in interest,and to declare that it was the legal owner of salvage rights in the central america.recovery limited also commenced a separate in rem action against the wreck and its cargo to declare itself the salvor for future salvage operations and to obtain a salvage award for all newly recovered gold and artifacts.the district court entered orders dated july,reopening this in rem action,granting recovery limited motion to substitute itself as the salvor,and consolidating the two in rem actions under the original action case number.at approximately the same time,on july,the court granted robol motion to withdraw as counsel of record for columbus america.
robol now alleges that recovery limited and its related business entities owe him plus interest in unpaid legal fees and that ezra owes him in rent that it failed to pay for the west sixth avenue property.to recover these amounts,robol filed a verified proof of claim in the ohio receivership proceeding on january.
additionally,robol filed a verified statement of right,interest,and claim in this proceeding on june,seeking a salvage award from the continuing salvage operations on the ground that he aided and assisted in these salvage operations by voluntarily releasing possession of documents over which he had a retaining lien for attorneys fees and a property interest from ezra abandonment of them upon default of its lease.more specifically,he alleged that he assisted the salvage operation by returning to the receiver various maritime and navigational charts,maritime maps,locational data,documents,drawings,historical data and accounts,shipwreck research and analysis,photographs,video,and other materials that he had acquired through his roles as counsel and as landlord and by providing assistance in obtaining site photography and video footage held by butterworth.butterworth had served as columbus america director of photography during the early stages of the salvage operation and thereafter as the company vice president,acting president,and chief executive officer.robol alleged that this aid and assistance was voluntary and involved items in which he had control,dominion,lien rights,ownership,sic interests and that recovery limited utilized these materials in the salvage of the central america to the benefit of the salvage,thus entitling him to a salvage award.
recovery limited,by its receiver,filed a motion to dismiss robol claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that the claim was not in the nature of a claim for a salvage award and that,in any event,robol did not furnish his assistance voluntarily,as required to demonstrate a valid salvage claim.
by order dated august,the district court granted recovery limited motion and dismissed robol claim for a salvage award as a matter of law.the court concluded that robol,who was licensed to practice law in both virginia and ohio,had a duty under virginia rule of professional conduct e to supply the materials to recovery limited within a reasonable time of the termination of his representation of recovery limited or columbus america and therefore that his action was not voluntary.although the court rejected robol argument that it should apply ohio law,which,robol claimed,would have permitted him to assert a retaining lien over some of the materials as a result of unpaid legal fees,it nonetheless recognized that such a lien would not have permitted robol to use the materials for his own purposes,citing restatement third of agency,cmt.b.at best,the court said,robol might have an in personam claim for attorney fees or document storage fees.the court concluded further that the photographs and videos that butterworth provided to the receiver at robol urging had been prepared by butterworth during salvage operations as an employee of columbus america,the agent of recovery limited,and therefore that they belonged to recovery limited.
from the district court order dismissing robol claim,robol filed this appeal.
robol contends first that,in turning over to the receiver his former clients documents relating to the salvage of the central america,he provided voluntary assistance that proved useful in the renewed salvage operation,entitling him to a salvage award.a salvage award is,of course,compensation to persons by whose voluntary assistance a ship at sea or her cargo or both have been saved in whole or in part from impending sea peril,or in recovering such property from actual peril or loss,as in cases of shipwreck,derelict,or recapture.the sabine.emphasis added.thus,a valid salvage claim requires a s ervice voluntarily rendered when not required as an existing duty or from a special contract.id.emphasis added.as an initial matter,robol argues that,in rejecting the allegations of his verified statement of claim that his actions in turning over documents to the receiver were voluntary,the district court erred in failing to take his allegations as true,as required when ruling on a rule b motion.specifically,he maintains that the district court should not have discredited his allegation that his aid and assistance was voluntary inasmuch as he returned documents over which he had control,dominion,lien rights,ownership,sic interests because of his retaining lien for unpaid attorneys fees.
robol allegation of voluntariness,however,was no more than a legal argument that he was not required to return to his former clients documents over which he had a retaining lien and that his doing so was therefore voluntary.and the district court appropriately treated his legal argument as one that it could and indeed did resolve as a matter of law.relying on the existence of robol relationship,the district court concluded that robol had a preexisting duty to turn over the documents because the virginia rules of professional conduct preclude attorneys from exercising retaining liens.regardless of whether the district court was correct on that point,it is clear that the court was not rejecting an allegation of fact,but rather robol legal conclusion.of course,such legal conclusions are not entitled to the presumption of truth.see ashcroft iqbal,d t he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.
robol also contends that,in reaching the conclusion that his action was not voluntary,the district court inappropriately went beyond the four corners of his verified statement of claim because its allegations did not include the facts necessary for the court to reach that conclusion.the district court,however,did not go beyond the claim except to note that robol had been counsel of record for columbus america and recovery limited and therefore that he owed a duty to return the materials relating to the salvage operation to his former clients.robol can hardly dispute the court reliance on the fact that he was counsel of record,as that is not only part of the record in this case,but also part of the record in virtually every case relating to the salvage operation.courts are entitled to consider such matters of public record in relying on motions to dismiss.see charles alan wright et al,federal practice and procedure ed see also,walker kelly,cir holding that a federal court may consider documents from a prior state court proceeding in conjunction with a motion to dismiss.moreover,robol stated in his sworn opposition to recovery limited motion to dismiss that he served as counsel for columbus america discovery group,inc recovery limited partnership at various times from until and with respect to various matters.in the same document,he also acknowledged that at least some of the documents that he turned over to the receiver were the property of his clients in which he had asserted a retaining lien.the district court simply treated these matters as given and ruled as a matter of law that robol,as counsel for the entities,had an ethical duty to return the documents,notwithstanding any retaining lien that he claimed.accordingly,we reject robol claim that the district court failed to adhere to established principles for ruling on a rule b motion.
on the merits,robol contends that because he relinquished possession of the documents despite his retaining lien,his acts were voluntary,entitling him to a salvage award commensurate with the value of the documents to the continuing salvage operation.
modern standards of professional conduct,however,preclude robol from exercising a retaining lien in such a manner.the virginia rules of professional conduct obligate an attorney to return to a former client documents furnished by the client and attorney work product,whether or not the client has paid the fees and costs owe
