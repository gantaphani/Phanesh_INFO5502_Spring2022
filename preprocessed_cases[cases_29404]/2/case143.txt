mill transportation company mill appeals from a verdict,following a bench trial,of the united states district court for the southern district of new york william pauley iii,judge finding mill and plaintiff blue ocean lines blue ocean jointly and severally liable to project hope for vials of spoiled humulin,a type of insulin.see project hope ibn sina,d.
project hope initially contracted with blue ocean for transport of the humulin from winchester,virginia to cairo,egypt via the port of norfolk,virginia.blue ocean,in turn,subcontracted with mill for the overland portion of the transport in virginia and with united arab for the oceangoing leg of the transport.when mill transported the humulin at the wrong temperature,it spoiled.
on appeal,mill challenges on two grounds that part of the district court judgment making the damage award joint and several.first,mill argues that in imposing joint and several liability the district court improperly resorted to federal admiralty law,which permits joint and several awards in the normal course in cases involving multiple tortfeasors.second,mill argues that,in any event,project hope failed to assert direct claims against mill and can not look to it for recovery.
project hope,contending that the district court erred in relying on the replacement cost for the spoiled humulin to measure damages,in calculating the actual damage award,and in dismissing its claims against united arab shipping and its united states agent,united arab shipping agencies,collectively,united arab.
we hold that the district court did not err in allowing joint and several recovery against mill or in holding mill liable to project hope despite project hope failure to assert claims against mill directly.with respect to project hope,we hold both that the district court did not err in relying on the humulin replacement cost to measure project hope damages and that the district court properly dismissed project hope claims against united arab.however,because we find that the district court improperly calculated project hope actual loss,we vacate the damage award and remand the case to the district court for recalculation.
the judgment of the district court is thus affirmed in part,vacated in part and remanded for recalculation of damages.
background 
familiarity with the detailed factual account in the district court opinion is assumed.see project hope,d at.we recite only those facts relevant to the disposition of this appeal.no challenge has been made to the district court factual findings,which we take to be true.
on october,eli lilly and company eli lilly donated to project hope vials of chemically synthesized form of insulin manufactured exclusively by eli lilly and taken by more than million people with diabetes around the world every day,see http last visited april.humulin must be stored within five degrees of at all times otherwise,it will spoil.
project hope is a private,organization that makes charitable donations of medicine and pharmacy supplies both in the united states and abroad.in early october,project hope contracted with blue owning common it to arrange the transport of the donated humulin from project hope warehouse in winchester,virginia to cairo,egypt.blue ocean,in turn,contracted separately with united arab for the ocean carriage and mill for the overland motor carriage.the arrangements called for united arab to provide a refrigerated container reefer to be used throughout the transport from winchester to cairo united arab was also to transport the humulin on board its vessel from the virginia international terminal in norfolk,virginia the norfolk terminal to cairo.mill responsibilities included picking up the empty reefer from united arab at norfolk terminal,transporting the reefer to project hope winchester warehouse,waiting there while project hope staff loaded the humulin into the reefer,and transporting the reefer back to the norfolk terminal for loading aboard united arab vessel.
on october,blue ocean prepared and faxed to mill a dock receipt that stated in relevant part temperature must be plus or minus do not freeze vents must be closed.according to the facts stipulated by the parties and accepted by the district court,neither blue ocean nor mill provided a copy of the dock receipt to united arab.on october,a blue ocean employee negligently misinformed a member of united arab staff that the reefer temperature should be set at eight degrees below than the proper temperature.as a result,united arab set the reefer temperature at.
later that same day a truck driver for mill picked up united arab reefer at the norfolk terminal and,the next morning,transported it to project hope winchester warehouse.project hope personnel loaded the humulin into the reefer,but neither mill driver nor anyone on project hope staff verified that the reefer temperature was set properly.after the humulin was loaded,mill issued a straight bill of lading to project hope for the inland transportation between winchester and norfolk.
mill driver returned to the norfolk terminal with the humulin on october,whereupon terminal personnel inspected the reefer and then issued mill driver a receipt that documented the container temperature at between and.at some point during the weekend of october,as united arab was preparing to load the reefer onto its vessel,an united arab employee discovered the error.as a consequence,the reefer was not loaded onto united arab vessel,and united arab informed blue ocean,which in turn informed project hope,of the situation.no one disputes that placing the humulin in a environment rendered it unfit for use and thus a total loss.project hope,d at.
on december,project hope insurance underwriter,kemper insurance kemper,paid project hope for the spoiled humulin and for other incidental damages.on or about january,project hope used the insurance proceeds to purchase a replacement shipment from eli lilly.however,due to a january,increase in the price of humulin from to per vial,project hope was only able to secure with the insurance proceeds a replacement shipment of vials of humulin,as compared to the donated vials that had spoiled 
on may,project hope sued,inter alia,defendants neptune orient lines,united arab,and blue ocean,alleging that they had breached their duties and obligations as common carriers.thereafter,defendant blue ocean filed a complaint against mill.mill answered both blue ocean complaint and project hope original complaint.
on march,following a bench trial,the district court found mill and blue ocean jointly and severally liable in the amount of,of which was project hope recovery for the humulin.see id.at.the district court also found that united arab was not responsible for the incorrect temperature setting and therefore dismissed the claims against united arab.see id.at.
mill appeal and project hope followed.
discussion 
mill appeal 
the thrust of mill appeal is directed toward avoiding liability,joint and several or otherwise,for the loss project hope suffered.it asserts two arguments in this effort.despite its briefing on the issue,we understand mill first argument to be that the district court erroneously resorted to federal admiralty law principles in deciding to impose joint and several liability on mill.see project hope,d at.mill second argument is that after it was impleaded by blue ocean under federal rule of civil procedure a,project hope failed to amend its original complaint to assert direct claims against mill,and,thus can not look to mill for recovery.
as noted,mill argument seems to be that the district court,in imposing joint and several liability,erroneously resorted to the federal common law of admiralty,under which such awards are a standard remedy in cases involving multiple tortfeasors.see mcdermott,amclyde,d noting that in admiralty j oint and several liability applies when there has been a judgment against multiple defendants the atlas.adopting joint and several liability rule in admiralty coats penrod drilling,cir en banc stating that joint and several liability is the maritime rule and noting that b y,the rule of joint and several liability was being adopted in admiralty pennsylvania v.the beatrice,cir see also thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed celeste,coats penrod drilling corporation the fifth circuit adheres to the doctrine of joint and several liability in the general maritime law,tul,marie yeates et,contribution and indemnity in maritime litigation,drake towing meisner marine constr,cir.
mill premise is infirm,however.our review of the district court judgment against the finding of liability and the imposition of joint and several that it was not grounded in admiralty see project hope,d at.rather,mill liability and the joint and several award were determined exclusively under two federal statutory schemes the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,et,and the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,we therefore turn to consider whether the joint and several award against mill was proper under these statutes.the prima facie cases for both cogsa and the carmack amendment are identical for all relevant purposes here.
cogsa and the carmack amendment 
cogsa is not a proper basis for mill joint and several liability.by its express terms,cogsa only covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the ship to the time when they are discharged from the ship.e defining carriage of goods see also id.cogsa covers contract s for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states,in foreign trade.mill negligence in failing to ensure that the reefer was set at the proper temperature occurred exclusively on land,while the humulin was being transported from project hope winchester warehouse to the norfolk terminal.therefore,mill negligence was plainly outside cogsa reach 
the carmack amendment,however,does govern mill negligence in pertinent part,the carmack amendment provides 
a carrier and any other carrier that deliver the property and are providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under are liable to the person entitled to recover under the bill of lading.the liability imposed is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by a the receiving carrier,b the delivering carrier,or c another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the united states 
the carmack amendment reach is determined by reference to,the provision of the interstate commerce act that now establishes the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board formerly the interstate commerce commission with respect to the transportation by motor carrier of passengers and property.in relevant part,extends the reach of the carmack amendment to motor carrier transportation of property 
between a place in 
a a state and a place in another state or 
e the united states and a place in a foreign country to the extent the transportation is in the united states 
where multiple carriers are responsible for different legs of a generally continuous shipment,whether either a or e is satisfied to trigger application of the carmack amendment is determined by reference to the intended final destination of the shipment as that intent existed when the shipment commenced.see swift textiles,watkins motor lines,cir the nature of a shipment is not determined by a mechanical inspection of the bill of lading nor by when and to whom title passes but rather by the essential character of the commerce,reflected by the intention formed prior to shipment,pursuant to which property is carried to a selected destination by a continuous or unified movement.internal citations and quotation marks omitted southern pac.transp.icc,cir discussing the reach of interstate commerce commission jurisdiction.this intent fixes the character of the shipment for all the legs of the transport within the united states.see new york,new haven hartford nothnagle.citing sprout south bend.greenwald pan am.world airways.
thus,if the final intended destination at the time the shipment begins is another state,the carmack amendment applies throughout the shipment,even as to a carrier that is only responsible for an intrastate leg of the shipment.see,merchants fast motor lines,icc,cir discussing challenge to icc ruling and stating i t is elemental that a carrier is engaged in interstate commerce when transporting goods either originating in transit from beyond texas or ultimately bound for destinations beyond texas,even though the route of the particular carrier is wholly within one state martinez phillips petroleum,texas united states,cir determining the existence of the requisite fixed and persisting intent to move goods in interstate commerce turns in significant part on the factual context of each case.burlington weyerhaeuser,cir noting intent manifested at the time of shipment fixes interstate or intrastate character of shipment and finding intent was for intrastate shipment.similarly,if the final intended destination at the time the shipment begins is a foreign nation,the carmack amendment applies throughout the entire portion of the shipment taking place within the united states,including intrastate legs of the shipment.see swift textiles,at united states erie.the character of a shipment is not affected by the fact that the transaction is initiated or completed under a local bill of lading which is wholly intrastate texas new orleans sabine tram.long beach banana,atchison,topeka santa fe,cir.
here,project hope intention that the humulin travel in foreign commerce was fixed before mill transported the humulin from project hope winchester warehouse to the norfolk terminal.as a result e is satisfied,and the carmack amendment governs mill liability even though mill role in the humulin shipment was restricted exclusively to virginia.
having concluded that the carmack amendment controls mill liability,we must consider whether the district court imposition of the joint and several award was permissible under the carmack amendment.to answer this question,we look to the federal common law of damages,which informs the propriety of damage remedies under the carmack amendment see,hector martinez southern pac.transp,cir the carmack amendment incorporates common law principles for damages.j h flyer pennsylvania,cir see also camar preston trucking,cir mccarty southern pac,cir.
doing so,we find that the district court imposition of joint and several liability in this case was consistent with the federal common law of damages and,therefore,permissible under the carmack amendment.the district court imposed joint and several liability only after concluding between blue ocean and mill the record d id not permit a fair allocation of comparative fault.project hope,d at.where a fair allocation of liability can not be made among multiple tortfeasors,the federal common law permits imposition of joint and several liability.see,restatement second of torts if the tortious conduct of each of two or more persons is a legal cause of harm that can not be apportioned,each is subject to liability for the entire harm,irrespective of whether their conduct is concurring or consecutive.page keeton,prosser and keeton on torts,at ed.single indivisible result certain results,by their very nature,are obviously incapable of any reasonable or practical division and n o ingenuity can suggest anything more than a purely arbitrary apportionment of such harm.where two or more causes combine to produce a single loss,each may be a substantial factor in bringing about the loss,and if so,each is charged with all of it.gordon mooney,farrell lines,cir holding that,under the carmack amendment,comparative fault is the appropriate method for assigning liability among joint tortfeasors where fault is assignable.
because the district court found that liability could not be fairly factual conclusion that is not challenged by mill in this because the common law of damages allows resort to joint and several liability in such instances,we hold that the district court joint and several award against mill was proper under the carmack amendment.
mill second line of attack on the joint and several award centers on the fact that after blue ocean served its complaint against mill pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,project hope did not amend its original c
