discussion 
the primary question before us is whether the united states has waived sovereign immunity.we will consider the issue of sovereign immunity on the merits because it can be raised at any time by the government,as it goes to a court jurisdiction.irs fed.labor relations,cir 
it is elementary that the united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued,and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.a waiver of sovereign immunity can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.united states mitchell,citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.the waiver of sovereign immunity is a prerequisite to jurisdiction.united states mitchell.l imitations and conditions upon which the united states government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.soriano united states.federal sovereign immunity insulates the united states from suit in the absence of an express waiver of this immunity by congress.robinson united states,cir quoting block north dakota ex rel.bd.of sch.lands.
in their complaint,plaintiffs offered a number of sources of an alleged waiver of sovereign immunity by the united states.plaintiffs also filed a motion to amend their complaint to add two additional sources.the district court denied the motion on the ground that the proposed amendment could not cure the defect.like the district court,we consider all sources.those sources include the public vessels act pva,the suits in admiralty act saa,u.the federal tort claims act ftca the alien tort statute,the military claims act,a regulation,b the convention on the law of the sea the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr a bilateral treaty between ecuador and the united states concerning the use of an air force base at manta,ecuador and a letter from the united states embassy to the ecuadorian government requesting permission to board plaintiffs vessel.
non congressional sources 
the regulation and the letter are not acts of congress,so they can not effect a waiver of sovereign immunity.united states park place,cir.additionally,we note that the regulation contains no relevant information and does not pertain to sovereign immunity.similarly,the letter does not mention sovereign immunity and,as noted,even if it implies that sovereign immunity would be waived,implied waivers are ineffective.mitchell,at.
military claims act,alien tort statute,and treaties 
the military claims act does not mention,and therefore does not waive,sovereign immunity.see murphy ex rel.estate of payne united states,d,the military claims act does not waive the government sovereign immunity,but instead merely authorizes the secretary to settle claims including disallowing claims at his or her discretion and under such regulations as the secretary may prescribe,adopted,cir per curiam we affirm on the opinion of the district court.
t he alien tort statute has been interpreted as a jurisdiction statute has not been held to imply any waiver of sovereign immunity.goldstar panama united states,cir citing sanchez espinoza reagan,canadian transp.united states.thus,any party asserting jurisdiction under the alien tort statute must establish,independent of that statute,that the united states has consented to suit.id.
the united states has signed,but has not ratified,the convention on the law of the sea.in the absence of congressional action,the convention does not waive sovereign immunity.
the united states has ratified the iccpr.but that treaty is not and therefore did not itself create obligations enforceable in the federal courts.sosa alvarez machain.
finally,the bilateral treaty concerning the air force base at manta,ecuador,concerns,naturally enough,the air force base at manta,ecuador,which played no part in the coast guard actions here.the treaty does not mention the coast guard,payment for the types of damage alleged by plaintiffs,judicial remedies,or sovereign immunity.that being so,the treaty does not waive the united states sovereign immunity.
c.the public vessels act,suits in admiralty act,and federal tort claims act 
each of these three acts provides an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.the pva waives sovereign immunity for suits for damages caused by a public vessel of the united states.a.but the pva contains a reciprocity requirement a national of a foreign country may sue under the pva only if the government of that foreign country would permit a united states national to bring the same suit in its courts.id.the saa waives sovereign immunity,subject to some exceptions,in admiralty cases when a civil action could otherwise be brought if the united states were not a party.id.a see earles united states,cir recognizing a discretionary function exception to that waiver.finally,the ftca waives sovereign immunity in tort actions brought against the united states,subject to certain exceptions listed in.
because each of those three acts provides a separate,explicit waiver of sovereign immunity,one might expect that any of the three waivers would suffice.for example,one would think that a claim brought under the saa could proceed if the waiver requirements for that act were met.for historical reasons,however,that is not how the acts work together.
in united states united continental tuna,the supreme court explained the relevant history.the court concluded that a plaintiff who brings an admiralty claim that falls within the scope of the pva must meet the pva reciprocity requirement,even though the text of the saa suggests that a claim brought under the saa need not meet that requirement.id.at.in taghadomi united states,cir,we held that the same reasoning applies to potential claims under the ftca.in short,if a claim falls within the scope of the pva,the plaintiff must meet the reciprocity requirement of the pva,regardless of the type of claim the plaintiff,saa,or ftca.we turn,then,to whether plaintiffs claims fall within the scope of the pva.
whether plaintiffs claims fall within the scope of the pva 
a claim falls within the scope of the pva if the claim comes within federal admiralty jurisdiction and if the damages were caused by a public vessel.taghadomi,at.to come within federal admiralty j
