national marine,appeals from a judgment,entered after a jury trial,awarding richard donaldson on an action for the wrongful death of donaldson adoptive father,albert pavolini.
background 
pavolini spent his adult working life on or around boats and ships.he served in the navy from until.he worked for military sea transport from to,he worked for national marine then cardinal carriers from to and he worked for other private shipping companies from until he retired,a few years later.pavolini duties both for the navy and for the private shipping companies included installing or repairing insulation around pipes and waterlines,and it is undisputed that pavolini was exposed to asbestos during his naval career,and later,while working for the private companies.pavolini also began smoking at age,and smoked until.
in may,pavolini was diagnosed with lung cancer.he died in of complications resulting from the cancer.
these proceedings began prior to pavolini death,when pavolini filed suit against multiple defendants,including several tobacco companies,on the theory that his lung cancer was caused by a combination of his use of tobacco and his exposure to asbestos during his naval career and his employment with the private companies.although it is not clear from the record,it appears that the defendants originally included companies that manufactured or supplied products containing asbestos to the navy or to the private shipping companies.in all events,the parties ultimately stipulated to orders severing the tobacco defendants from the asbestos defendants for separate trial.
in the case against the tobacco defendants,the trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend,and entered judgment in favor of the tobacco defendants.pavolini appealed.we consolidated that appeal with a second appeal,filed by edwin brigham.and.after pavolini died,on july,we permitted his adoptive son,richard donaldson to substitute for pavolini.brigham also died while the appeal was pending,and we permitted joseph naegele and david wheeler as of the edwin naegele trust,and alicia ojeda brigham,to substitute for brigham.we affirmed the judgment of the trial court in both cases,finding that the tobacco defendants were immune from suit under the version of civil code section in effect at the time pavolini causes of action accrued naegele reynolds tobacco th,d.donaldson did not seek review of our decision,but the supreme court granted review in naegele,and has reversed our decision in that case.naegele reynolds tobacco cal th,d.
in the meantime,on september,donaldson filed suit against national marine,as the successor to cardinal carriers,seeking damages for pavolini death under the jones act,title united states code appendix section,and under the maritime doctrine of unseaworthiness.national marine moved to dismiss the case against it on the theory that the san francisco superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over donaldson maritime claims because pavolini work for cardinal carriers took place outside of california territorial waters.the motion was denied,and the matter went to trial.
at trial,national marine did not dispute that pavolini died of lung cancer.it defended on the theory that pavolini lung cancer was not related to his exposure to asbestos,but resulted from his history of smoking tobacco.national marine also theorized that even if pavolini exposure to asbestos was a factor in his lung cancer,tobacco was a greater factor.finally,it argued that in all events pavolini exposure to asbestos during his naval career was far greater than his exposure to asbestos while working for cardinal carriers 
the jury rejected donaldson unseaworthiness claims.it found,however,that national marine was negligent under the jones act,and that its negligence was a cause of pavolini death.the jury further fixed the damages for pavolini death at,and apportioned fault between pavolini,national marine,the navy and the tobacco companies,at percent for pavolini,and percent each for national marine,the navy and the tobacco companies.
national marine appealed from the judgment,entered on the jury verdict,of at least.
the trial court later denied national marine motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,but granted donaldson motion to amend the judgment to make national marine liable for percent of the jury verdict.the court found that the navy and the tobacco companies were immune from donaldson claims,and that national marine,accordingly,was liable for the full amount of damages,less the percent attributable to pavolini fault.the court therefore corrected its judgment to increase donaldson award against national marine to.
national marine filed a second appeal from the court order.the appeals have been consolidated,and we consider both here.
discussion 
national marine contends that the san francisco superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over donaldson claims,and that the trial court,accordingly,erred in denying national marine motion to dismiss.the contention is based on an interpretation of maritime law,and a split in california authority as to whether the state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over actions brought for the death of a seaman outside of the state territorial waters.after reviewing the historical development of maritime law and its application to actions for negligence and wrongful death,we conclude that california courts do indeed have subject matter jurisdiction over such actions,even when the actionable wrong or the death occurred outside of the state territorial limits.
it is that state courts are competent to try civil maritime suits for injuries to seamen,although they will be required to apply federal maritime law to the seaman claims.see,engel davenport.at first,however,maritime law afforded no cause of action for wrongful death.the harrisburg.in addition,although the point later was questioned in moragne states marine lines,d,it was believed that no federal common law action for wrongful death existed in the united states.plaintiffs seeking damages as a result of the wrongful death of a seaman,therefore,were relegated to such relief as might be available under a state wrongful death statute.moragne states marine lines,supra,d the tungus skovgaard,d.
in,however,congress passed two landmark acts the death on the high seas act,title united states code sections et.dohsa,which established an action for a death occurring beyond a marine league from the shore of any state,and the jones act,title united states code section,which extended the protections of the federal employers liability act fela to seamen,and thereby provided a right of recovery against employers for negligence resulting in injury or death.appen,moragne states marine lines,supra,at.problems arose when suit was brought not for negligence,but for unseaworthiness,and the death occurred within a state territorial waters.in such cases,the death was not covered by dohsa,which was limited to deaths occurring on the high seas,or by the jones act,which was limited to actions arising from negligence.if recovery could be had for such claims,therefore,it still could be had only under state wrongful death statutes,a situation that fostered a lack of consistency in the adjudication of wrongful death claims.moreover,because the jones act preempts state law remedies for the death or injury of a seaman,state statutes could provide no relief to true seamen,with the result that,within a state territorial waters,recovery was available under a state wrongful death statute for the death of a longshoreman but not for the death of a jones act seaman.miles apex marine,d moragne states marine lines,supra,at.
the supreme court,in moragne,remedied the situation by overruling the harrisburg,and creating a general maritime remedy for wrongful death.moragne states marine lines,supra,at.and see also miles apex marine,supra,at.after moragne,the jones act provided a cause of action for the negligent death of a seaman,irrespective of the place at which the injury occurred or the death took place.in addition,dosha provided a cause of action for wrongful death on the high seas,and a general maritime remedy existed for wrongful death caused by unseaworthiness,also irrespective of the location of the injury or death.
that these causes of action exist,of course,does not mean that a state court has subject matter jurisdiction to entertain them.article iii,section of the united states constitution confers jurisdiction on the federal courts to hear all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.title united states code section,part of the judiciary act of,provides that the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.italics added.thus,the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over civil maritime cases unless the remedy is one that is saved to suitors.
national marine,citing chromy lawrance d,contends that the savings to suitors clause permits state courts to entertain admiralty or maritime actions only if the state wrongful death statute provides a remedy for that action.the contention assumes that the term remedy,for purposes of the clause,means that the state wrongful death statute must itself establish the right to sue for the death at issue.california wrongful death statutes,code of civil procedure section et,do not specifically establish a right to sue for maritime deaths occurring outside of the state territorial limits.pavolini died in tennessee,of injuries alleged to have been received,in part,while working for national marine as a seaman on or around the mississippi river.it follows,under national marine analysis,that california wrongful death statute can not provide a basis for the exercise of state court subject matter jurisdiction over donaldson maritime claim.
national marine contention,however,is based on two premises that we reject that california wrongful death statutes do not apply to deaths occurring outside of the state territories and that title united states code section allows state courts to entertain only those rights of action specifically recognized by the state in question.
although california wrongful death statutes do not specifically apply to deaths occurring outside of california territories,there is no question but that its courts have subject matter jurisdiction over injuries or deaths,assuming a basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the parties.nothing in the wrongful death statutes suggests that they are limited to deaths on waters only when those waters exist within the state territorial limits it is true that state courts traditionally have been reluctant to provide a remedy for a maritime death occurring outside of the state territorial waters.see miles apex marine,d moragne states marine lines,supra,at,including fn.and the hamilton.this reluctance,however,arises from issues of choice of law rather than from issues of the competence of a state court to hear the claim.the reasoning is that because the remedy of wrongful death is a creature of statute,not recognized in all jurisdictions,it would be improper to impose it on a claim arising in a jurisdiction that does not itself recognize that remedy.
this point was discussed in mcdonald mallory et,a case often cited for its discussion of the reach of state wrongful death statutes.a vessel,registered in new york,was destroyed by fire while anchored on the high seas,outside of the territory of any jurisdiction.a citizen of new york was killed as a result of the fire,and an action for wrongful death was brought in the new york state court.the defendant argued that new york statute provided no right of action to recover for wrongs committed outside of the state territorial limits.the court recognized,as is particularly relevant here,that as a general rule,the law of the jurisdiction where an accident occurred applies to any claim arising from that accident.this meant that if an accident took place in a jurisdiction that did not recognize a claim for wrongful death,the state court of new york,applying the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurred,would not provide a remedy for wrongful death.the court reversed,in essence,that it should apply the law of the jurisdiction where the death occurred.it did not find that it lacked competence to hear a claim arising from a death resulting from a wrong committed outside of the state territorial waters.id.at.the court also recognized that a vessel while at sea constructively is part of the territory of the state to which the vessel belongs,and subject to that state laws.id.at.it concluded that the new york wrongful death statute applied unless it was displaced by the law of the jurisdiction where the wrong occurred.as the claim arose on the high seas,outside of any state territorial waters,and as maritime law at that time did not provide an exclusive remedy for a death occurring on the high seas,the court found that the new york statute applied.id.at.it also found that the state court had jurisdiction to hear the claim.ibid.
under this analysis,california courts have subject matter jurisdiction over deaths occurring outside of the state territorial limits,although they may be required to apply the law of the jurisdiction where the wrong occurred.for purposes of this case,that law is the jones act.as the jones act recognizes a claim for wrongful death,the superior court was entitled to hear donaldson claims.
the second premise in national marine argument that we reject is that the savings to suitors clause saves only those rights of action recognized by state law.the clause refers to remedies,not to rights of action.the difference between the two was explained by the united states supreme court in knapp,stout company mccaffrey.knapp was a suit brought to enforce a lien for towage.in finding that an illinois court had jurisdiction over the case,notwithstanding the limitations on jurisdiction imposed by the judiciary act of,the supreme court distinguished between actions brought against a vessel itself and actions brought against a personal defendant to enforce a lien against a vessel.the court concluded that admiralty courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the first type of action because the action against the vessel all the features of an admiralty proceeding in rem suit may be maintained against the owner,however,even though the plaintiff seeks to enforce a lien against the vessel for towage charges,because the suit brought in a state remedy saved to suitors.id.at.
an additional issue arose from the fact that the suit in knapp,stout company mccaffrey,supra,was a suit in equity,and therefore certainly not a action.id.at.the court held but it will be noticed that the reservation is not of an action at common law,but of a remedy and a remedy does not necessarily imply an action.ibid.the true distinction between such proceedings as are and such as are not invasions of the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction is this if the cause of action be one cognizable in admiralty,and the suit be in rem against the thing itself,though a monition be also issued to the owner,the proceeding is essentially one in admiralty.if,upon the other hand,the cause of action be not one of which a court of admiralty has jurisdiction,or if the suit be in personam against an individual defendant,with an auxiliary attachment against a particular thing,or against the property of the defendant in general,it is essentially a proceeding according to the course of the common law,and within the saving clause of the statute of a remedy.the suit in this case being one in equity to enforce a remedy,the state courts were correct in assuming jurisdiction.id.at.
in the present case,it is true,as national marine contends,that california,although recognizing an action for wrongful death code civ,et,does not specifically recognize an action for wrongful death occurring outside of its territorial limits.under knapp,however,that fact is of little importance.the question is whether california law recognizes a remedy of an in personam suit for wrongful death.it does,and that remedy is saved to suitors by section of the judici
