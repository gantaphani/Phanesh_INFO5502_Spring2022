plaintiff,james perkins,appeals from the district court order entering judgment in favor of defendants,american electric power fuel supply,aep and indiana michigan power company,river transportation division after a bench trial on plaintiff claims for negligence under the jones act,and unseaworthiness under general maritime law.plaintiff also appeals the district court order denying plaintiff motion to continue the trial date,extend discovery,and amend his complaint.for the reasons that follow,we reverse in part and affirm in part the district court order entering judgment against plaintiff and remand however,we affirm the district court order denying plaintiff pretrial motion.
background 
plaintiff worked for defendant aep from until the date of his accident.plaintiff worked as a deckhand from to on commercial river vessels.in,he was promoted to second mate,the position he held until his injury which is the subject of this litigation.defendant aep is a river transportation company,transporting bulk commodities,primarily coal,on the ohio river and its tributaries.defendants were the operators of the bryan and barge.
plaintiff duties as second mate included seeing that wires,ratchets and rigging were properly placed on the tow,in accordance with the captain orders,and inspected prior to use.plaintiff was injured on december,when he fell from barge to the deck of the bryan,a distance of about eight or nine feet.when plaintiff fell,he was attempting to lay a rock and roll or jockey wire from an outside barge to the bryan.although plaintiff had laid dozens of wires on inside barges before,he had never performed this specific task.plaintiff was attempting to lay the wire by tightening it using a stationary rachet located on the port stern of barge,cranking the ratchet outboard with a cheater pipe slipped over the ratchet handle for added leverage.plaintiff had gotten the wire substantially tight when the dog of the ratchet failed to catch properly,causing the tension on the cheater pipe to give way.then,plaintiff was propelled forward,lost his balance and fell over the edge of the barge onto the deck of the bryan.the evidence at trial revealed that plaintiff was straddling the ratchet while attempting to lay the wire.
plaintiff sustained extensive injuries from the fall including permanent disabling injuries.plaintiff suffers from chronic pain and permanent physical limitations.he has had five surgeries his right knee is permanently fused his right leg stands a half inch off the ground and his left ankle is fitted with a steel plate and may require fusion or even amputation.
plaintiff and his wife,judith perkins,filed suit against defendants for his injuries on january.the complaint alleged that defendants were liable for negligence under the jones act and for the unseaworthiness of the bryan the barge under general admiralty law because the ratchet plaintiff used was defective and was the cause of his injuries,and defendants failed to take adequate safety precautions and provide training for plaintiff 
prior to trial,on july,plaintiff filed a motion to continue the trial,amend his complaint,and extend discovery.the district court denied the motion on august,and the matter went to trial on september.
after a bench trial,the district court found that defendants were not negligent and that the bryan and barge were seaworthy.moreover,although not necessary to its decision,the district court concluded,without explanation,that plaintiff was negligent in straddling the ratchet in violation of aep policy and that his negligence was likely the sole proximate cause of his injuries.this appeal followed.
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.see schroyer frankel,cir.the factual findings of the district court following a bench trial are reviewed for clear error.see id.in our review of the district court factual findings,this court gives due regard to the district court opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.see adams county reg l water dist.vill.of manchester,ohio,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.quoting united states united states gypsum.
this action arises under the jones act,and general admiralty law.plaintiff,defendants employee and a seaman claims that defendants were negligent and defendants vessels,the bryan and,were unseaworthy because the equipment appurtenant thereto,namely the ratchet,malfunctioned under proper and intended use and defendants failed to provide adequate safety measures and training for plaintiff.
plaintiff contends on appeal that the district court erred in its factual findings and application of the law.specifically,plaintiff claims that the district court erred in finding that the ratchet was not defective,that plaintiff had received adequate training,that defendants were not negligent in failing to take certain safety precautions to prevent plaintiff injury,and that the bryan and barge were not unseaworthy.plaintiff also claims that the district court disregarded plaintiff status as a ward of the court and erred in its application of the proof of negligence required under the jones act and the standard of liability under the seaworthiness doctrine.and although not necessary to the district court decision,plaintiff also challenges the district court finding that plaintiff was negligent in straddling the ratchet and that plaintiff negligence was likely the sole cause of his injuries.we hold that the district court erred in concluding that plaintiff was not entitled to recover either on the jones act claim or the unseaworthiness claim.
it is a principle of law that seamen are emphatically the wards of the admiralty.chandris,latsis,d citation and quotation omitted accord oil smith.davis am.commercial lines,cir.
the paternal regard of the courts and congress for seamen has,for the most part,grown out of the peculiar conditions of their employment.these conditions,by their very nature rigorous and subjecting the seaman to unusually severe discipline for extended periods of time,are quite unlike the conditions which attend land labor,and have resulted in extraordinary remedies being made available to those who accept this calling.
paul united states,cir.it is for this reason that remedial legislation enacted for the benefit and protection of seamen has been liberally construed to attain that end,at.accord isbrandtsen johnson.
one such remedial measure is the jones act,which provides in pertinent part 
any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may,at his election,maintain an action for damages at law,with the right of trial by jury,and in such action all statutes of the united states modifying or extending the right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply and in case of death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury,and in such action all statutes of the united states conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable.
under the jones act,seaman are afforded rights parallel to those given to railway employees under the federal employers liability act fela,et.the fela provides in pertinent part 
every common carrier by railroad shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents,or employees of such carrier,or by reason of any defect or insufficiency,due to its negligence,in its cars,engines,appliances,machinery,track,roadbed,works,boats,wharves,or other equipment.
therefore,in suits under the jones act,the court must determine whether the evidence justifies the conclusion that the employer was negligent and that the employer negligence played any part,however slight,in producing the injury to the seaman.see sweeney am.steamship,cir.
proof of negligence duty and breach is essential to recovery under the jones act.see jacob city of new york.whether an employer is negligent is determined under the ordinary prudence standard normally applicable in negligence cases.see gautreaux scurlock marine,cir.however,once the plaintiff proves negligence,he need only show that his employer negligence is the cause,in whole or in part,of his injuries.see daughenbaugh bethlehem steel,cir.in essence,there is a reduced standard for causation between the employer negligence and the employee injury.see gautreaux,at.moreover,because the comparative negligence principle applies to negligence actions under the jones act,any negligence on the part of the employee operates only to mitigate the damages due to the employee unless his negligence is the sole cause of his injuries.see jacob,at.
to recover,the plaintiff must first establish the breach of a duty to protect against foreseeable risks of harm.hernandez trawler miss vertie mae,cir.in the instant case,plaintiff alleged that defendants were negligent in several respects in providing a defective ratchet with which plaintiff had to work in failing to provide plaintiff with adequate training and in failing to take certain safety precautions to prevent plaintiff injury.we conclude that plaintiff met his burden of proof with respect to the safety precautions and that the district court clearly erred in this respect.as to the other two claims of negligence,the defective ratchet and the training,we are not similarly convinced that plaintiff met his burden of proof.we will address each in turn.
we conclude that plaintiff has failed to establish the breach of a duty with respect to his first theory of negligence,that the ratchet was defective,inasmuch as plaintiff has failed to establish the employer prior notice of the defect or that the risk of harm from a defective ratchet was foreseeable.it is a fundamental principle that,under the jones act,an employer must have notice and the opportunity to correct an unsafe condition before liability will attach.havens polar mist,cir.there must be some evidence from which the trier of fact can infer that the owner either knew,or in the exercise of due care,should have known of the unsafe condition.id.the evidence on record fails to show that defendants knew or should have known of any possible defect in the particular ratchet plaintiff was using or that they had an opportunity to correct such a defect.in fact,the evidence demonstrates that plaintiff himself inspected the ratchet prior to using it and did not detect any defects.moreover,plaintiff supervisor conducted another visual inspection of the ratchet after plaintiff accident and did not detect any defects in the ratchet this constitutes evidence that defendants did not have notice of any defect in the ratchet.absent evidence sufficient to show that defendants knew or should have known that the ratchet was defective,plaintiff has failed to establish that defendants breached a duty to protect plaintiff from a foreseeable risk.see ribitzki canmar reading bates,cir.
similarly,we conclude that plaintiff has failed to establish that defendants were negligent in ensuring that plaintiff was adequately trained to lay the jockey wire.with respect to the adequacy of plaintiff training,the district court found 
plaintiff was an experienced seaman.he received training which is consistent with the custom and practice in the river industry.in addition,during his seventeen year with aep,plaintiff attended safety meetings on at least a monthly basis.when captain harrington was aboard the vessel,plaintiff attended safety meetings on a weekly basis.some of these meetings included instruction and warnings regarding the safe use of ratchets,cheater pipes and other rigging.
moreover,plaintiff had significant experience in laying and tightening jockey wires.having laid such wires before the night of his injury,he was familiar with the risks and dangers associated with that type of wire.although plaintiff testified that this was the first time he had laid the wires to the outside barges,as opposed to a center barge,the court finds this configuration did not change the way in which the wires were tightened or the way the ratchet was positioned and cranked.moreover,plaintiff had laid thousands of other wires,at least some of which had required him to tighten the ratchet toward an empty cargo hopper or toward the edge of a barge exposing him to comparable danger,which would have given him similar training and experience.the court finds plaintiff had adequate training and experience to safely lay the jockey wire on the night of his injury.
at.we are not convinced that these findings are clearly erroneous.
plaintiff does not deny that he had previously laid thousands of wires safely.his testimony reveals that he had no reason to believe that he could not perform the procedure safely that night.plaintiff,however,argues that he had never laid a jockey wire to an outside barge before.plaintiff argues that he had experience in laying the wire to the center barge,not the outside barge.there is a difference between the two,plaintiff argues,such that he needed additional training to perform the task.
defendants expert,however,testified that a review of exhibits admitted into evidence revealed that plaintiff had extensive training,some above and beyond industry standard.defendants expert further testified that plaintiff was trained in tightening wires,ratchet replacement and proper rigging.despite that plaintiff had not received specific instruction regarding laying jockey wire to an outside barge,defendants expert testified that there was no appreciable difference in the method for laying jockey wires to an outside barge and the thousands of other wires plaintiff laid to the center barge.defendants expert stated that,from the evidence including plaintiff deposition and training information,plaintiff training was adequate to allow him to lay a jockey wire to an outside barge.defendants expert testimony supports the district court conclusion.giving due regard to the district court opportunity to judge the witness credibility,as we must,we conclude that the district court findings as to the adequacy of plaintiff training were not clearly erroneous.
we next turn to the district court finding of fact and conclusions of law as to plaintiff allegation that defendants were negligent in failing to provide adequate safety precautions.specifically,the district court found that 
although,the ratchet on barge that plaintiff was using at the time of the accident was older,he determined pursuant to his responsibility as second mate that it was not in need of replacement or repair.likewise,upon inspection after the accident,captain harrington determined the ratchet was not in need of replacement or repair and left it in service for the remainder of the tow.tow ratchets were removed from barge on january,one of which was determined to be in need of replacement.however,it was not established which ratchet plaintiff was using on the night of the accident.accordingly,the court finds that barge was reasonably safe and fit for its intended purpose on the night of december.no evidence was offered to establish that barge departed in any way from industry standard.
the bryan had passed inspection by the coast guard under the responsible carrier program without suggestion that any modification was needed to the vessel in order for it to be reasonably safe and fit for its intended purpose.the installation of a rigging or safety deck between the towknees sic is not required by regulation,nor is it customary or common in the industry on a vessel like the bryan.likewise,the installation of a safety chain or grab irons between the towknees sic is not required or customary in the industry.neither the absence of these safeguards,nor the lack of rubber on the towknees sic,rendered the bryan unsafe or unfit for service the night of december.
at.here,plaintiff takes issue with district court findings and argues that they are based on facts not in evidence.we agree that the district court findings are unsupported by the evidence in the record.
plaintiff argues that the district court finding that bryan had passed inspection by the coast guard and under the responsible carrier program without suggestion that modification was needed to the vessel was not supported by the record.specifically,plaintiff points to the fact that bryan is an uninspected vessel,meaning that the coast guard does not inspect the vessel for or regulate the construction of safety equipment such as the handrails,safety chains or guardrails about which plaintiff complains.as an uninspected vessel,federal regulations only require that the vessel have minimal safety requirements such as life preservers,emergency radio beacons,fire extinguishers,see pts.
although the district court correctly pointed out that there were no regulations or industry practices requiring the presence of safety ropes or handrails,there was no evidence that safety ropes or handrails were inconsistent with custom and practice.the evidence at trial reveals that defendants installed safety chains and rails in several other areas of the vessel.moreover,other vessels in defendants fleet had safety appliances between the tow knees.defendants expert testified at trial that the size of the vessel would prohibit the installation of a safety deck,but conceded that nothing prevents the installation of a safety chain on top of the tow knees.defendants argue that the inspections of the responsible carrier program did not result in recommendations that either safety chains or safety decks be constructed on the ship.however,the testimony does not point to the extent of those inspections and whether the inspections were meant to consider whether safety chains or safety decks were needed.
in addition,there was testimony by defendants safety manager that,one month prior to plaintiff accident,another worker on the bryan fell from the tow knee and was injured.furthermore,defendants expert testified that the failure of the ratchet was common in the industry.based on these facts,we conclude that the district court erred in determining that defendants were not negligent in failing to provide adequate safety measures.these facts show that defendants knew of the risk that the ratchet could fail and also knew that a seaman could fall from the tow knee and injure himself nevertheless,defendants failed to adequately guard against these risks for the safety of their seamen.moreover,that defendants had installed safety ropes in other ships and other areas of the bryan indicates that it would not have been excessively burdensome in light of the risks to the seamen for defendants to install safety ropes here.given that one month prior to plaintiff injury another seaman was injured by a fall on the bryan,we conclude that defendants were negligent in failing to take adequate safety precautions in the face of the notice of the danger to their seamen.
similarly,there is sufficient evidence to show that defendants failure to provide the safety ropes was the cause,in whole or part,of plaintiff injuries.the testimony at trial was that if a safety rope had been in place,plaintiff would have had something to grab and his fall would have been prevented.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in determining that plaintiff was not entitled to recover under this theory of negligence.
under the seaworthiness doctrine,there is an absolute duty to maintain a seaworthy ship,the breach of which imposes liability without fault,strict liability.see brown dravo,cir.a shipowner has an obligation to furnish a vessel and appurtenances reasonably fit for their intended use.havens,at.however,a vessel need not be free from all possibility of mishap,for the seaworthiness of a ship is a relative concept,dependent in each instance upon circumstances.brown,at.to prove an unseaworthiness claim,a plaintiff must show that the unseaworthy condition of the vessel was the substantial and direct or proximate cause of the plaintiff injuries.see havens,at.
it is law that even a temporary or unforeseeable failure of a piece of vessel equipment under proper and expected use is sufficient to establish unseaworthiness provided that the unseaworthy condition was the proximate cause of the harm suffered by the plaintiff.see ferrara fishing,cir havens,at hubbard faros fisheries,cir.menhaden johnson,cir.plaintiff testified that he used the ratchet and attempted to lay the jockey wire in the same manner as always.in addition,plaintiff supervisor testified that he saw nothing abnormal,incorrect,or unusual about plaintiff performance during the period that he observed him.in the instant case,there is sufficient evidence on the record to conclude that plaintiff was properly using the ratchet for its intended purpose when it malfunctioned defendants expert concluded and the district court found that the ratchet malfunctioned 
furthermore,plaintiff established that the malfunction of the ratchet was a proximate or a direct and substantial cause of his injuries.defendants expert testified that the malfunction of the ratchet was common.given the manner in which a wire is laid,we find that it was foreseeable that if a ratchet malfunctioned during the laying of a wire,the force resulting from the ratchet could propel a seaman forward and cause injury.it is clear from the evidence that the malfunction of the ratchet was a substantial and direct cause of plaintiff injuries.the district court therefore erred in determining that,despite the testimony that the ratchet malfunctioned under normal use,the bryan and were seaworthy.to the contrary,the record indicates that defendants failed in their absolute duty to maintain a seaworthy vessel because the ratchet plaintiff was using on the night of his injury was not reasonably fit for its intended use.see hubbard,at.menhaden,at.
we further conclude that plaintiff can recover for unseaworthiness on the ground that the bryan and did not have adequate safety equipment and therefore were not fit for their intended uses.as discussed earlier,defendants knew of the dangers of the ratchet failing as well as the dangers of seamen falling on the vessel,having had a seaman injured on the same vessel by a fall just a month prior to plaintiff injuries.this evidence is sufficient to show that the bryan and were unseaworthy and that defendants were therefore strictly liable for their failure to provide a seaworthy vessel.plaintiff also showed that the failure to provide adequate safety equipment was at least one of the proximate causes of plaintiff injuries inasmuch as it was foreseeable,given the previous fall,that plaintiff could be injured from a fall on the vessel in light of the failure to provide safety rope or similar equipment.
we now consider plaintiff contention that the district court erred in determining that he was negligent in straddling the ratchet.we need not address the district court dicta that plaintiff negligence was the sole proximate cause of his injuries inasmuch as we have previously concluded that defendants negligence contributed to plaintiff injuries.
the district court noted that 
at the time of his injury,plaintiff was straddling the ratchet with one foot flush to the coaming and the other beside the outside edge of the ratchet.aep safety rule instructs employees not to straddle wire or ratchets when tightening barge lines.in this context,the court finds there is no significant difference between tightening barge lines and tightening barge wires as plaintiff was doing.plaintiff own expert testified that it would be common sense in the industry not to straddle the ratchet.rule further provides that employees shall operate the ratchet lever from the inboard side.this means from the side of the ratchet closest to the center of the vessel upon which the employee is standing.when an employee is straddling the ratchet,he is not to the inboard side of the ratchet and is likewise in violation of this latter portion of the rule.
aep policy also prohibits pushing the cheater pipe past vertical when tightening a wire.plaintiff learned through training and experience that doing so was dangerous because it increases the likelihood of the dog sl
