stephen medeiros appeals from a district court order dismissing the complaint he filed against the rhode island department of environmental management dem,the atlantic states marine fisheries commission asmfc,and the united states,challenging the constitutionality of a dem regulation restricting the number of lobsters which may be harvested by methods other than lobster traps.we affirm the district court order.
background 
in,with congressional approval,fifteen atlantic coast states,as well as the district of columbia,entered into a compact pursuant to which the signatories would exercise joint regulatory oversight of their fisheries,the area within three miles of their respective shorelines,primarily through the development of interstate fishery management plans ifmps.each signatory is represented on the atlantic states marine fisheries commission asmfc.
until,the decision to participate in any ifmp was entirely voluntary.as compliance was spotty,congress enacted the atlantic coastal fisheries cooperative management act,acfcma,which permits the asmfc i to identify which ifmp terms it considers necessary,id.a,and ii to require that all member states adopt and comply with these terms.id.a the responsibility for managing atlantic coastal fisheries rests with the states,which carry out a cooperative program of fishery oversight and management through the atlantic states marine fisheries commission.it is the responsibility of the federal government to support such cooperative interstate management of coastal fishery resources.should a member refuse to comply,the asmfc may contact the secretary of commerce,id.b,who makes a plenary determination as to whether i the particular ifmp term is indeed necessary,and ii the member state is in noncompliance.id.a.should the secretary determine that the member state is not complying with an essential term,a moratorium on fishing may be imposed in the offending member state coastal waters.id.c.
approximately of all atlantic lobsters are harvested within the territorial waters of the atlantic states,within three miles of the shoreline,and an even greater percentage by means of lobster traps.a small example,in rhode island,harvested by trawling and netting.in december,asmfc promulgated an ifmp containing amendment,after acquiring evidence suggesting that,despite years of heavy regulatory oversight,the atlantic lobster population was still being overfished overfishing is defined as a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the capacity of a fishery to produce the maximum sustainable yield on a continuing basis.id.specifically,asmfc determined that i ninety percent of recently harvested lobsters were young recruits which had just molted into the minimum legal size permitting their capture,and ii the loss of a population of more mature lobsters had resulted in a drastic diminution in production.
thus,amendment promulgated a variety of necessary measures to ward off an impending catastrophic collapse of the atlantic lobster stock.as concerns harvesting by lobster trap,amendment reduced the number of traps allowed on a vessel,as well as the trap capacity and the size of the trap vents designed to allow smaller lobsters to escape.with respect to lobstering methods,such as trawling and netting,amendment limited the daily harvest of lobsters to per vessel,or for vessels undertaking fishing expeditions of five days or more.the rhode island marine fisheries council rimfc duly implemented the latter provision of amendment as rimfc regulation.in june,medeiros was indicted in rhode island superior court after his otter trawler landed lobsters.the case was ultimately dismissed.
some state officials were less than enthusiastic about amendment.mark gibson,a former dem official,and jan reitsma,a former director of dem,stated that amendment was discriminatory and resulted in no genuine conservation benefit.in june,over the strong objection of the governor and the dem,rimfc repealed regulation,and,pursuant to the atlantic coastal act,asmfc notified the secretary of commerce that rhode island was no longer in compliance with this necessary ifmp requirement.the secretary agreed and announced an intention to impose a moratorium.however,in november,rhode island reinstated regulation,and stripped the rimfc of its authority to rescind the asmfc regulations.rimfc is now a purely advisory body.see laws.consequently,the moratorium never went into effect.
medeiros submitted the instant complaint in state court against the asmfc,the dem,and the united states,alleging that amendment as adopted through rimfc regulation violates his rights to equal protection and substantive due process,and constitutes an unlawful commandeering of rhode island legislative prerogatives under the tenth amendment.the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the district of rhode island.thereafter,pursuant to for summary judgment the district court dismissed all counts in the complaint.medeiros atlantic states marine fisheries comm n,d.medeiros appeals.
discussion 
for summary judgment are reviewed de novo,and all facts,as well as reasonable inferences therefrom,are reviewed in the light most favorable to the respective parties,with a view to determining whether i a genuine issue exists as to any material fact and ii either moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see barnes fleet bank,cir.
a.the equal protection claim 
first,medeiros claims that amendment and regulation violate the equal protection clause,in that their discrimination between trap and lobstering methods bears no rational relationship to the asserted governmental purpose to conserve the dwindling atlantic lobster stock.
legislation or regulation which neither employs a suspect classification nor impairs fundamental rights will survive constitutional scrutiny,provided the remedy is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.see wine and spirits retailers,rhode island,cir citizens awareness network,united states,cir.remedial choices made by the appropriate legislative or regulatory body are invested with a strong presumption of validity,rebuttable only where the party challenging the legislation or regulation can establish that there exists no fairly conceivable set of facts that could ground a rational relationship between the challenged classification and the government legitimate goals.see wine and spirits,at citation omitted.
regulation was designed to ameliorate the unprecedented overfishing of atlantic lobster stocks,and the resulting diminution in the overall vitality of those stocks.the defendants proffer two principal rationales for the differing treatment which amendment and regulation prescribe for trap and lobstering.
traps are a targeted,passive method for harvesting lobster.the lobster trap rests passively on the ocean floor awaiting the lobsters,which come for bait that is designed to attract nothing but lobsters.normally,newly molted lobsters,or soft shedders,are not caught in traps,in part because the vents in the traps permit smaller lobsters to escape from the trap.unless the smaller lobsters can escape,there can not be a sufficient population of mature lobsters capable of egg production,and the asmfc goal of rebuilding the atlantic lobster stocks would be threatened.
in contrast,methods,bottom trawling,are both and.for the most part,the lobster is a coincidental and insignificant for trawlers fishing primarily for finfish.the trawler nets actively dredge the ocean floor,catching whatever species may be in their path and large enough to be caught in the mesh,and the act of trawling the bottom may cause significant shell damage to the vulnerable population of soft shell lobsters.the relatively small openings required in trawler nets in order to catch most finfish species also lead to the capture of numerous soft shedders,which likewise causes a diminution in overall egg production.for instance,seventy percent of the lobsters seized from the medeiros vessel in june were soft shedders,many of which were moribund.
given these inherent differences between the trap and methods,these defendants opted to impose different limitations on each.trap methods are more amenable to input controls,limiting the number and size of lobsters which will be caught in the first instance.accordingly,amendment limited the number of traps per vessel or expedition,their overall capacity,and the minimum size of their escape vents 
on the other hand,such input controls were simply a less practicable and efficacious methodology for use in lobstering.for instance,had defendants prescribed that the mesh openings in a trawler net were to be made significantly larger to enable the escape of small lobsters,the trawlers primary catch of finfish would be necessarily and severely diminished as well.asmfc rationally adopted the limitation because it would reasonably account for the historical,coincidental capture of lobster during finfish trawling,while deterring trawlers from deliberately targeting more lobster.thus,asmfc decided to impose output controls upon methodologies.
the defendants point out as well that limitations upon methodologies are essential,in that even though the lobster on the part of fishing vessels presently employing methods constituted a relatively minor percentage of the overall lobster harvest fishing vessels confronted with finfish stocks with increasing regulatory limitations upon finfish harvesting or trap lobstering might turn increasingly to unregulated lobstering.since methods have proven most destructive to the vulnerable population of soft shed lobsters,such a potential redirection of the vessels efforts into lobstering eventually would undermine the essential aims of amendment and regulation.
medeiros maintains that these asserted reasons do not constitute a rational basis for equal protection purposes.he cites to the written opinions of mark gibson,a former dem official,and jan reitsma,a former director of dem,who opposed the limit because i it would discriminate by placing catch limits on the sector,but none on the trap sector,and ii offered no conservation benefit,since landings constitute but a small fraction of the total lobster catch.
however sincere these officials may have been in regard to the usefulness of the lobster catch limits,their opinions can not satisfy the daunting burden of demonstrating that the limit has no conceivable rational basis.see mcdonald bd.of election comm rs,d legislatures are presumed to have acted constitutionally wine and spirits,at.a legislative or regulatory body is entrusted with substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived.gary manchester sch,cir.citation omitted,cert.denied,d.once a rational basis is identified,we must uphold the statute or regulation even in cases when there is no empirical data in the record to support the assumptions underlying the chosen remedy.see powers harris,cir donahue city of boston,cir.noting that reasons need not be supported by record,and any plausible justification will suffice citation omitted,cert.denied,d starlight sugar,soto,cir.
amendment and regulation reasonably discriminate by imposing output controls upon methods,as these methods are not amenable to the type of input controls imposed upon the trap sector.the defendants aptly note that any attempt to place comparable restrictions upon the sector would be unworkable.for example,any requirement that trawling nets have larger openings in their mesh would result in the coincident loss of finfish,the trawlers primary catch.moreover,even if practicable input controls could be placed upon the sector,the dredging method inherently poses a greater risk of lobster mortality not presented by the trap sector.see state trawlers assocs.jorling,cir upholding against equal protection challenge a statutory prohibition on lobster trawling,based upon demonstrable damage to lobster populations from trawling method.
the reliance by gibson and reitsma upon the relatively small percentage of landings is similarly unavailing.first,the conclusion which they the limit has no conservation demonstrably false at the very least,the limit would have some albeit small conservation benefit commensurate with the relative size of the sector.more importantly,a statute or regulation is not lacking in a rational basis simply because it addresses a broader problem in small or incremental stages.see city of new orleans dukes,d.it is only necessary that there be some rational relation between the method chosen and the intended result.and it can not be gainsaid that it is entirely plausible to anticipate that the limit likely would decrease the harvesting of lobster to the extent such unrestricted harvesting previously occurred.
the yet more fatal fallacy in the medeiros argument is that it conveniently ignores the assertion that the defendants designed the limit as a prophylactic measure to prevent any future redirection of efforts from trap lobstering and finfishing into lobstering methods.as this court has noted,those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.abdullah comm r,cir quoting fcc beach communications,d emphasis added citation omitted.in an industry increasingly subjected to severe restrictions designed to enable the replenishment of rapidly dwindling fishing stocks,it was entirely rational for defendants to conclude that any opening left in the regulatory net could entice fishermen to venture an advantageous escape.
as surely as the opinion of the two dem officials can not be successfully utilized to the asmfc prerogatives,neither may the court such regulatory judgments.see beach communications,at.e qual protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom,fairness,or logic of legislative choices.dukes,at.t he judiciary may not sit as a super legislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations made in areas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines.lcm enters.town of dartmouth,cir baker city of concord,cir.
as the district court correctly concluded that medeiros could not establish at trial that amendment and regulation lack any conceivable rational basis,it properly granted summary judgment for the defendants on the instant claim.
b.the substantive due process claim 
medeiros appeals as well from the district court ruling that he failed adequately or distinctly to plead the claim that amendment and regulation violate his right to substantive due process.medeiros maintains that he adequately alleged that the regulations infringed upon his fundamental right to make a living,thereby triggering the heightened strict scrutiny standard of review.
however,at oral argument medeiros conceded that the identical analysis applied to the equal protection and due process claims.if medeiros alleged an infringement of a fundamental right,both claims were subject to strict scrutiny analysis.otherwise,both claims were governed by the rational basis standard of review.
the right to make a living is not a fundamental right,for either equal protection or substantive due process purposes.see state trawlers,at supra note.thus,amendment and regulation must be upheld against the medeiros substantive due process challenge,in that,as we have already noted,see supra section enters.chater,cir a court must apply substantially the same rational basis analysis to both substantive due process and equal protection challenges,both are rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of lobster conservation.see pfz,rodriguez,cir the doctrine of substantive due process does not protect individuals from all governmental actions that infringe liberty or injure property in violation of some law.rather,substantive due process prevents governmental power from being used for purposes of oppression,or abuse of government power that shocks the conscience,or an action that is legally irrational in that it is not sufficiently keyed to any legitimate state interests.citations omitted.accordingly,the district court correctly entered summary judgment for the defendants on the medeiros substantive due process claim.
