luhr.luhr brought this civil and maritime action seeking exoneration from liability for property damage and loss arising from the eagle auriga eagle colliding into a drydock on the waterway in august.the drydock owner,vessel repair,suffered damages that have been stipulated at.the eagle,owned by crystal shipowning crystal also sustained in stipulated damages.luhr operated the,vickie vickie.crystal alleges that the vickie embarrassed the navigation of the eagle resulting in an allision.luhr alleges that the trial court clearly erred in finding the vickie at fault for the allision.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the stipulated facts 
the waterway in question runs northeast to southwest between the port of port arthur and the neches river.northeast from port arthur,beacons and mark progress toward the neches river.upchannel from the beacons on the west bank is the marine maintenance facility.approximately one quarter mile north of the facility is the vessel repair drydock which is also on the west bank.at the time of the incident,the dredge louisiana was working about a mile above the drydock on the east bank.upchannel from the drydock is the atlantic shipper wharf,the pabtex coke dock,and an area called north which are all on the west bank.
on the morning of august,the vickie and its tow were operating in the waterway canal,en route from the lower mississippi river to trinity bay,texas.overall,the vickie and its tow are approximately feet long and feet wide.that same morning,the eagle,a tank ship,was the second of a convoy of three loaded tank ships headed from the sabine sea buoy to the ship berths.the eagle was proceeding behind the beryl and ahead of the aldebaran.at the time of the accident selinidis selinidis was the conning pilot on the eagle and james white white was the captain of the vickie.both selinidis and white were properly licensed.
before the accident,the marine duval duval came to a berth at the facility which is south of the drydock.two tugboats,the hermes and spartan,were pushing perpendicular against the starboard side of the duval to hold it in place portside to the.as the duval was berthing at the,the vickie and the eagle met and passed one another abeam of the two harbor tugs and the duval.shortly thereafter,the eagle bow came into physical contact with the drydock,resulting in damage to the eagle and the drydock.the vickie did not come into physical contact with anything.
b.the testimony before the magistrate judge 
captain white and captain selinidis testified that before the allision,the eagle was outbound and had proceeded midway between beacons and when it first saw the vickie.at that point,the vickie was traveling inbound and was halfway between north and the coke dock coming toward the eagle.most of the time,the eagle and the vickie proceeded on,or near,the centerline of the channel.the eagle and the vickie had slowed for other obstacles in the channel before increasing to full speed.when the eagle was in the vicinity of beacon,it became aware of the vickie which was between north and the coke dock.white testified that it was physically possible to stop the vickie at the coke dock at this time.by the time the eagle communicated with the vickie,the eagle had passed beacon.at that time,the eagle maintained an average ground speed of miles per hour.just before the allision,the eagle began corrective maneuvers for the bank suction and shear in the vicinity of the.
selinidis testified that he had been trying to raise the vickie by radio but received no response.he testified that the captain of the first ship in the convoy,the beryl,came on the radio and said that the vickie would not respond and was going to cause an accident.according to selinidis,immediately thereafter,white,the captain of the vickie,came on and said that he would pass the duval and meet selinidis and the eagle in one whistle,meaning that the two vessels would pass.white reportedly told selinidis that he had been running slow but would hook it up and get past the duval before selinidis reached that point.selinidis testified that he pleaded with white not to speed up but to go slow until the eagle cleared the duval.selinidis testified that he told white that the eagle was on dead slow speed and could not go any slower,and he asked white to let the eagle clear the duval.selinidis feared that if white tried to clear the duval,the wheel wash from the tugs,pushing perpendicular on the duval,would push the vickie in front of the eagle.
white testified that the vickie passed the beryl,the first ship in the convoy without incident at the coke dock.white explained that before he reached the coke dock,he could see the eagle way down the channel.he then passed two other inbound tugs.according to white,after he passed the beryl,he began trying to raise the eagle on the radio but he received no response.white was traveling at between seven and eight miles per hour and slowed down as he was coming to vessel repair.white testified that when the vickie was at vessel repair,he spoke with the pilot of the eagle,who told him that the eagle was running slow.according to white,they agreed that the vickie would speed up to pass the duval at the and that they would pass each other on one whistle.white testified that selinidis did not ask him to stop or slow down.
white increased his throttle to full and positioned the vickie as far to starboard as possible,towards the tugs that were pushing the duval.as white passed the second tug,he met the eagle.the vessels were then abeam of the duval at the.white testified that his vessel stayed on his side of the channel and did not cross the centerline but that the eagle was on white side of the channel.white passed the eagle without hitting it.
selinidis testified that the vickie was over the centerline of the channel,and he had to take evasive action by forcing the ship to starboard so that the vickie could pass on his port side and avoid a collision.the eagle then experienced a sheer to port.selinidis increased to full,tried to put the engines full astern,made a hard starboard rudder at the last minute and then ordered the anchors dropped.selinidis efforts were unsuccessful,and the allision occurred with the vessel repair drydock on the eagle port side.

iii.analysis 
the issues on appeal are whether the trial court clearly erred by failing to make a specific finding of proximate cause,and whether the trial court finding of negligence by the vickie resulted from an incorrect view of the navigational rules and a clear error in applying the navigational rules.a thorough review of the record and the highly deferential review afforded bench trials of admiralty actions leads this court to affirm the trial court findings and conclusions.the following findings of the trial court are pertinent to the issues on appeal.
finding of proximate cause 
we are persuaded that the trial court made sufficient findings to give this court a clear understanding of the factual basis for the decision.burma navigation reliant seahorse mv,cir.the trial court defined the duties of each vessel,specifically explained where each party breached those duties,made findings of negligence,and apportioned liability.although the trial court made no separate finding of proximate cause,it is implicit in the trial court negligence findings and apportioning of liability.see mclennan american eurocopter,cir noting that although the district court entered no actual finding of proximate cause concerning a negligence claim,such a finding was implicit in the court decision see also,brooks united states,cir explaining that a district court finding of facts in a bench trial must be specific enough to give appellate courts a clear understanding of the basis for the decision and to ensure that the district court has taken care in ascertaining the facts.in addition,luhr conceded during oral arguments that it may be a fair inference from the trial court findings that the vickie bore part of the responsibility for the vessels meeting in front of the at the same time.the trial court did not clearly err in its view of the evidence and we deduce proximate cause.
the failure of proper communication formed the basis of the negligence finding against the vickie.the trial court concluded that both selinidis and white were aware of the shortcomings in the channel,but it assigned most of the responsibility for the accident to selinidis,captain of the eagle.in apportioning fault,the trial court made the following findings of mixed law and fact.the channel narrows in the vicinity of because of significant shoaling over the years.selinidis had actual knowledge of the shoaling and other immediate hazards in the vicinity.as a result,selinidis kept the eagle on the centerline.the trial court determined that although the eagle was loaded with the most restrictive draft,crystal can not claim a superior position in the channel by assuming the risk of loading the vessel to that level.the eagle had no greater right to traverse the channel than any other vessel.the trial court explained that had the eagle been loaded to a more shallow draft,it would have had greater mobility in the channel.
when the eagle and the vickie first made radio contact,the vickie was past the coke dock.when the eagle told the vickie,it was traveling slow it was actually traveling at knots more than half speed.at that time,the vickie was traveling slower,at approximately knots.the eagle and the vickie agreed on a pass.the trial court concluded that the eagle proceeded upchannel at full speed without tugs and did not reduce its speed until it passed beacon.the eagle was to be met by the tugs,hermes and spartan before reaching beacon but the tugs were delayed with problems in docking the duval.given these conditions,the trial court found that the eagle should have reduced speed before beacon.
even though the eagle inaccurately described its speed,other vessels are required to rely on independent observations of facts.independent of the miscommunication between white and selinidis,white testified that around north,before he reached the coke dock,he could see the beryl.white further stated that way down the canal i could see him the eagle.way down the ship channel,is in that area i could see what appeared to be a ship down there.and i was trying to call the second the eagle i knew they was there.the first pilot of the beryl told me they was there.white further testified that as he was approaching vessel repair,he slowed down to approximately five miles per hour to accommodate some barges but still was unable to make contact with selinidis.at this point,white could see the second ship in the channel.white explained that it was not until he spoke with selinidis that he decided to hook it up.
the trial court implicitly found that the vickie failure to maintain proper communication and to observe relative speeds was the negligent conduct that in part caused the allision.the trial court found that both selinidis and white knew they had a duty,discussed infra,to rely on independent observations even if the information relayed to each other was accurate.the trial court found that independent of the communication between them,both selinidis and white knew that they would encounter traffic and docking facilities in the channel.rather than rely on their independent observations,the trial court found that selinidis and white both relied on their communication.the trial court further found that the accident would not have occurred had the two vessels not met where they did.luhr contends that it was the eagle misinformation that caused the vickie to hook it up,otherwise,the two vessels would not have met at the.the trial court explained the duty of each captain to rely on their independent observations regardless of their communication.in its oral argument,luhr confirmed that at the time the eagle described its speed,the vickie could see the eagle.the trial court explained the vickie duty,found that the vickie failed to adhere to that duty,and then apportioned liability.from these findings,this court can deduce a finding of proximate cause.
the trial court further noted that the east side of the channel was not obstructed by the duval,the two tugboats,or any other structure.the trial court speculated that had the eagle and vickie chosen a starboard to starboard pass,there would have been ample room for all vessels,even at the narrowest point near the facility.moreover,if the eagle had actually been proceeding at knots,slow when it passed beacon,and if the vickie did not speed up,the two vessels would not have met abeam of the facility.finally,if the eagle had an actual ground speed of knots,dead slow before reaching the,the allision might have been avoided entirely.thus,the trial court concluded that it was the failure of all vessels to establish prompt communication that foreclosed this opportunity.
luhr argues that the trial court failed to make a specific finding that any negligence assigned to the vickie was a proximate cause of the allision,that the vickie actions caused the eagle to lose its steering.specifically,luhr contends that the trial court findings that the bank suction would have been reduced and the allision probably would have been avoided if the eagle were going slower,and that the eagle began corrective maneuvers merely imply that a shear occurred rather than account for proximate cause.moreover,luhr asserts that the trial court finding that the eagle traveled near the centerline at all times with sixty to seventy feet of the vessel across the centerline negates any relationship with the eagle meeting with the vickie.we disagree with luhr theory of the incident.
the trial court did not specifically mention the cause of the sheer,but from selinidis testimony the trial court noted that the eagle hard starboard move and the resulting sheer most likely occurred as a result of the eagle maneuver to avoid the approaching vickie.selinidis testified that he took evasive action to avoid a collision with the vickie and to allow it to pass on his port side.a fair reading of the trial court decision is that the failures of both the vickie and the eagle constituted negligence and that together,their conduct was the proximate cause of the two vessels meeting at the,resulting in the damage to the drydock.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson city of bessemer city,d.the trial court view of the incident is not clearly erroneous.
