the owner of the vessel the kariba,and owners of cargo on the tricolor,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer.the district court found the kariba solely liable for a collision off the coast of dunkerque,france.we reverse and remand.
background 
a.the collision 
before dawn on december,three vessels,the kariba the kariba,the tricolor the tricolor and the clary the clary were navigating a traffic separation scheme tss in international waters north of dunkerque,france generally known as the english channel.at the relevant point of the tss,two branches intersect at approximately right angles,one branch cutting roughly,the other roughly.on the night in question,the fog was thick and visibility was low.the kariba was proceeding westward at about knots.the tricolor was also proceeding westward at knots,mile to the starboard aft of the kariba,and in the process of gradually overtaking her.at the same time,the clary was moving northward,along the intersecting branch of the tss,at knots,on a collision course with the kariba.
noticing that it was on a collision course,the clary planned to turn starboard and steer astern of the kariba.before the clary began to turn,however,the kariba initiated its own evasive maneuver.the kariba,seeking to avoid a collision with the perhaps unaware of the proximity of the an abrupt turn to starboard.the kariba struck the port side of the tricolor,rending the tricolor hull below its bridge.the tricolor along with its cargo then sank there were no human casualties.
in the leading up to the collision,none of the vessels sounded its foghorn or communicated with any other vessel via radio.
b.the collision from the perspective of the three different ships 
onboard the kariba 
the kariba is a bahamian flagged container ship,built in,with a carrying capacity of about standard containers.having left port in antwerp,belgium,the kariba was bound for le havre,france,and travelling westward in the branch of the tss.there were three men present on the bridge at the time of the collision captain kamola,making his first voyage as a master second officer szymanski and seaman ignacio.the bridge featured an automatic radar plotting aid arpa,described as a computer system that automatically tracks and plots target vessels and calculates their courses and speeds,thus predicting the closest point of approach of other vessels.
captain kamola first noticed the clary on his radar at.at,upon making a planned adjustment to his course by rounding a point called the fairy south buoy,captain kamola noticed he might be headed for a collision with the clary.captain kamola did not act,however,because he expected the clary to steer astern of him.at,when his arpa would have shown he was approximately miles and eight minutes away from colliding with the clary,captain kamola asked syzmanski to go onto the port wing of the ship and to check for the clary lights.after looking for approximately two minutes,syzmanski did not see anything.at this point,the kariba was miles away from a collision with the clary.
by,captain kamola radar still indicated the clary had not changed course.concerned about a collision,and now only miles away from a collision with the clary,captain kamola ordered a degree turn to starboard registered on the dunkerque radar at.fifteen or seconds later,captain kamola ordered another degree turn to starboard.seconds later,captain kamola saw the lights of the tricolor and ordered the rudder full to starboard.it was too late,however kamola exclaimed,oh my god,we will hit them.within the next minute or so,the kariba bow struck the tricolor broadside.the tricolor listed hard,capsized and sank.
onboard the tricolor 
built in,the tricolor was a norwegian flagged carrier,with a capacity to carry over cars.on the day of the collision,the tricolor was on a voyage from zeebrugge,belgium to southampton,england,and headed westward in the branch of the tss.there were three men on the bridge of the tricolor captain knutsen,second officer cabanda and seaman matel.
after,captain knutsen was aware of the kariba,as well as two other ships,ahead of him.at,captain knutsen noticed he was beginning to overtake the indeed,could see her lights.knutsen was also aware of the clary and its being on a collision course with the kariba.then suddenly,captain knutsen noticed the kariba had abruptly and without warning turned to starboard,and was heading straight for him.in the moments leading up to the collision,captain knutsen had the tricolor on autopilot.seeking to avoid the collision,captain knutsen and cabanda simultaneously converged on the wheel,hurriedly disengaged the autopilot and sent the vessel hard to starboard.despite their efforts,the kariba struck the tricolor,which listed hard,capsized and sank.
onboard the clary 
the clary,a singaporean flagged bulk carrier,was built in.on the day of the collision,the clary had been on a voyage from savannah,georgia to the netherlands.in the moments leading up to the collision,there was only one man on the bridge second officer toncic.while the clary bridge did not include an arpa system,it did have a device that calculated closest points of approach,but only for vessels selected by toncic.
by,second officer toncic noticed the tricolor and the kariba on his radar.by,if toncic had plotted the point of possible collision,he would have noticed that only miles separated the clary from the point of collision with the kariba.at,toncic decided it was time to make his starboard turn in order to pass astern the kariba and the tricolor,as suggested by basic navigational rules.according to the findings of the district court,toncic then moved away from his radar,plotted his position on the chart table,then disengaged his autopilot and made a dramatic turn to starboard.in making his turn dramatic,toncic had sought to ensure the maneuver would register on the radars of other ships.in their brief and at oral argument,counsel for the clary stated an appropriately dramatic turn would be or degrees in magnitude.by the time the clary turned to starboard,had the kariba been able to maintain its westward course,the two ships would have been only about two miles apart while both were on a collision course.two minutes later,toncic heard collision,collision,collision on his vhf radio.realizing the blips representing the kariba and the tricolor had coalesced and ceased to move,toncic readjusted his course to sail northward,west of the collided ships.toncic did not answer the distress call.
toncic later explained he thought the ships had only kissed.after passing through the area of the collision,toncic erased his chart.at trial,toncic admitted that someone had altered the clary logbook pages so as to reflect that conditions were clear,and that there were two other men on deck at the time of the able bodied seaman at the wheel,and a lookout.
c.the procedural posture 
in june,otal investments,the owner of the kariba hereinafter,otal and the kariba together will be called the kariba,filed a complaint in the southern district of new york seeking exoneration from or limitation of liability.see.et,replaced by,et,and.supplemental admiralty rule f.in response to this complaint,numerous claimants filed claims against the kariba,seeking damages for the loss of their cargo,which had sunk along with the tricolor hereinafter,the claimants will be called the cargo owners.meanwhile,the kariba impleaded the clary and the tricolor as defendants.
the kariba and the cargo owners settled their disputes before trial,and the tricolor agreed to resolve its disputes against the kariba in belgium.for the district court,this left only the disputes between the kariba and the cargo owners,on the one side,and the clary and the tricolor,on the other.after a bench trial,the court ruled in favor of the clary and the tricolor,finding the kariba to have been the sole cause of the collision.see in re otal investments,wl,dist.lexis at.
both the kariba and the cargo owners appealed from this judgment,seeking a reversal of the district court determination that the kariba was solely liable.the clary and the tricolor seek to preserve that decision.
ii.discussion 
a.the applicability of the rule in the pennsylvania 
all parties agree the substantive law governing this case derives from treaties ratified by the vessels flag states.specifically,the navigational duties are contained in the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea,codified by congress at,et the colregs.in addition,the parties have stipulated their claims should be adjudicated in accordance with the brussels convention for the unification of certain rules of law with respect to collisions between vessels,the collision convention.see in re otal investments,wl,dist.lexis.of course,while these treaties govern the substantive law,the law of the maritime procedural law.the mandu,cir in re seiriki kisen kaisha.
appellants the kariba and cargo owners argue this procedural law includes the rule in the pennsylvania.the rule in the pennsylvania,wall,is the subject of much debate.in its original form,it stated 
when a ship at the time of a collision is in actual violation of a statutory rule intended to prevent collisions,it is no more than a reasonable presumption that the fault,if not the sole cause,was at least a contributory cause of the disaster.in such a case the burden rests upon the ship of showing not merely that her fault might not have been one of the causes,or that it probably was not,but that it could not have been.
id.at.in other words,the rule operates in a manner reminiscent of negligence per se it establishes a presumption based on a statutory duty of care.unlike negligence per se,however,the rule in the pennsylvania creates a presumption only as to causation,and not as to fault or negligence.see george rutherglen,not with a bang but a whimper collisions,comparative fault and the rule of the pennsylvania,tul.originally,the rule in the pennsylvania stated quite a harsh presumption,requiring the party against whom the presumption operated to show their wrongdoing could not have been the cause.the pennsylvania,at.but since then,our circuit has interpreted the presumption more permissively now,a party must prove its wrongdoing could not have been the cause within the bounds of reasonable probability.the mabel,cir the aakre,cir nicholas healy joseph sweeney,the law of marine collision.widely criticized,the rule in the pennsylvania appears to be,today,rejected by all maritime states other than the united states.see marsden on collisions at sea ed.it is submitted that the critics of the pennsylvania rule are correct,and that it should be abrogated,either by the supreme court or by an act of congress.craig allen,farwell rules of the nautical road ed michael,the pennsylvania rule murky waters revisited,cardozo,rutherglen,tul.at william tetley,the pennsylvania anachronism the pennsylvania error,journal of maritime law comm.
the district court found the rule in the pennsylvania did not apply in this case.generally,the court held,united states courts will apply the collision convention when a collision occurs in international waters between vessels that fly flags of signatory states.in re otal investments,wl,at,dist.lexis at.article of that convention states a ll legal presumptions of fault in regard to liability for collision are abolished.if the rule in the pennsylvania is substantive,the court noted,article of the convention would override it.id.at,dist.lexis at.relying on the ninth circuit decision in ishizaki kisen united states,cir,the district court held that because the rule in the pennsylvania is outcome determinative,it must be substantive.in re otal investments,wl,at,dist.lexis at in re g g shipping.because it is substantive,the rule can not apply in a case where the collision convention governs.in re otal investments,wl,at,dist.lexis at.
we agree the rule in the pennsylvania is not a mere procedural rule it is,instead,substantive.the question of whether a rule is procedural or substantive depends on its effect at trial.the forum will apply its own local law in determining which party has the burden of going forward with the evidence unless the primary purpose of the relevant foreign rule is to affect decision of the issue rather than to regulate the conduct of the trial.restatement second of conflict of laws.under the rule in the pennsylvania,a vessel that violates a navigational rule not only must show that her fault did not cause the collision,but also must persuade the court that her own explanation of the collision is correct.ishizaki kisen,at citations omitted.this is an imposing burden.it does not serve simply to determine who moves forward with the evidence,or to narrowly regulate the conduct at trial.to the contrary,the rule in the pennsylvania is so significant as to substantially affect the decision of the issue of liability in a collision.moreover,the purpose of the rule in the pennsylvania extends beyond regulating evidentiary burdens at trial.as its author,justice strong,proclaimed,the rule is necessary to enforce obedience to the mandate of the statute,the pennsylvania,at,an aim that exceeds mere evidentiary concerns.
although it escaped the attention of the district court and the parties to this case,one of our precedents suggests our circuit may have adopted the view that the rule in the pennsylvania is a procedural rule.in the aakre,at,we determined whether a norwegian vessel stranded itself on cheney island in canada as the result of unseaworthiness or navigational error.ultimately,our decision rested on the strength of the standard of review we decided that none of the district court factual determinations was clearly erroneous,and the vessel was seaworthy.id.at.in arriving at this conclusion,we stated that questions surrounding the rule in the pennsylvania,in so far as they need affect this case,are easily settled.id.indeed,however the pennsylvania rule was originally stated,the history of its application shows that it has done no more than shift the burden of proof with regard to causality.id.but we believe the aakre does not control here simply because that panel statements concerning the pennsylvania constituted obiter dicta.moreover,these dicta largely concern the force of the not the distinct,though related,question of whether the rule is procedural.thus,the aakre does not detain us.we hold that under our modern conflict of laws jurisprudence,the rule in the pennsylvania is a substantive,not procedural,rule.
appellants cargo owners urge that even if the rule in the pennsylvania is substantive,it still should apply because the collision convention only abolished presumptions of fault and not presumptions of causation.this argument must fail.if the convention did refer only to fault,and not causative fault,appellants cargo owners argument still would lack traction.the parties to this case have agreed that various international instruments contain the substantive law in this case.if the rule in the pennsylvania is substantive,then appellants can not succeed by showing the collision convention does not abolish the rule in the pennsylvania.rather,appellants must show one of the instruments affirmatively embraces the rule in the pennsylvania.this,appellants have not done.thus the district court did not err in declining to apply the rule in the pennsylvania 
violation of the colregs 
having concluded the district court correctly declined to apply the rule in the pennsylvania,we now must consider whether the district court erred in finding the collision was the sole and exclusive fault of the kariba.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.the relevant navigational duties are contained in the colregs,a treaty ratified by the flag states of all we affirm the district court findings to the extent they determine that the kariba was responsible for the collision.we reverse,however,the findings that determined that the kariba was solely responsible,as well as the finding that the tricolor and the clary bore no responsibility for the collision.
the kariba 
we begin by noting that the kariba concedes it was at fault,but maintains that its fault was not the sole cause of the collision.we agree with both contentions.with regard to the kariba violations,we conclude the district court correctly assessed the kariba actions as violating colregs e and d on avoiding collision and turns.we affirm the district court determination that special circumstances did not inhere further,contrary to appellant kariba assertions,the district court did not apply colreg in its findings of liability.
cautious navigation 
colreg e requires vessels in conditions of restricted visibility to slow down or take all her way off and in any event navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.foll.e.instead of turning abruptly to starboard,the kariba should have slowed down until the danger of collision had passed.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.the district court gloss on rule e is correct as a matter of law and its underlying factual determinations are not clearly erroneous.
avoiding action 
the district court also determined the kariba violated colreg d ii,which states i f a situation is developing a risk of collision exists,then a vessel must avoid the collision,taking care not to steer toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam.foll.d.the district court found the kariba had steered directly into a vessel abaft its beam in violation of colreg d.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.the district court correctly interpreted rule d,and its underlying factual determinations are not clearly erroneous.
special circumstances 
at trial,the kariba attempted to justify its otherwise illegal turn by appealing to colreg b on special circumstances.colreg b states in construing and complying with these rules due regard shall be had to any special circumstances,including limitations of the vessels involved,which may make a departure from these rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.foll.the district court rejected the kariba defense,noting it is not at all unusual or special for three ships to pass the juncture of a tss simultaneously.moreover,the danger was not immediate insofar as several minutes separated the kariba from the expected collision.the district court did not err in applying colreg b,and its underlying factual findings are not clearly erroneous.
d.the applicability of colreg 
appellants cargo owners insist the district court erroneously applied colreg as between the kariba and the clary.colreg provides that when two vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision,the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way foll.this colreg only applies to vessels in sight of one another.foll.at one point in its opinion,the district court stated at trial,the testimony of every witness underscored the belief that the clary,as the ship in this crossing situation,was obligated to turn starboard.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.the court reference to the ship,the cargo owners argue,reveals that it erroneously applied colreg in substance,if not in name.this argument lacks merit.the district court did not apply colreg rather,the district court opinion,read as a whole,makes clear that the court understood the clary obligation to turn starboard derived from colreg d.
conclusion 
we affirm the district court in its findings of liability with respect to the kariba.
the tricolor 
we conclude the district court misinterpreted colregs and on overtaking,and colreg on safe speed.we clarify those rules and hold that,as a matter of law,the tricolor violated the rules on both overtaking and safe speed.
overtaking and overtaken vessels 
colreg states a ny vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.foll.a related rule,colreg,states every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall,so far as possible,take early and substantial action to keep well clear.foll.as the district court acknowledged,an overtaken vessel may make predictable adjustments in course and speed necessary for safe navigation.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.
some courts have suggested that the overtaking vessel not only must avoid predictable adjustments,but all adjustments,predictable or not.a district court in the fifth circuit typified the latter absolutist approach when it held that a leading vessel is under no obligation to keep out of the way.bockenheim unterweser reedereibeteiligungs schiffahrtsges,mbh voyager,construing the pilot rules for the western rivers,et,currently codified as part of the inland navigational rules,et.indeed,that court continued,t he overtaking vessel takes the risk of necessary alteration of course or checking of speed by the leading vessel to avoid a third vessel or stopping to let another vessel pass.id.we reject this absolutist approach.under colregs and,an overtaking vessel has a duty to maintain such a distance from the overtaken vessel so as to allow the overtaken vessel to conduct reasonably predictable adjustments.the iran torab,lloyd marsden.
we note further that rule does not govern only the conduct of vessels in an overtaking situation.it also governs the very choice to overtake.specifically,rule obliges an overtaking vessel to select a safe place to overtake another vessel in the first instance.healy sweeney tug ocean queen,tanker four lakes,finding because of the strong tide and the sharp bend in the hell gate,new york channel,it was unsafe to attempt to overtake.whether or not it is safe to attempt to overtake under colreg depends on contextual factors,including visibility,sea conditions,the space that confines the overtaking and overtaken vessels,the vessels speed and the vessels capabilities.
in this case,the district court found the tricolor did not violate colregs and in overtaking the kariba when positioned to miles off its starboard quarter.in analyzing the overtaking situation,the district court determined the overtaking vessel only needed to keep clear of the overtaken vessel predictable adjustments.to this extent,the district court correctly interpreted colregs and.the district court erred,however,in failing to consider whether the tricolor breached its colregs and duties in attempting to overtake the kariba in the first place or at least,in not adjusting its speed and course as it proceeded with the overtaking.here,the tricolor first became aware of the kariba at and at the tricolor captain noticed he was beginning to overtake her.at this point,the tricolor did not slow down but instead attempted to overtake the kariba in a fog,at knots,in a heavily trafficked tss,with the knowledge the kariba was on a collision course with a northbound vessel,the clary.we deem this a strikingly precarious situation attempting to overtake without slowing or altering course in anticipation of adjustments that the overtaken vessel reasonably could be expected to make in response to a third approaching vessel.we hold that as a matter of law,the tricolor violated colregs and in attempting to overtake under these conditions.
safe speed 
colreg states every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.foll.rule b restates this same rule in the context of restricted visibility conditions every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility.id.traveling at a safe speed is not just the fiat of colregs and b it is also a matter of good seamanship.the nordic ferry,lloyd,marsden.
whether a speed is safe depends on the circumstances.in determining safe speed,a vessel must take into account various factors,including visibility,a i,and traffic density,a ii,as well as vessels capabilities,a iii,sea conditions,a v,and draught relative to total depth,a vi.among other things,vessels with radar must consider the number,location and movement of vessels detected by radar.b v.traditionally,courts often analyzed the question of speed largely as a function of stopping distance.see union oil v.the san jacinto,d endorsing circumstantial application of the rule,which requires ships to travel at a speed permitting them to stop within half the distance the lookout could see ahead the cherokee,cir asking a ship to travel at such speed that she could stop within the full distance that she could see ahead.the conjunctive formulation avoid collision and be stopped of colreg suggests the colregs have preserved this emphasis on stopping distance.marsden.healy sweeney even suggest that under the colregs,courts must always apply the rule t o be considered safe,the vessel speed should generally be sufficiently slow to enable her to stop within half the limit of visibility.healy sweeney at.but the better view holds that safe speed does not depend on stopping distance alone,but on the peculiar circumstances of every case.to be sure,stopping distance is a major factor for considering whether a speed was safe and in considering the factor of stopping distance,a court might usefully consult the rule for frame of reference.ultimately,however,a court also must consider the full range of other factors,including visibility,sea conditions,traffic and the vessels capabilities in determining whether a vessel has violated colregs and b on safe speed.
in this case,the district court misinterpreted colregs and b on safe speed.the district court held that the tricolor speed was not unsafe because it was overtaking the kariba at a fairly low relative speed of knots.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.in reducing the question to one of relative speed only,the district court failed to consider the absolute speed of the tricolor,as well as all the relevant surrounding circumstances,such as visibility,traffic and stopping distance.in this case,the district court found the tricolor chose to overtake the kariba,to miles to its starboard,at the speed of knots.the tricolor did this under conditions of heavy fog,in a tss known for its traffic congestion,with the knowledge the kariba was on a collision course with the clary.the district court did not enter findings on the appropriate speed under the rule.nevertheless,we hold that as a matter of law,the tricolor speed under these conditions constituted a violation of colregs and b.
conclusion 
the district court erred in its determination of the tricolor liability.the tricolor violated colregs and on overtaking,and colregs and b on safe speed.
we affirm the district court determination that the clary violated colreg on proper lookout.the district court erred,however,in its interpretation and application of colreg d on avoiding action.further,the district court erred in failing to apply an important presumption regarding the unexplained alteration of logbooks.
proper lookout 
colreg states every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.foll.colreg a,concerning the ordinary practice of seamen encompasses this same command.foll.marsden.the district court held that the clary violated both of these colregs in staffing its bridge with a lone mariner.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.the district court correctly interpreted colreg and its factual determinations are not clearly erroneous.
avoiding action 
colreg d requires a vessel not in sight of another,upon entering or realizing a risk of collision,to take avoiding action in ample time foll.the ninth circuit has held that for large,ocean going vessels,objective estimates of range from two miles to almost five miles.alkmeon naviera,marina l,cir see also socony vacuum transp.gypsum packet,cir hellenic lines,prudential lines,cir finding that any passing distance under two miles is close quarters in a fog.
the district court sought to distinguish these cases t hese cases describe ships on the high seas where it is reasonable to expect vessels to remain further away from each other but the west hinder tss is a different story.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.the west hinder tss is heavily trafficked and despite the late hour there were quite a few other vessels in the area.it would be naive to assume that a vessel was obligated to maneuver when it was ten or more minutes away from collision,because to avoid one collision could serve only to put it on a collision course with another.id.at,dist.lexis at footnote omitted.
we reject this reasoning.most important,it contains a faulty premise it was not the case that if the clary turned ten minutes before the collision such could serve only to put it on a collision course with another vessel.to the contrary,the record discloses a number of alternative by starboard turns of various degrees and reduction of of which would have entailed colliding with another vessel.moreover,in focusing on the term,the district court failed to interpret correctly colreg d.colreg d functions to prevent collisions by urging action at an early stage,requiring vessels to take avoiding action in ample time whenever a risk of collision exists or a situation is developing emphases added.in this case,the risk of collision arose when the kariba steadied on its westward course after rounding the fairy south buoy.at this ten minutes before the kariba decided to make its fateful clary had a colreg d duty to take avoiding action.
the avoiding action under colreg d could have taken either one of two basic forms.first,the clary could have slowed.second,the clary could have made a starboard turn astern the kariba and the tricolor.the clary argues it made its starboard turn at the earliest possible moment because it was limited by its desire to make a dramatic or degree turn so that its change of course would register on other vessels radar.at the same time,asserts the clary,the colregs prohibited it from crossing outside the bounds of the tss.the point at which it actually turned,the clary notes,was the earliest point at which it could make a dramatic turn while staying within the bounds of the tss.
this argument is unpersuasive.certainly,the avowed custom of making a dramatic or degree turn is wise.but nothing in the colregs mandates a turn of this magnitude the colregs only mandate avoidance.thus it makes no sense for a vessel to try to reach the magical degree angle,all while increasing the risk of collision ahead.further,the colregs do not prohibit turns that lead a vessel to cross out of a tss.according to colreg,vessels must so far as practicable keep clear of a traffic separation line or separation zone.foll.b ii.n ormally,a vessel should join or leave a traffic lane at the termination of the lane b iii.the conspicuous qualifying language normally,so far as practicable demonstrates the relative flexibility of colreg.colreg even includes guidance for those obliged to cross out of a tss those who do so shall cross on a heading as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.c.see also marsden opining that vessels must balance the risk of staying within the tss against the risk of crossing out of it.in other words,the text of colreg specifically anticipates that vessels sometimes must cross out of the tss.it is clear from the record the clary faced no particular risks in crossing out of the tss while there was traffic in the tss,no vessels were proceeding on the branch near the clary.meanwhile,the clary encountered great risk in continuing on its collision course with the risk that contributed to the collision in this case.
we hold,therefore,that the clary violated colreg d in failing to take avoiding action promptly.as soon as the kariba steadied on its collision course with the clary,the clary could have reduced its speed or made a starboard turn astern the kariba and the tricolor.in making this starboard turn,the clary could have chosen to make a shallow turn of perhaps or degrees and stayed within the bounds of the tss.alternatively,the clary could have executed a or degree starboard turn that would have led it to cross out of the bounds of the tss.in failing to take either type of avoiding action,the clary,as a matter of law,violated colreg d.
unexplained alterations of ships records 
appellants the kariba and cargo owners note the clary logbooks had been altered.the district court gave no legal effect to this fact it is true that the clary was at best sloppy and at worst dishonest in its,but none of these violations appear causative of the collision.in re otal investments,wl,at,dist.lexis at.although the alteration of the logbook obviously did not cause the collision,the fact of the alteration has relevance to the ultimate allocation of liability for damages.
our admiralty jurisprudence is especially sensitive to the unexplained alteration of logbooks.where a logbook is altered,we can not avoid the conclusion that it had been dressed up to excuse the ship faults.warner barnes kokosai kisen kabushiki kaisha,cir learned hand.such alterations should give rise to a presumption the logbook contained entries adverse to the vessel contentions at trial.the inference goes much further than merely to discredit the document itself it is positive evidence upon the very issue of liability.id.when a party is once found to be fabricating,or suppressing,documents,the natural,indeed the inevitable,conclusion is that he has something to conceal,and is conscious of guilt.id.we join the fifth circuit the unexplained alteration of a ship record of maneuvers not only casts suspicion on the whole case of the vessel,but creates a strong presumption that the erased matter was adverse to her contention.tokio marine fire ins.flora mv,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also hal antillen mount ymitos ms,cir the silver palm,cir the etruria,cir andros shipping panama canal,craig allen at healy sweeney.much of the case law concerning unexplained alteration of logbooks emphasizes the distinct force of the attendant adverse presumption.the presumption is a strong one because it serves not only to engender truth in evidence,but also to deter vessels from engaging in an act of obfuscation that threatens the disposition of interests of vessel and cargo owners and impedes civil and criminal investigations into the cause of the collision.see,requiring the reporting of marine casualties within united states jurisdiction granting the coast guard the power to subpoena vessels logbooks united states kostakis,cir reviewing the guilty plea and sentence of a merchant mariner prosecuted under for using a falsified ship record within the jurisdiction of the united states coast guard.this presumption is a rule of evidence as an evidentiary rule of the forum,it applies in this case.
here,toncic erased his chart after passing through the area of the collision.at trial,toncic admitted that someone had altered his logbook pages so as to reflect that there were three men on deck at the time of the,an able bodied seaman at the wheel,and a in fact,toncic had been alone on the bridge at the relevant times.in addition,toncic logbook reflected that conditions were clear,when conditions in fact had least for part of his.
toncic admissions sharply diminish,if not eliminate,the relevance of the presumption normally arising from the alteration of a logbook.the presumption is especially useful in cases where the facts that should have been entered are not known,or at least are in dispute.see,tokio marine fire ins.flora,wl,dist.lexis,general trading hellenic carrier,dist.lexis,april.here,however,those facts are known,indeed,admitted by the clary officer.thus,as to these facts,which were deemed adverse to the clary by the district court,the presumption would add nothing.in some cases an issue might arise as to whether the fact of an alteration gives rise to a presumption that facts,other than those concealed by the alteration,are adverse to the party responsible for the alteration,but none of the parties adverse to the clary has made such a claim in this case.thus,although the fact of alteration may have a bearing on the ultimate issue of allocation of liability for damages,the presumption that the logbook contains facts adverse to the vessel responsible for the alteration need not be assessed 
conclusion 
the district court correctly determined the clary violated colreg on proper lookout.the district court erred in its interpretation and application of colreg d on avoiding action as a matter of law,the clary violated colreg d.the clary alteration of its logbook will have some bearing on the ultimate issue of allocating liability for damages and the district court must take it under consideration.
there remains the question whether these violations of colregs caused the collision.put another way,we still must determine whether the violations of the colregs constitute causative fault.we review findings of causation for clear error.ching sheng fishery united states,cir.yet,a district court understanding of the standard of causation is a question of law,reviewed de novo.id.at.in its decision,the district did not articulate a standard of causation.though we do not quarrel with the district court reticence in this regard,we do infer from the district court reasoning that it applied an incorrect legal standard of causation.to the extent the district court unspoken conception of the standard might have been correct,we deem its findings on causation to have been clearly erroneous.typically,in a case exhibiting such an error,we would remand for further fact finding.we believe,however,that this case presents a record sufficiently,and circumstances so paradigmatic,as to allow us to render conclusions concerning causation as a matter of law.we do so,after framing the proper standard of causation.
the proper standard of causation 
the standard of causation under colregs and the collision convention mirrors the standard of causation under american maritime tort law.marsden see,tokio marine,at.to show causation,a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant act was a factual or cause of a harm and the defendant act proximately caused the harm.see zuchowicz united states,cir calabresi,thoughtfully discussing the general requirements of causation in the context of connecticut law draft restatement third of torts.
an action is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent that action.draft restatement third of torts.put more concretely,a navigational error is a factual cause of a collision when the collision would not have suffered the damage but for the defendant error.marsden.factual cause may inhere even when the actions of a third party or another force intervene.zuchowicz,at.
the inquiry into proximate cause is less straightforward.in general,proximate cause limits liability to those harms whose risks made the actor conduct tortious.draft restatement third of torts.beyond this,t he requirements of proximity are many and varied,and are not simply linked to questions of closeness in time and space.zuchowicz,at.we find one principle particularly pertinent to this case.when an actor tortious conduct is a factual cause of harm that is among the harms whose risks made the actor conduct tortious,the actor is subject to liability for the harm even if an unforeseeable intervening act,including a nonculpable human act,is also a factual cause of the harm.draft restatement third of torts a.an actor will not be liable,however,for a superceding is,an act that is extraordinary,defined as neither normal nor reasonably foreseeable.exxon sofec,cir quotation marks omitted aff exxon sofec,d.in applying a principle such as this,courts necessarily exercise common sense and reasonable judgment.blaine richards marine indemnity ins.company of america,cir discussing the somewhat more restricted doctrine of causation applicable to maritime insurance cases.
the district court did not articulate a standard of causation.but in summating its causation analysis,the district court implied a relatively narrow framework there may have been other faults which led up to this single fault of the kariba turn,but none w as causative.otal,wl,at,dist.lexis at.this statement,coupled with the district court failure to articulate a causation standard,leads us to believe that it erred in conceiving the standard of causation to the extent the district court conceived the correct standard,we hold that its findings are clearly erroneous.we principally track the doctrine of and proximate causation as embodied by a of the draft restatement and sofec,at,in analyzing the causative actions of the kariba,the tricolor and the clary in turn.
the causative impact of the kariba 
the district court correctly found the kariba to have caused the collision.if the kariba had not made its turn,the collision with the tricolor would not have occurred the vessels would have continued on roughly parallel westward courses.therefore,the kariba turn was a factual cause of the collision.
as noted above,the district court correctly determined this turn constituted a violation of the colregs.this abrupt turn caused a risk that the kariba might collide with other vessels in close same risk of harm as makes turns illegal under the colregs.no extraordinary action occurred thereafter.thus the district court was correct to consider the kariba violation a cause of the collision.
the causative impact of the tricolor 
as for the tricolor,the district court erred in failing to find its violations to have caused the collision.if the tricolor had not chosen to overtake in an unsafe place and in an unsafe manner,the collision would not have occurred the kariba would have passed across the tricolor bow.the tricolor decision to overtake and the manner of overtaking was thus a factual cause of the collision.
as noted above,the tricolor violated the colregs in choosing to overtake the kariba at an unsafe place and time and in an unsafe manner.this choice to overtake created a risk that other vessels,particularly the kariba,would have less space,and less time,to avoid navigational exigency leading to a very same risk as makes inopportune overtaking a violation of the colregs.the kariba and the clary themselves might have increased the risk of collision to which the tricolor contributed,but these actions were not extraordinary.rather,these actions or similar actions intended to avoid a collision were foreseeable under the circumstances,and thus did not supercede the tricolor causative impulse.commonsense and reasonable judgment dictate the tricolor was both a factual and proximate cause of the collision.we thus hold,as a matter of law,the tricolor overtaking was a cause of the collision.
it is possible the tricolor also caused the collision through its violation of the colreg on safe speed.here,however,a distinction must be made.true,the tricolor violation of the colreg on safe speed was a cause of the collision if the tricolor had been travelling slower,the kariba would have turned safely in front of its bow.but under the familiar berry sugar notch borough,line of cases,we nevertheless can not consider the factor of the tricolor speed,when taken in isolation,to have caused the collision.as we have consistently reaffirmed,under berry sugar notch borough,the issue is whether,even after the event,we can say that the risk of such an accident was increased by the defendant behavior.moore painewebber,cir calabresi,concurring.zuchowicz,at.in this case,the tricolor unsafe speed,taken in isolation,is not the kind of transgression that leads a vessel to find itself in close proximity to another,abruptly turning vessel.in this sense,the tricolor unsafe speed alone did not stand as a cause of the collision.
yet,the berry sugar notch line of cases notwithstanding,the tricolor unsafe speed still might have been a cause of the collision.this question hinges entirely on whether the tricolor,had it not been proceeding at an unsafe speed,would have been able to stop soon enough to avert or mitigate the harm of the collision.in other words,the question hinges not on the factor of the tricolor speed in isolation,but whether that speed reflected an inability to stop,or slow,in time to avoid the kariba abrupt turn.as the record does not reveal the answer to this question,we must remand for further findings.
the causative impact of the clary 
the district court also erred in failing to find the clary caused the collision.if the clary had not understaffed its bridge and failed promptly to take avoiding action,the collision would not have occurred.that is,the clary would not have persisted in its collision course,and the kariba would not have found the need to make its fateful turn.the clary was thus a factual cause of the collision.as noted above,the clary violated the colregs in failing to keep a proper lookout.in failing to keep a proper lookout,the clary created a risk it could not swiftly and adequately compensate for a navigational exigency and avoid a same risk of harm as makes failure to keep a proper lookout a violation of the colregs.the clary also violated the colregs in failing promptly to take avoiding action.in delaying its avoiding action,the clary constrained the space and time in which the kariba and the tricolor could maneuver,thus creating a risk of same risk of harm as makes failure to take prompt avoiding action a violation of the colregs.the kariba and the tricolor themselves might have increased the risk of collision to which the clary only contributed,but their actions were not so extraordinary as to supercede the clary causative impact.commonsense and reasonable judgment dictate the clary was both a factual and proximate cause of the collision.we thus hold,as a matter of law,the clary violations were a cause of the collision.
conclusion 
the district court correctly held the kariba violations of the colregs to have been a cause of the collision.the district court erred,however,in determining the tricolor and the clary violations of the colregs did not cause the collision.in reversing,we conclude all three vessels committed violations of the colregs that caused the collision.it is unclear whether the tricolor unsafe speed was a cause of the collision to the extent the answer to that question requires further findings,the district court must make those findings as part of its inquiries into allocation of liability for damages,an issue to which we now turn.
allocation of liability for damages 
since we have ruled that all three vessels were at fault and that,at least to some extent,their respective fault caused the collision,the issue remains for the district court on remand to allocate liability for damages among the three vessels.in united states reliable transfer,d,the supreme court replaced the admiralty rule of equally divided damages with a rule that when two or more parties have contributed by their fault to cause property damage in a maritime collision or stranding,liability for such damage is to be allocated among the parties proportionately to the comparative degree of their fault,unless such measurement is not possible.id.at.the phrase degree of their fault created an ambiguity as to whether the court meant the comparative degree of their culpability or blameworthiness,how extensively each ship departed from a proper standard of care,or the comparative causative effect of each ship conduct,the extent to which each ship culpable conduct contributed to causing the collision.american courts have understood reliable transfer to mean liability according to relative culpability of the parties actions rather than their respective degrees of physical causation.afran transport maria venizelos,see maritime mercantile international united states,wl,dist.lexis,in re seiriki kisen kaisha.at collecting cases.
however,as judge sand pointed out in seiriki kisen kaisha,article of the collision convention,which allocates liability in proportion to the degree of the faults respectively committed,has been understood by the courts of great britain to assess comparative fault on the basis of both relative culpability and relative causative effect of each party acts.id.at citing cases.courts in france,germany,and italy have done the same.see healy sweeney at.we agree with judge sand analysis in seiriki kisen kaisha,followed by judge baer in the pending appeal,otal,wl.at,dist.lexis at,and interpret the convention,which applies in the pending case,to require consideration of both culpability and causative effect.
thus,on remand the district court will have to consider the relative culpability of each vessel and the relative extent to which the culpability of each caused the collision.in making the culpability comparison,the district court should include in its consideration of the fault of the clary the fact that its logbook was altered.we
