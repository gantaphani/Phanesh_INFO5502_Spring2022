this case concerns an injury to a sea captain and the subsequent settlement of his claims by the plaintiffs.the present appeal arises out of the plaintiffs attempt to recover the sums paid to settle the maritime personal injury action.specifically,the plaintiffs seek indemnity,contribution and equitable subrogation from the defendants,who allegedly constructed,designed or maintained the defective foodlift that caused the injury.the crucial question below was whether dutch law or federal maritime law applied to the action.the district court,finding in favor of dutch law,dismissed the action,determining on summary judgment that the claims were barred by a statute of repose.
the first set of issues presented before this court revolve around a shipbuilding agreement entered into between the shipowner plaintiff and the shipbuilder defendant.two provisions within the shipbuilding agreement are particularly relevant a dutch choice of law clause and a limitation of liability provision.we first look at whether either of these two provisions govern any of the claims.if so,we then determine the effects the applicable provision has on those claims.
as a signatory to the agreement,the shipowner is the only plaintiff who is potentially bound by the dutch choice of law provision.the broad wording of that choice of law provision indicates that it is applicable to the shipowner claims against the shipbuilder.in any event,whether dutch law applies to the shipowner claims is ultimately immaterial because the agreement limitation of liability provision explicitly prevents the shipowner from recovering consequential damages or other indirect damages,effectively barring the shipowner claims against either the shipbuilder as well as the because of another,related clause in the agreement.
the second set of issues presented before this court center on those claims that are wholly independent of the shipbuilding agreement.with respect to those claims,it must first be determined whether they are governed by dutch law,federal maritime law,or a third jurisdiction law.the substance of the applicable law must then be analyzed in order to find whether such law would bar the action as untimely.the other plaintiffs include the ship on which the sea captain was injured,the ship manager and the injured sea captain maritime employer.
the claims brought against the dutch shipbuilder and designer by the plaintiffs who are to the shipbuilding agreement are governed by dutch law because the netherlands would have an interest in the resolution of those disputes,whereas the united states has little or no such interest.moreover,the plaintiffs have failed to provide relevant information regarding other possibly interested jurisdictions.
a review of dutch law indicates that the claims that are based on a strict liability theory are barred by the dutch statute of repose.however,the plaintiffs also allege general tort claims.for these claims,dutch law provides a separate statute of limitations.that statute of limitations allows the general tort claims to proceed.
finally,federal maritime law applies to the claims against the dutch shipbuilder and designer american affiliate,which is incorporated in the united states,making all claims against that defendant timely.
factual background 
on the or of july,jameson cooper cooper,the captain of a motor yacht named the meduse the meduse,was injured when the ship dumbwaiter or foodlift referred to by the parties as the foodlift landed on his leg,causing severe injuries.according to cooper,the accident occurred while he was attempting to retrieve some of his clean laundry that had become lodged in a space between the floor of the foodlift and the ship deck.in an effort to free the clothes,cooper placed his left foot on the floor of the foodlift and his right foot on the deck of the meduse.at the moment that he was able to free the articles of clothing,the foodlift fell,injuring his leg.the meduse was located somewhere in the red sea at the time of the accident.
de vries scheepsbow de vries is the entity that constructed the meduse for meridian yachts ltd meridian.de voogt,de voogt is the entity that de vries subcontracted to design the ship.de vries and meridian entered into a shipbuilding agreement the agreement on january,which governed the purchase and manufacture of the vessel.the agreement,which was written in english,was executed by meridian as buyer and de vries as builder.the ship was built in the netherlands and was delivered to meridian on january.the delivery,according to appellees,took place at a dutch seaport.the parties further agreed that the ship shakedown cruise would be to waters off north america and that when the meduse arrived in florida waters,de vries would send a finish crew to resolve any issues that became apparent during that cruise.final payment for the meduse was to be made in florida after the finish crew completed its job.
the shipbuilding agreement contains four relevant clauses.article has a choice of law provision 
this agreement,and all disputes arising out of or in connection with it,shall be construed in accordance with and shall be governed by the dutch law.
the agreement also contains a limitation of liability provision in article.its critical language provides 
t he builder shall have no liability whatsoever for any loss or damage directly arising from the defectiveness or deficiency of parts except if resulting from intentional conduct or gross negligence of the builder or his servants.liability of the builder for loss of business,loss of profits,consequential damages or other indirect damage,however,is always excluded 
additionally,article of the agreement appears to permit to take advantage of the limitation of liability provision.it provides 
all exonerations and limitations of liability stipulated in favor of any party,shall also apply in favor of the servants,and suppliers of such party and of those directly or indirectly contracted by and suppliers.
however,another clause in the agreement,article,appears to prevent from benefitting from any portion of the agreement by stating 
nothing in this agreement,whether express or implied,is intended to confer any benefits,rights or remedies on any person other than the parties to this agreement.
the meduse was and is registered in the cayman islands.the ship travels worldwide and has docked in south florida as well as at other ports in the united states.meridian,which both originally purchased and currently owns the meduse,is a business entity organized under the laws of the british virgin islands.vulcan maritime ltd vulcan employer,cooper employer at the time of his accident,is a british virgin islands corporation.vulcan,vulcan manager,which was alleged by cooper to have been the manager of the meduse and its crew at the time of his accident,is incorporated in the state of the four appellants allege it has its principal place of business vulcan manager and vulcan employer are referred to as the vulcan appellants and meridian,the meduse,and the vulcan appellants together are referred to as appellants or the four appellants the four appellants state in their briefs that,as alleged by the plaintiff cooper in his complaint,meridian and vulcan employer have their principal places of business in florida.in their answer to cooper complaint,however,the four appellants had denied these allegations.the four appellants also claim that they are all beneficially owned by a citizen and that a citizen is president of meridian,vulcan manager and vulcan employer.however,in their answer to cooper amended complaint,they denied the existence of that beneficial owner and denied cooper allegation that the owner was personally involved in hiring cooper and regularly gave orders to cooper regarding the meduse movements,itinerary and operational budget.
the shipbuilder and appellees,de vries and de voogt,are both foreign corporations with their principal places of business in the netherlands de vries and de voogt are referred to as the dutch shipbuilding appellees.the four appellants allege that the dutch shipbuilding appellees,along with their american affiliate,feadship america,feadship america,conduct business in the united states under a market consortium or a joint venture known as feadship,which maintains a local office in florida de vries,de voogt and feadship america are referred to as appellees.specifically,the four appellants allege that,as part of the feadship venture,the dutch shipbuilding appellees design,manufacture,market,sell and distribute feadship yachts,including the meduse.
feadship america is a florida corporation with its principal place of business in florida.the four appellants allege that the feadship venture conducts business in the through feadship america,and that feadship america takes part in the sale and distribution of feadship designed and manufactured yachts.the four appellants,however,never allege that feadship america ever participated specifically in the sale or distribution of the meduse.feadship website,under the heading feadship america,advertises that over half of its clients are based in the united states and that its florida office serves as a base of operations for feadship people who travel to the united states from the netherlands.the website further states,under the heading feadship holland,that feadship was established in by de vries,de voogt and royal van lent,all dutch entities,and that feadship head office is located in haarlem,netherlands where it shares offices with de voogt.de vries and royal van lent each own fifty percent of feadship america stock.according to appellees,the foodlift was designed,manufactured and installed in de vries shipyard by a dutch company called lifttechniek,which is not a party to this action.appellees further claim that feadship america had nothing to do with the sale,manufacture or design of the meduse.
procedural history 
on october,cooper filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of florida the district court seeking damages for the injuries he suffered onboard the meduse.cooper asserted a claim for general maritime unseaworthiness against meridian as owner of the ship and against the meduse in rem.cooper further alleged a claim for jones act against vulcan maritime ltd as his maritime employer and a general maritime negligence claim against vulcan,as the manager of the meduse and its crew.
on july,the four appellants filed a complaint against de vries,the shipbuilder,de voogt,the designer of the ship,and feadship america,their american affiliate.the four appellants sought to hold them liable for any damages that could potentially be awarded to cooper.the amended complaint alleges that the foodlift that injured cooper was designed,installed,constructed,manufactured and inspected by one or more of the appellees.the four appellants claim that by negligently placing the defective foodlift in the stream of commerce,appellees breached an independent duty they owed to cooper,making them liable to the four appellants for indemnity,contribution and equitable subrogation under federal maritime law.the complaint,however,does not commit itself to a particular theory of liability,referencing both negligence and strict liability.
on november,the four appellants settled cooper personal injury action and the case remained pending only with respect to the four appellants claims against the dutch shipbuilding appellees and feadship america,their american affiliate.following settlement,the four appellants filed an amended complaint seeking recovery of the sums paid to cooper.there is nothing in the record evidencing either the total amount of the payment to cooper or the individual amounts paid by each of the four appellants.thus,it is not clear which,if any,of the four appellants would be entitled to a judgment in favor of their right to indemnity,contribution and equitable subrogation.
on november,appellees moved for summary judgment.on june,the district court held that because the agreement between meridian and de vries governed the construction of the meduse,including the allegedly defective foodlift,meridian claims,which arose out of or in connection with the agreement,were subject to the agreement dutch choice of law provision contained in article.therefore,claims brought by meridian,the only one of the four appellants who was a signatory to the agreement,were barred by the dutch statute of repose.the decision neither discussed whether dutch law actually contained a statute of repose or whether the statute of repose was applicable to meridian claims because the four appellants never contested the substance of appellees presentation of dutch law.in the alternative,the district court found that meridian claims were also barred by the limitation of liability clause in article of the agreement.
the district court further noted that,under some circumstances,closely related entities may be bound by the terms of an agreement even if they were.however,the court declined to analyze whether any of the remaining appellants were also bound by the choice of law provision contained in article,finding instead that dutch law applied to bar all of the claims without regard to the agreement.the district court,after looking at several other factors,placed the greatest weight on where the wrongful act occurred,and found that dutch law applied to all four appellants claims because that is where the ship and the allegedly defective foodlift were built.the court,therefore,granted the summary judgment motion,finding that the claims for indemnity,contribution and equitable subrogation were barred by the dutch statute of repose.

a.the shipbuilding agreement effect on the claims 
we turn to the effect,if any,that the agreement has on the four appellants claims.first,we discuss whether the agreement dutch choice of law and limitation of liability provisions control the claims brought by meridian,the shipowner,against de vries,the shipbuilder,the agreement only two signatories.if either one of these provisions controls,we then evaluate whether and to what extent they alter meridian ability to recover.second,we look to see whether the remaining appellants and the appellees are either bound by or have the ability to take advantage of these provisions,which were set out in a contract they never signed.
meridian shipowner de vries shipbuilder the signatories to the agreement 
the only two parties in this action that signed the agreement were meridian,the shipowner,and de vries,the shipbuilder.as a signatory,meridian claims against de vries are governed by both the dutch choice of law provision and the limitation of liability provision.
dutch choice of law provision 
with respect to the issue of what law governs,meridian does not argue that the agreement choice of law provision is invalid.instead,the shipowner asserts that,because its claims for indemnity,contribution and equitable subrogation are not disputes arising out of or in connection with the agreement,the choice of law provision does not apply to those causes of action.in determining whether a choice of law clause contained in a contract between two parties also governs tort claims between those parties,a court must first examine the scope of the provision.see green leaf nursery dupont de nemours,cir.a choice of law provision that relates only to the agreement will not encompass related tort claims.id.at.for example,a provision providing that t his release shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of x,will be construed narrowly as it only purports to govern the agreement itself and does not refer to any and all claims or disputes arising out of the agreement.id.
the provision at issue here,however,is clearly meant to be read broadly.the provision provides that all disputes arising out of or in connection with the agreement shall be construed in accordance with and shall be governed by the dutch law.such a provision purports to govern all disputes having a connection to the agreement and not just the agreement itself.although pursued as an action,meridian claims are based on its allegation that the foodlift constructed by de vries,as part of the agreement,was negligently or defectively manufactured.such an action is necessarily connected to the agreement.see int l underwriters ag liberty,triple i int l,cir w here the dispute occurs as a fairly direct result of the performance of contractual duties,then the dispute can fairly be said to arise out of or relate to the contract in question.quoting telecom italia,spa wholesale telecom,cir alteration in original.accordingly,meridian claims against de vries fall under the choice of law provision and are therefore governed by dutch law.
before the district court,however,the parties were less than helpful in explicating the content of dutch law.the four appellants argue that the evidence introduced by appellees concerning the dutch statute of repose was insufficient to demonstrate the untimeliness of their claims in support of their summary judgment motion,appellees presented the affidavit of a netherlands attorney that stated 
u nder dutch law any product liability claim would have become timebarred by virtue of article,paragraph providing for an absolute extinction of such claim after the lapse of years after the day the product came into circulation.accordingly,such claim would have become timebarred in any case by january,as meduse was delivered on january.
the affidavit,however,is incomplete.specifically,it failed to apprise the district court of the separate statute of limitations that dutch law creates for negligence claims as opposed to claims on the basis of strict liability our independent review of dutch law confirms that,while a strict products liability action is untimely when brought more than ten years after the defective product was first put into circulation,there is a separate limitations period from the date of injury for negligence claims this research confirms the untimeliness of meridian claims against de vries,to the extent that such claims allege strict liability under article of the dutch civil code.specifically,article,paragraph of the dutch civil code provides that t he liability referred to in article,paragraph extends to a damage caused by death or personal injuries the civil code of the netherlands hans warendorf,richard thomas ian,kluwer law international.the current action falls squarely within this definition because it seeks to recover damages caused by cooper injuries resulting from the allegedly defective foodlift.furthermore,article,paragraph provides a statue of repose for all strict products liability actions brought pursuant to article,including a action for indemnity and contribution 
the right to damages of the injured person against the producer pursuant to article,paragraph is extinguished on expiry sic of ten years from the beginning of the day following that on which the producer put the thing which caused the damage into circulation.the same applies to the right of a third person who is also liable for the damage,with respect to his right of recourse against the producer.
id.at.thus,meridian strict products liability claim was extinguished under dutch law because the complaint was filed more than ten years after the delivery of the meduse.
moreover,the four appellants presented no evidence on the dutch law statute of repose that would demonstrate the timeliness of an action for strict products liability brought under article if they had a contrary view of dutch law,it was their duty to present such law to this court.cont l technical,rockwell int l,cir stating that having the power to take notice of state law does not mean that federal courts must scour the law of a foreign state for possible arguments a a claimant with have made.having failed to do so,we rely on our research of foreign law for this point,which indicates that meridian is from bringing a claim under a strict liability theory.
although appellees have established that meridian strict products liability claim is,they have failed to explain why meridian can not take advantage of the separate limitations period recognized under dutch law for general tort claims.dutch law further indicates that the statute of limitations for actions brought under the general tort provisions,pursuant to article of the dutch civil code,expires five years from the day after cooper sustained his injuries.klaas bisschop sjoerd meijer,netherlands,the international comparative legal guide to product liability global legal group a cause of action for damages on the basis of an unlawful act can not be brought after a lapse of five years after the commencement of the day following the day on which the aggrieved party became aware of both the damage and of the person or legal entity liable.in any event an action can not be brought after a lapse of twenty years following the event that caused the damage.accordingly,meridian claims are not if brought as general tort claims,negligence.dennis campbell christian campbell,international product liability under dutch common tort rules,the general extinction period is twenty years after the damage causing event.therefore,if a victim can no longer file a claim based on strict products liability,he can submit a claim based on the general tort provisions.however,in that event,he is not able to benefit from the strict liability imposed on the producer and is to prove fault.
limitation of liability provision 
in any event,we conclude that the limitation of liability clause in article precludes all of meridian claims against the shipbuilder and,by virtue of article,the as the choice of law provision provides that the agreement is governed by dutch law,we must also interpret article under dutch law.see green leaf nursery,at.the only guidance on whether this clause is enforceable under dutch law was presented in an affidavit submitted by appellees,which stated that 
under dutch law,the exclusions and limitations of liability set forth in article of the agreement,specifically and explicitly agreed upon between two companies,are fully valid.freedom of contract is the basis of dutch civil law and there exists no provision in the dutch civil code prohibiting such exclusions or limitations of liability as agreed between de vries and meridian.
t he agreement expressly excludes liability for consequential and other indirect damage,and all the claims fall under this category under dutch law.under dutch law sic,this limitation is as well fully acceptable.this also follows from standing jurisprudence,also from the dutch supreme court,hr july,nj,in which case the validity of exclusion of liability for consequential and indirect damage was again confirmed.
normally,an affidavit from an attorney on foreign law would be sufficient to establish the substance of that law.while it no doubt would make our task easier to simply accept this representation of dutch law,we have doubts about this source on dutch law,considering the affidavit incomplete,if not inaccurate,representations concerning the dutch statute of repose.furthermore,on the issue of limitation of liability,the affidavit gives no citation to any provision of the dutch civil code and relies on one dutch supreme court case,which impliedly would support its position but fails to provide a copy and translation of that opinion.moreover the affidavit reference to standing jurisprudence is not explained.
although we endeavored to conduct independent research of dutch law on this issue,we were unsuccessful.unlike the issue of the scope of the dutch statute of repose,we were unable to find any materials in english on the limitation of liability issue.accordingly,we follow the usual rule where the parties have not taken steps to present the court with relevant foreign law and turn to the law of the forum in interpreting the limitation of liability provision.see cavic grand bahama dev,cir when both parties have failed to prove the foreign law,the forum may say that the parties have acquiesced in the application of the local law of the forum.quoting restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.h see also mutual serv.ins.frit,cir.
in this instance,this default analysis leads to the same result.the initial question is what is the forum for this purpose.one might presume it to be federal maritime law.however,a contract for the sale or construction of a ship is not within the federal courts admiralty jurisdiction.richard bertram v.the yacht,wanda,cir.thus,as a disinterested forum,it would seem appropriate for a federal court sitting in admiralty to look to the state law with an interest in the issue.we are left to determine which state law that is.we conclude that florida law provides the relevant law on this issue.
from a governmental interest point of view,no individual jurisdiction within the united states appears to have a significant interest in this action.it concerns foreign entities,namely companies from the british virgin islands and the netherlands.the parties have not provided this court with sufficient information on how british virgin islands law or dutch law would resolve this dispute.furthermore,it is reasonable to apply florida law because it was the original forum of this litigation,it has some factual connections to this litigation and no other jurisdiction has stronger ties.see,cavic,at because the parties did not raise any conflict of laws issue in the district court and do not raise it on appeal,under applicable conflict of laws principles the law of the forum florida would govern the substantive issues due to the absence of facts justifying the application of the law of some other jurisdiction.internal quotation marks omitted.
having determined that florida law applies,we need not decide whether the agreement is a contract for the sale of goods or for services.though the provisions of the florida uniform commercial code ucc would apply only if the contract were deemed a sale of goods,the limitation of liability provision governs to bar meridian claims regardless of whether the ucc or general florida contract law applies.
turning first to the ucc,florida version of the ucc permits a party to exclude liability for consequential damages.stat.consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.moreover,c onsequential damages resulting from the seller breach include b injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.stat.meridian claims against de vries are,therefore,barred by the agreement limitation of liability provision,as cooper injuries fall within the realm of consequential damages,which are clearly excluded by the clause,and there is no evidence suggesting that the provision is unconscionable.
even if the agreement is considered a service contract,de vries would still be shielded from liability.in that case,general florida contract law would apply.under florida law,e xculpatory provisions which attempt to relieve a party of his or her own negligence are generally looked upon with disfavor,and florida law requires that such clauses be strictly construed against the party claiming to be relieved of liability.sunny isles marina,adulami,so d.such provisions,however,have been found to be valid and enforceable by florida courts where the intention is made clear and unequivocal.see also murphy young men christian ass of lake wales,so d,exculpatory clauses are enforceable only where and to the extent that the intention to be relieved was made clear and unequivocal in the contract,and the wording must be so clear and understandable that an ordinary and knowledgeable party will know what he is contracting away.quoting southworth mcgill,bell,so d.
florida law would give effect to the provision at issue here as the contractual language is clear and unequivocal.the agreement provides that de vries shall have no liability whatsoever for any loss or damage directly arising from the defectiveness or deficiency of parts except if resulting from intentional conduct or gross negligence of de vries or its servants,but that l iability for loss of business,loss of profits,consequential damages or other indirect damage is always excluded the four appellants allege negligence and strict liability,but never allege gross negligence or intentional conduct.the agreement is clear that the only possible liability is for direct damage resulting from gross negligence or intentional conduct it is irrelevant whether meridian claims are classified as either direct or damages because the agreement disclaims liability under both negligence and strict liability theories regardless of the damages sought.thus,under the terms of the contract meridian can not recover.
the limitation of liability provision is clear and unequivocal under florida law even though it does not use the word negligence.florida courts do not,as a rule,require the use of terms such as negligence or negligent acts in order to validly release negligence claims.cain banka,so d,finding that an exculpatory clause absolving the defendant of any and all liability,claims,demands,actions,and causes of action whatsoever to be sufficient to include the plaintiff negligence action see also greater orlando aviation auth.bulldog airlines,so d,stating that the contention that florida courts have implied that the only method of conveying a clear and unambiguous expression of an intention to be free from liability for one own negligence is to use the word negligence,is erroneous.
meridian argues that the limitation of liability provision in article of the agreement does not govern its claims because the provision contains no specific language limiting liability based on personal injury to caused by de vries negligence or grounded in strict liability.meridian cites to a new york case,fendley power battery,dep t.however,in fendley,the court found that the limitation of liability clause did not apply because there was no any the provision excluded recovery for tort damages.the fendley court reasoned that nothing in the contract suggest ed even obscurely that the parties were contracting with respect to their liabilities grounded in tort.id.at,emphasis added.specifically,the clause ma d e no reference to personal injuries,negligence,strict products liability,or employ ed other words,such as consequential damages.id.
unlike in fendley,the provision at issue here clearly demonstrates that its intent was to contract out of tort claims.the limitation of liability provision explicitly states that liability for consequential damages or other indirect damage is always excluded.furthermore,the limitation of liability provision specifically references gross negligence,making clear that the exclusion of consequential or other indirect damages was meant to encompass tort claims.this differentiates the provision from the clause at issue in fendley,which did not use terms such as consequential damages or gross negligence.thus,meridian action against de vries is completely barred by the agreement limitation of liability provision 
meridian shipowner de voogt feadship america american affiliate application of the agreement beneficiary provision article to 
meridian has also sued two parties who did not sign the agreement,de voogt,the,and feadship america,its american affiliate.we must,therefore,determine whether these may take advantage of the agreement beneficiary provision.for the reasons discussed herein,only de voogt,the,may benefit from the provision.
the agreement has two seemingly conflicting provisions,articles and,that need to be reconciled before we can determine whether may utilize the limitation of liability provision.article of the agreement provides that limitations of liability stipulated in favor of any party,shall also apply in favor of the servants,and suppliers of such party article,on the other hand,provides nothing in this agreement,whether express or implied,is intended to confer any benefits,rights or remedies on any person other than the parties to this agreement.the affidavit provided by appellees asserts that according to article,paragraph of the dutch civil code,article of the agreement is a valid provision,that permits de voogt and feadship america,as meridian or servants,to benefit from the limitation of liability provision in article.the affidavit,however,fails to address article,which seems to prevent from enforcing the limitation of liability provision against meridian.neither side submitted evidence concerning how dutch law would either interpret article or resolve this seeming contradiction.
this apparent contradiction of terms can be resolved by either giving both provisions effect or finding that one trumps the other.in either case,article,which permits and servants to take advantage of the agreement limitation of liability provision,governs the questions presented here.article could be viewed to apply only in preventing from invoking benefits,rights or remedies conferred under the agreement in a suit against one of the signatories.so viewed,it would have no application to a seeking to invoke a separate contractual provision as a defense.article,by contrast,provides a shield,allowing a particular class of to invoke any agreed upon limitation of liability.thus,the two clauses do not necessarily contradict each other.even if the two clauses are deemed irreconcilable,florida courts have held that w here two clauses of an agreement are repugnant and can not stand together,the first shall be received and the latter rejected.copacabana records,wea latina,so d,quoting boden atl.fed.sav.and loan ass n,so d.thus,we can disregard article of the agreement.
it remains to be decided whether de voogt and feadship america can take advantage of the limitation of liability provision pursuant to article.according to article of the dutch civil code,can invoke the contract against any of the parties,if the contract contains a stipulation to that effect and if the third person so accepts.the civil code of the netherlands at.article of the agreement contains a stipulation permitting and servants to enforce the agreement limitation of liability provision.neither party disputes that de voogt was a subcontractor of de vries.de voogt also accepted the stipulation by invoking it here.therefore,under dutch law,the limitation of liability provision confers a benefit on de voogt and meridian claims against de voogt,the,are barred.article,however,does not apply to feadship america.feadship america denies having had anything to do with the construction,design or sale of the meduse,making it impossible for it to have been either a subcontractor or servant of de vries.accordingly,feadship america,although it may ultimately be found to bear no liability for the allegedly defective foodlift,can not benefit from the agreement limitation of liability provision.
vulcan manager ship manager and vulcan employer cooper maritime employer de vries shipbuilder application of the dutch choice of law provision to 
we next consider the claims brought by vulcan manager,the entity who cooper alleged was the manager of the meduse and its crew,and vulcan employer,cooper maritime employer,against de vries,the dutch shipbuilder.the general rule is that are not bound to the terms of a contract.because the vulcan appellants never signed the agreement,the dutch choice of law provision does not apply to their claims.furthermore,there is no evidence that the vulcan appellants fall within any exception to this general rule that would bind them to the contractual provision.
a choice of law clause,like an arbitration clause,is a contractual right that can not ordinarily be invoked by or against a party who did not sign the contract in which the provision appears.paracor,capital,cir.despite this general rule,this circuit has recognized in similar cases concerning arbitration agreements that common law principles of contract and agency law permit a signatory to bind a under a limited set of circumstances,these include incorporation by reference assumption agency and estoppel.world rentals and sales,llc volvo constr.equip.rents,cir quoting employers ins.of wausau bright metal specialties,cir.neither party alleges or provides any evidence demonstrating that any of these theories permit de vries to bind the vulcan appellants to the dutch choice of law provision.
this circuit has also recognized a somewhat different theory in lipcon underwriters at lloyd,london,cir.there,the court held that i n order to bind a to a forum selection clause,the party must be closely related to the dispute such that it becomes foreseeable that it will be bound.id.at quoting hugel of lloyd,cir quotations omitted.specifically,the lipcon court found that the parties were bound by the choice of law and choice of forum clauses where the parties rights were completely derivative of those of the signing parties and thus directly related to,if not predicated upon the interests of the signing parties.id.quoting dayhoff heinz,cir.
here,the vulcan appellants claims arise out of an independent right of indemnity and contribution and do not derive from the agreement.thus,even in the absence of the agreement,vulcan manager and vulcan employer would still have a viable action against de vries based on their underlying liability to cooper.moreover,de vries presents no other reason why the vulcan appellants should be bound by the agreement.in contrast to lipcon,in this case,there is no evidence that such a close relationship existed between meridian,who signed the agreement,and the vulcan appellants,who were.even assuming that meridian and the vulcan appellants have the same president and beneficial owner,that alone is not sufficient to demonstrate that the vulcan appellants are meridian alter egos,permitting us to disregard their individual corporate identities.the vulcan appellants therefore are not bound by the agreement dutch choice of law provision.
choice of law claims 
the meduse ship,vulcan employer cooper maritime employer vulcan manager ship manager the dutch shipbuilding appellees shipbuilder and negligence theory 
we turn now to the issue of what law governs the claims brought by the meduse,the ship,and the vulcan appellants,the ship manager and cooper employer,against de vries and de voogt,the dutch shipbuilder and designer.the and the netherlands are the only two countries with a potential interest in the determination of this action.the british virgin islands,where vulcan employer is incorporated,and the cayman islands,where the meduse is registered,are also potentially interested jurisdictions,but the parties have provided no information on this score,and we see no reason to burden ourselves with further research.as already discussed,dutch law provides a statute of limitations for actions brought under the general tort provisions of the dutch civil code and this action was filed less than two years after cooper injury.under law,any limitations period in a cause of action for indemnity or contribution does not begin to run until judgment against defendant has been entered or payment of the primary liability payment has been made itt rayonier,southeastern,cir.the complaint was filed prior to settlement with cooper,making this action timely under federal maritime law regardless of which limitations period applies.therefore,on this issue,there is no conflict and thus there is no need to decide whether or dutch law controls.accordingly,the claims brought by meduse and the vulcan appellants may proceed against the dutch shipbuilding appellees on a general tort or negligence theory.
the meduse ship,vulcan employer cooper maritime employer vulcan manager ship manager the dutch shipbuilding appellees shipbuilder and strict products liability theory 
as stated earlier,the appellants also raise claims based on strict liability.we must determine which jurisdiction law applies to those strict liability claims in order to decide whether they are.after conducting a conflict of laws analysis,we find the netherlands to be the only interested jurisdiction.accordingly,dutch law applies and the strict liability claims of the appellants are barred by the statute of repose.
in any conflict of laws analysis,the first issue that needs to be addressed is whether a conflict actually exists.in other words,are we dealing here with a false conflict simply stated,a false conflict occurs when the laws of the competing states are substantially similar fioretti massachusetts life ins,cir.if a false conflict exists,the court should avoid the conflicts question and simply decide the issue under the law of each of the interested states.see also dresdner bank ag olympia voyager,cir.
here,however,at least at first glance,a true conflict exists between federal maritime law and dutch law with regard to the timeliness of the strict products liability claims brought by the meduse and the vulcan appellants against the dutch shipbuilding appellees.a true conflict exists when two or more states have a legitimate interest in a particular set of facts in the litigation and the laws of those states differ or would produce a different result.estate of miller ex rel.miller thrifty system,d.there appears to be a clear difference between dutch law and federal maritime law.as already indicated,under federal maritime law,all of the claims are timely.under dutch law,on the other hand,the claims under a strict products liability theory are barred by the statute of repose.
the netherlands has an interest in making sure that the dutch shipbuilding appellees,companies incorporated and producing products within its borders,are not subjected to claims for an length of time.on the other hand,assuming,for purposes of argument,that the has an interest,its policy is to ensure that companies conducting business in the can seek indemnity or contribution from joint tortfeasors.the reason for this strong policy is partly related to the nature of federal maritime law,which imposes strict liability on shipowners,even where others are primarily at fault.see yamaha motor,calhoun,d the duty imposed was absolute failure to supply a safe ship resulted in liability irrespective of fault and irrespective of the intervening negligence of crew members.quoting miles apex marine,d.from a policy perspective,a true conflict exists between dutch and federal maritime law and we must therefore determine which law applies.
at the outset,the parties dispute which choice of law analysis applies.appellees argue that the district court was correct in applying the test set forth in lauritzen larsen,and expanded upon in romero int l terminal operating,d,and hellenic lines rhoditis,d by contrast,the four argue that in deciding which law to apply to their action,the district court should have applied the same law that governed cooper underlying personal injury claims against them,as set out in marathon pipe line drilling rig,cir,which held that the body of law establishing the indemnitee primary liability governs his claim for indemnity or contribution against a third party.
here,applying lauritzen is proper as it permits us to take into account the distinct interests involved at the contribution stage.the district court noted in its decision that marathon pipe is not controlling precedent in this and that the lauritzen factors more accurately weighs and balances the interests at play in a given case and allows for the law of the country with the greatest interest in the dispute to govern.cooper,slip.op.at.we agree and similarly refuse to adopt a choice of law analysis that ignores this suit international aspects.see lauritzen,at.recognizing the duty that one sovereign power is bound to respect the subjects and rights of all other sovereign powers outside its own territory.specifically,marathon pipe requires that a court automatically apply the same body of law to a contribution action as that which applied to the underlying action.this is the case,despite the fact that the underlying action likely involved different parties,interests and policies than those present in the subsequent contribution action.if we were to find in favor of applying marathon pipe,we would be ignoring these important differences.
no court has ever applied marathon pipe to a case such as this one,which has international aspects.the choice of law rule acknowledged in marathon pipe and the lauritzen choice of law analysis are separate rules that are to be utilized under different circumstances.indeed,the only time courts sitting in admiralty have applied marathon pipe is where the issue is which subset of american law law or federal admiralty law.see,ocean prods.research,finding,in a action where the underlying maritime injury occurred in the navigable waters of florida,that the substantive law of the indemnity and contribution claims by plaintiff will be subject to the principles of general maritime law citing marathon pipe line,at.the present action,by contrast,concerns a conflict between federal maritime law and the law of a foreign nation.if this were a wholly domestic matter,with no potential foreign interests,marathon pipe might very well apply.concerns for comity,however,make the lauritzen analysis better equipped at handling choice of law issues where the law of another nation is involved.see sigalas lido,cir lauritzen sought to reconcile the expansive reach of the jones act with the principles of comity that underlie international law so as to foster amicable and workable commercial relations.quoting rhoditis.harlan,dissenting see also calhoun yamaha motor,cir t he lauritzen factors are most often applied to determine whether the admiralty law of the united states or that of a foreign state should be applied to a particular dispute.unlike marathon pipe,lauritzen will always take into consideration both the and the foreign interests in a given action.
indeed,district courts in the fifth circuit,where marathon pipe is binding precedent,utilize lauritzen to resolve choice of law issues arising in contribution actions that have an international element and fail to even mention the possibility of applying marathon pipe.see,galapagos corporacion turistica galatours,v.the panama canal comm n,d,applying lauritzen to a plaintiff claims for indemnity and contribution where a choice of law question arose as to whether federal maritime law or panamanian law applied.in fact,the only case to ever specifically suggest that there is a conflict between the two tests,chose to apply the lauritzen analysis.in re complaint of kreta shipping,d,rejecting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,which explicitly refused to apply lauritzen to a indemnity claim.
still,the differences between lauritzen and marathon pipe are not as great when viewed from a policy perspective,and neither prevents a plaintiff who has paid more than his fair share from recovering against a defendant.but applying the automatic rule recognized in marathon pipe leads to a lack of respect for the interests of foreign jurisdictions.therefore,a more sophisticated analysis is required,which the lauritzen line of cases provide.
in employing this approach,we conclude that dutch law governs these claims because the has almost no interest in having its law applied to this action.the lauritzen and rhoditis decisions established a list of eight factors to consider when confronted with making a choice between applying federal maritime law and the law of a foreign country.that test requires consideration of the place of the wrongful act the flag under which the ship sails the allegiance or domicile of the injured party the allegiance or domicile of the shipowner defendants the place of the contract between the injured party and the shipowner the accessibility of the foreign forum the law of the forum and the shipowner base of operations.lauritzen,at.rhoditis,at.the supreme court emphasized in rhoditis that these factors are neither exhaustive nor are they meant to be mechanically applied.rhoditis,at.additionally,t he significance of one or more factors must be considered in light of the national interest served by the assertion of federal maritime jurisdiction.id.at.although the claims in lauritzen were brought under the jones act,the supreme court has held that t he broad principles of choice of law and the applicable criteria of selection set forth in lauritzen were intended to guide courts in the application of maritime law generally.romero,at.the controlling considerations are the interacting interests of the united states and of foreign countries,and in assessing them we must move with the circumspection appropriate when this court is adjudicating issues inevitably entangled in the conduct of our international relations.id.at.
the four appellants argue that,even if the district court was correct in engaging in the lauritzen choice of law analysis,it erred in its application.specifically,they claim that the district court treated the analysis as a balancing test between and foreign interests,when lauritzen is meant to focus on whether sufficient contacts exist to render application of federal maritime law appropriate.we do not read lauritzen so narrowly and,indeed,to do so would contradict the teaching of the quoted language of romero.
the issue at stake here is whether the federal maritime policy of contribution should prevail over the dutch policy of repose for strict liability claims.if vulcan employer and the meduse were from a jurisdiction that would find the strict liability claims against the dutch shipbuilding appellees to be timely,we would be facing a true conflict with dutch law.here,however,the maritime employer is a british virgin islands corporation and the ship itself is registered in the cayman islands.no information has been provided concerning whether the outcome of this issue under either british virgin islands or cayman islands law would differ from the outcome under dutch law.thus,as discussed more fully below,the lauritzen analysis reveals that only the netherlands appears to have an interest in the remaining strict liability claims,while the has no or,at most,a tangential interest.the wrongful conduct occurred in the netherlands where the ship was designed and built,and,thus,the netherlands has an interest in protecting the dutch shipbuilding appellees from a belated claim for strict liability.it would appear,on the record presented,that the netherlands is the jurisdiction with the only interest in this dispute and,therefore,the appropriate law to apply is dutch law.
because this is not an action directly by a seaman,as was the case in lauritzen and rhoditis,but rather for indemnity,contribution and equitable subrogation,under the facts of this case,the only factors that are relevant to this claim are the place of the wrongful act the allegiances or domiciles of the parties the dutch shipbuilding appellees base of operations and the four appellants base of operations 
the wrongful act,namely the manufacture and installation of the foodlift,took place in the netherlands and therefore strongly favors the application of dutch law because the netherlands has an interest in regulating all such activity occurring within its borders.the four appellants argue that the wrongful act occurred on the high seas,where the defect in the foodlift manifested itself,thus,not pointing either to the application of federal maritime law or dutch law.here,we agree with the district court that the wrongful act occurs where the construction of the defective product took place and not in the place where the injury remote area in the sea where the ship happened to have been at the time the effects of the defect came to fruition.see rationis enters.of panama hyundai mipo dockyard,cir finding that the place of the wrongful act is not where the vessel sinks,but where the negligence occurs.this factor should no doubt be given more weight here where the wrongful act occurred in a fixed location in contrast,the place of the injury,namely cooper injury,occurred in a purely fortuitous location on the high seas.see eeoc bermuda star line,finding that in title vii maritime cases,the place of the wrong factor merits considerable weight because unlike in jones act cases,where the place of the wrong should generally be given little weight,as the place a seaman is injured will generally be a fortuitous matter,here it is not so.
turning to the domicile factor,among the four appellants,meridian and vulcan employer are british virgin islands corporations and the meduse is registered in the cayman islands.if british virgin islands or cayman islands law is similar to federal maritime law concerning its policy of indemnity and contribution then a true conflict with dutch law would exist.however,again because the parties have not provided any information concerning the law of these countries,no conflict is evident,and this factor thus has no effect on our analysis.vulcan manager,the entity that is alleged by cooper to have managed the meduse at the time of his accident,is a washington corporation.however,this not a strong factor in favor of applying federal maritime law because no specific information has been provided about either vulcan manager role in managing the ship or its activities.with regard to appellees,de vries and de voogt are foreign corporations with principal places of business in the netherlands,which strongly favors the application of dutch law.although feadship america is a florida corporation with a principal place of business in florida,as discussed already,the company does not seem to have played any role in the manufacture of the meduse or the allegedly defective foodlift.here,the fact that one of the four appellants and one of the three appellees involved are domiciled in the united states is not sufficient to justify the blanket application of federal maritime law.
the choice of law analysis also requires us to look beyond corporate formalities and examine the parties operational contacts with the see williams cruise ships catering,serv.int l,d.this circuit has stated in dicta that i f the defendants have a substantial base of operations in the united states,this factor alone can justify the application of united states law.membreno costa crociere,cir emphasis added.at the same time,an earlier decision stated rhoditis does not command us to hold,that the shipowner base of operations is the sole controlling factor in a decision.chiazor transworld drilling,cir,overruled on other grounds by in re air crash disaster near new orleans,louisiana on july,cir.in deciding whether a party has a base of operations in the,the important question is whether the contacts,irrespective of the party contacts in other countries,amount to a substantial relation to the united states.williams,d at emphasis in original.
furthermore,a complete choice of law analysis requires that we examine the base of operations of all parties.in rhoditis,the supreme court added the consideration of the shipowner base of operations as an eighth factor to the lauritzen choice of law analysis.rhoditis,at.rhoditis,however,involved a very different factual scenario from that presented here.in contrast to this action,rhoditis concerned a direct suit by a seaman only against the shipowner.because no other parties were involved in that suit,in rhoditis the court only took into consideration the shipowner base of operations.rhoditis made clear,however,that the lauritzen factors were not meant to be exhaustive.id.we find it reasonable,under the facts of this case,where the shipowner is the plaintiff,to consider the operating base of the defendant shipbuilder and designer,who are analogous to the defendant shipowner in rhoditis.for similar reasons,we examine the contacts of all four appellants,and not just the appellant shipowner,to determine whether they have bases of operations in this country.the four appellants argue that the district court erred by failing to consider the base of operations factor.although this may be true,such error was harmless as the evidence presented before the district court was insufficient to determine that any of the four appellants or appellees actually have a base of operations.
the dutch shipbuilding appellees do not have a base of operations.the four appellants cite to feadship website,which acknowledges that de vries and de voogt are part of the feadship venture.however,no information is provided regarding either the extent or the types of activities that the two dutch shipbuilding appellees perform in the that could lead to a determination that de vries and de voogt conduct substantial operations in florida.furthermore,the website excerpts acknowledge that feadship head office is located in haarlem in the netherlands,and shares its offices with de voogt naval architects.although de vries owns fifty percent of the stock in feadship america,there is nothing to indicate that de vries exercises control over the american company or that corporate formalities are not properly maintained.
the website also states that feadship america florida office serves as a base of operations for feadship people during their frequent trips over from the netherlands.this,however,merely implies that de vries and de voogt,entities that are part of the feadship venture,use feadship america offices in florida if and when they visit the.the mere fact that the dutch shipbuilding appellees are part of a venture that also operates in the is not sufficient to demonstrate that they have a base of operations.membreno,at finding that the fact that the defendant is a fully owned subsidiary of carnival,which maintains its principal place of business in florida,is insufficient,by itself,to establish that the defendant has a substantial base of operations in the where the evidence presented showed that carnival did not control the defendant operations.this remains true even if half of feadship clients are located in the united states,especially where no information is provided concerning how much revenue the dutch shipbuilding appellees generate from their american clientele.sigalas,at finding that the fact that the bulk of the defendant shipowner revenue came from american clients is not enough,by itself,to justify application of american law.
similarly,the four appellants fail to present sufficient evidence establishing that they have a base of operations.the meduse has docked in florida and other ports,but no information is provided concerning the frequency of the ship presence in the.the four appellants also assert,in their brief,that meridian and vulcan employer have principal places of business in florida and that vulcan manager has a principal place of business in the state of washington however,in their answer to cooper amended complaint the four appellants denied that either meridian or vulcan employer have a principal place of business in florida.t he general rule is that a party is bound by the admissions in his pleadings.best canvas prods.supplies,ploof truck lines,cir.indeed,facts judicially admitted are facts established not only beyond the need of evidence to prove them,but beyond the power of evidence to controvert them.hill federal trade comm n,cir.we,therefore,deem the four appellants unexplained denials to be admissions that meridian and vulcan employer do not have a principal place of business in florida.these judicial admissions are binding,and the four appellants can not now claim the exact opposite to be true when they might work to establish their contacts even without such admissions,however,there is no evidence in the record that meridian or vulcan employer actually have their principal places of business in florida or that vulcan manager has its principal place of business in the state of washington.
the four appellants also allege that they are beneficially owned by a citizen and that meridian and the vulcan appellants have a citizen as their president.even assuming that the four appellants were beneficially owned by a citizen,this,by itself,is not sufficient to establish a base of operations where that person has used the advantages offered by a foreign jurisdiction law by incorporating in that jurisdiction.in rhoditis,the court found a base of operations where the foreign shipowner was principally owned by a domiciliary who managed the corporation in the the foreign shipowner had a principal place of business the ship was regularly engaged in scheduled runs between ports in the and ports in the middle east,pakistan and india and the ship entire income derived from cargo either originating or terminating in ports.rhoditis,at.unlike in rhoditis,here the four appellants provide no information demonstrating that the is where their operations occur,management decisions are made or revenues are generated.the bare allegations of american ownership and domicile of their president fail to demonstrate a base of operations.
other than cooper allegation in his complaint that meridian and the vulcan appellants were beneficially owned by a citizen who was personally and actively involved in hiring cooper and who regularly gave orders to cooper regarding the vessel movements,itinerary and operational budget,an allegation denied by appellants,there is no indication that the owner was actively involved in the operations of either the ship or the appellant corporations.rather,the only claim is that the owner was a citizen.although in some cases,having a corporate president may strongly indicate that the bulk of management decisions are made in the,the four appellants never make this allegation,let alone bring forth evidence suggesting the same.
in order to determine if the has a substantial interest,the supreme court has made clear that we must do more than engage in a contact counting exercise,as both parties have at times engaged in.hellenic lines rhoditis,cir lauritzen did not create a contact counting test,aff,d.rather,in determining whether the has an interest in applying its law,we must review the substance of those contacts by analyzing both the policies underlying the issues on which the dispute centers and the factual contexts under which the dispute arose.here,the only facts even remotely suggesting a interest are that vulcan manager,the company that cooper alleged to have been involved in managing the ship and its crew,is incorporated in the feadship america,an affiliate of the builder and designer of the ship,is a corporation the meduse,the ship on which the injury occurred,sometimes navigates in waters and docks in ports the four appellants have a beneficial owner and meridian and the vulcan appellants have a president.as demonstrated above,such connections,under the facts of this case,can hardly be considered so significant as to demonstrate a meaningful interest.in sum,the four appellants have not shown that the has a substantial interest in this action therefore,this issue involves a false conflict,with dutch law controlling.
the netherlands clearly has a strong interest in having its law applied.the domicile of the companies that constructed and designed the meduse are in the netherlands,as was the place of construction,thus demonstrating that it has not only a substantial,but a predominate,if not sole,interest in applying dutch law and its policy of repose accordingly,dutch law applies to the strict liability claims brought by the meduse and the vulcan appellants against the dutch shipbuilding appellees,effectively barring that action as untimely.
the four appellants feadship america 
on the other hand,federal maritime law applies to all of the claims brought by the four appellants against feadship america,making those actions timely.it is undisputed that feadship america is incorporated in the with a principal place of business in florida.furthermore,the four appellants include a company,two british virgin islands entities and a ship registered in the cayman islands.although the cayman islands and the british virgin islands appear to have an interest and may even provide a different answer than federal maritime law concerning the timeliness of this action,no party requests that the court apply such law or suggests that a conflict exists.thus,the only law that has any relevance to an action between the four appellants and feadship america is federal maritime law,making such law applicable.it is undisputed that this action is timely under federal maritime law.the four appellants are,therefore,free to proceed with their claims against feadship america,although,as noted above,because feadship america does not appear to have played any role in the sale,construction or design
