this action spawned four appeals from various final judgments entered by the united states district court for the southern district of florida,ryskamp,brought by two insurance companies,an ocean carrier and its stevedore,and a television production company,arising out of the destruction of a mobile stage while it was being loaded for transport from the port of palm beach to the island of maarten for use in an hbo television special titled sinbad soul party.
background 
in may,tall pony productions tall pony leased a mobile stage from in any event,any event.any event had previously leased the stage from its owner,stageline mobile stage stageline,a canadian manufacturer of mobile stages.tall pony subleased the stage in connection with an hbo sinbad special television production scheduled to take place in maarten.tall pony contracted with tropical shipping construction tropical,an ocean carrier,to transport the stage and other equipment from the port of palm beach to maarten.tropical and tall pony entered into a shipping contract,evidenced by a bill of lading,for shipment of the cargo on tropical vessel,the tropic tide.a separate clause in the bill of lading limited tropical liability to for each trailer or container prepared by the shipper,except where the shipper,in this case tall pony,declared a higher value for the equipment and paid the corresponding higher ad valorem tariff.tropical contends that tall pony did not declare value for the shipment on the bill of lading,and,as such,did not pay a higher tariff rate for its cargo,which the district court noted would have been approximately based on figures provided by tropical.if tropical is correct,tall pony recovery for property damage to the stage is limited to the per package limitation provided under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa.
fireman fund insured both tall pony and any event.to that end,fireman fund issued tall pony a blanket policy,which was supplemented with separate declaration endorsements for each production undertaken by tall pony.fireman fund issued one such policy and declaration for the sinbad soul party production.that policy states,in pertinent part,that t his coverage insures against all risks of direct physical loss or damage to the property covered.the policy further provides coverage for the value of personal property,including but not limited to mechanical effects equipment,grip equipment and mobile equipment damaged or destroyed during the term of coverage,caused by the perils insured against,while such property is used or to be used by you in connection with an insured production.notably,the policy does not contain an exclusion for property damage incurred during the loading and transport of the stage,and no endorsement to that effect was ever issued by fireman fund in connection with the tall pony production at issue.the fireman fund policy also contains an other insurance provision,which provides that the policy shall apply as excess insurance over any other insurance issued in favor of tall pony and covering the same property.
fireman fund issued a certificate of insurance on behalf of tall pony and in favor of stageline for the mobile stage.as the lessee of the stage,any event was required to indemnify stageline for damage to the stage.tall pony,the sublessee and actual user of the stage,was in turn legally obligated to indemnify any event for any amounts it paid to stageline arising from damage to the stage.
shortly before the scheduled shipment date,jerome anderson,the fireman fund underwriter for the tall pony policy,informed tall pony that its policy did not cover the loading and ocean transport of the stage and that fireman fund did not wish to underwrite risks associated with shipping by water.concerned about lack of coverage for the stage once it was turned over to tropical for loading onto its vessel,danny harris,head of production at tall pony,contacted tropical to inquire about obtaining ocean marine cargo coverage for the shipment.tropical referred harris to jim mcintire,a at seven seas insurance company seven seas,a sister corporation of tropical.after independently checking on seven seas with its broker,tall pony obtained open cargo or open sea insurance coverage from seven seas for the ocean transport of the stage,listing tall pony as named assured.the seven seas policy was an all risk cargo policy,and contained an other insurance provision similar to the one contained in the fireman fund policy.at tall pony request,on may,the same day the stage was damaged,seven seas issued a letter to tall pony,confirming that the stage was insured for ocean transport under the seven seas policy tall pony productions is held covered on their cargo sailing from port of palm beach to maarten and on the return trip from maarten to port of palm beach.coverage is all risk excluding any discrepancies prior to receipt from tropical shipping.relying on seven seas letter as proof of insurance coverage for its shipment,tall pony took no further action with respect to securing insurance coverage.
tropical employed birdsall,a stevedore,to load the stage onto the vessel through the use of a crane with spreaders.the crane employed by birdsall was manufactured by bromma.during the course of loading the stage,the crane failed,causing the stage to drop to the dock,resulting in its total destruction.consistent with the adage that the show must go on,tall pony made arrangements to secure a replacement stage.
proceedings in the district court 
on may,tall pony,fireman fund,its insurer,and any event commenced an action against tropical,birdsall,bromma and stageline,and the tropic tide,in rem,for damages arising from the destruction of the stage at the time it was being loaded onto the tropic tide tall pony i.on december,tall pony initiated a separate action against seven seas to recover,inter alia,property and consequential damages pursuant to the terms of the all risk policy issued by seven seas tall pony ii.on may,the district court dismissed,on joint stipulation of the parties,any event as a plaintiff in tall pony on november,the district court consolidated the tall pony i and tall pony ii actions.
while tall pony i and tall pony ii were pending in the district court,stageline and its insurers commenced an action against fireman fund and any event to recover for the property damage to the stage.in settlement of that claim,fireman fund paid stageline and its insurers.on december,in exchange for payment of the settlement proceeds,stageline and its insurers executed a release in favor of fireman fund its insureds for all claims relating to the physical damage to the stage.fireman fund made additional payments for claims arising out of the destruction of the stage to any event for its loss of use claim against tall pony to tall pony for reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with obtaining a replacement stage and for miscellaneous accounting expenses.
in october,some ten months after fireman fund settled the claims brought by stageline and its insurers,tall pony signed a loan receipt in favor of fireman fund for,the total amount of funds paid out by fireman fund for claims arising out of the destruction of the stage.the loan receipt was principally comprised of three separate sets of payments made by fireman fund the settlement funds fireman fund paid to stageline and its insurers payment to any event on its loss of use claims against tall pony and payment to tall pony directly for costs incurred in securing a replacement stage,consequential damages.the loan receipt provided,inter alia,that the was a loan and not payment on any claim,and was repayable out of any net recovery tall pony made against any vessel,carrier or insurance company for property damage to the stage.
in a decision dated august,the district court held that the mobile stage constituted a single package for purposes of cogsa and,thus,tropical and birdsall liability to fireman fund and tall pony for the damage to the stage was limited to,the statutory per package limitation on a carrier liability under cogsa.see.in concluding that the cogsa limitation applied,the district court determined that tall pony was on constructive notice of the contents of the bill of lading,which contained a clause paramount that expressly adopted the provisions of cogsa,see ins.of am.ocean lynx,cir,and that tall pony failed to declare a higher,therefore,pay a higher tariff its cargo in order to opt out of the cogsa limitation.in reaching its decision,the district court found that the bill of lading legibly and clearly described the stage as one unit or package for purposes of cogsa.the district court further held that birdsall liability was limited to pursuant to the himalaya clause contained in the bill of lading on appeal,fireman fund and tall pony argue that the district court erred in holding that tropical and birdsall had limited liability under section.
on february,the district court held a bench trial on the issue of liability as to tropical,birdsall and the other defendants in connection with the destruction of the stage.following that trial,the district court held that birdsall was negligent in lifting the stage,and that its negligence was the proximate cause of the damage to the stage.the district court further held that tropical was vicariously liable to tall pony and fireman fund for the damage to the stage.the district court held tropical and birdsall jointly and severally liable for the damage to the stage.however,based on the district court prior ruling,tropical and birdsall liability to tall pony and fireman fund was limited to under cogsa section and the himalaya clause contained in the bill of lading.the district court also dismissed with prejudice the claims asserted by tall pony and fireman fund against stageline and bromma.the district court entered final judgment on the issue of liability on june.stageline and bromma are not parties to the instant appeals.
on october,the district court held a bench trial on tall pony claim against seven seas for damages and attorney fees under the ocean cargo policy issued by seven seas as the liability insurer of tropical,and on tall pony failure to procure insurance claim against tropical.on october,the district court orally issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to tall pony claims.the district court held that seven seas had assumed sole coverage for ocean transport of the stage by tropical and,accordingly,was liable to tall pony for,the amount paid by fireman fund on behalf of tall pony in settlement of the claims brought by stageline and its insurers.the district court held that tall pony could not,however,recover consequential damages from seven seas related to the cost of obtaining a replacement stage and the interruption of its business.although the district court held that tall pony was entitled to attorney fees pursuant to.stat,it did not make a specific fee award at that time.finally,the district court held that tropical was not liable on tall pony failure to procure insurance claim.final judgment to that effect was entered on october,and an amended final judgment was entered on december.on march,the district court entered judgment awarding attorney fees of,plus interest,in favor of tall pony and against seven seas.
on appeal,seven seas challenges the district court finding that it alone is liable to tall pony for the amounts paid by fireman fund on behalf of tall pony to stageline and its insurers for the property damage to the stage.tall pony,contesting the district court decision limiting its recovery against seven seas to.tall pony also seeks attorney fees in connection with the instant appeal pursuant to.stat.
following the district court decision,tropical filed a motion to tax costs pursuant to.d with respect to the dismissal of tall pony failure to procure insurance claim.the district court initially granted tropical motion,but later vacated that award after tall pony moved for reconsideration.on appeal,tropical argues that its award of costs should be reinstated.
discussion 
we first consider whether the district court erred in holding that section of cogsa limits tropical and birdsall liability for the physical damage to the stage to.

the parties do not dispute that cogsa,which governs all contracts for carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states in foreign trade,polo ralph lauren,tropical shipping constr,cir quoting,applies to fireman fund and tall pony claims against tropical and birdsall for the property damage to the stage.the parties differ,however,on the application of section to the instant dispute.fireman fund and tall pony argue that,because the stage is an unpackaged piece of machinery,the cogsa limitation should be multiplied by each customary freight unit,which they contend is cubic feet.see assocs.oriental knight,cir holding that the customary freight unit determination is a question of fact that varies from contract to contract.thus,fireman fund and tall pony contend that the maximum recovery they are entitled to under section is multiplied by cubic feet the total size of the stage,or,which far exceeds the they sought.in response,tropical and birdsall argue that the bill of lading listed the stage as a single item or unit and,accordingly,the stage constituted one package for purposes of cogsa.thus,under tropical and birdsall theory,tall pony recovery for the damage to the stage should be limited to.we conclude that the district court properly applied section of cogsa,when it concluded that the mobile stage trailer qualified as one package,such that tropical and birdsall liability for damage to the stage should be limited to.
section of cogsa provides,in pertinent part 
neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding per package,or in case of goods not shipped in packages,per customary freight unit,or the equivalent of that sum in other currency,unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.this declaration,if embodied in the bill of lading,shall be prima facie evidence,but shall not be conclusive on the carrier.
see also ocean lynx,at congress enacted the cogsa limitation on liability in order to restrain the superior bargaining power wielded by carriers over shippers by setting a reasonable limitation on liability that the carriers could not reduce by contract.the bill of lading executed by tall pony and tropical extended the applicability of included,inter alia,the limitation of liability clause contained in section from the time when the goods are received by the carrier at the port of loading until they are delivered or dispatched by the carrier at the port of discharge.bill of lading at see also hartford fire ins.orient overseas containers lines uk,cir a carrier and a shipper can extend cogsa so that it applies prior to loading and subsequent to discharge of goods from a ship,but the extent of any application beyond the scope of the statute is a matter of contract.citing.footnote omitted.
to invoke the limitation on liability under section,the carrier must satisfy two preconditions first,the carrier must give the shipper adequate notice of the limitation by including a clause paramount in the bill of lading that expressly adopts the provisions of cogsa.second,the carrier must give the shipper a fair opportunity to avoid cogsa section limitation by declaring excess value.ocean lynx,at internal citations omitted see also.after reviewing the bill of lading,the district court concluded that tropical satisfied both preconditions.we agree.
paragraph two of the bill of lading is entitled clause paramount,and provides that the bill of lading is subject to the provisions of cogsa and that the carrier is entitled to any privilege and right and immunity provided under cogsa.bill of lading at.the clause paramount put tall pony on constructive notice that it could declare a higher value for its cargo on the bill of lading.see,ocean lynx,at holding that a clause paramount in the bill of lading is sufficient to afford the shipper an opportunity to declare excess value.tracking the language in section,the bill of lading also put tall pony on actual notice that it could opt out of the cogsa liability limitation by declaring a higher value for the shipment and paying an extra freight charge 
t he value of the goods shall be deemed to be per package unless the nature of the goods in a valuation higher than shall have been declared in writing by the shipper upon delivery to the carrier and inserted in this bill of lading and extra freight paid if required

we must next determine whether the district court properly applied the cogsa definition of package to the equipment shipped.
this circuit has adopted the second circuit definition of package under cogsa.see fishman tobin tropical shipping constr,cir fishman,at.in fishman,we recently reaffirmed our adherence to the definition of package set forth by the second circuit in aluminios pozuelo,navigator,cir aluminios the meaning of package can therefore be said to define a class of cargo,irrespective of size,shape or weight,to which some packaging preparation for transportation has been made which facilitates handling,but which does not necessarily conceal or completely enclose the goods.id.at.
at the outset,we note that our resolution of disputes arising out of the per package limitation on carrier liability is complicated by the absence of statutory language defining the meaning and scope of the word package,and the adoption of new methods of preparing and assembling goods for shipment.binladen bsb landscaping nedlloyd rotterdam,cir binladen citing allied int l am.eagle trading yang ming,cir.accordingly,in construing the parameters of the cogsa limitation on liability provision,courts are called on to evaluate diverse and occasionally idiosyncratic items shipped in various,boxes,cartons,bales,coils,crates,rolls,skids,pallets,and order to determine what units,if any,constitute cogsa packages.id.at.our analysis is further complicated by advancements in technology,such as those present in the design of the stage,that outpace the existing law under cogsa.here,for instance,we must decide whether a fully mobile,preassembled,hydraulically operated staging unit constitutes a package under cogsa.
notwithstanding,several basic principles guide our determination of whether the mobile stage constitutes a single package under cogsa.for carriers to avoid unforeseen liability,the number of packages should be fully and accurately disclosed and easily discernable by the carrier.fishman,at.as a result,the touchstone of our analysis is the contractual agreement between the parties as set forth in the bill of lading.id.internal quotations omitted see also hale container line houston sea packing,cir characterizing the bill of lading as the contract of carriage,at quoting binladen,at.entries on the bill of lading are thus important evidence of the intent of the parties to the shipping contract,and the declaration on the bill may bind a shipper even when the contents of the shipment diverge from the description on the bill.binladen,at internal citations omitted.we have taken great pains to note,however,that reference to the cogsa liability limitation in the bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence,but shall not be conclusive on the carrier.hiram walker sons kirk line,cir quoting.while an ambiguity on a bill of lading regarding the number of cogsa packages should be resolved in favor of the shipper,sony magnetic prods.merivienti,cir,in construing the terms of the bill of lading,like any other contract,t he court can not make a new contract for the parties where they themselves have employed express and unambiguous words.int l ins.johns,cir.
we begin with the district court description of the mobile stage,unchallenged by the parties on appeal,which we accept as not clearly erroneous,see hiram walker sons,at 
the mobile stage in question is not a shipping container per se.when the stage is folded up,it can be pulled by a diesel tractor on the highways as if it were a regular rig.when the stage is folded down,the walls of the trailer form the floor of the stage,and internal aluminum superstructures fold up to form metal rigging for attaching lights,roofing and windwalls.the manufacturer promotional materials claims sic that stageline has not reinvented the wheel,it reinvented the stage on wheels 
in the bill of lading,the parties listed the mobile stage trailer as one unit.this designation,along with the terms of the bill of lading incorporating the provisions of cogsa and expressly invoking the per package limitation on liability under cogsa for loss or damage to the shipment,is important evidence of the intent of the parties to the shipping contract.binladen,at.thus,absent ambiguity in the description of the number of packages on the bill of lading,parties to bills of lading should expect to be held to the number that appears under a column whose heading so unmistakably refers to the number of packages.seguros illimani popi p,cir seguros illimani see also fishman,at holding that courts should look beyond the number of packages column in the bill of lading in cases where the description of the shipment in the bill of lading is ambiguous or where the carrier description of the shipment is.in fishman,we cited with approval to the second circuit decision in seguros illimani,which held,in pertinent part 
the number appearing under the heading no.of pkgs.is our starting point for determining the number of packages for purposes of the cogsa limitation,and unless the significance of that number is plainly contradicted by contrary evidence of the parties intent,or unless the number refers to items that can not qualify as packages,it is also the ending point of our inquiry.
at emphasis added see also,at shipper not entitled to recover full damages where the bill of lading listed one container only as the number of packages aluminios,at having specified that the press was one package,they must abide by its meaning as a word of liability limitation.further,courts have held similarly large items to constitute a single unit or package for purposes of cogsa.see,fmc marjorie lykes,cir fire engine aluminios,at press marine,archigetis,yacht taiwan power george wythe,pressurizer weighing approximately pounds,placed on three wooden saddles and secured by means of steel straps.
tall pony argues that because the stage design does not require packaging for it to be transported by the ocean carrier,the stage can not be classified as a package for purposes of section.we disagree.
we will not permit tall pony to hide behind the sophisticated technology and design of the stage to avoid the unambiguous terms of the bill of lading and the description of the stage as one unit in the bill of lading.the stage was prepared for shipment in the normal manner in which goods of this kind are prepared,at quotation marks omitted,and no further packaging was required or could have been undertaken in order to ready the stage for ocean transport.as the district court stated,t he sheer cleverness of the design obviates any need to prepare the stage in any way for shipping other than by folding it up.danny harris,the head of production at tall pony,testified at deposition that the stage was s y ou push two buttons and it opens up out of a giant tractor trailer and becomes a giant stage,with little help from its technicians.thus,the packaging of the stage is effectively incorporated into the design of the stage,which becomes one package enclosed on all sides when it is folded up.under these circumstances,it would be unfair to permit tall pony to rely on the technology of the stage as a means of avoiding the per package cogsa limitation on liability and the express language in the bill of lading,and thereby expose carriers like tropical to unforeseen liability.see fishman,at.
because we conclude that the mobile stage trailer constitutes a single package for purposes of cogsa,we reject tall pony argument that the district court should have applied the cogsa limitation on damages based on the cubic area of the stage,which tall pony contends was the customary freight unit used by tropical in calculating the freight charge for the stage.in aluminios,the second circuit rejected this argument under similar circumstances 
t here is nothing in the bill of lading or in the statute that justifies the assumption that a cubic foot constitute s a customary freight unit.the parties could select this method for fixing the freight charges but there was no proof that such a cubic area was a customary unit to each of which units the limitation was applicable.it would be highly artificial to attribute to the stage as would tall pony,to each cubic foot or a ceiling on liability of in order to cover the loss.
tall pony next argues that it is entitled to recover the full value of the stage because it satisfied the requirements in the bill of lading by declaring a higher value for the stage on the bill of lading.in response,tropical and birdsall contend that the amount listed in the bill of lading represents the insurable value of the stage for purposes of obtaining insurance coverage,and was not the declared value of the stage,which would have required tall pony to pay a significantly higher ad valorem freight charge pursuant to applicable tariff regulations.we conclude that tall pony did not declare the value of the stage on the bill of lading and,accordingly,is limited to the recovery provided under section.
a shipper can increase the carrier potential liability for loss or damage to the shipper cargo simply by declaring a higher value and ensuring that it is inserted in the bill of lading.stolt tank containers evergreen marine,cir quotation marks omitted.if the shipper chooses this option,it must pay additional freight on the cargo in accord with filed ad valorem rates,at see also fishman,at i f the shipper wanted greater insurance coverage on its clothing,it could have paid additional freight charges,thus opting out of cogsa coverage.stolt tank containers,at.the shipper must declare the value of its cargo on the face of the bill of lading,not on some other related documents,to satisfy the valuation requirement,at.as the shipper,it was tall pony responsibility to ensure that the declared value was properly documented on the bill of lading see hale container line,at under cogsa,the shipper has the burden of declaring the value of its goods and paying a higher freight if it wants to have greater liability placed on the carrier.footnotes omitted.
in arguing that it is entitled to the full value for the stage,tall pony fails to distinguish between the insurable and declared value of the stage.see,at holding that the figure appearing on the bill of lading was the amount of insurance coverage a declaration of value for the purpose of satisfying the valuation requirement.simply stated,the insurable value is relevant with respect to the amount of premium paid to the insurer for coverage of a particular shipment.in contrast,the declared value is relevant in calculating the higher tariff rate paid to the carrier in order for the shipper to opt out of the cogsa limitation on liability.thus,the amount of insurance coverage sought by a shipper is not equivalent to a declaration of value for the shipment sufficient to satisfy the valuation and tariff requirements.tall pony confusion is evident in its brief on appeal where it argues that tropical can not limit its liability because tall pony declared the value of the shipment and agreed to pay to insure the cargo emphasis added.as such,we agree with the district court conclusion that tall pony failed to declare the value of the stage on the bill of lading.
moreover,it is undisputed that tall pony failed to pay additional freight on the cargo based on the applicable ad valorem tariff rates.an addendum to the bill of lading provided that a dditional liability will only be assumed by carrier at the request of the shipper and upon payment of an additional charge of two and percent of the total declared valuation.the district court determined that tall pony would have been required to pay an additional ad valorem freight tariff of approximately based on a declared value of for the shipment.we concur in the district court calculation instead,tall pony opted to rely on its insurance policy with seven seas to insure its cargo.see,ocean lynx,at.if tall pony believed that it had declared the higher value for the cargo,it would not have needed to obtain the seven seas policy.by making the business decision in favor of insurance coverage,tall pony actually paid an insurance premium of as listed in the bill of lading,an amount significantly less than the ad valorem tariff it would have been required to pay had it declared the value of the shipment on the bill of lading.under these circumstances,we will not provide tall pony the benefit of insurance for which it did not pay.unimac ocean,cir.for these reasons,we hold that the district court properly concluded that tall pony claim against tropical and birdsall for damage to the stage was limited to under section.
failure to procure insurance claim 
tall pony also appeals the district court dismissal of its failure to procure insurance claim against tropical.
tall pony brought a claim against tropical for negligently failing to procure the proper insurance coverage on its cargo for that portion of tall pony property and consequential damages resulting from the destruction of the stage that are not recoverable under the seven seas policy.in the event that it can not recover on its failure to procure insurance claim,tall pony raises an alternative theory of recovery under restatement second torts,which provides liability for negligence in a voluntary,rather than a contractual,undertaking.see,deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.
the claims were tried before the district court and tropical prevailed.in dismissing the claims,the district court found that tropical merely recommended that tall pony contact seven seas to discuss obtaining coverage for the shipment and that tropical was not acting as seven seas agent when it made that recommendation.because we conclude that the district court findings under the agency and restatement second torts theories of recovery were not clearly erroneous as a matter of law,we affirm the district court dismissal of tall pony claims.see beck prupis,cir,aff,d.we elaborate.
it was seven seas,rather than tropical,that tall pony contacted prior to the scheduled shipment date to confirm that it was adequately insured.further,tall pony concedes that it checked on seven seas with its broker before it contracted with seven seas for ocean marine insurance coverage for its shipment.similarly,seven seas,not tropical,issued the letter to tall pony stating that tall pony was fully insured on its cargo.thus,following its initial inquiry of tropical,tall pony dealt primarily with seven seas in obtaining insurance coverage.under these circumstances,tall pony can not persuasively argue that tropical undertook to obtain insurance coverage on behalf of tall pony for its cargo.see klonis armstrong,so d.
seven seas tall pony 
seven seas challenges the district court ruling that it is solely liable to tall pony under the terms of the seven seas insurance policy for,the amount paid by fireman fund to stageline and its insurers for the property damage to the stage.notably,seven seas does not dispute that its policy covered loss claims resulting from damage to the stage during ocean transport rather,seven seas argues that the fireman fund policy also insured tall pony for damage to the stage and,thus,the should be allocated pro rata between fireman fund and stageline based on the terms of their respective policies.seven seas also contends that the district court erred in holding that tall pony is entitled to attorney fees under.stat.in connection with its damage award against seven seas.tall pony,arguing that the district court erred by limiting its damage recovery against seven seas to the amount of physical property loss to the stage.specifically,tall pony argues that it is entitled to recover an additional,the difference between the amount paid by fireman fund to satisfy its obligations to third parties and tall pony arising from the accident and the amount awarded by the district court to tall pony under the terms of the seven seas policy for the physical damage to the stage.this amount is principally comprised of additional expenses tall pony incurred to obtain a replacement stage and settlement of any event loss of use claim against tall pony.we will consider the merits of these arguments seriatim.
the seven seas policy 
in concluding that the parties intended that only the seven seas policy afforded coverage for property damage to the stage occurring during ocean transport,the district court considered the deposition testimony of jerome anderson and robert sattler,the insurance agents who underwrote the fireman fund policy to tall pony,and danny harris,the head of production at tall pony.anderson testified that he had informed tall pony that fireman fund did not wish to insure risks associated with the open seas and,thus,that its policy did not cover the loading and transport of the stage.tall pony also relies on a letter from james mcintire,a vice president at seven seas,to harris stating that the seven seas policy covered tall pony cargo both to and from maarten.mcintire sent the letter to harris after harris had expressed concern that tall pony lacked adequate coverage for the ocean transport of its cargo.
following a bench trial on tall pony claim against seven seas for breaching its obligations under the seven seas policy,in which the district court considered the testimony of the anderson,sattler and harris and the letter from seven seas,the district court held that 
fireman fund said,we do want to insure this cargo while it on the open seas.we do want to take the open cargo type of coverage.we not very good at that and we just do want to handle that coverage.tall pony says fine,i try to get other coverage.and they talk to the shipper,who is tropical,and tropical recommends its sister company,which is seven seas.
so representatives at tall pony call fireman fund and say,what about this company,are they any good they check them out and they say yeah,they should be all right sic,we write our coverage and we wo charge you for the coverage with regard to the open sea trip,the ocean cargo policy.
now,all of this seems to happen at the last minute.and,finally,tall pony does have any indication of its insurance and so it calls seven seas and says,that thing is moving until i get some confirmation of coverage.that the infamous letter which says you covered for all risks.
t he first question the court has to deal with is,did fireman fund provide any coverage for the maritime leg of this trip the insurance company,one party to the contract,says we did write out any coverage,we did charge a premium that reflected that.the insured says they did provide any coverage and we did pay for that coverage.we paid somebody else for that risk.
w ith regard to the incident in question,i would find that at the time the stage was dropped fireman fund did not have coverage for that portion because that the portion that was specifically assumed by seven seas and they picked up the coverage at that time.
so if there is no insurance from fireman fund,that fireman fund has an assignment from tall pony and tall pony is the ultimate bailee of this,they had coverage with seven would hold seven seas liable for the total amount of the property damage,which is.
the import of the district court findings and conclusions of law was that fireman fund was not liable for any claims arising out of the destruction of the stage and that tall pony sole recourse was against seven seas under the terms of its all risk cargo policy.we disagree with the district court reasoning on this issue.
the question of the extent of coverage under an insurance policy is a question of law to be decided by the court and is therefore subject to plenary review by this court.see gulf tampa drydock great atl.ins,cir see also coleman florida ins.guar.ass n,so d,jones utica mut.ins,so d.

we agree to pay to you or on your behalf the value of personal property,including but not limited to cameras,camera equipment,sound and lighting equipment,portable electrical equipment,mechanical effects equipment,grip equipment and mobile equipment,not including loss of use,owned by you or which is the property of others for which you are legally liable and which is lost,damaged or destroyed during the term of coverage,caused by the perils insured against,while such property is used or to be used by you in connection with an insured production.
the perils insured provision under coverage d of the fireman fund policy provides this coverage insures against all risks of direct physical loss or damage to the property covered from any external cause,except as hereinafter excluded emphasis added.thus,under the plain language of these provisions,the fireman fund policy provided tall pony coverage for physical damage to equipment it owned or leased from a third party,unless the property was specifically excluded or the damage was caused by an uninsured peril.further,the policy limited fireman fund liability for each loss under coverage d to million,with a per loss deductible of.
this brings us to the perils not insured and property excluded sections in coverage d of the fireman fund policy.notably,those sections do not exclude coverage for the mobile stage or ocean transport further,fireman fund and tall pony point to no language in the fireman fund policy that is arguably ambiguous on its face.accordingly,we conclude that,under the clear and unambiguous language contained in the four corners of the fireman fund policy,vulcan painters mci constructors,cir,the parties intended that fireman fund would insure tall pony against loss on account of damage done to equipment,including,but not limited to,the mobile stage at issue,which tall pony was legally liable for at the time of the accident.therefore,the district court erred in considering parol evidence in construing the scope of coverage afforded under the fireman fund policy and holding that seven seas was exclusively liable for tall pony claimed loss arising from the property damage to the stage.
seven seas does not dispute that the coverage under its open cargo policy,which contained a million limitation on liability,extended to property damage to the stage at the time of the accident.indeed,the letter written by james mcintire on behalf of seven seas on the date of the accident confirms that conclusion.thus,having determined that fireman fund and seven seas are liable under the terms of their respective policies,we must next consider the impact of the mutual other insurance provisions contained in those policies.
the other insurance provision in the fireman fund policy states if at the time of loss or damage any other insurance is available which would apply to the property in the absence of this policy,the insurance provided by this policy shall apply as excess insurance over the other insurance.the seven seas policy contains a similar provision if an interest insured hereunder is covered by other insurance which attached prior to the coverage provided by this policy,then this company shall be liable only for the amount in excess of such prior insurance.the result of these competing other insurance clauses is settled under florida law when two insurance policies contain other insurance clauses the clauses are deemed mutually repugnant and both insurers share the loss on a pro rata basis in accordance with their policy limits.galen health care am.cas.of reading,citing travelers ins.lexington ins,so d,see also rouse greyhound,cir in applying florida law,holding that the other insurance clauses are mutually repugnant,since if both are given effect neither insurer would be liable.accordingly,the fireman fund and seven seas other insurance clauses cancel each other out and both insurers share the loss on a pro rated basis.galen health care.at.without the benefit of adequate briefing on this point,we leave it to the district court on remand to decide in the first instance the manner in which liability for the physical damage loss to the stage should be apportioned between fireman fund and seven seas based on the scope of coverage provided under their respective policies.see,clark putnam county,cir.accordingly,we vacate the damage award,plus prejudgment interest,against seven seas in connection with tall pony claimed loss for property damage to the stage.
tall pony for consequential damages 
tall pony challenges the district court ruling that the seven seas policy did not provide for consequential damages,comprised mainly of costs associated with settling tall pony liability to any event and payments made by tall pony to obtain a replacement stage and transport it to maarten where it was assembled.specifically,tall pony claims that all of these costs,totaling,fall within the scope of coverage provided in the seven seas policy.we turn to the district court resolution of tall pony claim for consequential damages as our starting point.
in rejecting tall pony claim for consequential damages,the district court reasoned 
i think that the language all risks in the context of shipping things by sea has to be construed in the terms of all risk of damage to the,all types of damage to the equipment.i do believe that there was any indication here that they saying we get paid for consequential damages.
if that were sought,it seems to me it would be incumbent upon harris of tall pony to say not only do i want all kinds of coverage for all kinds of perils,but i want consequential damages too.
w ith regard to tall pony contention that they had broader coverage than the total amount of the property damage to the stage,i would think that there at least ought to be some document indicating that they were looking for broader coverage than that.i have read a lot of cases involving shipping and they always talk about an policy as being all risks of sea.you know,sinking.anything.act of god.anything that can happen to it,including breakage.and i sure that that exactly what they meant by that letter.
i have never seen nor have i heard of,with many of these maritime cases,somebody providing an open cargo coverage,interruption of business,and consequential damages.there would be no way that anybody could underwrite that,from a standpoint of saying,well,we going to insure that your product is lost or damaged or unusable.
they could say,well,we were going to use that for this,and because we could do that and this happened,that consequential damages could go into the gazillions.
we agree with the result reached by the district court,albeit for slightly different reasons.
the inherent flaw in tall pony argument is its failure to distinguish between a risk or peril insured against under the insurance policy,the cause of the loss,and the damages or recovery sought as a result of the occurrence of that risk or peril.to view tall pony argument,and the misconceptions that underlie that argument,in their proper context,we first briefly discuss certain general principles applicable to all risk policies.
in general,an all risk insurance policy provides coverage for the primary risks to the ship of navigating on the waters.lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance at id.at as a general statement,the coverage under a marine insurance policy is presumed to apply to risks common to the sea or other navigable waters.an all risk policy,such as the one present here,typically works in favor of the insured o nce the insured establishes a loss apparently within the terms of an all risks policy,the burden shifts to the insurer to prove that the loss arose from a cause which is excepted.union fire ins.carib aviation,cir per curiam emphasis added quotation marks omitted see also int l ship repair marine servs.paul fire marine ins,int l ship repair.this benefit to the insured applies,however,only where what is at issue is the risk insured against in an policy.appalachian ins.united postal sav.ass n,so d,where,as here,the issue is not the risk,but the application of a deductible,then the fact that the instant policy happens to be an policy is totally immaterial.
in contrast,an insurance policy may provide coverage for named perils,where,for example,the insured may purchase protection from a specific peril,such as fire,collision,or ice.lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance at.in these cases,the insured may recover only if the loss was caused by one of the covered perils enumerated in the policy.see,steelmet,at united states fire ins.cavanaugh,cir.
cases involving an all risk insurance policy generally share a common theme a determination of whether the claimed loss or damage was caused by a peril falling within the policy coverage.see,morrison grain utica mut.ins,cir atl.lines am.motorists ins,cir holding that the average insured would not believe that this was a risk or hazard against which he had insured when he purchased all risk insurance jewelers mut.ins.balogh,cir the assured did not have to demonstrate that the loss was not caused by one of the excepted conditions.int l ship repair.at redna marine poland,see also lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance at noting that coverages under all risk marine insurance policies address only what instrumentalities of the loss are covered.this point is further illustrated by webster definition of the word risk someone or something that creates or suggests a hazard or adverse chance or the chance of loss or the perils to the subject matter of insurance covered by a contract.webster third new international dictionary emphasis added.with these basic principles in mind,we examine the perils clause contained in the seven seas marine insurance policy,which governs our analysis.
the perils clause contained in the seven seas policy provides 
touching the adventures and perils seven seas is contented to bear,and takes upon itself,they are of the seas,fire,assailing thieves,jettisons,barratry of the master and mariners,and all other like perils,losses and misfortunes,illicit or contraband trade excepted in all cases that have come to the hurt,detriment,or damage of the said goods and merchandise or any part thereof.
emphasis added.the parties assert,and we agree,that the language in the clause is sufficient to demonstrate seven seas intention to provide all risk coverage to its insured.int l ship repair.at.however,the plain import of the perils clause is that it applies only to the ship cargo,and not for damages for loss of profits and expected use of a piece of equipment that is out of commission.lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance at nevers aetna ins,holding that an all risks yachtsman hull policy was not broad enough to provide coverage for the loss of the boat due to defective title.while the seven seas policy limited tall pony recovery to damage to its cargo,it did not make tall pony recovery contingent on the occurrence of a specific peril as the cause of that damage.accordingly,we hold that the plain language of the policy repudiates tall pony contention that the seven seas policy is broad enough to include consequential damages.further,tall pony cites no authority in support of its claim that consequential damages are recoverable as a matter of common industry practice in cases involving similar marine insurance policies.because the seven seas policy is unambiguous on this point,we need not consider the mcintire letter in construing the scope of coverage afforded under the policy or as evidence of the coverage tall pony believed it had at the time of the accident.see towne realty,at union fire ins,at.
to the extent tall pony argues that the parties intended the mcintire letter to supplement or modify the coverage provided under the seven seas policy,this argument still fails to rescue tall pony claim for consequential damages.
to view tall pony claim in its proper context,we begin with the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the letter by seven seas.on the same day that tropical was scheduled to ship the stage and tall pony other equipment,tall pony became concerned that it lacked insurance coverage for its cargo.this prompted harris to contact seven seas and request a written confirmation from seven seas that it was covered for the trip.in response,james mcintire,vice president at seven seas,issued a letter to harris stating,in part,that tall pony productions is held covered on their cargo sailing from port of palm beach to maarten and on the return trip.seven seas letter apparently quelled tall pony concerns,as there was no further contact between the parties with respect to the letter.the accident that resulted in the damage to the stage occurred later that day.
in support of its contention that the mcintire letter is sufficiently broad to include a claim for consequential damages in connection with the damage to the stage,tall pony relies on the following excerpted language from that letter coverage is all risk excluding any discrepancies prior to receipt from tropical shipping.even assuming that this isolated language represented the sum and substance of the mcintire letter and that the letter effectively modified the terms of the seven seas policy,it adds nothing to tall pony claim.as we held above,under an all risk policy,an insured is entitled to recover for damage to its cargo regardless of the peril that caused that damage.the term all risk does not,however,stand for the far broader application advanced by tall pony namely,that an all risk policy permits an insured to recover for all losses or damages resulting from the accident.
tall pony contention is further flawed because it reads that sentence in isolation of the remainder of the letter.specifically,tall pony selective treatment of the mcintire letter fails to include the following language from the preceding sentence tall pony productions is held covered on their cargo sailing from port of palm beach to maarten emphasis added.thus,read in its entirety,the mcintire letter supports seven seas position that it intended to limit its policy coverage to tall pony cargo.moreover,given the timing and sequence of events that prompted issuance of the letter,we are not persuaded by tall pony argument that the parties intended that letter to embody their intentions with respect to the parties mutual obligations and the scope of coverage provided under the seven seas policy.rather,the letter was intended to address tall pony immediate concerns regarding proof of insurance for its shipment.to hold otherwise,we would have to stretch reality to conclude that the parties relied on a letter,prepared with little or no negotiation,to encompass their entire insurance agreement.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of tall pony claim against seven seas for in consequential damages arising out of the accident 
award of attorney fees under.stat.
with little argument from the parties,the district court held,following the conclusion of the bench trial in tall pony ii,that tall pony,as an insured suing its insurance company,was entitled to attorney fees in connection with its damage award against seven seas.the district court did not,however,make a specific award of attorney fees at that time.in a final judgment dated march,the district court awarded tall pony attorney fees in the amount of,along with prejudgment interest.on appeal,seven seas does not challenge the amount of attorney fees awarded to tall pony,but rather,tall pony entitlement to attorney fees in connection with its damage award against seven seas.specifically,seven seas argues that fireman fund,rather than tall pony,is the real and,thus,the present dispute is actually between two insurance companies.we agree,and therefore vacate the district court award of attorney fees made pursuant to.stat.
we review de novo the legal question of whether tall pony is entitled to an award of attorney fees pursuant to.stat.see weisberg,at.
our vacatur of the damage award against seven seas requires that we also vacate the award of attorney fees against seven seas in connection with that damage award.simply put,an award of attorney fees can not stand absent a judgment in favor of the insured.see.stat.upon the rendition of a judgment against an insurer and in favor of any named or omnibus insured the trial court shall adjudge or decree against the insurer and in favor of the insured reasonable attorney fees.however,because we hold today that both the fireman fund and seven seas insurance policies provide coverage for the property damage to the stage at the time of the accident,we will consider now the question whether tall pony is entitled to any award of attorney fees based on the district court determination on remand of seven seas pro rata share of the claimed loss for the physical damage to the stage.see steelmet,at a n insured is entitled to an award of fees even where both parties obtain some relief in the appellate court.as a threshold question,we must first determine whether state or federal maritime law governs.
in weisberg,we considered the question of whether federal or state law governs an application for attorney fees in the context of a marine insurance contract dispute.see weisberg,at.in that case,the insurance company argued that.stat.conflicted with established maritime law,which prohibit s any award of attorney fees in an admiralty action absent a contract provision,a federal statute,or bad faith in the litigation process.id.we disagreed,noting that t his circuit has awarded attorney fees pursuant to.stat.in a number of marine insurance contract disputes.id.at.we viewed the consistent application of state law in this context as implicitly hold ing that there exists no specific and controlling federal law relating to attorney fees in maritime insurance litigation.id.accordingly,we expressly held that a district court may award attorney fees pursuant to.stat.against an insurer in a maritime insurance contract case.id.at.
having determined that the district court did not err in relying on.stat.as a basis for awarding attorney fees,we turn to the substantive question at hand whether the district court properly applied.stat.based on the specific facts and circumstances present in this case.
stat.provides 
upon the rendition of a judgment or decree by any of the courts of this state against an insurer and in favor of any named or omnibus insured or the named beneficiary under a policy or contract executed by the insurer,the trial court or,in the event of an appeal in which the insured or beneficiary prevails,the appellate court shall adjudge or decree against the insurer and in favor of the insured or beneficiary a reasonable sum as fees or compensation for the insured or beneficiary attorney prosecuting the suit in which the recovery is had.
broadly read,section provides attorney fees to an insured that obtains a judgment against an insurer.ins.of am.lexow,cir.however,because s ection is in the nature of a penalty against an insurer who wrongfully refuses to pay a legitimate claim,we strictly construe its language.great southwest fire ins.dewitt,so d,citing lumbermens mut.ins.am.arbitration ass n,so d,see also lexow,at id.at noting that the purpose of section is to discourage contesting of valid claims of insureds against insurance companies,and reimburse successful insureds reasonably for their outlays for attorney fees when they are compelled to defend or to sue to enforce their contracts quoting wilder wright,so d.i ndividuals entitled to recover attorney fees under section are either an insured or the named beneficiary under a policy or contract executed by the insurer,lexow,at quoting indus.fire cas.ins.prygrocki,so d,and the statute authoriz es the recovery of attorney fees from the insurer only when the insurer has wrongfully withheld payment of the proceeds of the policy.lumbermens mut.ins,so d at quotation marks omitted.the paramount condition is the entry of a judgment against the insurer and in favor of the insured.lexow,at quotation marks omitted.
seven seas concedes that tall pony was a named assured under the seven seas policy and that the policy is all risk and covers tall pony claimed loss for the physical damage to the stage.we also note that tall pony is listed as the plaintiff in the action against seven seas seeking to recover for the loss arising from the damage to the stage.the parties dispute focuses on the significance of the loan receipt executed by fireman fund and tall pony,and,more importantly,whether the present dispute is in substance an action between two insurance companies,to wit,fireman fund and seven seas.
the loan receipt provides,in pertinent part,that tall pony receives the sum of from fireman fund 
as a loan and not as payment of any claim,repayable only out of any net recovery tall pony may make from any vessel,carrier,bailee,or others upon or by reason of any claim for the loss of or damage to the stage,or from any insurance effected by tall pony and as security for such payment we hereby pledge to fireman fund all such claims and any recovery thereon.
in further consideration of the said advance,we hereby appoint the agents and officers of fireman fund with irrevocable power to collect on such claim s and to begin,prosecute,compromise or withdraw,in tall pony name,but at the expense of fireman fund,any and all legal proceedings which it may deem necessary to enforce such claim or claims,and to execute in our name any documents which may be necessary to carry into effect the purposes of this agreement.
we hereby ratify,approve and confirm the filing and maintenance of any suits in our name for recovery of any damages with respect to said shipments.
the loan receipt covered payments made by fireman fund in settlement of claims brought by any event and stageline,as well as payments made directly to tall pony for expenses incurred in obtaining a replacement stage.seven seas argues that the timing and circumstances surrounding the execution of the loan receipt demonstrate that tall pony was not the real in the action against seven seas.we agree.
fireman fund and tall pony executed the loan receipt approximately ten months after fireman fund tendered the payment to settle the suits initiated by stageline and its insurers for the damage to the stage.more notably,the remaining payments that comprise the balance due under the loan receipt were made during with the exception of a audit expense,some three years before the loan receipt was executed.see id.during that three year period,tall pony proffered no consideration for the payments made by fireman fund directly to tall pony and on its behalf,and fireman fund did not seek a subrogation of tall pony rights or a reservation of its rights in exchange for those payments.in addition,both fireman fund and tall pony were represented by the same attorney,and that attorney was compensated by fireman fund.under these circumstances,we conclude that the loan receipt masks the true nature of this action,utica mut.ins.mut.cas.ins,so d,which was one solely between two insurers rather than a subrogation action.id.
an examination of the various judgments entered by the district court in the seven seas action reinforces our conclusion.
to further support its position that fireman fund was the real in the action against seven seas,seven seas maintains that the district court entered judgment in favor of fireman fund,which is neither a named or omnibus insured or the named beneficiary under the seven seas policy.stat,and,therefore,tall pony is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under that section.this argument is not without force,as both the october,final judgment and the december,amended final judgment state that final judgment is hereby entered for the plaintiff,fireman fund,for the use and benefit of tall pony.further,during the bench trial in tall pony i,the district court commented that,in cases such as the present action,the real party in interest is the insurance company who paid the loss and is looking to pass their loss off on the party who created the damage t he real party was the insurance company who provided insurance for the use and benefit of the insured.we note,however,that in the final judgment awarding attorney fees entered on march,the district court awarded,plus interest,in favor of plaintiff,tall pony productions.
notwithstanding the language employed by the district court in the march,judgment,and that tall pony was identified as the plaintiff in the action commenced against seven seas,we conclude that fireman fund was the real in that action.accordingly,we hold that tall p
