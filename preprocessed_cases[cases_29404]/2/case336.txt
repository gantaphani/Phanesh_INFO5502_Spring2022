on september,the lee white,a foot cargo freighter carrying million pounds of iron ore,struck the grosse ile toll bridge,a drawbridge on the trenton channel of the detroit river.the grosse ile bridge company filed suit against the american steamship company,which owns the white,seeking to recover damages to the bridge on the basis that the collision was caused by the white negligence.following a bench trial,the district court found that the white bore no responsibility for the accident,and therefore denied recovery.grosse ile now concedes that it was at fault for not timely swinging the bridge open,but argues on appeal that the white was also partly at fault for failing to timely stop when it had the opportunity to do so.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the grosse ile toll bridge is a privately owned bridge over the detroit river that opened to traffic in.it has a swing span in its center section that pivots open.the swing span is feet long and takes approximately one and a half minutes to completely open after the bridgetender activates the pivot mechanism.bracketing the swing section on both sides are fixed spans that are feet in length.when the swing span is open,two draws are created on either side of the bridge pivot point.the bridge thus presents a tight passage for a ship such as the white,which is feet wide.
on september,which was a clear,sunny day,the white was proceeding south on the trenton channel of the detroit river toward its destination beyond the grosse ile toll bridge.the bridge operators knew that the white was coming,because the ship had radioed notice to the operators the day before.bridgetenders donald ryan and john tonkovich testified that they expected the ship to arrive shortly after they came on duty at that day.
ryan was posted in the toll booth with a.his duties involved taking tolls from passing traffic and lowering the traffic gates to clear the bridge of vehicles whenever the bridge needed to be opened for river traffic.tonkovich was stationed in the office,which has a window looking northward onto the trenton channel.as the bridgetender manning the office,tonkovich was responsible for monitoring radio communications from the coast guard and responding to requests to open the bridge by vessels on the channel.he was also charged with operating the mechanism for opening the bridge,which is situated on top of the office and accessed by ladder.
more than a mile above the bridge,the white picked up two tugboats to help control the ship lateral movement as it passed through one of the bridge draws.richard sibbersen,captain of the tugboat that attached itself to the white bow,testified that he informed one of the bridgetenders over the radio that the ship and its tugboats would be at the bridge in the next to minutes.tonkovich,the bridgetender who received the call,acknowledged the information by saying,according to captain sibbersen,that they would be looking for us.
after the two tugboats began moving down the river at between five and seven miles per hour,captain sibbersen again called the bridge by radio.he said we on our way down,we be down there in about five minutes or so,to which tonkovich responded fine.we see you.we be ready for you.captain sibbersen radioed a second time to tell the bridgetenders that he would be giving a whistle signal for the bridge to open in just a couple of minutes,and to ask them if they would be ready to open the bridge.tonkovich replied fine,okay.the whistle signal to open the bridge was given by captain sibbersen on his tugboat whistle just after the white reached red buoy,the point in the channel where it is customary to give the signal when towing a ship.but the bridge did not respond,so captain sibbersen blew a second signal on his tugboat whistle.he also radioed tonkovich for a third time,but received no reply.
despite these radio calls and whistle signals,captain sibbersen saw vehicular traffic still moving on the toll bridge.so did richard gasco,the lookout on the bow of the white,as the ship approached green buoy and red buoy.these buoys,located approximately feet above the bridge,are effectively the point of no return for a ship the size of the white.the custom and practice of the bridge was to begin opening the pivotal span for a ship no later than red buoy,which is feet north of buoys and.
upon reaching the point of no return,captain sibbersen blew the danger signal to the bridge on his tugboat whistle.john gapczynski,captain of the white,also blew the danger signal,which he repeated as the ship passed the buoys.these danger one consisting of five short whistle heard by witnesses on the shore.in addition to all the whistles,michael mehall,a pleasure boater who was next to the bridge and sitting on the top of his boat at the elevation of the bridgetender office about feet above the water,yelled to tonkovich that the ship was approaching the bridge.but the bridge remained closed.allen wilson,another pleasure boater in the vicinity,testified that the bridge yellow light,a signal that the bridge is opening,was flashing as the ship bow passed green buoy and red buoy.
but neither the white nor the tugboats saw the light or any other sign that the bridge was about to open,and the district court made no finding as to whether the yellow light was in fact on or off.gasco,the lookout,testified that he was aware that a flashing yellow light is one method that a bridge can use to signal that it is about to open,but said that he did not specifically look for such a light on the day of the accident because it would have been difficult to see in sunny conditions.instead,he focused on other signs that the bridge was opening,such as the traffic on the bridge.
soon after the ship passed the point of no return,gasco saw a car hurriedly back away from the center section of the bridge.interpreting this as a sign that the bridge was about to open,gasco told captain gapczynski that the vehicular traffic had finally cleared away.but then gasco saw two more vehicles drive onto the center section.hearing this,captain gapczynski decided that he had to stop the white in order to avoid a collision.in attempting to do so,captain gapczynski first radioed to the tugboats that he was going to back down the white engine,even though this would cause the bow of the freighter to swing to the port side.he told captain sibbersen to move his tugboat from the bow to the starboard flank of the ship in order to partially counteract the movement to port.the white engine was then put into reverse,causing the bow to veer to port and thus lose alignment with the planned draw through the open bridge.
sometime after these measures were taken,the bridge finally began to open.when the white was just to from the bridge,the ship dropped its pound anchor.the white had come to an almost complete stop when it reached the bridge,but its bow tapped the stationary span on the east side of the bridge.because of the huge momentum of a ship laden with million pounds of iron ore,this slight tap was enough to knock the entire span into the water.fortunately,no one was injured.the bridge,as it turned out,had fully opened by the time the ship hit the stationary span.
why the bridge failed to timely open is less than clear.tonkovich testified that he simply thought he had more time to open the bridge than he did,and that he did not hear the ship second danger signal.ryan offered no justification.there was testimony from one of the bridgetenders,however,that ryan appeared to have been drinking alcohol when he reported for duty at on the date of the accident.
grosse ile sued american steamship to recover damages to the bridge.after a bench trial,the district court found that the bridgetenders had failed to timely open the bridge for the white despite receiving multiple notices of the ship approach.the district court concluded that grosse ile actions and lack of action in this matter caused the co llision,and that the white bore no responsibility for the accident.grosse ile then filed this timely appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court apportionment of fault is subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard.in re cleveland tankers,cir affirming the district court apportionment of fault in an admiralty case using the clearly erroneous standard todd shipyards turbine,cir holding that,in an admiralty case,questions concerning the existence of negligence and proximate causation are treated as factual issues and are thus subject to the clearly erroneous standard.a finding is clearly erroneous where,although there is evidence to support that finding,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.kalamazoo river study group rockwell intern,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
b.the district court findings 
whether bridgetender ryan had been drinking alcohol 
grosse ile contends that the district court erred in finding that bridgetender ryan had been drinking on the day of the accident,and that this finding is extremely important,because it may explain otherwise unexplainable conclusions the court reached about the actions of the vessel,and may have otherwise tainted her opinion.the following passage in the district court opinion discusses ryan alleged drinking 
ryan was said to have received alcoholic beverages as gifts while tending the bridge.gerald lakos,an off duty bridgetender,also testified that ryan had been drinking that day.these facts do not indicate that the bridgetenders were not generally competent to operate the bridge.the court finds that the bridgetenders were generally competent to operate the bridge.however,on september,neither bridgetender exhibited this general competence in opening the bridge.
although the district court opinion refers to lakos testimony in the above passage,it is not clear that the district court found as a matter of fact that ryan had been drinking on the day of the accident.even if the district court is presumed to have made such a finding,however,we conclude that the finding was sufficiently supported by the record as not to be clearly erroneous.lakos testimony had several indicia of credibility.first,lakos knew ryan personally and was thus likely to be able to detect changes in his demeanor.second,lakos was one of the bridgetenders on the shift that ended just before ryan came on duty at on the day of the accident.finally,lakos testified that when he saw and spoke to ryan at the shift change,ryan appeared to have been drinking because his speech was slurred and he had a brown paper bag with him.lakos therefore saw ryan first hand,and made specific observations very near in time to the collision.
on the other hand,it was common for bridgetenders to receive gifts of alcohol without opening the gifts,and ryan slurred speech could have resulted from chewing gum.this contrary evidence is not so overwhelming,however,as to leave us with a definite and firm conviction that a finding that ryan had been drinking when he reported for duty on the date of the accident would be clearly erroneous.
furthermore,the conclusion that the district court allegedly drew from the fact that ryan had been he exhibited incompetence in timely opening the bridge on the day of the fully supported by other uncontested facts in the record.this is made clear in the portion of the district court opinion that immediately follows the passage quoted above 
instead,the bridgetenders delayed the opening of the bridge,continued to allow vehicles onto the bridge and failed to respond to the vessel after the danger signals were given.the court finds that on september,the grosse ile bridge was tended by competent and bridgetenders.however,these bridgetenders failed to competently perform their duties on the date in question.
the matter of whether ryan had been drinking is thus superfluous to the district court ultimate finding that the grosse ile bridgetenders failed to competently perform their duties that day.
whether the white posted a proper lookout 
grosse ile also contends that the district court erred in determining that the white posted a proper lookout.by statute,
e very vessel shall at all times maintain a proper by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.
a lookout must be a person of suitable experience and vigilance,stationed at a place where the risk of the danger of collision may be readily perceived.see bunge furness bridge,cir finding that the defendant vessel had failed to post a proper lookout because,although on the bow and apparently capable of observing the important signs of danger,the lookouts were not adequately vigilant in executing their duties prior to the collision between the vessel and a wharf.
if the white failed to post a proper lookout in violation of this statute,then the rule of the pennsylvania,wall,would govern the issue of liability.the supreme court held in the pennsylvania that where a vessel at the time of a collision is in violation of a statutory or regulatory rule intended to prevent such a collision,the violation is presumed to be at least a contributory cause of the accident.id.at.to rebut this presumption,the vessel in violation of a rule must prove not only that the violation was not in fact the cause of the accident,but that the violation could not have been a cause of the accident.id.
in the present case,the lookout on the white as it approached the grosse ile toll bridge was richard gasco,the ship second mate.gasco was positioned on the bow,from which he communicated directly with captain gapczynski via radio.a licensed pilot,gasco had gone through the grosse ile toll bridge numerous times during his years as a seaman.gasco was therefore to serve as the white lookout,and he was positioned properly to view the bridge as the ship drew near.
but grosse ile argues that gasco was nevertheless an improper lookout because he did not know the response signal for which he should be looking.according to grosse ile,gasco should have been looking for the bridge flashing yellow light,which is one of the methods that the coast guard has approved for a drawbridge to signal that it is preparing to open.c iii.
gasco testified,contrary to grosse ile characterization of his statements,that he was aware that a flashing yellow light may be used by a bridge to signal that it is opening,and that if he had seen such a light,he would have reported it.but gasco explained that he does not specifically look for flashing yellow lights during the daylight hours because they are too difficult to see at such times.rather,he looks for other signs that a bridge is preparing to open,such as the lowering of the gates that prevent vehicles from entering the swing span and the cessation of traffic flow across the bridge.the question therefore becomes whether gasco decision not to look specifically for the yellow light rendered him an improper lookout.
during the course of the trial,the district judge personally viewed the opening of the pivotal span from the pilothouse of a ship similar to the white as it approached the grosse ile toll bridge.the judge found that 
on a clear,sunny day not unlike the day of the co llision,the yellow signal light while visible is not very visible to the naked eye during sunny daylight hours.however,the activity on the bridge is very visible from the pilothouse of the vessel and by inference would be more visible from the bow which is approximately feet forward of the pilothouse.
there is no dispute that gasco competently observed and accurately reported the actions of the gates and traffic on the bridge,as well as the nonopening status of the bridge itself,and that all of these indicators pointed to the bridge not opening on time.furthermore,we are not in a position to the district court corroboration of gasco statement about the low visibility of the yellow flashing light in the daytime.gasco decision to focus on the more easily observed signs of activity on the bridge rather than search for a flashing yellow light was therefore a judgment call that a v
