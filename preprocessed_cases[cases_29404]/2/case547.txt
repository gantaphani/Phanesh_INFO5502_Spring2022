on june,the international longshoremen association,union,filed a representation petition with the national labor relations board nlrb or board,pursuant to section c of the national labor relations act act,c,seeking an election to become the exclusive bargaining agent for port captains,assistant port captains,and port engineers employed by evergreen america corporation evergreen or employer.the employer opposed the proposed bargaining unit on the ground that the five persons in the unit were managerial employees and therefore excluded from coverage under the act.following a hearing,the acting regional director issued a decision holding that the disputed employees were not excluded managers and ordered an election.see evergreen am,case,representation decision,reprinted in joint appendix.the employer then sought review by the board.a secret ballot election was held on september,and the ballots were impounded pending a decision from the board.on october,the board denied the employer request for review.on november,after the ballots had been counted,the acting regional director certified the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in the contested unit.
in order to obtain judicial review of the board certification decision,evergreen refused to recognize and bargain with the union.evergreen also refused to provide information sought by the union relating to existing employee benefit plans.on january,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the nlrb.a complaint was then issued,alleging that the employer refusals to bargain and furnish information violated sections a and of the act,a.the employer filed an answer admitting the refusal to bargain,but challenging the validity of the board certification.the board subsequently granted the general counsel motion for summary judgment,holding that the employer had violated sections a and as charged.see evergreen am,nlrb,wl.evergreen petitions this court for review of that order,and the board for enforcement.
the only issues on appeal are whether substantial evidence supports the board determination that the port captains,assistant port captains,and port engineers in the contested bargaining unit are employees under the act and whether the board determination is consistent with the act.on the record at hand,we find no basis upon which to overturn the board judgment.we therefore deny evergreen petition for review and grant the board for enforcement.
background 
the hearing on the representation petition included testimony from chen,evergreen junior vice president and marine department head,charles meng,an assistant port captain,yang,a port captain,and johnnie chen,manager of the marine section.the facts elicited at the hearing are largely undisputed.we reprint them here 
background 
the employer is a new jersey corporation,with its office located in morristown,new jersey.the employer is a general shipping agent for evergreen marine corporation emc,a company located in taipei,taiwan that owns and operates approximately ships used to transport cargo in containers for its customers to various ports around the world.in the new york city area,emc ships berth at maher terminal,a terminal in elizabeth,new jersey.
the employer is responsible for the loading and unloading of emc vessels at maher terminal the terminal.neither the employer nor emc own the terminal.rather,the employer contracts with the terminal for terminal services,meaning that the terminal provides a berth for ships owned or chartered by emc as well as stevedore services,meaning that the terminal provides employees called stevedores to unload and load cargo.the stevedores are employees of the terminal.other shipping companies berth ships at the terminal.usually,three of emc ships arrive at the terminal each week.after berthing in elizabeth,the ship travels to other ports in europe or on the east coast of the united states,such as baltimore or savannah.on any given day,the employer stores two or three thousand containers at maher terminal.
the five employees work in the employer marine section,which also includes a section manager,an assistant manager and a general staff person.the employees report to the new york city marine section manager who reports to the junior who heads the marine department.the marine department junior also supervises the marine section manager in salt lake city and the marine section manager in los angeles.the marine department junior vice president reports to the executive for marine and logistics.in its organizational chart,the employer designates personnel at the level of executive and above as management.
b.the port captains 
the parties have stipulated that the duties of the port captains and the assistant port captain are the same.the port captains and assistant port captain are responsible for preparing a schedule for unloading and loading the ship,preparing a plan for loading its cargo,acting as a liaison between the ship and the port,and monitoring the unloading and loading of cargo 
the port captains remain at the employer morristown office until a ship comes in.when a ship arrives,they work in the terminal,monitoring the loading and unloading of the ship.the port captain manager records when the port captain leaves the office and returns from working in the terminal.the port captains have their own desks in morristown,but do not have individual offices at the morristown facility.the port captains manager works in the morristown office where he usually remains.the port captains must be available to management by phone at all times.the port captains manager testified that the port captains contact him throughout the day to keep him informed on situations.the port captains manager testified that port captains can handle routine matters,but they consult with him on matters or emergencies,matters involving significant costs and matters not covered by guidelines previously given to the port captains.the employer has issued detailed descriptions of the port captain functions,but concedes that these may not reflect actual practice.a port captain can not approve payment of checks by the employer accounting department.in a conflict between the port captain and the ship captain or the chief mate,the ship personnel prevail.
preparation of prospect reports 
approximately one week before a ship is scheduled to arrive at the terminal,the port captain compiles a projected schedule for the ship activity at the terminal,called a prospect report.the prospect report includes the dates the ship will berth,the estimated time of arrival,the estimated time the ship will berth,the times that unloading and loading,referred to as cargo activity,will begin and finish,the total number of container movements,the number of labor gangs ordered,the hours they will work and the estimated time of departure.some of the information on the prospect report is supplied from various departments within the employer.the port captain does not change the ship overall schedule,which has been determined by the employer project department and can not be changed without the agreement of the port captain manager.
the port captain obtains the estimated time of the ship arrival from the project department.it generally takes three and hours after the ship arrives at the harbor to get to its berth in the terminal.the employer advises the port captain of the total number of containers to be unloaded and loaded,or container movements.
the port captain adds to the prospect report the planned times that cargo activity will begin and end.he also adds the estimated number of labor gangs requested.he arrives at these figures by making mathematical calculations.he is limited by the ship overall schedule.normally a ship is in port for about hours.he knows the number of containers that a crane can move within an hour.pursuant to terminal procedure,one labor gang works with each crane.he knows the number of cranes that can safely be operated on a ship.the number of container movements and the length of time that the ship will be berthed determine the number of labor gangs he requests.for example,a port captain may be told that a ship can be in port hours and will need moves.he knows he must move containers an hour and that a crane can move moves per hours sic,so he will figure on using four cranes and four labor gangs to move the containers.
the junior testified that in scheduling cargo activity,the port captain takes into account the start times of the stevedores,who start at or am,pm or pm.he testified that the port captain tries to schedule cargo activity to avoid paying overtime costs,and to use the stevedores during the day when it is less expensive to pay them,as opposed to at night.the port captain may recommend that the ship captain speed up to arrive in the terminal at a time that is economical for cargo activity.
the port captain manager reviews each prospect report.at the beginning of each week,the port captain manager contacts an administrator at the terminal to review with him the schedules of emc ships coming into the terminal that week.after terminal personnel learn the schedules of all of its customers,a terminal representative will contact the port captain to tell him how many cranes and workers will be available for each ship.if the terminal advises that the number of stevedores is different than that requested by the employer,the port captain will report this to his manager.if there is a conflict in which two vessels owned or chartered by emc are scheduled to berth at the same time,the port captain manager will decide how many gangs are assigned to each vessel.
the number of gangs assigned to a ship is ultimately decided between the terminal manager and the port captain manager.subsequently,if a ship is behind schedule,the port captain may,in consultation with his manager,request that the terminal provide additional labor to shorten the period of cargo activity.
ii.preparation of stowage plans 
the process of loading cargo is termed stowage.prior to the arrival of a ship,the port captain prepares a stowage plan,which is a diagram showing the placement of cargo to be loaded onto the ship.in making the stowage plan,the port captain aims to load the cargo efficiently,and to load the ship to its maximum capacity while maintaining the ship stability.the port captain starts with a computerized floor plan of the bays in the ship where cargo can be stored.emc ships have ten different floor plans.the port captain looks at the previous stowage plan designation for the containers to be unloaded to determine what space will be available for loading.he is told the weight of the cargo the ship can handle.he contacts the employer export department to find out the size and weight of the cargo to be loaded.the employer generally uses three sizes of containers.there may be oversized cargo to be loaded onto the ship.the port captain considers the sequence of ports in the ship route.he plans to load heavier cargo at the bottom of the ship.the port captain takes into account the number of cranes available at the port where cargo will be unloaded.a port captain will spread out cargo to conform with the positioning and number of cranes at the destination port.the port captain also considers whether cargo is hazardous.he must follow federal regulations and the international maritime code in the manner these containers are handled.he must get approval from his manager if he deviates from these guidelines.he learns from the employer whether containers must be kept refrigerated and therefore require access to electricity.the port captain knows where electrical outlets are located on the various ships.the export department advises him the day before the ship comes in if military containers will be loaded and if so,the weight,size and destination of such containers.
the employer gives the port captain specific guidelines as to how space on the ship is to be used.the port captain uses a computer to superimpose onto the floor plan a diagram showing where containers going to the various ports will be placed.he uses a hydrostatic table to evaluate the ship stability after cargo is loaded according to the stowage plan.
if a ship will berth between am and pm,the port captain must complete the stowage plan the night before the ship will berth.if the ship is to be berthed after pm,the port captain must complete the plan before noon on that day.the port captain submits the stowage plan to his manager,and to his manager supervisor for review.the port captain must review the stowage plan with the ship chief mate,who is in charge of the ship cargo,to determine if it is in conflict with a previous stowage plan.
iii.liaison between ship and port 
the port captain notifies the coast guard hours before a ship arrives to advise the coast guard of the ship estimated time of arrival and departure.the employer junior vice president characterized this procedure as routine.if the coast guard changes the ship schedule,then the port captain must notify his manager.the port captain must tell the coast guard the names of the crew,and their date of birth,nationality and position aboard ship.the coast guard usually performs a safety inspection,during which the port captain is present.during such an inspection,the coast guard typically checks hazardous containers.if the coast guard finds unsafe conditions on the ship,the port captain will ask the ship master or ship engineer to repair the condition.the port captain may arrange for a surveyor,who is a licensed marine engineer designated by the employer to inspect repairs.the port captain can not authorize a repair.if a repair can not be completed before the ship is scheduled to depart,the port captain will contact his manager.
the employer has contracted with various vendors to supply services to the ship while it is in port,including a tugboat company to provide tugboats,a piloting company to provide pilots to maneuver the boat in the harbor,the terminal to supply linemen to tie the ship to the terminal,and a husbandry agent to assist in clearing customs.the marine department junior,or the junior in conjunction with his supervisor,determines with which vendor the employer contracts.emc has contracted with a bunker oil supplier to provide bunker oil.the ship captain determines the number of tugboats needed.each ship requires two pilots.emc determines how much bunker oil will be supplied.
the port captain arranges for tugboats,pilots,linemen,a husbandry agent and bunker oil.these contacts are,as one of the employer witnesses acknowledged,routine.if a port captain learns that any vendor with whom the employer has a standing arrangement can not meet the needs of a particular ship,then the port captain notifies his manager.the junior may consult with the port captains as to the performance of the various services with whom the employer contracts.
the port captain communicates with the ship captain.if the ship captain informs him that any crew members need medical attention,the port captain works with his manager to arrange this.he can not arrange for medical attention on his own.if a crew member is not able to rejoin the ship,the port captain sees that the immigration and naturalization service is contacted and advises his manager of the change so that the manager can determine if a substitute crew member is needed.the ship captain may tell the port captain that he needs money,charts or maps.
iv.monitoring unloading and loading 
the port captain monitors the unloading and loading of the ship by the stevedores.the port captain does not supervise the stevedores who are supervised by employees of the terminal.there was a conflict between the parties proffered evidence as to whether a port captain can,on his own,hire a reefer,or refrigerator mechanic to assist in unloading refrigerated containers.
the port captain brings any significant errors involving unloading and loading to the attention of his manager.he investigates unloaded damaged containers and reports these to his manager.he does not make the determination as to whether to repair these containers.he has the discretion to determine whether to load a damaged container.the port captain may determine that time constraints do not permit loading all of the containers as planned.in such a case,the port captain may refrain from loading empty containers.
the port captain reports unusual incidents such as a stowaway to his manager.there was testimony at the hearing about an incident where a crew member did not show up at the ship scheduled departure time.the port captain manager decided that the ship could not sail.
the port captains manager must approve any significant change in the stowage plan made after he has reviewed it.for example,if a customer asks for change in number of containers to be loaded at a particular port that will significantly impact upon the weight of the ship cargo,then the port captain must notify his manager,as well as the ship chief mate.or,if the port captain determines that the placement of a hazardous container pursuant to the stowage plan results in a potential unsafe condition,he consults with his manager to decide whether to withhold the hazardous container.
the port captain evaluates the stability of the ship with a hydrostatic table once the cargo has been loaded.the chief mate may adjust the ballast,a tank on the ship that can be filled with water to balance the ship,in response to the way the vessel is loaded or unloaded.the port captain may make a recommendation concerning the ballast.
terms and conditions of employment 
the port captain may sleep and take meals on the ship while it berths.the port captain is entitled to a meal allowance when his manager confirms that he worked on a shift that entitles him to such allowance.
the port captain does not attend management meetings.the employer gives a gold lapel pin to its managers.the employer does not give the port captains or the assistant port captain these lapel pins.a port captain can not authorize a visitor to board a ship,although his manager can give this permission.
the port captain usually works over hours weekly.he does not get overtime pay.he does not punch a time clock.if he works a weekend day,he gets day off.if he works hours straight through during the week,he gets four hours off.
vi.education and work experience 
the employer requires the port captain to have the equivalent of a bachelor degree in navigation.the employer prefers that a port captain have experience as a ship captain.
b.the engineer 
the engineer works in the marine section in the employer morristown office until a ship arrives,when he goes to the terminal to see if the ship needs assistance with a mechanical problem.he works with the ship engineer to repair the ship,and may arrange for the purchase of parts or obtain the assistance of a mechanic.he does not actually perform a repair.he may communicate with the coast guard about an engine room failure or deficiency.he is in charge of updating maritime engineering certificates and insuring that a ship has a certificate of financial responsibility concerning pollution of the harbor.he reports to the marine section manager.he does not punch a time clock.he has the equivalent of a bachelor degree in engineering.
see representation decision,slip op.at.
following the hearing,the acting regional director issued a decision on august,finding that the port captains,assistant port captains,and port engineers are not managerial employees.id.at.in reaching this result,the acting regional director concluded 
i find no evidence that port captains formulate the employer business policies.i note that port captains work under the supervision of their manager on all but routine matters.the degree to which their actions are reviewed is inconsistent with managerial status.the evidence reveals that they lack the requisite discretion and judgment,independent of the employer established policies,necessary to confer managerial status upon them.
id.at,citing nlrb yeshiva,d.the representation decision further held that,
w hile work that is based upon technical and professional competence must necessarily involve the exercise of discretion and judgment,technical and professional employees who exercise such discretion and judgment are not necessarily managerial employees.general dynamics.
id.at.in the general dynamics decision cited in the representation decision,the board held 
work which is based on professional competence necessarily involves a consistent exercise of discretion and judgment,else professionalism would not be involved.nevertheless,professional employees plainly are not the same as management employees either by definition or in authority,and managerial authority is not vested in professional employees merely by virtue of their professional status,or because work performed in that status may have a bearing on company direction.likewise,technical expertise in administrative functions which may involve the exercise of judgment and discretion does not confer status upon the performer.a lawyer or a certified public accountant working for,or retained by,a company may well cause a change in company direction,or even policy,based on his professional advice alone,which,by itself,would not make him managerial.
at.finally,the representation decision concluded that the port engineer m ere exercise of discretion did not endow him with managerial status.representation decision,slip op.at.the acting regional director ordered an election in the disputed unit,id.at,and evergreen filed a timely request for review.
on september,a secret ballot election was held,but the ballots were impounded pending the resolution of the evergreen request for review.on october,the board denied evergreen request for review.the impounded ballots were then opened on november,and it was determined that the union had received a majority of the votes cast.on november,the acting regional director certified the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees.the employer then filed a motion for reconsideration with the board,which the board denied on january.
evergreen refused to bargain with the union,and the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the board on january.evergreen filed an answer admitting its refusal to bargain and attacking the validity of the board certification of the union.on february,the nlrb general counsel filed a motion for summary judgment,to which evergreen responded by again challenging the validity of the certification.on april,the board issued a decision and order granting the general counsel motion for summary judgment.the board held that evergreen violated section a and of the act,a,by failing and refusing to recognize and bargain with the union and by failing and refusing to provide the union with information it sought from evergreen.evergreen,wl at.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in considering evergreen petition for review,we must ask whether the board determination that the port captains,assistant port captains,and port engineers are employees under the act has warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in law.seattle opera nlrb,see also nlrb hearst publ ns.as the supreme court noted in nlrb yeshiva university,we accord great respect to the expertise of the board when its conclusions are rationally based on articulated facts and consistent with the act.at.at.under the act,it is clear that t he findings of the board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.e.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.meco nlrb,quoting richardson perales,d.additionally,the court will uphold the board decision upon substantial evidence even if we would reach a different result upon de novo review.see perdue farms,cookin good div.nlrb.in short,this court reverses for lack of substantial evidence only when the record is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find to the contrary.lakeland bus lines,nlrb,quoting united steelworkers nlrb.with this standard of review in mind,we turn to the principal findings supporting the board conclusion that the five employees are not managerial.we also address evergreen claim that the board decision can not be squared with yeshiva.
b.the managerial exclusion 
the act only extends its protections and guarantees to those workers who
