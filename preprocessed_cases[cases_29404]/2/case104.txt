decedent gumersindo medina duarte medina died in a tragic accident while working aboard the tank barge atc on january.the vessel was in a graving dock,a species of dry dock,at the brooklyn navy yard.medina,who was working on the floor of a tank,needed to get to the upper deck to adjust the regulator for his torch,and began climbing a ladder affixed to the tank wall.it is undisputed that,immediately prior to his fall,he stepped off the ladder in order to let a descend.
medina estate,wife,and child all represented by his wife brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york block,against the general contractor overseeing repairs to the barge,gmd shipyard gmd after a bench trial,the court entered judgment on behalf of gmd on all claims.
background 
the owner of tank barge atc contracted with defendant gmd to refit it so it could transport a particular kind of oil.gmd subcontractor employed medina as a part time welder.
on the morning of the accident,medina was welding coils and refit pipes on the floor of the starboard tank.to get to the deck,medina had to climb two ladders,each approximately twenty feet long.the first runs from the base of the tank to a small platform,the second from the platform to the deck.the wall of the tank is reinforced by angle irons,lateral projecting fins spaced at regular intervals of feet from top to bottom.each angle iron protrudes between five to eight inches from the wall.see vasquez fce indus,cv fb,wl,at.
medina began ascending the first ladder while a,mario concepcion,was descending from the platform.medina and concepcion met approximately six to eight feet from the bottom of the tank.to let concepcion pass,medina stepped off the ladder onto an angle iron.
the precise sequence of subsequent events is disputed.at a bench trial,the district court found the facts to be as follows 
rather than return to the tank floor and wait for concepcion to finish descending,medina moved laterally off the ladder and stepped onto one of the angle irons that provided structural support to the tank wall.then,instead of waiting for concepcion to pass him and then returning to the ladder,medina began climbing up the tank wall itself by means of the angle irons.moments after passing concepcion,medina lost his grip and fell from the angle irons to the floor of the tank and died.
plaintiff does not dispute that medina moved off the ladder,but maintains that there was insufficient evidence for the court to conclude that medina actually began climbing up the angle irons.
on the basis of its factual finding,the district court dismissed all plaintiff causes of action,holding,inter alia,that medina injury was not caused by a dangerous condition on the premises labor law that gmd was not required to provide additional safety devices under new york scaffold law labor law and that the new york industrial code provision regarding hazardous openings labor law was inapplicable.
discussion 
in reviewing a judgment entered after a bench trial,we are to give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility,and we must not set aside findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.a see also anderson bessemer city,d.under this standard,factual findings by the district court will not be upset unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.fdic providence college,cir quoting united states gypsum.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson,at.we review conclusions of law,and the application of the law to the facts,de novo.see,henry champlain,cir.
although the parties do not contest our jurisdiction,we are obliged to ascertain it independently.see,joseph leavitt,cir w e have an independent obligation to consider the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte.
the constitution extends federal judicial power to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.const.art.iii.congress has codified admiralty and maritime jurisdiction at,which gives federal district courts original jurisdiction of a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction see also jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d leblanc cleveland,cir.the primary purpose of federal admiralty jurisdiction is to protect commercial shipping with uniform rules of conduct.leblanc,at quoting sisson ruby,d internal quotations omitted.
historically,admiralty jurisdiction over torts depended solely upon the locality of the wrong i f the wrong occurred on navigable waters,the action was within admiralty jurisdiction if the wrong occurred on land,it was not.executive jet aviation,city of cleveland,d.in executive jet,the supreme court modified this purely mechanical application of the locality test,and held that the wrong must also bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity the nexus test.id.at.
thus,we now apply a test for determining when a tort action falls within the federal courts admiralty jurisdiction.first,the alleged tort must have occurred on or over navigable waters.grubart,at.second,the activity giving rise to the incident must have had a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity,such that the incident had a potentially disruptive influence on maritime commerce.id.
navigable waters 
medina fall occurred while the atc was being repaired in a graving dock.a graving dock is a permanent structure on land with gates that allow vessels to enter and that then can be closed to drain out the water.in other words,it is a dry drydock.san francisco drydock,dalton,cir see also trading marine salvage,a graving dock looks like a huge,concrete bathtub sunk into the ground when repairs are completed,workers flood the dock until the water reaches the same level as the water outside the gate.it is opened and the ship leaves.there are three types of dry docks a floating dry dock,as its name makes clear,floats on the water,the vessel resting on the bottom of the dry dock after the water has been removed.a graven dry dock is dug into the land.the vessel floats in but rests on land once the water has been pumped out.finally there is the marine railway,on which the vessel is drawn out of the water,instead of the water being drawn away from the vessel.avondale marine ways henderson.burton,concurring.
the water in a graving or graven dock is temporarily removed so that a ship under repair comes to rest on dry land,but the temporary absence of water does not defeat federal maritime jurisdiction.in the robert parsons,the supreme court held that a vessel in a graven dock remains in navigable waters for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction,even when the water is removed as all serious repairs upon the hulls of vessels are made in drydock,the proposition that such repairs are made on land would practically deprive the admiralty courts of their largest and most important jurisdiction in connection with repairs.no authorities are cited for this proposition,and it is believed that none such exist.id.
the supreme court reaffirmed the point in simmons v.the steamship jefferson,in which it compared a ship in a graven dock to one at a pier when the water temporarily recedes at low tide 
in reason,we think it can not be held that a ship or vessel employed in navigation and commerce is any the less a maritime subject within the admiralty jurisdiction when,for the purpose of making necessary repairs to fit her for continuance in navigation,she is placed in a dry dock and the water removed from about her,than would be such a vessel if fastened to a wharf in a dry harbor,where,by the natural recession of the water by the ebbing of the tide,she for a time might be upon dry land.
