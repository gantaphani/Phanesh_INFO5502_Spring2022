on april,the towboat anne holly was traveling north on the mississippi river when its tow of fourteen barges allided with the eads bridge near louis,missouri.the impact caused the tow to break apart,leaving several barges to float uncontrolled downstream.one of the loosed barges allided with the admiral,a casino ship owned by president casino and moored at the missouri shore just downstream from the eads bridge.when the barge struck,the admiral moorings broke loose,and the ship hull was damaged.consequently,the admiral closed for days to undergo repairs.
two days after the accident,the owner of the anne holly at the time,american milling,filed a complaint in the district court seeking to limit its liability to the value of its vessel,pursuant to the limitation of shipowners liability act the limitation act,app.current version at.president casino,and its subrogated insurer,essex insurance company,subsequently filed claims against american milling to recover damages after a first phase of litigation to resolve the issues of limitation and liability,the district court ruled that american milling was entitled to limit its liability under the limitation act to million.the court also concluded that american milling was eighty percent at fault for the allision,and attributed the remaining twenty percent of fault to president casino because of its failure to protect the admiral despite past accidents where the casino boat was moored.in re american milling,d,aff in part,rev in part,cir.
with american milling right to limitation and the parties liability decided,the district court proceeded to address the issue of damages.the parties stipulated to the amount of property damages,leaving in dispute president casino claims for business interruption losses,certain extraordinary expenses,and wage expenses.in particular,president casino sought to recover the profits lost during the period of the admiral closure the business interruption losses.president casino also endeavored to recoup from american milling the extra advertising and cash coupon promotional expenses that it allegedly incurred to attract customers after the closure.a cash coupon is a promotional coupon that is mailed to potential customers,who can redeem the coupon at the admiral for chips to be used like cash in various casino games.president casino also claimed that to mitigate potential damages from employee departures,the company continued to pay wages and tips to its hourly employees while the admiral was closed,and that american milling should be liable for those payments.
at trial,president casino relied on the testimony of its senior vice president and chief financial officer,ralph vaclavik,and on the report and testimony of a certified public accountant cpa,robert traven,to support its damages claims.vaclavik testified generally about profits lost during the closure,and he alleged that higher than normal promotional expenditures were necessary after the allision to notify customers of the casino reopening and to persuade them to return.he also testified that the decision to pay employee wages and tips during the closure was reasonable in light of the uncertain duration of the closure,the likelihood that the casino employees would flee to competitors,and the regulatory barriers to hiring new gaming employees.on the basis of president casino financial records,traven quantified the damages from the allision,and estimated the total business interruption losses and extraordinary expenses to be 
american milling countered with an expert witness and cpa of its own,peter karutz.in his report and testimony,karutz disagreed with several aspects of traven methodology,including how traven measured the ordinary level of expenses against which any extraordinary expenses should be compared.using a baseline level of expenses that was higher than that calculated by traven,karutz valued the disputed damages at.
after considering the evidence,the district court determined that president casino business interruption losses totaled,and denied recovery of the wages and tips paid during the admiral closure.the court pointed to the absence of evidence showing an exodus of employees during the closure,and concluded that the wage and tip payments were a voluntary business decision,not an action required by law.the district court also denied president casino claim for extraordinary advertising and cash coupon expenses.after reducing the amount of business interruption losses by twenty percent to reflect president casino fault,the court awarded the casino a total of,plus prejudgment interest compounded annually.
president casino first challenges the district court decision to deny recovery of the allegedly extraordinary advertising and cash coupon expenses.we review the factual findings of the district court,sitting without a jury in admiralty,for clear error.mcallister united states.this standard of review applies to the district court findings with respect to overhead expenses,see united states capital sand,cir,and lost profits.see conagra,inland river towing,cir.we may reverse only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that error has been committed.anderson bessemer city,d.
president casino contends that the district court denial of the advertising and cash coupon expenses was clearly erroneous,because the dispute between the witnesses at trial was not whether the casino incurred the extra expenses,but how much those expenses totaled.president casino expert,traven,valued the advertising costs at,which he said was the difference between the amount the casino spent on advertisements in the month after the allision and the amount budgeted for that purpose.karutz,the expert retained by american milling,found a net increase of by calculating the difference between the advertising expenses incurred in the two months after the allision and similar expenses from the same months in the prior year.given that neither expert found no extraordinary advertising expenses,president casino suggests that the district court finding was unsupported by substantial evidence.the casino supplements this argument by highlighting karutz statement at trial that measuring increased advertising expense after the allision appeared reasonable.
president casino makes a similar claim regarding cash coupon expenses,drawing on the experts estimates and karutz testimony to conclude that the district court finding was clearly erroneous.traven calculated damages of,representing the difference between the casino cash coupon expenditures in the two months after the allision,may and june,and the average monthly cash coupon expense in the fiscal year before the allision.karutz estimated expenses of by comparing the casino cash coupon expenses in may and june with the casino average monthly cash coupon expenditures from july through february,after the allision.karutz reasoned that because cash coupon expenditures remained high long after the allision,it was appropriate to use those higher figures to establish a baseline reflecting the increase.again,because both experts calculated some damages,president casino argues that the district court clearly erred by awarding no damages.president casino also notes that when asked whether there was any extra expense related to cash coupons,karutz responded based on records we had,it appears that there is.
the difficulty with president casino position is that the district court is not required to accept the opinion of either expert.t he weight to be accorded expert opinion evidence is so
