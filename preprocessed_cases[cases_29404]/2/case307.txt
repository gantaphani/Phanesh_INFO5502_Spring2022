at issue is whether,for extraterritorial application of the maritime drug law enforcement act.et,the fifth amendment due process clause requires a nexus between a foreign citizen and the united states,where the flag nation for his vessel has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of united states law by the united states.id.c c.requiring such a nexus,the district court dismissed the indictment for lack of jurisdiction.vacated and remanded.
defendant nestor suerte,a philippine national and resident of colombia,has apparently never entered the united states.the government alleges the following.
suerte was captain of a freighter registered in malta and owned by a member of a drug trafficking organization dto he met in venezuela with dto members in july and august to coordinate loading the freighter,off the northern coast of venezuela,with kilograms of cocaine for transport to,and distribution in,europe the freighter apparently departed venezuela on august the next day,an attempt was made,using speed boats,to transport the cocaine to it after venezuelan law enforcement detected the boats,they took evasive action as a result,approximately kilograms of the cocaine was lost and the remainder was stored for another attempt.
the dto telexed suerte plans for the second attempt,to occur at designated coordinates on august on and august,however,venezuelan authorities arrested some of the dto members,thwarting the second attempt but,nevertheless,on august,the freighter was at the vicinity of the designated rendezvous point,in international waters.
the united states requested,and received,permission from malta the flag nation to board and search the freighter.more specifically,malta waived objection to the search,and the coast guard issued a statement of no objection to the boarding team.a search by the coast guard did not find cocaine.
approximately a week later,malta waived objection to the enforcement of united states laws over the freighter and its crew.the government towed the vessel to the port of houston,texas on september,it was searched by united states customs special agents found in suerte cabin was a torn copy of the telex giving the date,time,and coordinates for the second attempt to load cocaine and also found was an attache case containing in bills.
suerte was arrested and indicted for conspiracy as discussed infra to possess,with intent to distribute,more than five kilograms of cocaine on board a vessel subject to united states jurisdiction,in violation of the maritime drug law enforcement act mdlea.the act provides,in pertinent part 
a it is unlawful for any person on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states to knowingly or intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.
c for purposes of this section,a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states includes 
c a vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of united states law by the united states 
j any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this chapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense,the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.
id.emphasis added.
suerte moved to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction,claiming that,because he did not have a nexus to the united states,the constitution does not permit the mdlea to have extraterritorial effect over him.see united states suerte,no,slip op.at,d,june.agreeing with suerte position,the district court reviewed international law principles of extraterritorial jurisdiction,which represent ed the different types of nexuses recognized under international law,and thus,inform ed its analysis,id.at,d at held no nexus existed between suerte and the united states and,accordingly,dismissed the indictment.
the government contends the due process clause does not require an individualized nexus for extraterritorial application of the mdlea alternatively,one exists.normally,we would first address the government alternative position.this is because,as a general,prudential rule,we have a strong duty to avoid constitutional issues that need not be resolved in order to determine the rights of the parties to the case under consideration.county court of ulster county,allen,d.
whether the due process clause requires such a nexus,however,is a much more straightforward question than whether a philippine national and resident of colombia,engaged in a conspiracy to traffic drugs internationally,but whose voyage is not proceeding to the united states,has a nexus with this country.therefore,it is appropriate to first consider the constitutional question.we review de novo the district court holding.see,united states brown,cir.
in addition to the supreme court not having addressed whether there is such a nexus requirement for the extraterritorial reach of the mdlea,this issue is one of first impression for our court.
to date we have published only two opinions regarding the mdlea.see united states,cir coumou united states,cir,withdrawn in part and superseded in part,cir.neither case concerns the due process constraints vel non governing the mdlea extraterritorial reach.
however,approaches resolving the issue at hand.that case involved a presumably colombian defendant,aboard a panamanian vessel bound for portugal through international waters between hispaniola and puerto rico.based on information provided by the greek government,the united states suspected the vessel of drug trafficking.panama waived objection to the united states boarding and searching the vessel.the consent to enforcement of united states law was given before trial but after the government search for,and seizure of,drugs aboard the vessel in international waters,at.
in addressing whether this belated consent satisfied statutory jurisdictional requirements,we noted 
because panama consented to the enforcement of united states law over the vessel prior to trial,the district court had jurisdiction so long as the criminal statute under which the defendant was prosecuted meets the subject matter jurisdiction requirements of article iii of the united states constitution and conferring original jurisdiction on district courts for offenses against the laws of the united states.section a defines a law of the united states sufficiently enough to satisfy article iii and defines an offense against the law of the united states sufficiently enough to satisfy.therefore,the district court had the authority to act on this case.
id.at.this implies that the only constitutional constraint on jurisdiction under the mdlea is to be found in article iii,not the due process clause.
of the three circuits that have addressed the issue at hand,only the ninth circuit has held the due process clause requires a nexus.
united states davis,cir,cert.denied,d,involved a british vessel seized in international waters off california.a search of the vessel,pursuant to great britain consent,discovered over pounds of marijuana.id.at.
the vessel captain,davis,who was not a united states citizen,was prosecuted under the mdlea and contested its extraterritorial application.because t he congress shall have power t o define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,and offenses against the law of nations piracies and felonies clause,const.art.i,cl,the ninth circuit first decided that the clause authorize s congress to give extraterritorial effect to the mdlea.davis,at.the ninth circuit qualified this holding in order to apply extraterritorially a federal criminal statute to a defendant consistently with due process,there must be a sufficient nexus between the defendant and the united states so that such application would not be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.id.at emphasis added internal citation omitted.
further rationale for the ninth circuit nexus requirement was provided by united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
the nexus requirement serves the same purpose as the minimum contacts test in personal jurisdiction.it ensures that a united states court will assert jurisdiction only over a defendant who should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in this country.
id.at quoting volkswagen woodson,d.on the other hand,the ninth circuit does not require a nexus for stateless vessels,also covered by the mdlea,c a.see united states caicedo,cir because stateless vessels do not fall within the veil of another sovereign territorial protection,all nations can treat them as their own territory and subject them to their laws.
the first and third circuits have rejected a nexus requirement.in united states cardales,cir,cert.denied,d,the first circuit considered an mdlea prosecution,pursuant to venezuela consent,of crew members of a venezuelan vessel boarded and searched miles south of puerto rico.id.at.in addressing whether the due process clause required a nexus,cardales noted,as had the ninth circuit in davis to satisfy due process,our application of the mdlea must not be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.id.at emphasis added.
in determining whether due process was satisfied,cardales consulted international law principles for guid ance and concluded that the mdlea satisfies both the territorial principle,under which a state has jurisdiction to prescribe and enforce a rule of law in the territory of another state to the extent provided by international agreement with the other state,id.quoting united states robinson,cir,cert.denied,d,and,especially,the protective principle,under which a state may assert jurisdiction over a person whose conduct outside the state territory threatens the state security,id.quoting robinson,at.
concerning the protective principle,cardales observed that congress had expressly found that trafficking in controlled substances aboard vessels is a serious international problem and is universally condemned,and presents a specific threat to the security of the united states.id.alteration in original quoting.in that light,cardales held due process did not require the government to prove a nexus.
when the foreign flag nation consents to the application of united states law,jurisdiction attaches under the statutory requirements of the mdlea without violation of due process or the principles of international law because the flag nation consent eliminates any concern that the application of united states law may be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.
the court was careful,however,to note that it did not view the mdlea as a congressional override of international law.id.at.to the extent international law requires a nexus to the united states,that nexus requirement is satisfied by the foreign flag nation authorization to apply law to the defendants the territorial principle and by the congressional finding that drug trafficking aboard vessels threatens the security of the united states the protective principle.id.
the third circuit which earlier rejected a nexus requirement for mdlea prosecutions involving stateless vessels,see united states,cir,cert.denied,d,follows a similar approach.united states,cir,involved the mdlea prosecution of a foreign captain of a vessel,which was sailing from colombia to canada when intercepted by the coast guard north of trinidad and tobago.id.at.after panama waived objection,a search uncovered over two tons of cocaine.id.
after noting that d providing that a failure to comply with international law shall not divest a court of jurisdiction or otherwise constitute a defense expresses the necessary congressional intent to override international law to the extent that international law might require a nexus to the united states,id.at quoting,at,the court held that no due process violation occurred from the mdlea extraterritorial application because drug trafficking is condemned universally by nations,and t he panamanian government expressly consented to the application of the mdlea,id.the court found the second fact particularly compelling such consent from the flag nation eliminates a concern that the application of the mdlea may be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.id.
in addition,in united states mena,cir,cert.denied,d,while not expressly ruling on a nexus requirement vel non,the eleventh circuit upheld the mdlea against a due process challenge for vagueness.mena involved the prosecution,with honduran consent,of foreign defendants arrested aboard a honduran vessel in international waters east of the bahamas.the defendants claimed as unconstitutionally vague term vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.
noting that due process requires s tatuory language to convey sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices,id.at quoting jordan de george,the court concluded 
there is nothing vague about the statute.congress has provided clear notice of what conduct is forbidden those embarking on voyages with holds laden with illicit narcotics,conduct which is contrary to laws of all reasonably developed legal systems,do so with awareness of the risk that their government may consent to enforcement of the united states law against the vessel.
id.emphasis added quoting united states gonzalez,cir.as discussed infra,the same is true for those who conspire to commit an offense proscribed by the mdlea.
the opinions by these circuits do not discuss several sources of law which,although not dispositive of the present issue,provide us great assurance that,where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of united states law by the united states,c c,due process does not require a nexus for the mdlea extraterritorial application.those sources include the constitutional convention debate surrounding the piracies and felonies clause the congress shall have power t o define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,and offenses against the law of nations the earliest exercise of congressional power under the clause and supreme court opinions reviewing that exercise.
concerning the piracies and felonies clause,the committee of detail draft constitution,submitted to the convention on august,would have empowered congress t o declare the law and punishment of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,and the punishment of counterfeiting the coin of the united states,and of offences against the law of nations.records of the federal convention of max farrand,emphasis added.subsequent debate over the clause primarily concerned the propriety of granting the power to both punish and declare and whether the latter power should read declare,designate,or define.see id.at.
there was apparently no debate regarding constraints vel non on the clause extraterritorial reach.it would seem that,had they been of concern,the matter would have been discussed,especially because the clause contains the only specific grant of power to be found in the constitution for the punishment of offenses outside the territorial limits of the united states.congressional research service,library of congress,the constitution of the united states,analysis and interpretation,doc,at johnny killian george costello,doc.no.
the first congress promptly enacted legislation under the piracies and felonies power.in april,approximately seven months after proposing the bill of rights to the states september,congress approved an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the united states act.it provides,in part in,t hat if any person or persons shall commit upon the high seas murder or robbery,every such offender shall be adjudged a pirate and felon,and being thereof convicted,shall suffer death and,in,t hat if any person shall commit manslaughter upon the high seas,such person so offending,and being thereof convicted,shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years,and fined not exceeding one thousand dollars.act of,ch,stat,emphasis added.
for purposes of this appeal,perhaps the most striking aspect of the act is that many of its provisions regarding crimes on the high seas apply to any person.emphasis added.it is important to note,especially in a case in which at issue is the constitutionality of another exercise of the piracies and felonies power,that,at the time it passed the act,the first congress had already drafted the fifth amendmen
