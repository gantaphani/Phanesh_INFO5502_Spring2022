a massive drug interdiction on the high seas by the united states coast guard the coast guard ended with the arrest and indictment of multiple defendants,including appellant francisco nueci pe√±a nueci.nueci was sentenced to years in prison after being convicted of possession with the intent to distribute over pounds of cocaine and heroin while on board a vessel in violation of the maritime drug law enforcement act.et mdlea.on appeal,nueci says his conviction can not stand,arguing that congress has no authority under article,section,clause of the united states constitution to criminalize drug trafficking on board a vessel in international waters under the mdlea without requiring a nexus between the conduct and the united states,and that the admission of certain certifications to support the jurisdiction determination violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation.after careful consideration,we affirm.
on february,the coast guard detected a suspicious vessel in carribean waters.after the vessel twice attempted to evade authorities,the coast guard managed to stop and board the vessel to verify its nationality.nueci,identifying himself as the master of the ship,said that the vessel was colombian.consistent with operational procedures,the coast guard contacted colombian authorities for confirmation.the colombian navy,however,could neither confirm nor deny that the vessel was registered in colombia.the coast guard,therefore,determined that the vessel was without nationality and subject to the jurisdiction of the united states under the mdlea.the coast guard proceeded to search the vessel and discovered kilograms of cocaine and kilograms of heroin on board.
all six passengers on the vessel,including nueci,were arrested and subsequently charged with aiding and abetting count i and conspiracy count ii in the possession with intent to distribute at least five kilograms or more of cocaine and one kilogram or more of heroin on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states that is,a vessel without nationality,in violation of the mdlea,a,b,and b.they pled not guilty.
on october,on the eve of trial,nueci moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the vessel,a motion joined by other.in their motion,the defendants argued that the direct use of gunfire by the coast guard violated article of the agreement between the government of the united states of america and the government of the republic of colombia to suppress illicit traffic by sea.the defendants further asserted that at the time of the interdiction nueci claimed the vessel was registered in venezuela,not colombia.in support of that assertion,the defendants said that three of them had overheard nueci telling the officer,who was part of the coast guard boarding team,that the vessel was venezuelan.they added that fbi special agent benjamin walker,who was not part of that boarding team,stated in an affidavit in support of the complaint against the defendants that nueci had claimed venezuelan registry.that the colombian authorities could neither confirm nor deny the vessel registry in the end,the defendants argued,meant nothing since the united states authorities had requested a consent waiver from the wrong country.defendants insisted that since no contact had been made with the venezuelan government to verify that claim of registry,the united states never had jurisdiction over the vessel and,consequently,over them.the defendants claimed that,as a result,the united states had not established jurisdiction under the mdlea over the vessel.
confronted with the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction less than two weeks before nueci trial was set to begin,the district judge pushed back the trial and referred the motion to a magistrate judge in in its opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss,the government rehashed what happened when the coast guard boarded the vessel that nueci,who claimed to be the person in charge on the vessel,told an officer,who was part of the coast guard boarding team,that the vessel was colombian.the government pointed to the certification for the maritime drug law enforcement act case involving the go fast vessel without nationality attached to its opposition,which recounts that the vessel had no marking or indicia of nationality and was not displaying any registry numbers,a hailing port,or flying a national flag,and had no documentation or registry papers at the time of the interdiction.the certification showed that in accordance with the operational procedures for boarding and search of vessels suspected of illicit traffic by sea related to narcotics and psychotropic substances,the coast guard inquired via fax with the colombian navy to verify nueci claim of registry,but colombia could neither confirm nor deny that claim.consequently,the government noted,the united states determined the vessel was without nationality,or stateless,in accordance with d c and subject to its jurisdiction.in response to the defendants argument that the united states should have asked venezuela,not colombia,whether the vessel was registered there,the government asserted that any confusion about the vessel registry was created by the defendants themselves.the government acknowledged nueci had claimed at one point that the vessel had departed near the border and that the drug trafficking venture was organized in venezuela which the government suggests could have been why agent walker indicated that nueci had claimed venezuelan registry when he was not actually present at the interdiction.but,the government argued,at the time of the interdiction the vessel flew no flag,had no markings,had no registration documentation,and defendants have offered no proof that the vessel was venezuelan.the government further argued that subject matter jurisdiction was not an element of the offense under the mdlea and that defendants had no standing to challenge compliance with the treaty they claimed the united states violated in using gunfire to stop the vessel.
the government later filed a supplemental response to the defendants motion to dismiss.in that response,the government detailed the coast guard more recent contact with venezuelan authorities contact initiated to determine whether the vessel was indeed registered there as nueci claimed.the government attached to its motion the supplemental certification for the maritime drug law enforcement act case involving the go fast vessel without nationality federal drug identification number fdin issued on january.the supplemental certification not only details the contact with the colombian authorities concerning the vessel registry included in the original certification,but also addresses nueci claim of venezuelan registry.in accordance with article of the agreement between the government of the united states of america and the government of the republic of venezuela to suppress illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by sea,the coast guard requested the venezuelan coast guard to confirm or deny that nueci vessel interdicted on february,was registered in venezuela.venezuela could not say the vessel was registered there.the government asserted that regardless of nueci claim of registry,because neither venezuela nor colombia claimed the vessel,the vessel was stateless and the united states exercise of jurisdiction was proper under the mdlea.
the magistrate judge recommended the defendants motion to dismiss be denied.emphasizing that the list of mechanisms for establishing that a vessel is without nationality was not meant to be exhaustive and may be supplemented by looking to international law,the judge found the vessel would not have been authorized to fly the venezuelan flag under international law since venezuela was unable to trace the registry of the vessel.he therefore concluded nueci vessel was without nationality and subject to the united states jurisdiction under d as supplemented by international law.the magistrate judge quickly disposed of the violation of international law claim,finding that there was no evidence the vessel was registered in colombia and defendants had failed to explain how the treaty had been triggered without such registry.the magistrate judge further concluded that even if the treaty applied in nueci case,nueci had no standing to raise a claim for failure to comply with international law and that such failure does not divest a court of jurisdiction.see.the district judge approved and adopted the report and recommendation in full in an order issued on april.after rescheduling the trial multiple times mostly due to the parties motions to continue she set the trial date for september.
days before trial,two moved to change their pleas and the court terminated the september trial date and referred the motions to the magistrate judge.two additional moved to change their pleas around this time.the magistrate judge granted the motions and recommended the district judge accept their guilty pleas the judge adopted those recommendations and subsequently sentenced each of those defendants.
in the thick of that activity,mitchell hunter moved to supplement the previous motion to dismiss.he argued that the commander certifications regarding jurisdiction prepared by the secretary of state designees as proof that both colombia and venezuela did not object to the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendants vessel were testimonial hearsay,and that under crawford washington,d,their use in the pretrial jurisdiction determination,without an opportunity for,constituted a violation of his sixth amendment right to confrontation.the district judge referred the matter to the magistrate judge who recommended denying the motion.the magistrate judge found inter alia that the right to confrontation was a trial right and,therefore,inapplicable to the pretrial jurisdiction determination.while nueci had not moved to join the motion to dismiss,he moved to join mitchell hunter timely filed objections to the magistrate report and recommendation.the district judge overruled those objections and agreed with the magistrate judge that the confrontation clause and crawford did not apply before trial and found no other reason for dismissal under the mdlea.mitchell hunter changed his plea to guilty,which the district court accepted,and nueci proceeded to trial,set for june.
the day before trial nueci moved for an order declaring he had preserved his jurisdictional challenges he moved to preserve three issues the constitutionality of allowing certificates as proof of a statement of no objection the constitutionality of having the jurisdictional issue decided by the court and of not having the jury decide an element of the crime and the constitutionality of being tried under this statute the mdlea which criminalizes activities on the high seas with no requirement that the acts be directed towards the united states,and in particular,whether it is constitutional to exercise jurisdiction over a person in this manner.though the district judge determined that the first issue had been previously raised,she could not find in the record when he had ever raised the latter two issues understandably puzzled by a request to preserve arguments she was not aware nueci had ever raised before,the district judge ordered him to provide the specific information regarding the presentation of these two issues.instead of complying fully with the order,nueci clarified his challenge to the mdlea was based on the statute provision which exempts the government from having to demonstrate a nexus between the offense and the united states merely because the vessel was deemed stateless.he argued that the statute lack of a nexus requirement exceeds congress power to define and punish piracies and felonies on the high seas.as the district judge correctly concluded,however,nueci merely gave an explanation of the motion last two constitutional issues,without referring the court to the instances,if any,where each of them had been raised before.nor could the district judge find any motions where those specific issues had been raised.she therefore found the constitutionality of allowing certificates as proof of a statement of no objection as the only issue that had been preserved for appeal purposes and otherwise noted nueci motion to preserve the other issues.
on june,the jury found nueci guilty on both counts in the indictment.the district court denied his motion for acquittal and his renewed motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction.nueci received years imprisonment and years supervised release.he moved for reconsideration of the sentence,arguing that the sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable given the disparity between his sentence and that of each of his,among other reasons.the judge denied that motion too.nueci appeal followed.
discussion 
constitutional challenge to the mdlea 
on appeal,nueci argues the mdlea is unconstitutional because it exceeds congressional authority t o define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas the piracies and felonies clause under article i,section,clause of the constitution.
as a threshold matter,nueci says that de novo review applies to his constitutional challenge on appeal.we,however,ordinarily review legal and constitutional claims de novo only when they are properly preserved.united states neto,cir.nueci failed to preserve his constitutional challenge by failing to properly raise it in the district court nueci motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction before trial was not based on a challenge to congress authority under the piracies and felonies clause to punish drug trafficking under the mdlea rather it was based on nueci claim that he had said the vessel was of venezuelan,not colombian,registry and since the united states had not at that time contacted venezuela to confirm it,the united states never had jurisdiction over the vessel and,consequently,over the defendants.
his motion the day before trial for an order deeming jurisdictional issues preserved listed as one of those issues the constitutionality of being tried under this statute the mdlea which criminalizes activities on the high seas with no requirement that the acts be directed towards the united states,and in particular,whether it is constitutional to exercise jurisdiction over a person in this manner.when ordered to indicate when nueci had previously raised that argument,nueci instead filed a further explanation of his argument that the mdlea is an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority under the piracies and felonies clause.as the district judge aptly concluded,however,nueci had never before raised that argument.
ignoring his failure to properly preserve the constitutional challenge he now raises on appeal,nueci seems to suggest that his constitutional claim goes to whether the district court had jurisdiction to sentence him for violating a law he says is unconstitutional that is,if the mdlea lack of nexus requirement exceeds congressional authority under the piracies and felonies clause,the district court lacked jurisdiction over nueci,or so the argument goes.to the extent nueci contends that a challenge to the constitutionality of the mdlea inherently involves a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction and that subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time,regardless of whether it was raised below,we have previously rejected the assertion that a constitutional challenge to the mdlea always implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.united states cardales luna,cir.if a challenge to the constitutionality of an underlying criminal statute always implicated jurisdiction,then federal courts,having an obligation to address jurisdictional questions sua sponte,would have to assure themselves of a statute validity as a threshold matter in any case.id.quoting united states baucum.
because he failed to raise his argument before the district court that congress exceeded its authority under the piracies and felonies clause in enacting the mdlea without requiring a nexus between the conduct and the united states,the proper standard of review is plain error.see united states acevedo maldonado,cir plain error review applies where defendant failed to raise confrontation clause objection at trial.to establish plain
