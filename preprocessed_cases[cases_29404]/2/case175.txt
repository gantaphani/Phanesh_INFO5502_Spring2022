appellants abukar osman beyle and shani nurani shiekh abrar were each convicted on criminal counts arising from the armed abduction and murder of four citizens off the coast of somalia.beyle and abrar were part of a group of nineteen pirates who seized a yacht and captured the four americans on board.the pirates headed for somalia,but were intercepted by the united states navy.during a final confrontation with the navy,beyle,abrar,and another pirate shot and killed the four american hostages.the navy secured the boat and apprehended the surviving pirates,who were transported to the united states to face criminal charges.after a trial,a jury convicted beyle and abrar on all counts,and each defendant received multiple life sentences.
beyle and abrar now challenge their respective convictions on separate grounds.beyle argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the murder and firearms charges against him because the americans were not killed on the high seas.abrar,who maintains that he was kidnapped before the piracy operation,contends that he was unable to present certain witnesses who could have corroborated his duress defense.we conclude,however,that the site of the murders,thirty to forty nautical miles from the somali coast,lay on the high seas and thus beyond the territorial sea of any nation.we further conclude that abrar was not denied his fifth amendment right to due process or his sixth amendment right to present witnesses material to his defense.the district court gave each of the defendants the fair trial that he deserved,and we affirm in all respects its judgment.
in reviewing defendants convictions by a jury,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.evans united states,see united states moye,cir en banc.
the united states and its allies are engaged in a multinational battle against piracy in the waters off the horn of africa.through the gulf of aden and much of the indian ocean,pirates have launched attacks against commercial and recreational vessels,from large freighters to personal yachts.see the white house,united states counter piracy and maritime security action plan annex a at june of the sec y on the situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of somalia,doc.piracy poses a threat not only to the free flow of global commerce,but also to the individuals who navigate the seas.in,armed somali pirates attacked an estimated seafarers and took some individuals hostage.oceans beyond piracy et,the human cost of maritime piracy,at.of those hostages were killed.id.at.
this case arises from one such attack.in early february,a group of pirates,with the assistance of several investors and facilitators in somalia,prepared to hijack a ship at sea.the investors provided a primary mothership for the voyage,as well as an attack skiff that the pirates would use to launch assaults on their targets.the mothership,the alqasim,was a captured yemeni fishing boat,and four yemeni fishermen on board were forced to operate the boat for the pirates.all of the pirates were somali,except for one,another yemeni fisherman who had been captured by somali pirates but then decided to join their ranks.among their supplies,the nineteen men brought various automatic firearms and a grenade launcher.
beyle and abrar were part of this cohort.beyle assisted with acquiring an outboard motor for the attack skiff.abrar brought an ak aboard the boat.one of the pirates drew up a list of the individuals who had participated in the mission,to allocate any eventual ransom shares.both beyle and abrar were on the list.the four captive yemeni fishermen from the alqasim were not.
the pirates set to sea on february.during their first nine days,they made a number of unsuccessful efforts,including chasing a large container ship.in at least one such attempt,abrar carried the grenade launcher.
on february,the pirates spotted a new target a sailboat with four citizens aboard.the americans had been sailing in the arabian sea as part of an international yacht rally,traveling a leg from india to oman.two of them,scott adam and jean adam,were husband and wife and owned this vessel,known as the quest.the other two americans were phyllis macay and robert riggle,who were friends of the couple.
six of the pirates,including beyle and abrar,boarded the attack skiff.they moved swiftly to hijack the quest and take the four americans hostage.as the skiff approached,beyle fired an ak into the air.once on board,abrar first subdued the two women,and he then cut the boat communication lines.at the time the pirates gained control,the nearest land was oman or yemen,approximately four hundred miles away.the pirates had traveled to miles from the somali coast.
with the quest secured,the remaining pirates took the supplies from the mothership and crowded onto the quest.they released the four yemeni captives,who departed in the alqasim.the nineteen pirates then set a course for somalia.they intended to hold the americans hostage on land and work through their coconspirators to secure a ransom the americans were kept primarily in a bench area around the helm.beyle and abrar were among the men assigned to guard the americans,with guns ready.after hijacking the quest,the pirates also used the americans cellular telephones to take photographs and record videos.several pirates put on clothing belonging to their victims,and abrar can be seen wearing a hostage sunglasses and smiling.
the navy was soon alerted to the attack,and a carrier strike group moved to intercept the quest.after locating the boat,which was still hundreds of miles into the indian ocean,the navy established radio communications with the pirates and began following the quest as it proceeded to somalia.the navy objective was to stop the quest from entering somali territorial waters and to secure the hostages safe release.claiming they lacked any negotiating authority,however,the pirates demanded that they be allowed to reach somalia and engage in hostage negotiations through an interlocutor on land.the navy made clear to the pirates that they would not be permitted to take the hostages to somalia.but time was running short the pirates were on pace to reach somalia within days.at one point during these exchanges,abrar fired an ak into the air above scott adam,as a warning to the navy.the pirates variously threatened to kill the hostages and themselves.
on february,the navy directed the pirates to stop proceeding toward somalia.the navy was determined to keep the quest in international waters and prevent it from entering somali territorial waters.but the pirates refused.the navy began maneuvering to block the boat and informed the pirates that these movements were peaceful.one pirate answered,i will eat them like meat.
suddenly,another pirate fired a grenade toward the uss sterett,the navy destroyer that had been following the quest most closely.the rocket missed and splashed into the water,between the sterett and a set of smaller boats carrying navy seals.bullets from the quest began whizzing over the sterett,but the navy did not return fire.at that point,a group of three pirates beyle and abrar,together with ahmed muse salad,also known as afmagalo fired their automatic weapons and killed the four americans.scott adam was shot seven times jean adam was shot seven times phyllis macay was shot eight times robert riggle was shot nineteen times.at the time of these events,it is undisputed the quest was between thirty and forty nautical miles off the coast of somalia.
within a matter of minutes,a team of navy seals headed for the quest,boarded it,and secured it.by the time the seals arrived,all four americans had been mortally wounded.many pirates,including beyle and abrar,put their hands up and surrendered.the other shooter,afmagalo,was the last to surrender.at the end of the encounter,four of the pirates were dead two from the discharge of the pirates own weapons,and two from the seals raid.
the navy took the remaining pirates into custody.while held aboard the uss enterprise,an aircraft carrier,they were given miranda warnings and questioned by the fbi.one pirate,a juvenile,was released.abrar told the fbi that he had been forced to participate in the piracy mission.in abrar account,he was offered work as a mechanic in the coastal somali town of garacad,but was then kidnapped at gunpoint by two of the other pirates,mohamud salad ali,also known as juguuf,and mohamud hirs issa ali,also known as sarindaaq.abrar acknowledged that he had been the first pirate to board the quest,and he contended that after the hijacking his role changed from mechanic to guard.according to abrar,he did not leave with the four yemeni fishermen who were released on the alqasim because he thought he would have been arrested in yemen for piracy.
although abrar admitted that he had been pointing a gun at jean adam before the concluding moments of carnage,he denied ever shooting any of the american hostages.abrar,who is considered a member of the bantu minority ethnic group in somalia,claimed that he would not have received a share of any ransom.when confronted with the pirates list of participants,abrar suggested that his name may have been included simply to assuage his feelings.
the fourteen remaining pirates,including beyle and abrar,were transported to the united states for criminal prosecution.a federal grand jury returned a indictment against the pirates.nine members of the group pleaded guilty to piracy under the law of nations,and two leaders,sarindaaq and juguuf,pleaded guilty both to piracy under the law of nations and to resulting in death.each of the eleven pirates who entered guilty pleas was sentenced to at least one term of life imprisonment.
on july,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment containing counts against each of the three pirates who had not pleaded,beyle,and abrar.the superseding indictment charged the codefendants with the following crimes conspiracy to commit resulting in death,in violation of a count resulting in death,in violation of a and counts,and conspiracy to commit kidnapping,in violation of c count kidnapping resulting in death,in violation of a and counts,and conspiracy to commit violence against maritime navigation resulting in death,in violation of a h count violence against maritime navigation resulting in death,in violation of a g and counts,and murder within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states,in violation of and counts,and piracy under the law of nations,in violation of and count the use,carry,brandish,and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence,in violation of c and counts and the use,carry,brandish,and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence resulting in death,in violation of c and j and counts,and.the superseding indictment also included the requisite notice of special findings for seeking capital punishment,and nine months later the government filed notices of its intent to seek the death penalty against afmagalo,beyle,and abrar.
beyle and abrar each filed motions to dismiss.first,beyle moved to dismiss counts through and counts through on the ground that the murders had taken place in somali territorial waters,beyond jurisdiction.the district court denied the motion in a memorandum order.second,abrar moved to dismiss the indictment based on his inability to investigate or corroborate a duress defense.abrar identified various witnesses located overseas several individuals in somalia,as well as the four yemeni fishermen from the alqasim who he believed could provide meaningful character evidence to support his claim that he had been forced to join the piracy operation.the district court denied this motion as well.
the guilt phase of the codefendants capital trial,which lasted from june to july,featured extensive testimony from officials and from many of the pirates.the court issued a jury instruction on abrar duress defense for counts through and count that is,for all the counts besides the murders and the various firearms offenses.
at the conclusion of the guilt phase of the trial,the jury convicted afmagalo,beyle,and abrar on all counts.the jury recommended sentences of life imprisonment.the district court eventually sentenced each of the codefendants to three concurrent life sentences,plus eighteen consecutive life sentences and thirty consecutive years.
beyle and abrar now appeal.each argues his claim independently,and neither purports to join the other grounds.the third convicted codefendant,afmagalo,is not a party to this appeal.
beyle contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the charges of murder counts,and and concomitant use of a firearm counts,and because the underlying actions occurred within somalia territorial waters,not on the high seas.for many reasons,we find beyle claims unpersuasive.
the constitution grants congress the power t o define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas.const.art.i,cl.congress has exercised this enumerated power to punish maritime crimes since the earliest days of the republic.united states dire,cir discussing criminal piracy statutes from and and associated litigation.
the statutes under which beyle was convicted fall well within congress constitutionally granted power to punish felonies on the high seas.the first statute proscribes murder w ithin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states.b.the second statute defines the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states as including the high seas,any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the united states and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state,and a ny place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the united states.id.finally,the statutory prohibition of the use of a firearm to cause the death of another tacks onto the underlying offense.id.c,j.congress undoubtedly possesses the authority under the define and punish clause to enact the criminal laws at issue in beyle appeal.
that said,the crux of beyle argument is not that the statutes under which he was convicted are facially unconstitutional,but rather that he was not on the high seas when he committed the actions for which he is to be punished.he asserts that the district court mistakenly construed the law regarding the limits of the territorial seas of somalia.appellants br.at.beyle appeal thus presents a single issue is a person thirty to forty nautical miles off the somali coast on the high seas we review this question of law de novo.united states woolfolk,cir.
it is that the high seas encompass all those waters beyond the boundary of the various territorial waters.simply put,o utside the territorial sea are the high seas.united states louisiana,see also kiobel royal dutch petroleum,piracy typically occurs on the high seas,beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the united states or any other country.united states rodgers,a large body of navigable water,open and unconfined,and not under the exclusive control of any one nation or people,must fall under the definition of high seas.as we have noted,beyond the territorial waters lie the highseas,over which no nation can exercise sovereignty.titanic,haver,cir.
customary international law supports this definition.two international agreements are most relevant to the case at hand.first,the geneva convention on the high seas,which the united states has ratified,defines high seas as all parts of the sea that are not included in the territorial sea or in the internal waters of a state.convention on the high seas,opened for signature,entered into force.second,the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos states that a nation sovereignty covers only the territorial sea.convention on the law of the sea,opened for signature,entered into force.although the united states has not signed or ratified unclos,it has recognized that the treaty baseline provisions reflect customary international law.united states alaska,internal quotation marks omitted dire,at statement on united states oceans policy,pub.papers,t he united states is prepared to accept and act in accordance with the balance of interests relating to traditional use of the oceans.
unclos recognizes an exclusive economic zone eez beyond a nation territorial sea but within two hundred nautical miles of the coastal baseline.see unclos,supra.beyle insists that unclos treats the eez as a distinct entity and that the high seas do not begin until two hundred nautical miles from land.because the quest was within the eez when the murders occurred,he thus asserts that he was not on the high seas for the purposes of law.
while it is true that the part of unclos that is titled high seas concerns the waters extending beyond the borders of the eez,see unclos,supra,almost all of the treaty provisions apply with equal force inside the eez as they do outside it,see id.the eez bordering a particular nation territorial sea is merely a part of the high seas where that nation has special economic rights and jurisdiction.unclos grants coastal nations certain rights to natural resources within the eez,as well as jurisdiction over marine scientific research and protection and preservation of the marine environment.id.a,b see also titanic,at noting that the eez grants exclusive control over certain economic matters,but not over navigation.
any allocation of economic rights,however,is a far cry from conferring on a nation the exclusive authority endemic to sovereignty to define and punish criminal violations.in effect,beyle would have us use unclos grant of certain specific enumerated rights as a wedge to dramatically expand somalia plenary control past the maximum.but beyle points to no court that has declared that a nation full sovereign rights extend two hundred nautical miles from the coast.we decline to credit such a sweeping interpretation.
if beyle was beyond the bounds of somalia territorial sea,therefore,he was on the high seas and within the reach of the criminal statutes under which he was convicted.the question then becomes where exactly somalia territorial sea ends and the high seas begin.the weight of authority points to an outer territorial limit of twelve nautical miles,which places the quest on the high seas at the time of the murders.
unclos explicitly restricts territorial seas from extending farther than twelve nautical miles from national coastlines.unclos,supra.at the time of the piracy at issue in this case,nations had ratified unclos,including somalia.with nearly signatory nations today,unclos enjoys widespread acceptance in the international community.as noted above,although the united states is not a signatory to unclos,this country recognizes the treaty place as an accurate reflection of customary international law.it is,moreover,the policy of the united states not to respect claims that a territorial sea extends beyond twelve nautical miles.office of ocean affairs,dep t of state,pub,limits in the seas united states responses to excessive maritime claims,fact sheet,office of the press sec y,the white house,united states oceans policy,see b see also the white house,united states counter piracy and maritime security action plan annex b at june.consistent with unclos,the united states itself claims a territorial sea extending up to twelve nautical miles.e argentine republic amerada hess shipping corp,a ii,iii,iv applying a territorial sea of twelve nautical miles for determining criminal jurisdiction and the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction,and for interpreting international law proclamation,extending the territorial sea to twelve nautical miles in accordance with international law.
we,too,have repeatedly stated that a nation territorial waters generally extend to twelve nautical miles.see united states shibin,cir dire,at titanic,at.the jury instructions given by the district court reflected this understanding,and earlier cases were predicated upon the same definition.the high seas include areas of the seas that are outside the territorial seas of any nation.a nation territorial seas are generally limited to an area within nautical miles of the nation coast.see,excerpt of proceedings jury instructions at,united states hasan,cr,same,ecf,aff sub nom.dire.
nevertheless,beyle argues that customary international law does not apply to the determination of the extent of somalia territorial sea,because somalia passed national legislation in that extended its sea to two hundred nautical miles even if we could or would credit any such territorial claim,it does not pass muster here.somalia ratified unclos in,making a clear international commitment to a territorial sea of no more than twelve nautical miles furthermore,somalia also has never submitted a declaration indicating to any unclos provision,and in any event unclos prohibits signatories from opting out selectively from its provisions.unclos,supra.the united states,moreover,explicitly does not recognize any claim by somalia to a territorial sea and has conducted operations well within the limit to make that policy known.office of the judge advocate,navy,maritime claims reference manual somalia.indeed,the navy maneuvered to block the quest where it did precisely because it did not want the pirated vessel to sail into the territorial sea.
the common and obvious meaning of the expression,high seas,is also the true legal meaning,daniel webster once argued before the supreme court.united states bevans,wheat.the expression describes the open ocean,where the dominion of the winds and waves prevails without check or control.id.although webster was not conversant with unclos,he plainly grasped the point that expansive claims of territoriality would intrude upon the natural domain of the seas and the multinational interests therein.nowhere is this truer than when litigants seek to extend customary international law as memorialized in treaties to claim territorial seas more than sixteen times the maximum breadth.the quest,beyle,and the victims were on the high seas when the murders occurred.
we are aware of no court that has held that somalia territorial sea extends past the boundary prescribed by unclos,much less to two hundred nautical miles.we shall not be the first.
piracy is an international problem.the primary statute in our criminal code,incorporates the definition of piracy under international law.dire,at.an essential element of the international crime of piracy is that the violence against persons,vessels,or property occurred on the high seas or outside the jurisdiction of any nation.unclos,supra,a i ii see shibin,at dire,at.in a reflection of that shared understanding,it has fallen to and north atlantic treaty organization nato coalition forces to combat piracy.these naval forces conduct patrols in the gulf of aden,a vital shipping passageway between the arabian peninsula and the horn of africa.parts of the gulf of aden off the somali coast are under two hundred nautical miles wide.in essence,beyle asks this court to treat the gulf of aden as a somali territorial sea.as a practical matter,such a ruling would prove especially problematic for nato maritime forces,which only operate in somali territorial waters under the consent of somali authorities.fact sheet.command,atl.treaty,operation ocean shield,at.
the risks of an extension of the somali territorial sea include as well emboldened gangs of pirates,increased investment in piracy by financiers,and bridled nato and multinational efforts.such results would offend the united nations security council ongoing apprehension over the threat to international navigation,the safety of commercial maritime routes and the safety of seafarers and other persons posed by the violence of piracy and.res,preambular,doc.we decline to allow beyle challenge to his murder and firearm convictions to undermine this broader multinational effort.
in short,the structure of domestic and international law that beyle seeks to topple protects commercial peace against piratical disruption,and we reject his challenge to his murder and firearms convictions.
abrar argues that he was denied his fifth amendment right to due process and his sixth amendment right to present witnesses material to his duress defense.in particular,he maintains that he was unable to access or subpoena certain witnesses located abroad who could have corroborated his story that he had been kidn
