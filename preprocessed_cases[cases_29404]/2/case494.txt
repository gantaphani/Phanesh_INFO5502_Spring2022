we must decide whether the federal court had removal jurisdiction over an action brought by a passenger against a cruise line and insurance companies alleging various tort and contract claims arising out of events in the port city of bombay,india,and,if so,whether these claims were properly dismissed on summary judgment.
ottilie morris morris appeals the district court dismissal on summary judgment of her tort and contract claims against princess cruises,princess and american international assistance service,national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pa,and berkelycare limited collectively,the insurers.these claims arose out of a princess cruise that morris and her late husband,roy morris morris,took from athens to bombay in november.
in june,and morris,who had taken a number of princess cruises in the past,made reservations for a princess holy lands cruise through cruise consultants consultants,a travel agency based in san antonio,texas.at the same time,the morrises purchased an excess insurance policy known as love boat care the policy administered by berkelycare and underwritten by national union fire insurance.the policy designated emergency assistance provider was american international assistance service,aias.the policy benefits included,inter alia,coverage for emergency evacuation to the nearest hospital where appropriate medical treatment can be obtained and economy airfare for a family member traveling with the insured medical expense coverage for illness worldwide emergency telephone assistance so that help and advice may be furnished and emergency medical assistance to help locate the nearest qualified medical facility and to provide up to a advance payment to a hospital if needed to admit the insured.the policy description of coverage contained the following caveat 
note that the problems of distance,information and communications make it impossible for national union fire insurance company,berkelycare ltd,princess or its assistance service provider to assume any responsibility for the availability,quality,use,or results of any emergency service.in all cases,you are still responsible for obtaining,using,and paying for your own required services of all types.
in november,the morrises departed from athens aboard the island princess for a cruise to singapore by way of bombay.on november,morris,who had a history of heart disease,contracted pneumonia and was admitted to the ship medical center under the care of the ship physician,katrina lewis lewis.given the seriousness of morris condition,lewis believed that he should be evacuated as soon as possible to a intensive care unit icu.she spoke with the ship captain about the possibility of arranging for helicopter evacuation or diverting the ship to the nearest port,but was told that the ship was outside the range of any emergency medical helicopters and too far from appropriate medical facilities.thus,the ship proceeded full speed to bombay.
on november,lewis contacted aias,the emergency assistance provider under morris policy.lewis informed aias that she would arrange for morris to be air evacuated by aea,international aea to singapore as soon as the ship reached port in bombay and that aias assistance would not be necessary.aea is the only emergency evacuation assistance provider that princess cruises employs in that region and the provider that lewis was specifically instructed to use by her supervisors.according to uncontradicted testimony,aea has a reputation for being a very reliable emergency assistance provider.aias monitored morris condition and faxed its approval of the air evacuation plan to aea with a guarantee for the full policy limit for emergency evacuation.aea represented to lewis and aias that it would have a jet ready to evacuate morris to singapore upon his arrival in bombay.
the ship reached port in bombay in the early morning hours of november.an physician,one mehra,came aboard and examined morris.aea apparently represented to lewis that mehra was a specialist in aviation medicine.after the examination,mehra expressed his concern for morris oxygenation in the event that the plane lost cabin pressure during the flight to singapore and recommended that the flight be delayed until morris could be stabilized.
with this change in plans,it was agreed that mehra would take morris to a bombay icu by ambulance.the ambulance mehra provided was woefully deficient.it was not equipped with any medical supplies or devices of any oxygen.it was also filthy,as was the stretcher onto which morris was placed.lewis herself testified that the ambulance was not appropriate for taking morris to a hospital facility and expressed her concerns to mehra,who replied that this was the only ambulance available.relying on aea chosen physician,lewis turned treatment of morris over to mehra,having first provided morris with oxygen and blankets from the ship medical center.
after a ambulance trip through bombay,mehra transported morris to the aradhana intensive care and nursing home.morris testified to the wretched conditions prevailing at the aradhana facility.there was half an inch of urine on the floor flies and roaches were everywhere.there was no medical equipment of any kind there.morris pleaded with mehra to transfer her husband to a regular hospital.mehra agreed,but demanded,which morris immediately handed over.after spending approximately six hours at the nursing home,morris was transferred to breach candy hospital in bombay.
meanwhile,aias attempted to contact morris to help her find hotel accommodations and to assist in having money wired to her from her family in the united states.according to morris,she checked in to the hotel shalimar at the recommendation of aias.during her stay there,she was assaulted and some of her personal belongings were stolen.she was also accosted by mehra again,who demanded an additional,which morris refused to pay.
morris was treated at breach candy for days,and morris was pleased with the care morris received there.on december,morris was deemed fit to fly home to texas.aias arranged for a flight back to san antonio for both and morris and provided a medical escort for the trip,as well.morris arrived home feeling better and did not seek out medical attention for a couple of days.on december,morris suffered a fatal heart attack during an angioplasty procedure.cause of death was listed as severe coronary artery disease.
morris submitted a claim under the policy in the amount of for trip cancellation,loss of her personal belongings at the hotel shalimar,and hotel,meals and transportation while in bombay.she submitted a second claim of for medical expenses,including the she paid to mehra.based on their currency conversion table and pursuant to policy limitations not at issue here,the insurers paid morris,including for her medical expenses,which included the cash payment to mehra.the insurers paid an additional for morris air evacuation from bombay to texas.morris no longer disputes the amount of the insurers payments on her claims.
on may,morris filed a wrongful death claim against princess and a claim of negligent misrepresentation against consultants.she alleged that princess failed to provide adequate care for morris aboard the island princess failed to arrange for morris to be transferred to a proper medical facility failed to maintain contact with the morrises while they were in bombay failed to provide air transfer of morris to singapore as promised and failed to have policies and procedures for proper health care and safe evacuation and subsequent care for passengers who become ill while in the care and custody of princess.she alleged that princess thereby breached its duty of care to morris and that such breach was a proximate cause of his death.she also alleged that consultants falsely represented that princess cruises was a reputable cruise line and that passengers in their care would be safely and adequately served.
princess and consultants removed to the united states district court for the western district of texas based on diversity jurisdiction,federal question jurisdiction,admiralty jurisdiction,and the death on the high seas act dohsa.morris brought a motion to remand,contending that the presence of consultants,a citizen of texas for purposes of diversity,defeated complete diversity that admiralty claims filed in state court in the first instance are and that dohsa claims filed in state court are likewise because the dohsa sounds in admiralty.morris submitted an affidavit along with her motion to remand in which she expressly maintained that neither she nor her husband at any time discussed the quality or nature of medical care provided on board princess cruise lines ships with consultants,as they were both in perfect health and had no need for this information.on march,the district court denied morris motion to remand,concluding that consultants was fraudulently joined and hence that the court had removal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship.on january,while her motion to remand was still pending,morris filed her unopposed first amended original complaint,in which she joined the insurers,stating claims against them for negligence,breach of contract,breach of the texas insurance code,and violations of the deceptive trade practices act.on april,morris filed her second amended complaint,in which she replaced her wrongful death claim against princess with claims alleging negligence based on the same alleged breaches as recited in her original state court complaint,gross negligence,breach of contract and breach of warranty.she also restated her previous claims against the other parties.
pursuant to a forum selection clause contained in the morrises cruise tickets,venue was transferred to the central district of california.on march,consultants was dismissed from the action under fed.civ.proc.b for failure to state a claim.on october,the district court granted summary judgment for princess and the insurers on all claims.
we must first decide whether the district court properly acquired and retained removal jurisdiction over this action.
the district court held that it had removal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship.a.section requires complete diversity of citizenship each of the plaintiffs must be a citizen of a different state than each of the defendants.caterpillar lewis,d.nevertheless,one exception to the requirement of complete diversity is where a defendant has been fraudulently joined.
fraudulent joinder,we have noted,is a term of art.mccabe general foods,cir.joinder of a defendant is deemed fraudulent,and the defendant presence in the lawsuit is ignored for purposes of determining diversity,i f the plaintiff fails to state a cause of action against a resident defendant,and the failure is obvious according to the settled rules of the state.id.further,the defendant is entitled to present the facts showing the joinder to be fraudulent.id.because consultants,like morris,is deemed a citizen of texas for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,its presence in the lawsuit at the time of removal defeated diversity jurisdiction unless it was fraudulently joined.
morris sued consultants for negligent misrepresentation.to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation under texas law,the plaintiff must establish the representation is made by a defendant in the course of his business the defendant supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business the defendant did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information and the plaintiff suffers pecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the representation.federal land bank ass of tyler sloane.the false information supplied must be a misrepresentation of a material fact.mccamish,martin,brown loeffler appling interests.mere or puffing is not actionable.prudential ins.of am.jefferson,statements describing property to be superb or super fine were puffing.whether a statement is an actionable statement of fact or mere puffing depends upon a number of factors,including the statement specificity,the speaker knowledge,the comparative levels of the speaker and the hearer knowledge,and whether the statement relates to the present or the future.transport ins.faircloth.we have noted that a material fact is one that would be likely to affect the conduct of a reasonable person with reference to the transaction in question.french merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
in her original state court complaint,morris alleged that jay silberman,owner of consultants,recommended the princess holy lands cruise to the morrises and represented that princess cruises,inc was a reputable cruise line and that passengers in their care would be safely and adequately served.such an allegation fails to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation against consultants and the failure is obvious according to settled law.silberman alleged statement is devoid of any meaningful specificity,amounting at most to a general recommendation of princess akin to mere puffing.further,the morrises had sailed on princess cruises in the past and were familiar with the services and amenities princess offered thus,they could not have reasonably relied upon such statement in any event.the obviously nature of silberman statement is highlighted by morris own affidavit that accompanied her motion to remand.morris specifically denied that she ever discussed the quality or nature of medical care provided on board princess cruise lines ships with silberman.in light of morris own admission,it is abundantly obvious that she could not possibly prevail on her negligent misrepresentation claim against consultants.see cavallini state farm mutual auto ins,cir f raudulent joinder claims may be resolved by piercing the pleadings and considering summary evidence such as affidavits and deposition testimony.citations omitted.consultants joinder as a defendant in this action was correctly ignored by the district court and removal was proper based on diversity of citizenship.
we must next determine if the district court retained jurisdiction over this action.after the case was removed to federal court,and while her motion to remand was still pending,morris amended her complaint to join the insurers as additional defendants.aias and national union fire insurance of pittsburgh are,like morris,deemed citizens of texas for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.once removal has occurred,the district court has two options in dealing with an attempt to join a party.e provides that i f after removal the plaintiff seeks to join additional defendants whose joinder would destroy subject matter jurisdiction,the court may deny joinder,or permit joinder and remand the action to the state court.newcombe adolf coors,cir.here,the district court did neither,permitting joinder of the parties while retaining jurisdiction over the action.if diversity were the only basis for the court subject matter jurisdiction,joinder of the insurers would have divested the court of jurisdiction.desert empire bank ins.of,cir permissive joinder of nondiverse defendant following removal to federal court divested court of subject matter jurisdiction.
the presence of the insurers in this action destroyed the district court diversity jurisdiction,but not its original subject matter jurisdiction.by failing to request a remand based on the joinder of the insurers,morris has waived whatever defect in the court removal jurisdiction their presence in the action created.the supreme court has held that removal jurisdiction,unlike original subject matter jurisdiction,can,in fact,be waived.in grubbs credit,d,the court held that where after removal a case is tried on the merits without objection and the federal court enters judgment,the issue in subsequent proceedings on appeal is not whether the case was properly removed,but whether the federal district court would have had original jurisdiction of the case had it been filed in that court.id.at.the district court grant of summary judgment implicates the rule in grubbs.see local union jones const,cir grubbs doctrine applies where a district court has entered summary judgment disposing of the merits of a case.
the district court would have had original jurisdiction over this case had it been brought initially in federal court because m
