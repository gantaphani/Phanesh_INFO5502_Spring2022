claimant rené rodríguez asserts ownership of seized by the united states.the district court entered a default judgment in favor of the united states,ruling that rodríguez claim was procedurally deficient,and denied rodríguez subsequent motion to vacate and motion to reconsider.rodríguez now appeals the denial of the motion to reconsider.after carefully considering the procedural missteps in this case,some by rodríguez and some by the court,we affirm.
on july,rodríguez was scheduled to fly on a commercial airline from the john kennedy international airport jfk in queens,new york to luis munoz marin international airport lmmia in carolina,puerto rico.suspecting that rodríguez was carrying money to pay for a shipment of cocaine that had arrived at jfk from lmmia on june,agents of the drug enforcement agency detained rodríguez at jfk while his flight proceeded on to puerto rico carrying his checked luggage.the agents questioned rodríguez and obtained his consent to search his luggage once it arrived at lmmia.upon searching his luggage,dea agents in puerto rico seized in currency pursuant to a.
subsequently,rodríguez attempted to retrieve the seized currency.the first step towards retrieving seized property is to file a sworn claim of ownership with the agency that made the the dea.a a.this verified administrative claim notifies the agency of the party alleged interest in the property.rodríguez properly filed a verified administrative claim with the dea on january,asserting that he was the owner of the seized at lmmia.
once a party has filed an administrative claim,the government has days either to file a complaint for forfeiture in the district court or to release the property.a a b.in this case,the government filed a timely complaint for forfeiture on april,in the puerto rico district court and served a copy of the complaint on rodríguez counsel the government also published notice of the forfeiture in the may,edition of el nuevo dia,a newspaper of general circulation in puerto rico authorized for notice purposes by local admiralty rule g of the puerto rico district court 
rule c of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims governs pleading in a civil forfeiture proceeding.see,united states v.one dairy farm,cir.that rule,as it existed during the lower court proceedings in this case,requires that any person with a claim to the property must file a verified statement identifying that interest or right verified statement within days of actual notice or completed publication of notice,or within the time the court allows the claimant must then serve an answer to the complaint within days of filing the verified statement rodríguez requested an extension of time.on may,the district court granted him a extension to file his pleadings.
rodríguez filed an answer on june,but he neglected to file the verified statement required by rule c.on july,the government filed two motions one to strike the answer because rodríguez had never filed a verified statement,and one to enter a default decree of forfeiture.copies of these motions were served on rodríguez counsel.nevertheless,rodríguez did not reply to either motion.on july,the district court granted the government motion for a default decree of forfeiture,forfeiting the to the government.
on july,appellant filed a motion to vacate the judgment by default.he attached a copy of his verified administrative claim and argued that,although it was originally filed with the dea and had not previously been before the court it was a sufficient substitute for the verified statement required by rule c.he did not offer any explanation for the failure to file the verified statement required by the rules before filing his answer,and he did not ground his motion to vacate in any particular rule.
in a written order entered on january,the court rejected appellant argument that filing a verified administrative claim fulfilled the pleading requirements of rule c.the court cited precedent that filing a verified statement is required to establish standing in a civil forfeiture case.it also distinguished this case,in which the claimant filed an unverified answer,from the exception we adopted in united states v.one urban lot,where we held that a verified answer can serve as both a verified statement and answer,cir.the court did not,however,specify the rule or standard of relief that it applied to the motion to vacate the default judgment.
on february,appellant submitted a motion to reconsider the denial of the january motion.again he attached a copy of the verified administrative claim and again he argued that it fulfilled the verification requirement of rule c.he did not invoke a particular rule when filing his motion.on february,the government filed an opposition to the motion.
on april,the court denied the motion to reconsider,which it characterized as a request for relief under rule b.after quoting rule b in its entirety,but without citing any one of the six possible grounds for vacating a judgment under rule b,the court reiterated that the filing of a verified administrative claim and an unverified answer does not meet the requirements of rule c and is not sufficiently similar to the filing of a verified answer to invoke the exception we adopted in one urban lot.rodríguez now appeals the district court denial of the motion to reconsider.
the filing of a verified statement,as required by rule c,is no mere procedural technicality.it forces claimants to assert their alleged ownership under oath,creating a deterrent against filing false claims.see,united states commodity account,cir verification forces the claimant to place himself at risk for perjury of false claims,and the requirement of oath or affirmation is not a mere technical requirement that we easily excuse.for this reason,filing a verified statement is normally a prerequisite to the right to file an answer and defend on the merits.one dairy farm,at quoting united states fourteen handguns,see also one urban lot,at s ympathy alone does not suffice to require the district judge to disregard claimants complete failure to abide by the command of supp.rule c to file a verified claim or answer.when a claimant files only an answer without a verified statement,the district court may strike the answer.see,united states beechcraft queen airplane,cir holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by requiring strict compliance with rule c and striking claimant answer because he did not precede it with a verified statement.
the failure to file a verified statement implicates federal rule of civil procedure,which governs the entry of a default judgment.see,one urban lot,at applying rule to a civil forfeiture default.the rule distinguishes between the entry of default under rule a and judgment by default under rule b.entry of default is an interlocutory in anticipation of a final recognizing that a party has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by the federal rules of civil procedure.a.because rodríguez did not file a verified statement in accordance with rule c,the court was entitled to enter a default under rule a for failing to otherwise defend as required by the rules.
in contrast to the entry of default under rule a,a rule b judgment by default is a final disposition of the case and an appealable order that has the same effect as a judgment rendered after a trial on the merits.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure civil.rule b provides that the court may enter a judgment by default provided that i f the party against whom judgment by default is sought has appeared in the action,the party shall be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least days prior to the hearing on such application.
in this case,rodríguez filing of an answer constituted an appearance before the court.see wright,miller kane,noting that an appearance merely involves some presentation or submission to the court.thus,he was entitled to notice,under rule b,of the application for a default judgment.the government provided notice of the motion for a default judgment by sending a copy to claimant counsel via certified mail.receiving no opposition to the motion to enter a default judgment,the court proceeded,on july,to issue a default decree of forfeiture,which acted as a final judgment by default pursuant to rule b.
motion to vacate and motion to reconsider 
rule c applies different standards for setting aside an entry of default under rule a and a judgment by default under rule b.a court may set aside an entry of default for good cause.this standard is a liberal one,coon grenier,cir the relevant factors are whether the default was willful,a would prejudice plaintiff,and the alleged defense was meritorious.keegel key west caribbean trading.by contrast,the court can set aside a final judgment by default only in accordance with rule b.rule b,the provision relevant here,requires a showing of excusable neglect to win relief from a final judgment this is a demanding standard.see coon,at.it allows the court,where appropriate,to accept late filings caused by inadvertence,mistake,or carelessness,as well as by intervening circumstances beyond the party control.pioneer inv.servs.brunswick,d however,ignorance of the rules,or mistakes construing the rules do not usually constitute excusable neglect id.at.we have said that,while other factors play an important role in the excusable neglect analysis,the factor will always be critical to the inquiry hospital del maestro labor relations,cir quoting lowry mcdonnell douglas,cir.we have also recognized that 
a trial judge has wide discretion in dealing with a litigant whose predicament results from blatant ignorance of clear or easily ascertainable rules,and,if the trial judge decides that such neglect is not excusable in the particular case,we will not meddle unless we are persuaded that some exceptional justification exists.
quebecor printing,at 
in this case,rodríguez filed two motions after the judgment by default the motion to vacate and the motion to reconsider.although the motion to vacate did not invoke rule b,and the district court did not explicitly rely on rule b in its decision,the motion was nonetheless a rule b motion because it sought to vacate a final judgment by default that,by the explicit terms of rule c,may be set aside in accordance with rule b.rodríguez second motion to restated his claims from the motion to vacate,but this time the court explicitly analyzed the motion under rule b.in essence,the court allowed rodríguez a second chance to argue his prior motion to vacate.for the purposes of this appeal,we accept the district court analytical framework and will treat the motion to reconsider as a rule b motion we review the district court denial of a rule b motion for abuse of discretion.see cotto united states,cir district courts enjoy considerable discretion in deciding motions brought under civil rule b.we review such rulings only for abuse of that wide discretion.
excusable neglect 
as stated above,the reason for delay is a critical factor in the excusable neglect analysis.at no stage in this process,either in the trial court or here,has appellant explained why,after being granted a extension by the district court to respond to the government forfeiture complaint,he did not comply with rule c,did not oppose the government motion to strike his answer,and did not ask the court for leave to file a verified statement and new answer after the court entered its judgment by default.at each stage,appellant has instead argued that his filing of a verified administrative claim somehow negates the requirement to file a verified statement in the judicial forfeiture proceeding pursuant to rule c,despite the absence of any precedent supporting that proposition.
we acknowledge that both the administrative claim and verified statement contain essentially the same information they identify the property,the claim to the property,and bear a sworn statement by the claimant asserting his or her claim.a a,supp.c.nevertheless,the two documents serve distinct purposes the administrative claim notifies the agency of the claim while the verified statement notifies the court.this distinction is important,inter alia,because the party that files an administrative claim may not be the only party with a claim against the property.more than one claimant may emerge to file a verified statement after public notice of the complaint for forfeiture.filing a verified statement with the court notifies all other parties of each claim to the property so that all interests may properly be resolved.for this reason,the facial similarity between the two documents does not negate the obligation to file a verified statement.see,united states,cir an administrative claim does not give the claimant any rights in the judicial condemnation proceeding it only ensures that a judicial proceeding will take place before the property is forfeited.
appellant also makes a passing reference in his brief to the difficulty caused by his incarceration in puerto rico and the apparent language barrier between rodríguez and his counsel.nevertheless,appellant did not present this argument in his motion to vacate and does not explain why these difficulties,which did not prevent him from filing a timely verified administrative claim,prevented him from filing a verified statement.under the circumstances,we can find no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to vacate the default judgment pursuant to rule b on the basis of excusable neglect.
good cause 
finally,rodríguez attempts to avoid the excusable neglect analysis by arguing that his submission of a verified administrative claim to the court in conjunction with his motion to vacate invoked the rule c good cause standard of review.he argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in applying the rule b standard because appellant procedural deficiency failure to file a verified statement only justified an entry of default rather than a judgment by default.if the court could only enter a default under rule a,the more lenient rule c good cause standard should have applied to the request for relief.
appellant analogizes his case to that of the claimant in one urban lot,whose pleadings were sufficient to present a valid claim to the property even absent the filing of a verified statement.in one urban lot,we found no abuse of discretion where the district court entered a default judgment against three claimants who did not file a verified statement.however,in the case of one claimant who filed a verified answer,we held that such an answer submitted prior to judgment by default,if it includes all of the material normally contained in a verified statement,can serve as both a verified statement and answer.at.hence the district court should not have stricken that answer.furthermore,with the verified answer still in place,the district court in one urban lot should not have elevated the entry of default to a judgment by default under rule b,susceptible to relief only under rule b.instead,the district court should have applied the more lenient rule c good cause standard and set aside the entry of default on that basis 
appellant now invites us to extend the exception of one urban lot and apply the rule c good cause standard to parties who provide only an unverified answer prior to default,and a sworn claim of interest only after the court has entered a judgment by default.we decline the invitation.
even assuming that the administrative claim would be a valid substitute for a verified statement we can not fault the district court,in the exercise of its discretion,for refusing to vacate a default judgment upon presentation of a verified document that should have been filed prior to default.the timely filing of a verified statement force s claimants to come forward as soon as possible after forfeiture proceedings have begun one urban lot,at.allowing claimants to rely on a verified administrative claim filed after the court has entered a default judgment would undermine this important goal of timeliness and an important related finality of judgments.see,custis united states,d i nroads on the concept of finality tend to undermine confidence in the integrity of our procedures and inevitably delay and impair the orderly administration of justice.moreover,we take judicial notice of the fact that the puerto rico district court is an exceptionally busy court,where the pressures for timely proceedings are relentless the requirement that a verified statement be filed before the filing of an answer was clearly set forth in rule c,and there was nothing difficult about the compliance with this requirement.the district court was entitled to insist upon procedural regularity.
in reaching this conclusion,we have considered several procedural irregularities in this case that,in some circumstances,might justify applying the rule c good cause standard rather than the rule b excusable neglect standard.first,while the local rules of the puerto rico district court require a party to respond to motions within ten days,the district court waited only eight computable days after the government filed its motions before entering its default decree second,instead of ruling separately on the motion to strike the answer,the court treated the answer as stricken in its default decree finally,the district court did not explicitly enter a default pursuant to rule a prior to entering a default judgment under rule b 
on the facts of this case,however,these procedural irregularities do not warrant c good cause review.appellant has not argued,before either the district court or on appeal,that any of these missteps require application of the good cause standard or that they prejudiced his case.thus,these arguments are waived.see,smilow southwestern bell mobile,cir issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner or not at all are waived.further,we have no reason to believe that these missteps by the court denied rodríguez a fair review of his claim.each occurred after the time for filing a verified statement had expired,including a extension granted by the court.we see no evidence that rodríguez would have remedied his procedural deficiency if the court had waited the full ten days before entering a default judgment instead of eight,or if the court had first entered a default before entering a default judgment.nothing in the history of the case barred the court from striking the answer explicitly and separately if it had chosen to do so.finally,the court gave careful consideration on two occasions to rodríguez request for b relief.
rodríguez filed deficient pleadings,failed to remedy those pleadings,and failed to explain his procedural missteps.while we recognize the desirability of deciding disputes on their merits,teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers union,local superline transp,cir,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion by embracing the countervailing goals of timeliness and the finality of judgments.our ruling is in accord with other courts of appeals that have similarly found no abuse of discretion when a district court requires claimants to comply strictly with the verified statement requirement of rule c.see,beechcraft queen airplane,at united states,cir united states v.one piper navajo aircraft,cir.
appellant claims that his counsel did not receive the complaint until may.because the district court granted rodríguez an extension of time to file his pleadings,and rodríguez met this extended schedule,the date on which his counsel received the complaint is not relevant to determining rodríguez compliance with the filing requirements.
rule c of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims requires that,in a civil forfeiture proceeding,the government must within the time that the court public notice of the action and arrest in a newspaper designated by court order and having general circulation in the district the notice must specify the time under rule c to file a statement of interest in or right against the seized property and to answer.
in previous cases,such as united states v.one urban lot,cir,we have referred to the verified statement as a verified claim.the year amendments to rule c changed the terminology from claim to statement.the advisory committee notes explain that the change permits parallel drafting,and facilitates cross references in other rules.the substantive nature of the statement remains the same as the former claim.thus,despite the different terminology,the verified statement we refer to now is functionally identical to the verified claim we have referred to in the past when discussing the requirements of rule c.
when this case was first before the district court,prior to the amendments effective december,rule c stated that i a person who asserts an interest in or right against the property that is the subject of the action must file a verified statement identifying the interest or right a within days after the earlier of the actual notice of execution of process or completed publication of notice under rule c,or b within the time that the court allows.iii a person who files a statement of interest in or right against the property must serve an answer within days after filing the amendments,none of which affect the judgment in this case,allow days to file a verified statement,change the first alternative event for measuring the days to the government service of the complaint,and allow days to both serve and file an answer after the filing of the verified statement.
at oral argument,appellant claimed that the attorney office had forwarded the administrative claim to the district court.appellee denied this,and we can find no evidence in the record that the attorney forwarded the administrative claim to the district court.rather,it appears that the court had the administrative claim before it for the first time when claimant filed a motion to vacate.
rule b states in relevant part on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b fraud whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party the judgment is void the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the.b.
although the excusable neglect standard at issue in pioneer arose under the bankruptcy code,the court analysis applies to the excusable neglect standard as used throughout the federal rules of civil procedure,including rule b.see,graphic communications int l union local quebecor printing providence,cir escuela de medicina universidad central del caribe,cir.
for cases finding excusable neglect,see wright,miller kane,citing examples of excusable neglect including cases where the default was caused by lack of notice,illness,death,withdrawal of counsel,misunderstandings between multiple defendants,problems due to an defendant and,in limited circumstances,honest mistake.
we note that a motion ask ing the court to modify its earlier disposition of the case because of an allegedly erroneous legal result is brought under.e.appeal of sun pipe line,cir see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure civil rule e include s motions for reconsideration.thus,rodríguez motion to reconsider was,in essence,a rule e motion which was filed within the required days.however,rule e does not provide a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures aybar,cir.moreover,the motion to reconsider filed by rodríguez merely restated the facts set out in the motion to vacate.the repetition of previous arguments is not sufficient to prevail on a rule e motion.see fdic world,cir motions under rule e must either clearly establish a manifest error of law or must present newly discovered evidence.
