robbin weaver,a slot machine attendant,was injured on a riverboat casino owned by hollywood hollywood.she sued for relief under general maritime jurisdiction,and the jones act.the district court held a bench trial,and awarded weaver under the jones act for pain and suffering,but found that there was no causal connection between the injury and some of weaver physical complaints.the district court also denied maintenance and cure,as well as attorneys fees.weaver appeals the causation ruling,the denial of maintenance and cure,and the denial of attorneys fees.because the record is insufficient to determine whether jurisdiction existed in the district court over weaver suit,we remand for further proceedings.
on may,weaver was employed as a slot machine attendant on the city lights i,a riverboat casino owned by hollywood a movable chest of drawers containing coins and tokens,known as a bank,fell on another employee.these banks are quite heavy,weighing between and pounds,and weaver injured her left wrist while helping to push the bank off the other employee foot.this was the second time in two days that a bank had fallen over,so hollywood apparently knew they were unstable.
weaver filed suit in federal district court under general maritime jurisdiction and the jones act,seeking damages for injuries arising from the incident.the district court held a bench trial.hollywood argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the jones act because a boat whose primary purpose is gaming is not a jones act vessel.in an effort to resolve this issue,the parties orally stipulated that the boat had navigational equipment,engines,a crew,and a raked bow.at the behest of weaver counsel,hollywood also stipulated that the boat cruises on a navigable waterway.moments later,however,in response to a question from the court,hollywood counsel stated that the city lights i can only travel t hree hundred yards,because there is a dam on the one side and a bridge on the other side.the parties also stipulated that the purpose of the boat was gambling.
the district court subsequently rejected hollywood jurisdictional argument,concluding that a gaming ship can be a jones act vessel,and holding that b ecause the defendants have not come forward with any evidence of special circumstances that would defeat weaver jurisdictional showing,jones act jurisdiction existed.weaver,d at.hollywood did not raise the jurisdictional issue on appeal,but during oral argument this court raised the question,and we later ordered supplemental briefing on whether jones act and general maritime jurisdiction existed in light of the parties factual stipulations before the district court.
while hollywood did not appeal the district court holding that it had jurisdiction under the jones act,and the issue of general maritime jurisdiction was not even discussed below,n o court may decide a case without subject matter jurisdiction,and neither the parties nor their lawyers may stipulate to jurisdiction or waive arguments that the court lacks jurisdiction.united states tittjung,cir.indeed,i t is the duty of this court to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.eeoc chicago club,cir citing mitchell maurer.accordingly,if the parties do not do so,then a court must raise the jurisdictional question on its own,as we have done in this case.see tittjung,at see also florio olson,cir considering sua sponte the question of whether admiralty jurisdiction existed.

maritime jurisdiction 
the constitution extends to article iii courts the power to hear all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.const.art.iii.that power was codified at,which provides for original jurisdiction of a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction 
historically,the only question in determining whether admiralty or maritime tort jurisdiction existed was whether the tort occurred on navigable waters.see jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.over time,the test has been refined.now,a party seeking to invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to over a tort claim must satisfy conditions of location and of connection with maritime activity.grubart,at.
there is thus a test for jurisdiction.the locality test reflects the traditional requirement that a tort occur on navigable waters.the requirement of a connection with maritime activity,also known as the nexus test,raises two issues.the court must first determine whether the incident involved has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce,and second,whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.see grubart,at.quoting sisson ruby,d.we begin with the location test.
location on navigable waters.
as the supreme court has explained,a court applying the location test must determine whether the tort occurred on navigable water.see id.the seminal case on navigable rivers is the daniel ball,wall.the daniel ball set forth the following test 
those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact.and they are navigable in fact when they are used,or are susceptible of being used,in their ordinary condition,as highways for commerce,over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.and they constitute navigable waters of the united states within the meaning of the acts of congress,in contradistinction from the navigable waters of the states,when they form in their ordinary condition by themselves,or by uniting with other waters,a continued highway over which commerce is or may be carried on with other states or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water.
id.at.see also grubart,at.citing the daniel ball,at 
the suitability of a river for interstate commerce,navigability in fact,is thus crucial to general maritime jurisdiction.as we have noted previously,t he logic of requiring commercial activity is evident.the purpose behind the grant of admiralty jurisdiction was the protection and promotion of the maritime shipping industry through the development and application,by neutral federal courts,of a uniform and specialized body of federal law.chapman,at quoting adams montana power,cir.see also sisson,at.no purpose is served by application of a uniform body of federal law,on waters devoid of trade and commerce,to regulate the activities and resolve the disputes of pleasure boaters t he burdening of federal courts and the frustrating of the purposes of state tort law would thereby be served.chapman,at quoting adams,at emphasis added.
in this case,the parties stipulated that the fox river on which the riverboat casino was located is navigable weaver claims that this is a factual concession that the river is navigable in fact.accordingly,she urges this court to find that the location test is satisfied.
if this stipulation were all the record had to offer,weaver might be correct.but hollywood contends that the statement that the fox river was navigable was a reference to the river generally,not to the portion of the river where the tort occurred,and cites for support its statement to the district court that the boat was confined within a small portion of the river.weaver has never questioned hollywood testimony that the riverboat casino could only move t hree hundred yards,because there is a dam on the one side and a bridge on the other side.hollywood thus argues that the river can not be navigated at the point where the city lights i was located.
indeed,the fact that a river as a whole is navigable is not dispositive for purposes of maritime law.see,leblanc cleveland,cir dammed river not navigable even though it was capable of supporting interstate commerce downstream from the location at issue.see also three buoys houseboat vacations morts,cir finding a lake with an impassable dam chapman,holding that admiralty jurisdiction did not extend to tort claims on waters which once supported commercial transportation but subsequently only supported recreational activities.the key to determining whether there are navigable waters is the river present navigability where the injury transpired.
for example,the second circuit recently held that there was no admiralty jurisdiction in a case involving an accident between a kayak and a recreational motor boat on the hudson river.see leblanc.in leblanc,the court held that the river was not navigable at the location of the accident because of rapids,dams,and several waterfalls,despite the fact that other portions of the river were navigable and the river as a whole was historically used for commerce.accordingly,the leblanc court determined that there was no admiralty jurisdiction.
the case before us presents a similar factual scenario.based on the stipulations in this case,it is probable that the waters in which the city lights i made its trips are not navigable in fact.the dam and bridge which obstructed the city lights i this river which can not be used as a highway for maritime commerce.a dam and bridge which prevent a riverboat casino from traveling over yards are presumably not susceptible to commercial shipping,and thus fail the test set forth in the daniel ball.
in addition,if the enclosed portion of the fox river at issue here is not navigable upstream or downstream for commercial shipping,it is also impossible to engage in interstate travel from this location.this part of the river,located in aurora,illinois,is entirely intrastate.those cases in which circuit courts have found dammed waterways navigable for jurisdictional purposes are easily distinguished by the fact that the waterway in question formed the border between two states,thereby rendering it capable of supporting interstate commerce despite the existence of artificial dams blocking downstream flow.leblanc,at.because the waterway in this instance is located entirely within the state of illinois,and given the circumstances of this case,we conclude that this small,enclosed,intrastate section of river is unlikely to qualify as a navigable water under general maritime law 
even so,it is theoretically possible that although the river is impassable for the city lights i a boat whose dimensions might differ significantly from the dimensions of other craft,this part of the river could still serve as a continuous highway for other vessels designed for commercial shipping.while the record is silent on this question,outside sources indicate that the fox river is very likely not navigable.a detailed map reveals that the fox river is riddled with dams,both within the confines of the city of aurora and within a short distance upstream and downstream of the city 
despite these apparent obstructions to navigation,it appears from the record that no consideration was given to the possibility that the evidence precluded the river from meeting the legal test for navigability.there was certainly no reference to navigability in the district court opinion.although hollywood argues strenuously in its supplemental brief that the absence of navigable waters precluded jurisdiction,this is the first time this claim has been raised indeed,hollywood counsel only noted that the dam and bridge were impassable in response to a question from the district court about how the city lights i navigates,a question which was not aimed at the location test.
in this context the parties stipulations could be read to concede that the fox river is navigable in fact.in many cases uncontested factual stipulations can resolve a jurisdictional question.workman united parcel service,cir.district courts are not required to the parties stipulations to jurisdictional facts.for example,i f the plaintiff in a diversity suit alleges,and the defendant admits,that the defendant is incorporated in delaware,the district judge is not required to run to moody to see whether it really is a delaware corporation,or to insist on the production of a certified copy of the defendant certificate of incorporation.prizevoits indiana bell telephone,cir.
however,t he rule against obtaining federal jurisdiction by consent would be ineffectual if parties by stipulating to jurisdictional facts could remove them entirely from judicial scrutiny.id.at citations omitted.i f facts brought out in pretrial discovery or at trial,fairly shriek that there is no federal jurisdiction,the district judge must conduct whatever supplementary factual proceedings are necessary to resolve the doubt.kanzelberger kanzelberger,cir.although the district court did not do so here,the appellate court,as noted,must also satisfy itself of federal jurisdiction over the case,and may order a case dismissed when there is no doubt that the district court lacked jurisdiction.see,id.citing bialac harsh,cir dismissing case where factual stipulation supporting diversity of parties was clearly false.
in this case,the record makes it unlikely that jurisdiction existed,and the district court has made no inquiry into the navigability of the fox river where the city lights i was located.a remand is appropriate in these circumstances so the district court may determine whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.see freeman northwest acceptance,cir remanding to district court after trial where plaintiff assertion of diverse parties was unlikely to be true.see also kanzelberger,at citing freeman with approval.
connection with maritime activity.
hollywood also argues that the second requirement for general maritime jurisdiction,a connection with maritime activity,was not met by the facts in the record.first,hollywood argues that weaver injury does not have the required potential effect on maritime commerce.in determining whether this requirement is met,a court must consider the incident giving rise to the claim at an intermediate level of generality.see grubart,at.the court should not consider the particular facts of the case before it,but must instead assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether such an incident is likely to disrupt commercial activity.sisson,at.
weaver claims the appropriate description of the incident would be an injury occurring during rescue efforts on a vessel on navigable waters.hollywood counters that the better description would be an injury to a slot machine attendant on a floating casino that can not move beyond a confined area of water.hollywood thus argues that the events giving rise to weaver injury could not possibly affect maritime commerce.
hollywood description of the incident in this case is too narrow and specific.grubart,at.incident described as damage by a vessel in navigable water to an underwater structure sufficiently indicated potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce sisson,at.incident described as fire on a vessel docked at a marina on navigable waters satisfied potential disruption requirement.weaver description more closely captures the general features of the incident,although she narrows the focus by including the detail that she was involved in rescue efforts.a more appropriate description would be an injury on board a vessel on navigable waters on the condition,of course,that the court finds that the waters are navigable.
the next step is to determine what the potentiality for the disruption of maritime commerce is,based on the general features of the incident.the key is not whether the incident affected maritime commerce,but whether it could do so.in sisson,for example,the supreme court thought it relevant that a fire on board a recreational boat at a marina could impact other ships engaged in maritime commerce,even though the boat involved was not engaged in commerce.
courts have used differing standards to determine the potential for disruption of maritime commerce.compare houseboat vacations,hernandez,cir finding no potential disruption of maritime commerce where houseboat occupants were injured by carbon monoxide fumes which could not harm other boats,and refusing to speculate on possible harms where to
