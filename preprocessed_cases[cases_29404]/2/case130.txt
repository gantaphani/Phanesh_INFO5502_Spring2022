christos kostakis,a greek engineer working on a and oil tanker,the alkyon,falsified log entries to conceal the ship discharge of bilge water into international waters.the coast guard detected this practice on a routine inspection when the ship docked in new york on january.kostakis later pleaded guilty to one count of making a materially false statement on a matter within the jurisdiction of the united states in violation of.at kostakis sentencing,the government urged the court to add a enhancement to his offense level because a substantial part of the scheme occurred outside the united states.see b b.without explicitly deciding whether the enhancement applied,or whether kostakis merited a credit for acceptance of responsibility,the district court allyne ross,judge determined that if it were to adopt the government version of the facts and,thus,apply the enhancement,the court would grant kostakis a downward departure because his conduct was outside the heartland of the conduct envisioned by the enhancement.
the government appeal requires us to decide whether the de novo review standard for departures,imposed by the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of,stat,codified at e b protect act or the act,applies to the review of sentences imposed before the act became effective.principally,because the de novo review standard neither criminalizes conduct that was not criminal when committed nor applies a greater penalty than could have been imposed at that time,we hold that the protect act de novo standard controls the outcome of this appeal.applying the de novo standard of review to the facts the district court assumed to exist,we find that its departure was impermissible.however,we vacate and remand so that the district court may find the facts necessary to determine whether the enhancement should apply,whether kostakis is entitled to a credit against his offense level for acceptance of responsibility,whether the facts as the court finds them justify a departure on the grounds the court originally used,and whether kostakis should receive a departure based on a combination of circumstances,the ground he originally proposed.given the unique procedural posture of this case,we also hold that the section of the protect act that limits the district court on remand to departures that it previously relied on and that this court has specifically approved does not apply retroactively.
background 
after his arrest,kostakis was briefly held in detention and then not allowed to leave the country pending the resolution of the charges against him.on may,kostakis executed a plea agreement with the government.he agreed to plead guilty to a information,which charged 
in or about and between october and january,both dates being approximate and inclusive christos kostakis did knowingly and willfully make and use a false writing and document in a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the united states,to wit,the united states coast guard,knowing the same to contain materially false,fictitious and fraudulent statements and entries in that the defendants stated and represented in the alkyon oil record book for the period october,to january,that all of the alkyon oily bilge water had been processed in its separator,when in fact,as the defendants then and there well knew and believed,the defendants had caused oily bilge water from the alkyon to be discharged directly into the sea without being processed in the ship separator.
in the agreement,the government calculated kostakis adjusted offense level at ten by estimating a base offense level of six pursuant to a,which applies to offenses involving fraud or deceit,adding six levels because a substantial part of the scheme occurred outside the united states pursuant to b,and deducting two levels for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to.the government further agreed that it would take no position concerning where within the guidelines range kostakis sentence should fall.if the ultimate guidelines range was in zone a or b of the sentencing chart,the government agreed to not oppose a motion for a downward departure based on a combination of circumstances,including the defendant required presence in the united states since january.
kostakis pleaded guilty to making a materially false statement in violation of pursuant to the agreement,but claimed that he did not begin to make false statements until the oily water separator broke down in december.kostakis attorney then submitted a sentencing memorandum to the court arguing that because kostakis had only falsified the log book once,the enhancement proposed by the government,which was for the commission of a substantial portion of a scheme outside the united states,did not apply.kostakis attorney also asked for a downward departure based on the allegedly frightening circumstances of his pretrial detention and kostakis prolonged separation from his family in greece.
the government maintained that the enhancement did apply and that kostakis was not entitled to a credit for acceptance of responsibility because he inaccurately minimized the extent of his conduct both when he pleaded guilty and in his sentencing memorandum.kostakis attorney responded by claiming responsibility for any inaccurate diminishment of kostakis responsibility.the attorney explained that he had focused on a single january,false statement because he had discussed that date with a government attorney.he emphasized that kostakis did not claim his conduct was limited to a single statement and that kostakis had admitted to the court that he made false statements.on september,the government informed the court by letter that it believed a hearing was required to sort through the disputed facts in the parties sentencing memoranda.
on september,at the beginning of kostakis sentencing,united states district judge allyne ross announced that she was contemplating a downward departure on a basis implicitly but not explicitly urged by kostakis,that the enhancement literally applied to kostakis conduct but that his circumstances were outside the heartland contemplated by the guidelines.for purposes of considering this departure,the court accepted the accuracy of the government proffer,which summarized evidence suggesting that all of kostakis log entries from april to january were inaccurate and that he had instructed his subordinates to dump oily water directly into the sea.
the court held that,if after a hearing it accepted the government proffer as true,it would find that the enhancement applied.in that event,however,the court indicated that it would grant kostakis a departure based primarily on its conclusion that b b contemplates,although it does not explicitly require,sophisticated conduct.the court first reason for this conclusion was the guideline overall language.section b provides for an addition of two offense levels,or if the offense level otherwise would be under twelve,to twelve,if 
a the defendant relocated,or participated in relocating,a fraudulent scheme to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement or regulatory officials b a substantial part of a fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the united states or c the offense otherwise involved sophisticated means 
b emphasis added.the court reasoned that the use of the word otherwise in clause c indicates that the sentencing commission assumed that a scheme described in clause a or clause b would most often be sophisticated.the district court next turned to the application note to the guidelines captioned,sophisticated means enhancement under subsection b,and noted 
t hat the title of the application note referring to all three bases for the subsection b,including the enhancement under part b for crimes committed substantially extraterritorially,describes that enhancement under part b as one for sophisticated means reinforces the inference that in the commission view,all three categories of offenses set forth in the subsection apply to schemes committed by sophisticated means.
the court also relied on the background section for the guidelines,which states that it
