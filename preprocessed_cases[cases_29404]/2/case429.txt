on january,the california air resources board began enforcing state regulations,the marine vessel rules,limiting emissions from the auxiliary diesel engines of vessels within miles of california coast.the pacific merchant shipping association,a group of companies that own or operate vessels subject to the marine vessel rules,filed suit to enjoin their enforcement because,they argue,the rules are by the clean air act,and the submerged lands act.we affirm the district court ruling that the marine vessel rules are preempted by the clean air act and we reinstate that court injunction against enforcement of the marine vessel rules.
the clean air act amendments of created a scheme for the regulation of emissions from nonroad sources such as lawnmowers,bulldozers,locomotives,and marine vessels.see engine mfrs.ass envtl.prot.agency,ema.the amendments governing emissions from nonroad sources reflect the basic structure of the clean air act,which makes the states and the federal government partners in the struggle against air pollution,but sought to avoid an anarchic patchwork of federal and state regulatory programs.ema,at,quotation omitted.the amendments granted the federal government the authority to promulgate regulations containing standards applicable to emissions from new nonroad engines and new nonroad vehicles.clean air act a,a on the other hand,congress expressly preempted state regulation of emissions from new engines used in construction and farm equipment,new engines smaller than horsepower,and new locomotive engines.clean air act e,e 
for other nonroad engines and vehicles,e of the clean air act allows california to seek authorization from the epa to adopt standards and other requirements relating to the control of emissions.id.e a section e provides in pertinent part 
in the case of any nonroad vehicles or engines other than those referred to in subparagraph a or b of paragraph,the administrator shall,after notice and opportunity for public hearing,authorize california to adopt and enforce standards and other requirements relating to the control of emissions from such vehicles or engines if california determines that california standards will be,in the aggregate,at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards.
id.e emphasis added.other states can adopt regulations identical to california regulations approved by the epa.id.e b.the board has neither sought nor obtained e authorization from the epa for the marine vessel rules.
nonetheless,on january,the california air resources board began enforcing the marine vessel rules it promulgated regarding the emission of particulate matter pm,nitrogen oxide nox,and sulfur oxide sox from vessels on all waters within nautical miles of the california coast.regs.tit,a,b the marine vessel rules apply to the emissions of auxiliary diesel engines,which are engines designed primarily to provide power for uses other than and used for electricity needs.id.d.such engines are typically powered by residual fuel,commonly called bunker fuel in the maritime industry,which has an average sulfur content of percent by weight.the rules provide,in pertinent part 
e requirements.
emission limits.
except as provided in subsections c,g and h,no person subject to this section shall operate any auxiliary diesel engine,while the vessel is operating in any of the regulated california waters,which emits levels of diesel pm,nox,or sox in exceedance of the emission rates of those pollutants that would result had the engine used the following fuels specified fuels omitted.
id.e emphasis added in sum,the emissions of any auxiliary diesel engine must not exceed the emission rates that would result had the engine used the specified fuels with a sulfur content of no more than percent by weight.id.
compliance with the marine vessel rules is presumed where a vessel uses the specified fuels.id.e c.however,a vessel owner may also comply by alternative emission control strategies that result in emissions that are no greater than the emissions that would have occurred using the specified fuels.id.g a.the marine vessel rules exempt,among others,vessels traversing the regulated waters but not entering or stopping at a port in california and vessels owned or operated by a local,state,federal or foreign government.id.c,c.
the pacific merchant shipping association pmsa is a mutual benefit corporation organized to support the legislative,legal,and administrative interests of its members,who are companies that own or operate vessels subject to the marine vessel rules.pmsa filed suit against the board in district court seeking to enjoin california from enforcing the marine vessel rules.pmsa argued that the marine vessel rules are invalid because the board failed to obtain the epa authorization required by the clean air act prior to enforcing the marine vessel rules,and the submerged lands act preempts application of the marine vessel rules outside of california boundary.
the district court granted pmsa motion for summary judgment on pmsa clean air act claim and did not rule on the submerged lands act claim.the district court held that the marine vessel rules are preempted by e of the clean air act because the regulations are emission standards and not requirements that merely regulate how vehicles may be used.the district court found the regulations to be emissions standards b ecause the regulations set numerical requirements for the reduction of emissions relating to particular emissions rather than a fleet as a whole.pac.merch.shipping ass cackette,no,order granting summary judgment.
the board and intervening parties natural resources defense council,coalition for clean air,south coast air quality management district,and the city of long beach collectively intervenors appeal the district court decision.we previously stayed the district court order enjoining enforcement pending appeal.pac.merch.shipping ass goldstene,cir.
ii.analysis 
we have jurisdiction to review the district court final order granting summary judgment.a district court order granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see padfield aig life ins,cir.summary judgment is proper if the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,discloses that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also universal health,thompson,cir.
the parties agree that the vessels regulated by the marine vessel rules are nonroad vehicles for purposes of clean air act.marine vessels are not expressly preempted under clean air act e.e.for nonroad engines and vehicles not covered by e,clean air act e creates a sphere of implied preemption surrounding those regulations for which california must obtain authorization.see ema,at.the issue in dispute here is whether the scope of the implied preemption of e includes the marine vessel rules.we hold it does.
the board contends that since the marine vessel rules apply only to engines,the rules are not preempted if e only applies to new engines.in,the circuit directly addressed this issue when it considered whether the epa interpreted the implied of e to apply only to new entitled to deference under chevron,nrdc,d.ema,at.after an exhaustive review of the text and legislative history,the circuit held that the implied preemption of e applies to both new and engines.id.at.
the district court adopted the holding of the ema majority that the implied preemption of e applies both to new and engines.so do we,because it is sound and because neither the epa nor congress has challenged the ema holding in the nearly twelve years since it was decided.thus,we join the circuit and hold that the implied preemption of e applies to any nonroad vehicles or engines,including new and sources.
a.the marine vessel rules are emission standards 
section e a of the clean air act requires california to obtain epa authorization in order to adopt standards and other requirements relating to the control of emissions from vehicles or engines.e a.the key issue in this case is whether the marine vessel rules constitute standards relating to the control of emissions fro
