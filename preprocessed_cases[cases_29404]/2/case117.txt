background 
procedural background 
on march,plaintiffs filed a civil action in the court of common pleas for franklin county,ohio,over the alleged nonpayment of contracts entered into between plaintiffs and defendants in connection with the search for the shipwreck central america in the.plaintiffs are individuals who contracted to participate in the central america search and recovery efforts and a company that supplied side scan sonar equipment to one of the defendant corporations.defendants are individuals who were,or allegedly were,parties to certain contracts or are,or were,directors or officers of one of the defendant corporations,and several corporations that were allegedly responsible for,and involved in,the search and recovery operation,and the alleged successors and of those companies.on april,defendants removed the suit to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio on the ground that the dispute was over a maritime contract and thus was governed by federal law.on july,plaintiffs filed this civil action in the southern district of new york swain,alleging that each plaintiff had a maritime claim against the defendants.plaintiffs immediately obtained an ex parte order for the issuance of a writ of attachment pursuant to rule b of the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims supplemental rules,supp.rule on october,the defendants moved,through an order to show cause,to vacate the writ and the attachment achieved under the writ,to dismiss the complaint,and for attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with the application.the district court,pursuant to rule e of the supplemental rules,heard arguments on the matter and received briefs and evidentiary submissions,supp.rule e f.on january,the district court issued its decision,which vacated the attachment as to the individual defendants other than thomas thompson,and denied vacatur as to defendants ezra,rlp,and cxllc,but vacated the attachments as to the remaining corporate defendants,and denied the defendants board members request for an award of compensation,costs,and fees for the wrongful attachment.defendants timely filed their notice of appeal,and plaintiffs the district court decision to vacate certain attachments.
plaintiffs assisted defendant thompson,at various times between and,in the location and recovery of the central america,a united states mail steamship that sank off the coast of south carolina in.as part of the compensation offered to plaintiffs for their assistance on the project,plaintiffs and thompson entered into and agreements that gave plaintiffs rights to a fraction of a percentage of the total recovery of the,the gross value of gold,silver,and valuable artifacts recovered from the shipwreck.the individual plaintiffs were members of defendant thompson team that first imaged the central america in,confirmed that the wreck was in fact the central america in,and recovered the gold,silver,and other artifacts from the ship.additionally,plaintiffs allege that one of the plaintiffs,international deep sea survey,idss,leased a side sonar to one of the defendants,recovery limited partnership rlp,in.as part of the agreement between idss and rlp,idss also agreed to be compensated,in part,based on the percentage of the net recovery of the operation.
in may,the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia ordered the arrest of the ship,took constructive possession of the ship and everything on it,and entered an order requiring any person asserting an interest in the central america to file a claim before the date.at present,all of the litigation concerning the central america in the eastern district of virginia has been completed defendants have obtained their portion of the treasure and have sold it.throughout this process,defendants wrote letters to plaintiffs assuring them that plaintiffs would receive their share of the total recovery after defendants completed the process of selling the treasure.however,as time passed,plaintiffs realized that the sale of the treasure had,in fact,been completed,and that nonetheless defendants still had not compensated plaintiffs.the lawsuit in the court of common pleas in ohio followed.
despite the fact that gold and valuables were certainly recovered from the central america,it is undisputed that defendants have never provided plaintiffs with any percentage of the total recovery.plaintiffs allege that defendants have therefore violated the contracts between plaintiffs and defendants and that plaintiffs are owed a portion of the total recovery.defendants,on the other hand,argue that,while gold and valuables were certainly found on the ship,the recovery efforts did not actually provide a return to the initial investors,much less a profit,and that defendants therefore have not violated their contract with plaintiffs.furthermore,defendants argue that plaintiffs erred in failing to bring their claims before the eastern district of virginia and that the plaintiffs are bound by the prior orders and decrees of the district court in virginia.
discussion 
defendants appeal raises numerous issues.first,defendants argue that the contracts between defendants and plaintiffs are not maritime contracts,and therefore federal jurisdiction does not apply,and prejudgement attachment is not proper in new york,given that the primary proceeding is pending in ohio.second,assuming the contracts are maritime contracts,defendants argue that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the requirements of notice and personal service for rule b attachments.third,again assuming the contracts are maritime contracts,defendants argue that the ex parte maritime attachments of certain defendants assets were improper in view of the equitable circumstances of the case.fourth,defendants argue that the district court erred in refusing to hold a hearing,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,to determine whether plaintiffs should be sanctioned for filing the ex parte attachment order.fifth,on,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in vacating the attachments against all defendants except thompson,ezra,rlp and cxllc.
we review a district court decision to vacate a maritime attachment for abuse of discretion however,we review de novo any legal determinations on which this discretion rests.aqua stoli shipping gardner smith pty,cir.
i.the contracts are maritime contracts 
maritime attachment is a prejudgement mechanism used by parties in admiralty cases to secure jurisdiction over an absent party and to obtain security for potential judgment where the absent party assets are transitory.id.at.maritime attachment is a unique aspect of admiralty jurisprudence that has deep historic and constitutional roots.id.at.
maritime attachments arose because it is frequently,but not always,more difficult to find property of parties to a maritime dispute than of parties to a traditional civil action.maritime parties are peripatetic,and their assets are often transitory.thus,the traditional policy underlying maritime attachment has been to permit the attachments of assets wherever they can be found and not to require the plaintiff to scour the globe to find a proper forum for suit or property of the defendant sufficient to satisfy a judgment.
id.at citations omitted.however,because prejudgement attachment is such a severe remedy,it is important to first determine whether a contract is,in fact,a maritime contract warranting maritime attachment.we review de novo the district court conclusion that the contracts at issue are maritime contracts.id.at.
because the case law regarding the distinction between maritime and contracts was somewhat confused,the supreme court clarified,in norfolk southern railway company james kirby pty,d,the appropriate approach for making such a determination.
to ascertain whether a contract is a maritime one,we can not look to whether a ship or other vessel was involved in the dispute,as we would in a putative maritime tort case.nor can we simply look to the place of the contract formation or performance.instead,the answer depends upon the nature and character of the contract,and the true criterion is whether it has reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.
norfolk ry,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in accord with the supreme court ruling in this case,we recently amended our jurisprudence on maritime contracts,recognizing that the proper inquiry is whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce,rather than whether the components are properly characterized as more than incidental or merely incidental to the contract.folksamerica reinsurance clean water of,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
here,the contracts reference maritime service or maritime transactions.the contracts concern agreements,whereby the hired workers promised not to work on the waters off the shore of the carolinas in exchange for a portion of the proceeds from a potential recovery effort of a shipwreck in the ocean agreements,whereby the hired workers promised not to discuss the work they were doing on a ship in the atlantic ocean and the lease of equipment for use in the search for the central america in the atlantic ocean.while the defendants may be correct in stating that these are just standard,nondisclosure,and lease contract agreements,they are incorrect in arguing that the contracts are therefore not maritime contracts.as the supreme court explained,a conceptual analysis is appropriate.see norfolk ry,at.we must focus our inquiry on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce,id.at,and we must look to the nature and character of the contract,id.at.here,the nature and character of these and agreements,as well as the agreement to provide technical equipment in exchange for a percentage of the recovery,are clearly salty.id.at.as the district court correctly found,the contracts at issue here were by their terms entered into in connection with maritime commercial venture and are therefore maritime in nature thus,the court has jurisdiction of the claims brought thereunder pursuant to.williamson recovery,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
defendants also argue that the provision in the contracts,selecting ohio law,governs the contracts such that they can not be analyzed under maritime law defendants misapprehend the state of the law.as the supreme court explained,the first step of the analysis is determining whether something is a maritime contract then,once a contract has been deemed a maritime contract,the next step is determining whether a specific state laws should be used to supplement any area of contract law for which federal common law does not provide.see norfolk ry,at.emphasis added.the fact that a provision exists in a contract does not,by itself,remove the contract from the scope of maritime law.we therefore affirm the district court determination that the contracts at issue here are maritime contracts and that the dispute is properly in federal court.
ii.the plaintiffs met the notice and service requirements necessary for a rule b attachment 
defendants next argue that even if the contracts are maritime contracts,and prejudgement attachment in new york is theoretically appropriate,the plaintiffs here failed to meet the requirements for notice and service necessary under rule b.we review de novo the district court conclusion that the plaintiffs complied with the requirements of rule see aqua stoli,at.
because admiralty and maritime proceedings are such a unique aspect of united states law,the supreme court has been responsible for promulgating uniform rules to govern such proceedings.id.at.since these rules were first established in,they have been revised and amended numerous times.id.the process by which a party may attach another party assets is currently governed by rule if a defendant is not found within the district a verified complaint may contain a prayer for process to attach the defendant tangible or intangible personal to the amount sued the hands of garnishees named in the process,supp.rule b a.then,t he court must review the complaint and affidavit and,if the conditions of this rule b appear to exist,enter an order so stating and authorizing process of attachment and garnishment.the clerk may issue supplemental process enforcing the court order upon application without further court order.rule b b.the order of attachment may be requested and granted ex parte,though notice of the attachment to the defendant via appropriate service is required.aqua stoli,at internal citations omitted.
defendants argue that the order and writs of attachment should be vacated because plaintiffs failed to give them prompt notice of the attachment as required by rule however,as plaintiffs explain in their brief,they made the defendants aware of all the attachments as soon as they became aware of them.the district court further found that the record demonstrates that notice of the actual attachment achieved pursuant to the writ has been given promptly upon plaintiffs becoming aware of the attachment of particular assets.this is sufficient compliance with the notice requirement of supplemental rule williamson,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.because we agree with the district court that plaintiffs provided prompt notice to the defendants,and therefore met the requirements of rule b,we affirm the decision of the district court.
iii.the attachments here are not subject to vacatur for equitable reasons under aqua stoli shipping 
defendants argue that,assuming the contract is a maritime contract and that service and notice were proper,the attachments should be vacated for equitable reasons.we review a district court decision whether to vacate a maritime attachment order for abuse of discretion.aqua stoli,at.
after the requirements of rule b have been met,and attachment has occurred,defendants have the opportunity under rule e f to contest the attachment of their property before the district court,supp.rule e f aqua stoli,at.despite our general policy of allowing maritime attachments,we have nonetheless found that,even when a plaintiff meets the procedural requirements for obtaining a maritime attachment,the district court may nonetheless vacate such an attachment for equitable reasons.rule e f is designed to satisfy the constitutional requirement of due process by guaranteeing to the property owner a prompt hearing at which the property owner can attack the complaint,the arrest,the security demanded,or any other alleged deficiency in the proceedings,supp.e f,adviso
