discussion 
background 
international,an agent for philip morris,hired oceanbridge shipping international,oceanbridge,a common carrier nvocc,to transport ten containers holding cigarettes from long beach,california to tokyo,japan.oceanbridge then contracted with american,another nvocc,to ship the containers from long beach to tokyo.american issued a bill of lading to oceanbridge identifying oceanbridge as the and okamoto freighters okamoto as the consignee.the particulars furnished by shipper in the bill of lading listed the cargo as ten containers holding cases cigarettes.
american,in turn,contracted with laufer,yet another nvocc,to transport the containers to japan.laufer provided american with a booking report confirming the information provided to laufer by american and naming american as the.laufer then issued a bill of lading to american designating american as the exporter,and describing the cargo as cigarettes cigars the bill of lading.
finally,on june,laufer booked a shipment of the ten containers of cargo with yang ming,to be carried to tokyo from long beach aboard the seto bridge.yang ming issued a bill of lading to laufer the yang bill of lading evidencing the contract of carriage and describing the goods as stc cartons of cigars cigarettes.the yang bill of lading labels laufer as the shipper and okamoto as the consignee.section of the bill of lading provides that the merchant expressly defined as including the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss,damage,expenses,liability,penalties and fines arising or resulting from a misdescription of the cargo.the bill of lading expressly incorporated by reference the terms of yang ming tariff.a tariff is a public document filed by the carrier and published by the federal maritime commission letting shippers know what services a carrier will furnish under certain conditions and at what price.one such service contemplated by yang ming tariff was the storage of the shipper cargo at the point of destination in return for a predetermined fee called demurrage.
the ten containers were loaded on board the seto bridge in long beach on june,and arrived in tokyo on july.upon their arrival in japan,four of the ten containers were transported by shipping company to a nearby warehouse where it was discovered that the containers held used tires instead of cigars and cigarettes.immediately returned the containers to yang ming tokyo container yard.japanese customs officials allegedly informed yang ming that the remaining containers also held old tires.okamoto subsequently notified yang ming that it was rejecting the entire shipment and abandoning the containers in yang ming tokyo container yard.
yang ming promptly notified laufer that the containers had been rejected by and proposed that laufer coordinate the return of the containers to long beach through okamoto.on july,yang ming notified laufer that free time had expired on the ten containers on july,and that demurrage charges were being incurred pursuant to yang ming tariff.
anticipating that laufer would abandon the cargo,yang ming began seeking potential buyers of the tires in tokyo.yang ming discovered that the tires had no commercial value in japan and that it would cost to dispose of the tires in that country.as yang ming expected,laufer sent yang ming a written notice of its abandonment of the containers on july.
unwilling to pay the disposal fee in japan,yang ming began searching in several countries for potential buyers of the tires.yang ming located an individual in hong kong who was willing to dispose of the tires free of charge if yang ming would absorb all costs arising from the shipment of the containers from japan to hong kong.yang ming agreed and used its own vessels to transport the tires to hong kong.
on november,yang ming filed a complaint against oceanbridge,laufer and okamoto,alleging breach of contract,violation of the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,negligence,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.
laufer answered the complaint,filed a for indemnity against oceanbridge and okamoto,and filed a complaint against american in favor of yang ming pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.oceanbridge filed its own complaint against seeking indemnification and declaratory relief,and an amended complaint adding philip morris,and british american tobacco as defendants.american filed a against oceanbridge,and philip morris for intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,indemnification,contribution,and declaratory relief.
on september,okamoto filed a motion to dismiss yang ming complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction,which was granted.pursuant to stipulation by the parties,the district court dismissed without prejudice defendant philip morris from the oceanbridge complaint.
on january,yang ming moved for summary judgment on its claims for breach of contract and violation of cogsa against oceanbridge and laufer.laufer responded by moving for summary judgment against yang ming.american then brought motions for summary judgment against both yang ming and laufer.
on february,the district court denied yang ming motion for summary judgment against laufer and oceanbridge and granted american motions for summary judgment against laufer and yang ming.in march of,the district court denied oceanbridge motion for summary judgment against laufer and granted in part and denied in part oceanbridge motion for partial summary judgment against yang ming.after being presented with additional evidence in may of,the court granted yang ming motion for summary judgment against laufer and oceanbridge.laufer timely appeals the district court awards of summary judgment to yang ming and american.
yang ming motion for summary judgment against laufer 
to recover indemnity from laufer pursuant to section of the yang bill of lading,yang ming must demonstrate that laufer breached its warranty as to the accuracy of the particulars,laufer has no defenses to yang ming claim for indemnity,and yang ming damages are reasonable under the circumstances.see atlantic overseas feder.the district court concluded that yang ming had satisfied all three requirements and therefore was entitled to summary judgment in the amount of.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment.balint carson city,cir en banc.
breach of warranty 
in addressing laufer breach of warranty claim,the district court held that laufer,as the shipper of the containers,warranted the description of the contents of the containers both implicitly under cogsa and expressly in section of the yang bill of lading.
on appeal,laufer challenges the district court holding that cogsa requires a shipper to indemnify a carrier for the misdescription of cargo.we need not address this claim,however,because laufer expressly concedes in its opening brief that the district court alternative section of the yang bill of lading included a shipper warranty of the description of the correct.
laufer asserts that even if the bill of lading required that it provide a correct description of the cargo,there was insufficient evidence proving that it failed to do so.laufer does not contest the fact that it informed yang ming that the ten sealed containers were said to contain cigarettes and cigars.rather,laufer alleges that there was insufficient proof that the ten containers held tires instead of cigars and cigarettes.we disagree.
the record is replete with documentary evidence demonstrating that the ten containers were filled with old tires rather than cigarettes.one conclusive piece of unrefuted evidence is a letter written by laufer itself informing yang ming that it had investigated the contents of the containers after their arrival in japan and had concluded that they did not contain cigarettes 
recently,yang ming advised that the consignee of the shipments four containers and returned them for back to the after the japanese consignee found that the containers were stuffed with junk tires instead of cigarettes as described in the bill of lading issued by the carrier.alarmed by this information,we have investigated and found that all the containers are likely to have the same worthless cargo and the original supplier of these containers has disappeared.
while laufer notes correctly that this letter was not expressly relied upon by the district court in concluding that the containers held tires,we may affirm the district court decision based on any reason finding support in the record.welch fritz,cir.laufer points to no evidence suggesting that the containers held anything other than used tires.we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that laufer breached the warranty of particulars in section of the bill of lading.
aside from laufer claim that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to the actual contents of the ten containers,laufer raises no defenses in this appeal.
after concluding that laufer breached its warranty as to the accuracy of the particulars,the district court calculated the amount of damages flowing from the breach to be.this figure represents demurrage charges incurred pursuant to yang ming tariff shifting charges in tokyo customs clearance charges in tokyo yang ming ocean freight charges from tokyo to hong kong and terminal handling charges in hong kong.laufer challenges this award on three grounds.first,laufer contends that the district court misinterpreted the indemnity provision in section,thus causing the court to miscalculate the amount of damages recoverable by yang ming.second,laufer argues that the district court erred in allowing yang ming to recover demurrage without first proving it suffered actual loss.third,laufer asserts that yang ming had the opportunity to dispose of the tires for,and therefore can not recover damages beyond that amount.each claim is addressed in turn below.
calculating damages 
the crux of laufer first challenge to the district court damages award is that the district court erroneously interpreted the indemnity provision in the yang bill of lading as requiring laufer to compensate yang ming for expenses other than payments made by yang ming to third parties.laufer argument is unavailing.
to resolve laufer claim we must interpret the word indemnify as it is used in section of the yang bill of lading.since the bill of lading is the contract of carriage between shipper and carrier,familiar principles of contract interpretation govern its construction.henley drilling mcgee,cir internal citations omitted.contract terms are to be given their ordinary meaning,and w henever possible,the plain language of the contract should be considered first.klamath water users prot.ass patterson,cir.
we have traditionally defined liberally the word indemnify.see atari ernst whinney,cir.in atari,we reviewed a district court conclusion that a plaintiff could not seek indemnification from the defendant when there was no claim against the plaintiff.the district court based this conclusion on the premise that u nder the ordinary and usual meaning of the word indemnify as used in indemnity contracts,the indemnitor agrees to protect the indemnitee against claims of third parties alien to the contract.id.at.
we rejected this holding by the district court,stating that an indemnitor obligation to indemnify an indemnitee extends beyond the mere reimbursement of third party claims.id.t he district court was wrong to assume that the word indemnify necessarily carries with it the baggage of the clauses in which it most frequently appears.we based our holding on the definition of indemnify provided by black law dictionary,which reads 
to restore the victim of a loss,in whole or in part,by payment,repair,or replacement.to save harmless to secure against loss or damage to give security for the reimbursement of a person in case of an anticipated loss falling upon him.to make good to compensate to make reimbursement to one of a loss already incurred by him.
id.at emphasis added quoting black law dictionary ed.thus,we concluded that t he plain,unambiguous meaning of indemnify is not to compensate for losses caused by third parties,but merely to compensate.id.
our holding in atari forecloses laufer argument that it can only be forced to indemnify yang ming for payments made to third parties.under the express terms of section,yang ming can recover all loss,damage,expenses,liability,penalties and fines it incurred as a result of laufer misdescription of the goods,irrespective of whether such damages represent payments made by yang ming to third parties.
having clarified the term indemnify as it is used in section,we must now calculate the total amount of damages recoverable by yang ming from laufer under the bill of lading as a damages recoverable by yang ming pursuant to both section and the tariff which is expressly incorporated into the bill of lading.to compute this figure,we must determine which of yang ming actions entitle it to compensation from laufer,which provisions of the bill of lading entitle yang ming to compensation for those actions,and the amount of compensation yang ming can recover for those actions.
the first set of actions for which yang ming seeks compensation from laufer is yang ming storage of the ten containers in its tokyo holding facility.while it is clear that yang ming can recover compensation for such storage,the difficult question is whether yang ming recovery is limited to the type of damages listed in section,actual loss resulting from laufer misdescription of the whether yang ming can recover the more lucrative demurrage charges established by the tariff.we believe that the answer to this question varies in relation to the dates during which yang ming held the cargo.we have divided the total time during which yang ming held the cargo into three separate periods,each of which represents a different rate of compensation recoverable by yang ming under different provisions of the bill of lading.
the first relevant time period is from july,the date the cargo arrived in japan,until july.yang ming concedes that it is not entitled to recover any compensation from laufer for storing the containers between these dates.this period of time represents what is commonly referred to in the shipping industry as free time,during which the shipper must hold the cargo for the receiver free of charge.benedict on admiralty,ed.
the next relevant period of storage was from july,the date demurrage charges began to run on the cargo,until july,the date laufer abandoned the cargo.the amount of compensation owed to yang ming by laufer during this time is established by yang ming tariff.specifically,the tariff provides that for every day the cargo remains unclaimed after the expiration of free time,laufer will be assessed a predetermined amount of demurrage.the amount of demurrage recoverable by yang ming is simple yang ming is expressly prohibited by statute from charging demurrage rates greater or less than the demurrage rates listed in its tariff.a.b serv.murrey son,cir.laufer familiarity with,and consent to,the demurrage provision in yang ming tariff is conclusively presumed.see,at.yang ming therefore is entitled to recover demurrage at the rate specified in its tariff for its storage of the containers between july and july 
the last relevant time period extends from july,the day after laufer abandoned the cargo,until the date the containers were removed from the storage facility to be shipped to hong kong.after laufer abandoned the cargo,yang ming was no longer stori
