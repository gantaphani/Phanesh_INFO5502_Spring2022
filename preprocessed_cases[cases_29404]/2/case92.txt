plaintiff appellant richard messier,a seaman,contracted lymphoma and sued his former employer,defendant appellee bouchard transportation,bouchard,seeking maintenance and cure undisputed evidence establishes that messier had lymphoma during his maritime service.but it is also undisputed the disease did not present any symptoms at all until after his service.after concluding messier lymphoma did not manifest itself during his service,the district court mcmahon,granted summary judgment for bouchard.
the first presentation of symptoms,however,is not the touchstone for maintenance and cure.if a seaman injury or illness occurs during his service,he is entitled to maintenance and cure regardless of when he starts to show symptoms.exercising jurisdiction under,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for bouchard and remand the case with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for messier.
background 
this case facts are not materially in dispute messier,a career tugboat seaman,was hired by bouchard in march.in september,he was assigned to work on a bouchard vessel called the tug evening mist.he served at least two hitches between september and october.messier claims that on the evening of october,while in service,he fell climbing down a ladder,and suffered back pain.he sought medical care,and was diagnosed with a probable back sprain.
messier back injury was apparently minor,and the pain associated with it quickly subsided.but the resulting medical examinations revealed a much more serious problem.during the course of messier examination,his doctor had ordered routine blood tests,which showed an elevated level of creatinine in messier blood.for a week messier creatinine levels rose dramatically,and his doctor sent him to the emergency room on november,to be treated for renal failure.the symptoms subsided and messier was released,but doctors performed more tests,trying to discover why his kidneys had failed.in late december,two months after his service on the evening mist ended,messier was diagnosed with lymphoma.he underwent treatment,and did not return to work until october.
messier filed this complaint in federal district court in november,asserting claims for negligence under the jones act,and for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure under general maritime law.the parties for summary judgment on maintenance and cure after messier dropped his other claims.although the district court concluded that,for the purposes of summary judgment,messier lymphoma existed while he was employed on the evening mist,it held that messier was not entitled to maintenance and cure as a matter of law because his lymphoma did not manifest itself,did not present symptoms,while messier was in service of the ship.accordingly,the district court granted bouchard motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case 
messier timely appeals.

maintenance and cure 
a claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel owner obligation to provide food,lodging,and medical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.lewis lewis clark marine.the doctrine entitles an injured seaman to three district remedies maintenance,cure,and wages.see rodriguez alvarez bahama cruise line,f d,cir.maintenance compensates the injured seaman for food and lodging expenses during his medical treatment.id.at.cure refers to the reasonable medical expenses incurred in the treatment of the seaman condition.see reardon cal.tanker,cir.and lost wages are provided in addition to maintenance,on the rationale that maintenance compensates the injured seaman for food and lodging,which the seaman otherwise receives free while on the ship.rodriguez alvarez,at.
the obligation to provide maintenance and cure payments,however,does not furnish the seaman with a source of lifetime or disability income.robert force,federal judicial center,admiralty and maritime law.a seaman is entitled to maintenance and cure only until he reaches maximum medical recovery.vaughan atkinson.put another way,maintenance and cure continues until such time as the incapacity is declared to be permanent.vella ford motor,quotation marks omitted.however,where a seaman has reached the point of maximum medical cure and maintenance and cure payments have been discontinued,the seaman may nonetheless reinstitute a demand for maintenance and cure where subsequent new curative medical treatments become available.force,supra,at see also farrell united states.
maintenance and cure is an ancient duty,calmar steamship taylor,which traces its origin to medieval sea codes,and is undoubtedly of earlier origin,thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed.see generally john shields,seamen rights to recover maintenance and cure benefits,tul,describing how the doctrine was codified as early as in the black book of the admiralty.the duty arises from the contract of employment and does not rest upon negligence or culpability on the part of the owner or master.taylor,at.in that respect,maintenance and cure has been called a kind of nonstatutory workmen compensation.weiss cent.of,cir.
the analogy to workers compensation,however,can be misleading,because maintenance and cure is a far more expansive remedy.first,although it is limited to the seaman who becomes ill or is injured while in the service of the ship,vella,at emphasis added,it is not restricted to those cases where the seaman employment is the cause of the injury or illness,taylor,at.t he obligation can arise out of a medical condition such as a heart problem,a prior illness that recurs during the seaman employment,or an injury suffered on shore.schoenbaum,supra,at.second,the doctrine is so broad that negligence or acts short of culpable misconduct on the seaman part will not relieve the shipowner of the responsibility.vella,at alterations and quotation marks omitted.third,the doctrine may apply even if a seaman is injured or falls ill for example,while on shore leave,see warren united states,so long as the seamen is in the service of the ship,which means he is generally answerable to its call to duty rather than actually in performance of routine tasks or specific orders.farrell,at quotation marks omitted.fourth,a seaman may be entitled to maintenance and cure even for a preexisting medical condition that recurs or becomes aggravated during his service.see sammon cent.gulf,cir compare brahms moore mccormack lines,denying maintenance and cure when seaman submitted evidence showing his injury preexisted his service and recurred afterward,but did not submit any evidence showing that illness existed during his service.
the policy underlying a broad maintenance and cure doctrine is the almost paternalistic duty admiralty law imposes on a shipowner toward the crew.garay carnival cruise line,cir.as justice story famously explained 
seamen are by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from change of climate,exposure to perils,and exhausting labour sic.they are generally poor and friendless,and acquire habits of gross indulgence,carelessness,and improvidence.if some provision be not made for them in sickness at the expense of the ship,they must often in foreign ports suffer the accumulated evils of disease,and poverty,and sometimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment.their common earnings in many instances are wholly inadequate to provide for the expenses of sickness and if liable to be so applied,the great motives for good behaviour sic might be ordinarily taken away by pledging their future as well as past wages for the redemption of the debt on the other hand,if these expenses are a charge upon the ship,the interest of the owner will be immediately connected with that of the seamen.the master will watch over their health with vigilance and fidelity.he will take the best methods,as well to prevent diseases,as to ensure a speedy recovery from them.he will never be tempted to abandon the sick to their forlorn fate but his duty,combining with the interest of his owner,will lead him to succor their distress,and shed a cheering kindness over the anxious hours of suffering and despondency.
harden gordon,cas.the supreme court relied on justice story classic passage more than a hundred years later to lay out the three primary justifications for maintenance and cure t he protection of seamen,the inducement to masters and owners to protect the safety and health of seamen while in service,and the maintenance of a merchant marine for the commercial service and maritime defense of the nation by inducing sea men to accept employment in an arduous and perilous service.taylor,at.
no matter how the doctrine is formulated,one thing is clear the duty of maintenance and cure exists for the benefit of seamen.accordingly,the supreme court instructs us to be liberal in interpreting this duty for the benefit and protection of seamen who are the admiralty courts wards.vaughan,at quotation marks omitted.a shipowner liability for maintenance and cure is among the most pervasive of all,and is not to be defeated by restrictive distinctions nor narrowly confined.id.at quotation marks omitted.thus,w hen there are ambiguities or doubts,they are resolved in favor of the seaman.see also farrell,at it has been the merit of the seaman right to maintenance and cure that it is so inclusive as to be relatively simple,and can be understood and administered without technical considerations.it has few exceptions or conditions to stir contentions,cause delays,and invite litigations.
manifestation of an asymptomatic illness 
keeping the foregoing principles in mind,this case major question is easy to frame whether a seaman may obtain maintenance and cure for an injury that occurs during his service of the ship,but does not present symptoms until his service is over.and though this question appears to be a matter of first impression among the federal appeals courts,its answer is straightforward.the only evidence submitted by either party establishes that messier illness occurred during his service.he therefore is entitled to maintenance and cure.the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
the occurrence rule 
the rule of maintenance and cure is simple and broad a seaman is entitled to maintenance and cure for any injury or illness that occurs or becomes aggravated while he is serving the ship.vaughan,at maintenance and cure is designed to provide a seaman with food and lodging when he becomes sick or injured in the ship service.emphasis added rodriguez alvarez,at a seaman is entitled to look to his ship operator for maintenance and cure following any injury incurred while in the ship operator employ.emphasis added.it does not matter whether he is injured because of his own negligence.vella,at.it does not matter whether the injury or illness was related to the seaman employment.taylor,at.it does not even matter,absent active concealment,if the illness or injury is merely an aggravation or recurrence of a preexisting condition.see sammon,at.this rule does not permit an exception for asymptomatic diseases so long as the illness was present during the seaman service,he is entitled to maintenance and cure.for the sake of convenience,we will call this rule the occurrence rule.
asymptomatic injuries have never been considered by any federal appeals court.the lone district court to have considered the matter applied the occurrence rule.in leonard united states in re petition of the united states,aff per curiam,cir,a seaman suffered minor injuries jumping overboard to escape a shipboard explosion.id.at.a few weeks later,complaining of a cough,nervousness and insomnia,he saw a doctor,and was diagnosed with lung cancer.id.at.he died from lung cancer nine weeks after the ship explosion.id.at.all the medical experts involved in the case agreed that the seaman had a malignant cancer in his left lung prior to the shipboard disaster.id.at.because the seaman o bviously had the malignancy while aboard the ship,his estate claim for maintenance and cure was c learly valid even though the lung cancer may not have manifested itself while in the service of the ship.id.at.
in the present case,the only evidence submitted at summary judgment establishes messier had lymphoma during his maritime service.and the supreme court has instructed us to resolve ambiguities or doubts in favor of the seaman.vaughan,at.under the occurrence rule,messier is therefore entitled to maintenance and cure as a matter of law.
the district court manifestation rule 
the district court in this case correctly recognized the general rule in our nomenclature the occurrence rule whereby a seaman is entitled to maintenance and cure for any injury or illness that occur s,become s aggravated,or manifest s itself while the seaman is in the service of the ship.messier bouchard,d,citing aguilar standard oil of,quotation marks omitted.but the court then proceeded to create an exception to that general rule,holding that an injury must not only occur,but also manifest,show symptoms,during a seaman service id.at.neither case law nor policy considerations support this formulation.
the manifestation of symptoms has never been the touchstone for a seaman entitlement to maintenance and cure.the actual rule is much simpler maintenance and cure covers any injury or illness that occurs while in the service of the ship.all that matters is when the injury occurred,not when it started to present symptoms.
in reaching a different conclusion,the district court was misled by imprecise language from this court.several years ago,we stated that a seaman whose illness or injury manifests after conclusion of his or her employment with the shipowner is generally not entitled to recover for maintenance and cure absent convincing proof of causal connection between the injury or illness and the seaman service.wills amerada hess,cir quotation marks omitted and emphasis added.
our language notwithstanding,it is evident for two reasons that wills did not create a new manifestation requirement.the district court appreciated the first one,acknowledging that the relevant passage from wills is dicta.see messier,d at.in wills,a seaman died of cancer,which was not diagnosed until his maritime service had ended.at.the only evidence the seaman estate presented about the timing of the onset of his cancer was a fellow seaman testimony that the decedent had,during his employment,complained to me on several occasions of symptoms he was experiencing.id.at quotation marks omitted.repeating the familiar rule that the obligation of shipowners to provide maintenance and cure extends only to a seaman who becomes ill or injured while in the service of the ship,the wills panel held simply that this sole piece of evidence was not enough the fellow seaman lack ed the medical training or expertise necessary to conclude reliably that decedent squamous cell carcinoma presented itself while decedent was employed by defendants or was caused by exposure to toxic emissions while in defendants employ.id quoting aguilar,at.thus,given the clear holding pursuant to which the wills claim was dismissed for lack of evidence the illness occurred or presented during the employment period at all,any additional discussion in wills regarding the timing of an injury manifestation is dicta 
second,it is clear from the wills opinion itself that its discussion of maintenance and cure was describing the traditional occurrence rule and not,as the district court believed,creating a new manifestation rule.because wills turned on the fact that the seaman estate failed to provide evidence that his cancer began during his service or was caused by his service,see at,the case is best read as a straightforward application of the traditional occurrence rule in which the word manifests was used as a synonym for the word occurs.several factors lead
