petitioner american stevedoring limited asl appeals from an order of the benefits review board of the united states department of labor the board affirming the decision of an administrative law judge alj awarding respondent victor marinelli marinelli permanent total disability compensation under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca or the act,et.asl argues on appeal that i marinelli is not entitled to benefits because his shop steward duties did not qualify as maritime employment ii asl is not required to pay such benefits because it was not marinelli employer and iii marinelli failed to establish that he was permanently and totally disabled.finding each of these arguments to be without merit,we affirm the board affirmance of the alj award of permanent total disability compensation to marinelli.
background 
prior to or,marinelli was employed by asl predecessor as a safety man,that is,a worker whose duty it is to ensure that conditions on the loading terminal are sufficiently safe for stevedoring work in or,marinelli employment as a safety man ceased when he was appointed by the international longshoremen association local the union,the union representing asl employees,as its shop position required by the collective bargaining agreement cba between asl and the union.subsequently,marinelli was elected to the shop steward position by the union members.marinelli testified that,as shop steward,he was effectively an arbitrator between asl management and the union members.marinelli had authority under the cba to enforce work rules specified in the cba,as well as informal pier rules.both sides would come to him with complaints.asl typically complained that the workers were not following the work rules or not working diligently,while the union members generally complained that they were short of men or received insufficient breaks.sometimes marinelli sided with management,sometimes with the union members.marinelli testified that,on occasion,he would order a work stoppage,without the union permission,if he believed that asl was requiring union members to work under unsafe conditions.
the cba required the shop steward to be present on the pier whenever stevedoring work was taking place.in practice,however,loading and unloading took place even when marinelli was not physically present on the pier,but he had to be available at such times.marinelli would be paid for every hour stevedoring work was taking place,regardless of whether he was physically present on the pier.
pursuant to the cba,asl paid marinelli hourly wages and deducted therefrom amounts for federal and state income tax,social security benefits,and disability benefits.asl officials testified,however,that they had no control over marinelli activities.marinelli stated that,three or four times a week,he reported to union officials about what was taking place on the pier,but that nobody told him what to do on his job.
on march,after engaging in a dispute with some of the workers,marinelli experienced chest pain,took several nitroglycerin tablets,and passed out,striking his head as he fell.marinelli was taken to a hospital where he underwent a cardiac catheterization.marinelli was discharged on march,and thereafter treated with medication.it is undisputed that marinelli suffered from coronary artery disease,had previously undergone a coronary bypass procedure in,and had been suffering from chest pain for three years before the incident occurred.after march,marinelli also began treatment for psychological symptoms.
subsequent to the march incident,marinelli filed a claim for permanent total disability compensation under the lhwca,contending that stressful conditions at his place of employment aggravated his underlying heart and psychological conditions.marinelli filing of this claim brought the director of the office of workers compensation programs the director,united states department of labor owcp into the case as an interested party.see ingalls shipbuilding,director,owcp yates,d.
an initial hearing on marinelli lhwca claim was held on april.in an interim decision and order on jurisdiction entered june,the alj found that an relationship existed between asl and marinelli.the alj further found that marinelli shop steward duties were an integral and essential part of asl stevedoring business,and therefore held that marinelli was a covered maritime employee under section of the act.
further hearings on the merits of marinelli claim were held on january,and march.in a decision and order entered july,the alj found that marinelli work stress had aggravated his underlying cardiac condition and caused adverse psychiatric consequences,and that marinelli was unable to return to his usual employment.on the basis of these findings,the alj awarded marinelli permanent total disability compensation under a,and medical benefits under.
in a decision and order dated august,the board affirmed both alj orders.marinelli american stevedoring,brb,wl.asl timely appealed.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to c.
discussion 
our review of the underlying administrative decisions is of limited scope we will only consider whether the board made any errors of law and whether the alj findings of fact,in light of the entire record,are supported by substantial evidence.sealand terminals,gasparic,cir.furthermore,we grant deference to the views of the director with regard to questions of interpretation of the lhwca.fleischmann director,owcp,cir 
in order to qualify for permanent total disability benefits to be paid by asl under the lhwca,marinelli was required to demonstrate that i he was engaged in maritime employment,ii an relationship existed between him and asl,id,iii his injury was causally related to his employment,id.and iv his injury rendered him permanently and totally unable to perform his job,id,a.
maritime employment 
section of the act defines a covered employee as any person engaged in maritime employment,including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations,and any including a ship repairman,shipbuilder and.an employee is engaged in maritime employment as long as some portion of his job activities constitutes covered employment.see northeast marine terminal,caputo,d.maritime employment is not limited to the occupations specifically enumerated in section,but also encompasses any employment that is an integral or essential part of loading or unloading a vessel.chesapeake ohio ry.schwalb,d.
implicitly invoking schwalb integral or essential test,the alj concluded that marinelli performance of his shop steward duties was an integral part of and essential to asl maritime business.the alj based this conclusion on findings that marinelli i represented the interests of both asl and the union members,and ii facilitated the operation of asl business so as to remove interpersonal obstacles which might otherwise obstruct such ongoing operations.
the board affirmed,finding that the alj conclusion was supported by substantial evidence and consistent with numerous state court cases holding that shop stewards and other union officials are entitled to workers compensation benefits from employers because they act in the interest of employers as well as unions,as the negotiation and implementation of collective bargaining agreements prevents unrest and promotes the uninterrupted operation of an enterprise.marinelli,wl,at collecting cases.
on appeal,asl argues that marinelli claim fails under schwalb integral or essential test because i longshoring operations do better without a shop steward,ii ships loaded and unloaded even when marinelli was not present,and iii marinelli duties were the same as a shop steward in kansas at a tire plant.
the first of these three claims is without merit because the relevant question is whether marinelli shop steward duties were integral or essential to asl stevedoring that were carried out by unionized whether shop steward duties are integral or essential to stevedoring operations in general.
as for the second and third claims,the director correctly points out that virtually identical claims were explicitly rejected by the supreme court in schwalb.schwalb concerned railroad employees at waterfront coal terminals who performed maintenance and repair work on the equipment used to dump coal from rail cars and to convey it from the dumping area to the ships holds.schwalb,at.the court held that employees who are injured while maintaining or repairing equipment essential to the loading or unloading process are covered by the act.id.at.the court explained that such employees are not 
removed from coverage if they also have duties not integrally connected with the loading or unloading functions when machinery breaks down or becomes clogged or fouled because of the lack of cleaning,the loading process stops until the difficulty is cured.it is irrelevant that an employee contribution to the loading process is not continuous or that repair or maintenance is not always needed.
id.emphasis added.this reasoning applies equally to defeat asl second contention that because ships sometimes were loaded and unloaded without marinelli being physically present,he was not needed.it is irrelevant to marinelli claim that his contribution to the loading process was not always needed.
the schwalb court also stated that i t makes no difference that the particular kind of repair work the workers were doing might be done by railroad employees wherever railroad cars are unloaded.id.at.this reasoning applies equally to defeat asl third claim that marinelli work as a shop steward was not particular to the stevedoring industry.it makes no difference that the particular kind of shop steward work marinelli performed might have been performed by a shop steward at a tire plant in kansas 
in sum,the alj determination that marinelli was engaged in maritime employment was supported by substantial evidence 
ii.relationship 
for a claim to be compensable under the act,the injury must arise out of and in the course of employment.therefore,an relationship between the employer and the claimant must exist at the time of the injury.see fitzgerald stevedoring servs.of,brb,wl,at,en banc citing clauss washington post,aff.under the act,employee is defined as any person engaged in maritime employment,and employer is defined as an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment.
a.the alj analysis 
the alj rested his determination that an relationship existed between asl and marinelli on two grounds.first,the alj noted that asl was required by the cba to pay marinelli wages.second,the alj reasoned as follows 
premise asl was an employer under the act because,as a stevedoring company,it employed individuals employed in maritime employment.
premise marinelli was employed in maritime employment.
conclusion therefore,asl was marinelli employer under the act.
this reasoning clearly begs the question of who was marinelli employer.the alj conclusion follows from the premises only if one assumes that marinelli only possible statutory employer was asl.as asl points out,however,the union may have been marinelli statutory employer.asl contended that the union was marinelli statutory employer because the than his activities.the alj rejected this contention 
t hat marinelli job duties may be under the control of the union has no bearing upon whether he is an employee of asl under the act.such traditional control consideration sic indeed begs the question whether marinelli is an employee under the act,and asl reliance upon decisions reached in borrowed employee cases is therefore misplaced.in these cases,the issue was which of several entities was the employer responsible for benefits,and not,as here,whether marinelli was an employee under the act 
this reasoning also does not address the issue.once it was determined that marinelli was an employee under the act,the question remained whether asl or the union was his employer.
b.the board analysis 
as the board noted in its decision below,it 
has applied three tests to determine whether an relationship exists within the meaning of the act the relative nature of the work,the right to control details of the work,and restatement second of agency,section,subsection,which encompasses factors set forth in each of the other two tests.the administrative law judge should apply whichever test is best suited to the facts of the particular case.where the administrative law judge application of one test is affirmable,the board need not address the administrative law judge application of the other tests.
marinelli,wl,at moreover,because the board reviews an alj findings of fact to ensure that they are consistent with the law,port.smith stevedoring,hunter,cir,the board may apply one or more of the tests even if the alj has not applied them,see reilly washington metro.area transit,brb,wl,at may,applying all three tests where alj applied no test to reverse alj determination that no relationship existed.
the board surmised i that the alj considered two factors listed in the restatement second of agency the method of payment of wages and the extent of control over the details of work,and ii that the alj determined that asl payment of marinelli wages outweighed any consideration of whether asl controlled the details of marinelli work.marinelli,wl,at.noting that it was undisputed that,pursuant to the cba,asl paid marinelli wages,the board affirmed the alj determination that asl was marinelli employer.id.
the board surmise that the alj relied on the method of payment of wages factor listed in the restatement second of agency is dubious.section g concerns the method of payment,whether by the time or by the job.the alj,however,did not focus on whether asl paid marinelli by the hour or by the job.rather,the alj based his conclusion that asl was marinelli employer on the fact that asl paid his wages.furthermore,section defines an employee as a person employed to perform services in the affairs of another and who with respect to the physical conduct in the performance of the services is subject to the other control or right to control.emphasis added.the various factors listed in section including the method of payment are factors that are considered in determining whether the worker is subject to the other control or right to control.it is thus difficult to square the board finding that the alj was relying on the method of payment factor with the alj claim that the issue of whether asl controlled marinelli job duties was irrelevant 
c.the relative nature of the work test 
despite the aforementioned flaws in the respective analyses of the alj and the board,these analyses correctly downplayed the issue of which entity,employer or the union,controlled the details of marinelli work.marinelli,wl,at.this control factor is not suited to the facts of th is particular case,because it was inherent in marinelli position as a shop position created by agreement between asl and the neither party exercised control over the details of his work.as the alj found,based on substantial evidence,it was marinelli job to mediate disputes between asl and the union,and he sometimes sided with asl,other times with the union.marinelli could not have performed this role if he had been under the detailed control of either entity 
hence,in deciding which of the three tests generally applied by the board is best suited to the facts of this case,the alj quite properly avoided the tests that make the right to control the details of the employee work an important factor,namely,the right to control the details of the work and the test embodied in section of the restatement second of ageny the remaining test the board has used,namely,the relative nature of the work test,accords no weight to this control factor and therefor is the appropriate test to use in this case.in applying the relative nature of the work test,a court should 
focus on two distinct areas the nature of the claimant work and the relation of that work to the alleged employer regular business.in evaluating the character of a claimant work,a court should focus on various factors,including the skill required to do the work,the degree to which the work constitutes a separate calling or enterprise,and the extent to which the work might be expected to carry its own accident bur
