this case arose from an allision between an unmanned pleasure yacht and a dock when hurricane frances hit south florida in early september of the district court found that the exercised reasonable care in preparing for the storm and accordingly exonerated him and his boat from liability.the dock owner now appeals.because the district court applied the proper standard of care and correctly allocated the burden of proof,and because its factual determinations are not clearly erroneous,we affirm the court judgment.
the neraida is a sailing yacht,a ketch.it was anchored in lake worth in palm beach during the early morning hours of september,when hurricane frances made landfall on the southeast coast of florida.by,the neraida had drifted eastward across the lake and come to rest,leaning against a dock owned by david fischer the dock suffered substantial damage as a result of the impact.
the neraida was beneficially owned by peter siavrakas,a michigan businessman and yachting enthusiast,through his percent interest as the general partner in neraida,a limited partnership,the neraida title owner.siavrakas purchased the yacht in and until late had operated it as a charter vessel in the caribbean.the neraida measured over feet bow to stern with a draft of feet,inches a mast height of feet,and a displacement of approximately pounds.
siavrakas and his family lived during most of the year in michigan and,prior to,would periodically travel to the caribbean to use the neraida for pleasure sailing.in,the charter business dried up,and siavrakas,his family,and a small crew sailed the neraida from the caribbean north to rhode island,and back south to palm beach,florida.
when siavrakas arrived in palm beach,he searched for a place permanently to anchor the neraida and settled on lake worth,where he found many other boats moored.a nearby marina,the rybovich,spencer marina,accommodated the neraida dinghy,which siavrakas used to go out to the neraida anchored in the lake.when the neraida was not being used,the dinghy remained docked at the marina.
between and september,siavrakas continued to travel periodically from michigan to florida to sail in the neraida for weeks or months at a time.while siavrakas was in michigan,he arranged to have a friend in palm beach,gregory afthinos,act as a caretaker for the neraida.afthinos,an engineer trained in the greek royal navy and merchant marine academy,had worked previously aboard freighters and cruisers.on several occasions,he sailed with siavrakas and his family aboard the neraida.once the yacht was moored in lake worth,afthinos task was to check on it weekly,to inspect it for vandalism and.he last checked on the yacht approximately a week before hurricane frances struck.
sometime during,siavrakas decided to sell the neraida.one interested buyer was steven cienkowski,a licensed captain in palm beach who wanted to put the yacht back into the charter business.cienkowski owned three smaller boats,two that he used to take passengers out on fishing and scuba diving trips,and a third sailboat.siavrakas and cienkowski never made a deal for the sale or lease of the neraida,but the two kept in touch over their shared interest in sailing.
siavrakas first became aware of hurricane frances,then designated a tropical storm on august.on the following day,when frances was designated a hurricane,it was still some miles off the coast of florida.a large and system,the storm lumbered its way west and then north through the caribbean over the next several days.a hurricane watch was first issued on september,for the entire atlantic coast of florida between flagler beach in the north and florida city in the south.the national hurricane center first issued a hurricane warning on september,once again covering the entire east coast of the state 
while frances was gaining strength in the caribbean,siavrakas was not in florida he had not been there since june.consequently,he did not personally carry out the preparations for the hurricane.siavrakas contacted afthinos and cienkowski,instead,on wednesday,september,and instructed them to prepare the neraida for the storm by setting a second anchor and removing the sails.siavrakas had decided by then to keep the yacht in lake worth instead of moving it to a different location for the storm.afthinos and cienkowski agreed to meet by the yacht to make the preparations on thursday,september,but due to scheduling conflicts,cienkowski wound up going out to the neraida alone,on the evening of friday,september.
once aboard the yacht,cienkowski first ensured that the sails were tied and secured to the masts.he did not remove the sails because heavy winds had already reached the area.he dropped the yacht secondary anchor the main anchor had already been lowered and set.the main anchor was a coastal quick release cqr design favored by many sailors for boats of comparable size.attached to the yacht by a chain,the anchor had the ability to set,dig a firm hold into the the yacht begins to move.the secondary anchor was also a cqr design it weighed about pounds and was attached to a chain and nylon rope.in preparing the neraida,cienkowski spent a total of thirty minutes on board.
the eye of frances finally made landfall during the early morning of september,some forty miles north from where the neraida was anchored,though the area around palm beach had been experiencing tropical winds since earlier in the night on september.given the size of the storm system,this distance put the neraida directly in the eye wall of the storm,where the winds are most intense.according to the uncontroverted testimony of siavrakas meteorology expert,lee branscome,the area surrounding the neraida experienced gusts of winds for six to eight hours and sustained winds for about three hours during the night of september.
by midday on september,when cienkowski returned to the yacht anchorage site,he saw that many of the other boats moored in the area had been severely damaged during the night.the neraida was found leaning against david fischer dock,which had been damaged from the impact.in addition to the damage it sustained from alliding with the dock,the neraida lost its main sail,which had become unfurled during the storm and mostly destroyed by the wind.the mizzen,located rearward,was unfurled but had not been raised or torn.two additional sails remained covered up and furled during the storm.
david fischer brought this action in the district court for the southern district of florida on december.he sued the neraida in rem and siavrakas and the neraida,in personam we refer to the defendants collectively as siavrakas.the gist of fischer complaint is that siavrakas is liable for the damage to fischer dock for negligently failing to secure the neraida prior to the hurricane.in a separate action,neraida,sued for exoneration or limitation of liability to the value of the neraida.see.the district court,sitting in admiralty,consolidated the two actions and held a bench trial on the issue of liability alone.
at trial,the testimony consisted predominately of the opinions of both sides expert witnesses.thomas correll,fischer expert and an inland marine consultant,testified that several of siavrakas acts and omissions in preparation for the hurricane were unreasonable.specifically,he testified that the sails should have been removed instead of merely furled,that the second anchor should have been set manually instead of being dropped overboard and allowed to and that the neraida should have been moved to a different location altogether.in contrast,siavrakas expert,thomas danti,testified that the primary purpose of removing sails is to prevent them from getting damaged rather than to prevent a vessel from moving,that additional anchors are often not helpful to a ship caught in shifting storm winds,and that it was reasonable to leave the neraida anchored in lake worth.
the district court resolved the issue of liability in the findings of facts and conclusions of law it handed down following the bench trial.in its conclusions of law,the court held that siavrakas bore the burden of proving that his actions in securing the neraida were reasonable.the court found that although hurricane frances was an act of god,its force was not so severe that no amount of precaution could have avoided the accident.nonetheless,the court found that because siavrakas measures to secure the neraida were reasonable,siavrakas was not liable for the damage to fischer dock and was entitled to exoneration under.the court entered a partial final judgment for siavrakas pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and this appeal followed.
we have jurisdiction to review the district court judgment.we review the court conclusions of law de novo.see united states kennedy,cir.the district court findings of determinations of the credibility of witnesses and weight of the not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.see.a dresdner bank ag olympia voyager,cir citing mcallister united states.the court findings will stand as long as they are supported by substantial evidence.see thelma raley,kleppe,cir.in a case in which the evidence is largely testimonial,like this one,the district court has the advantage of observing the witnesses and evaluating their credibility firsthand,and the standard of review imposes an especially heavy burden on an appellant.id.
fischer raises four arguments in support of reversal.first,he submits that the district erred by failing to shift the burden to siavrakas to prove that his actions in preparing the neraida were reasonable.second,he argues that the court should have held siavrakas liable when it found that hurricane frances was not so severe as to make the accident inevitable third and finally,he argues that siavrakas preparations were not reasonable and that the district court made a clear error when it decided otherwise.
the first argument fischer raises rests on but a single ambiguous sentence in the district court conclusions of law.the court stated in the final section of its conclusions that b ecause plaintiffs have failed to prove that defendants were negligent in their hurricane preparations with regard to the neraida,they are not entitled to recover.fischer submits that this statement meant that the district court placed the burden of persuasion on the plaintiffs instead of the defendants as required by the presumption articulated in the louisiana,wall.id.at holding that the vessel must show affirmatively that it is not liable see also bunge freeport marine repair,cir when a moving ship strikes and damages a stationary object,it is presumed that the moving ship is at fault.
reading the conclusions of law in its entirety convinces us that the district court correctly shifted the burden of proof to siavrakas.indeed,the court stated that siavrakas is relieved from liability only if he can show that the damage caused to fischer dock could not have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care.emphasis added.however,once siavrakas demonstrated to the court satisfaction that his preparations were reasonable,the presumption that the moving vessel was at fault was overcome.because the court properly invoked the presumption of the louisiana rule,we reject fischer argument.
in essence,fischer second argument boils down to the proposition that the louisiana rule converts the liability standard in allision cases from ordinary negligence into something much more demanding.this is incorrect.the duty of care owed by a moving vessel to a stationary object is reasonable care under the circumstances.thus,if a ship owner acted reasonably in preparing for a storm,the owner is not liable even if the ship eventually causes damage to another property.fischer conflates the applicable standard for negligence with the act of god doctrine.the act of god defense is a distinct argument that rebuts causation by establishing a superceding cause of the accident.defendants in allision cases need not,of course,prove a superceding cause in order to disprove negligence.
liability in collision and allision cases has always been apportioned based on fault.see thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed.in practice,however,evidence of fault is often in the exclusive control of the defendant in a collision action.see bunge freeport marine repair,cir.several judicial presumptions similar to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur have evolved to shift the burden of production and persuasion to the defendant.see schoenbaum,supra,at analogizing to res ipsa loquitur.of present concern are two related doctrines most commonly associated with the louisiana,wall,and the oregon.the oregon rule states that when a vessel moving under its own power allides with a stationary object,the moving vessel is presumptively at fault.see the oregon,at.at.the louisiana rule is the same except that it applies to vessels moving or drifting due to an external force,such as the current or the wind.see the louisiana,wall.at superior const.brock,cir comparing the two rules.
applying either of these rules creates a presumption that the moving vessel was negligent,but the presumption is rebuttable through any one of three ways.the defendant can demonstrate that the allision was the fault of the stationary object that the moving vessel acted with reasonable care or that the allision was an unavoidable accident.freeport marine repair,at.these three defenses might be analogized to the common law tort arguments of contributory negligence,denial of negligence,and superceding causation,respectively.each independent argument,if sustained,is sufficient to defeat liability.siavrakas does not argue that fischer was negligent in the construction or placement of his dock thus,the first defense is not applicable to the present case.we accordingly turn to the second defense,which siavrakas does raise,namely that he exercised reasonable care in preparing the neraida for the hurricane.
the appropriate standard of care in this regime is based upon general concepts of prudent seamanship and reasonable care statutory and regulatory rules and recognized customs and usages.schoenbaum,supra,at.the case law has consistently embraced this standard.in the louisiana,the supreme court applied a test,and concluded that the facts of the case required no assumption or affectation of any very great nautical skill in this court to discern defect ive management of the louisiana by her captain and crew.wall.at.the court found that the allision was caused by the crew want of judgment,evidenced in part by the fact that other persons of nautical skill found no difficulty in securing their vessels at the same place,and under similar circumstances.id.in short,the court concluded that the crew was obviously negligent.
collision cases decided subsequent to the louisiana also understood the standard of care in admiralty to be reasonable care under the circumstances,and not a higher standard.see the virginia ehrman.ascribing liability when the master or crew of both vessels are either deficient in skill,omit to take due care,or are guilty of negligence the clarita,wall.stating that vessels are liable for accidents due to the negligence,want of care or skill on the part of those employed in their navigation.particularly instructive is the the grace girdler,in which the supreme court stated that t he highest degree of caution that can be used is not required when a ship is pursuing a lawful avocation in a lawful manner,and that i t is enough that it is reasonable under the circumstances.wall.
cases of more recent vintage are no less consistent in their adherence to a standard.in petition of the united states,cir we stated that t he test for determining whether defendants were free from fault is whether they took reasonable precautions under the circumstances as known or reasonably to be anticipated.see also superior const.brock,cir hercules carriers,claimant state of,cir loveland,towing,cir bunge furness bridge,cir stuart cay marina special delivery,d.applied to the context of hurricane preparations,reasonable care amounts to whether the owner use d all reasonable means and took proper action to guard against,prevent or mitigate the dangers posed by the hurricane.stuart cay marina,d at.although what reasonable care requires changes with the circumstances,that standard recognizes the
