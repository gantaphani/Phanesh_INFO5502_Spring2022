parents appeal from an order denying their request for modification of a judgment awarding substantial visitation to paternal grandparents.because the trial court determined that there was no substantial change in circumstances to require modification of the original judgment,it did not address the children best interests.we review de novo,ors and reverse,concluding that the best interests of the children require termination of the visitation 
we begin with a review of the history of this proceeding,which provides the context for our decision regarding modification.this proceeding involves the three oldest of parents four daughter,c,who was born in july,and their two sons,t and m,who were born in april and october,respectively grandparents original petition for visitation was heard in april,when c was almost six years old and t and m were ages four and two.grandmother apparently sought visitation under former ors,repealed by or.laws,ch,because grandfather is father stepparent,he apparently sought visitation under ors grandparents sought weekly visits and one overnight visit per month,claiming that they had been regular caretakers of the children and had developed emotional ties with them.they contended that parents had begun denying visits after grandparents became critical of their efforts at parenting.apparently,on more than one occasion,grandparents had called the sheriff and lodged complaints with the state office for services to children and families scf now known as department of human services dhs regarding concerns that parents were mistreating the children.grandparents claimed that parents slapped the children in the face and pulled their hair,used profanity around them,and locked c in her room when she misbehaved.
parents admitted to spanking the children but denied slapping them in the face or pulling their hair,and mother explained that she had locked c in her room,in accordance with advice from parenting tapes,when c behavior was out of control.parents noted the lack of any evidence of abuse particularly given the regularity with which grandparents photographed the children,and the record indicates that dhs never took custody of the children despite investigating parents at grandparents behest.parents claimed that grandparents undermined them particularly mother as parents,including in front of the children,and that c was often defiant and difficult to manage after spending time with grandparents.parents disputed the extent of grandparents past contact with the children and contended that they had not denied visits but had merely insisted that any visits must occur in father presence.
grandparents petition was heard several months after the united states supreme court decision in troxel granville,d,in which a majority of the justices agreed that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.the same justices agreed that,under the circumstances of that case,the state court decision to override the parent reasonable choice to limit grandparent visitation merely because that visitation was found to be in the best interest of the children impermissibly infringed on that fundamental right.id.at.we addressed the impact of troxel in harrington daum,also decided before the hearing on grandparents that troxel now establishes that the court must give significant weight to a fit custodial parent decision regarding visitation and that a parent right to make decisions concerning the child upbringing is a supervening right that both affects the determination of whether visitation is appropriate and prevents the application of solely a best interests of the child analysis.
although the trial court in the hearing on grandparents original petition did not conclude that parents were unfit,there is no indication that the court considered troxel or applied any kind of presumption in favor of parents decision to limit grandparents to visits under father supervision.instead,the court found that parents had denied grandparents a reasonable opportunity to visit with their finding that was relevant only as to grandmother,because grandfather is father stepparent and found that it was in the best interest and welfare of the children that grandparents be awarded parenting time.specifically,the court indicated that it would award grandparents two overnight visits per month with the children.
before entry of the trial court judgment in may and without apprising the trial court,parents moved the family to wyoming.parents did not appeal the court judgment.soon after parents departure,grandparents obtained an order to show cause why parents were not in contempt of the judgment.the case was reassigned to a new judge the order was served only on mother and,when she failed to appear,grandparents sought and obtained a warrant for mother arrest from the judge newly assigned to the case.mother was arrested and spent three days in jail in wyoming in late december.
by april,parents had moved back to oregon and filed a motion to modify the visitation order to terminate grandparents visits or,in the alternative,to allow only supervised visits.parents both appeared at a hearing in may and acknowledged that they were in contempt of the original judgment.at that hearing,father presented by affidavit evidence that,in january,while the family was still in wyoming,c had disclosed to mother that grandmother had sexually abused her.father brought c to salem to be interviewed at liberty house later in january.during an interview,c disclosed that,on one occasion when she was five years old,grandmother had touched c genitals with her hand and instructed her to tell the police that her grandpa apparently indicating c maternal grandfather had done it.c reported that grandmother had indicated that she was going to hurt c and give her to the police if she did not listen to grandmother and say what grandmother told her to say.liberty house staff assessed the interview as credible evidence of sexual abuse and recommended that c be seen by a therapist experienced in treating abused children and that she have no contact with grandmother pending further investigation.
on receiving the report from liberty house,dhs administered a polygraph examination to grandmother,which was inconclusive.a second polygraph administered one week later was reportedly negative for sexual abuse,and dhs issued an opinion that the sexual abuse claim was unfounded.
even though all of this information was before the trial court at the may hearing,the court ordered that supervised visits be started weekly,specifically noting that supervision was ordered only for the purpose of easing the children transition,given that they had not seen grandparents since august.over parents objection,the court granted grandparents request that the visits be supervised by grandfather niece,michelle lindemann,who is a social services worker known to the trial judge but who also testified on behalf of grandparents in the hearing on their original petition.at a further status hearing a month later,several more weekly visits were scheduled,half supervised and half unsupervised.
between the may hearing and a hearing held in late august,the children had weekly supervised and unsupervised visits with grandparents.during that time,c had several sessions with cynthia,a child psychologist.in addition to interviewing c and both parents,during her sessions with c,used play therapy,a recognized form of psychotherapy that is designed to assist younger children,for whom verbal expression is difficult,to more naturally express their thoughts,feelings,and experiences.reports of those sessions are remarkable in several respects.
first,in each session,c play was characterized by a figure whom she dubbed the evil queen,who kidnapped or captured little girls and put them into cages or traps.c put to little dolls into cages and would routinely check on them each session to make sure they were still there and would add more.in c play,occasional efforts to help the little girls or confront the evil queen were always unsuccessful.
second,in the course of c play,she would comment about her fears that grandmother would take her away from mother and about threats that grandmother would make to her while taking her aside during visits.she frequently commented that grandmother tells me to keep secrets,including instructing c not to tell anyone about an incident in which m had burned his finger while at grandparents house.c reported that grandmother also had told her not to tell what she did to me which c described as grandmother using her finger to rub c crotch inside her underwear for about two minutes.c also frequently commented that grandmother had called mother names and said unkind things about mother.each week c became more anxious about talking to,recounting threats grandmother made to her for lying about grandmother.eventually c disclosed that grandmother had threatened to spank c or touch her again if she talked to.c also indicated that grandmother had told her to say to the judge that i lied to everyone and to tell everyone that i lied that she touched me.when c indicated that she did not understand who the judge was,explained to her that the judge is the person who decides who is telling the truth and that the judge mostly just wants to know if its sic safe for you to be at gramma.c reportedly looked straight at and said,he does well,it is really very safe.it is safe at all.
third,mother reported to that,since visits with grandparents had resumed,all three children had begun wetting their pants regularly and were waking up screaming from nightmares and showing signs of extremely high anxiety.mother also reported that c had been repeatedly provoking and pushing limits with parents and her maternal grandfather who lived with the family,sometimes screaming,hit me hit me c reportedly would play chase games that would escalate out of control,with c kicking and screaming,until someone usually c or the older of her brothers would get hurt.mother also reported that c was calling her brothers bad names and would report that gramma says it.c affirmed this privately with.
interpreted c play as indicating that c did not see a way to escape her feelings of being trapped and under the control of grandmother.she opined that the evil queen in c play represented grandmother,consistent with c comments in the context of her play.she noted that often the little girls in c play would cry out for help from their mothers,but to no avail,indicating c feelings of helplessness and futility.in every session c used a sleeping beauty figure,asleep in her case.commented that victims who are having dissociative problems often will represent themselves in some way as being asleep and therefore safe from the trauma.
opined that c was suffering from stress disorder ptsd as well as increasing anxiety and distress as a direct result of the visits with grandmother.she identified the trauma as c experience of the constant,relentless attack on her family,on her mother,her whole sense of security and safety,along with feeling that she has to be two different people,one person when she with grandma and then somebody else when she at home.it was evident to her that c did not feel safe with grandmother,and she opined that a sense of safety and security was of primary,critical concern in the treatment of ptsd.she opined that c relationship with grandmother was very,very toxic to her and recommended that all visits with grandmother be stopped immediately.she also recommended against the two boys having visits with grandmother because of the likelihood that grandmother would manifest similar destructive behavior with them.
eventually the supervised visits still alternating with unsupervised visits were moved to family building blocks,following c reports to that grandmother was taking her aside and threatening her while lindemann was supervising visits at grandparents home.reports of the visits at family building blocks indicated that c seemed happy to see grandmother and jumped into her arms upon seeing her.a videotape that grandparents submitted of a visit to the zoo indicated similar happiness on the part of the children at seeing grandparents.however,found this to be dissociative behavior very typical of people suffering from ptsd 
what you see is the child will behave one way when she with,say,her grandmother,and when she away from her grandmother will say,i afraid of her,she mean.
for c it not safe for her to try to stand up to her grandmother.and so when she sees the grandmother,i think she completely disassociates all of the stress and fear that she has of her grandmother.
that very typical,especially with young children,when they feel like they trapped in a dangerous situation.
rejected the trial judge suggestion that the family move to wyoming or the conflict between mother and grandmother were the source of c trauma.
grandparents evidence consisted only of testimony that the visits were going well,pictures and a videotape of visits,and further testimony from grandparents regarding their original allegations that parents were abusive toward the children.the record contains no expert evidence to rebut testimony that the visits with grandparents were destructive to c and potentially destructive to t and found no reason to believe that c had been coached to make allegations against grandmother and rejected suggestions that c behavior was attributable to the family move to wyoming or to physical discipline that may have been meted out by parents.additionally,an attorney appointed to represent the children interests recommended that visits with grandparents be terminated.
nevertheless,the trial court rejected parents request for modification of the original visitation judgment.the court findings consisted only of the statement that there is no substantial change in circumstances to require deviation from the original terms and conditions of the judgment of visitation.parents appeal that ruling.
before addressing the merits,we must address a preliminary issue regarding reviewability of the trial court order.grandparents,citing prior cases of this court and the oregon supreme court,contend that parents waived de novo review by consenting to the trial judge interview of the children off the record.the circumstances giving rise to the interviews are not clear from the record,nor is the content of the interviews.in rea and rea,or,the supreme court announced that de novo review would not be conducted in custody cases if the trial court,with the consent or informed acquiescence of the parties,made an independent investigation of the case off the record.the court applied the general rule that de novo review could not be conducted unless the reviewing court has before it all of the evidence on which the trial court based its decision and noted that,because the trial judge,aided by his staff,is in a better position to determine custody than is this court,we see no objection to a procedure whereby parties,in effect,agree that the decision of the trial judge who has had the benefit of testimony in open court,plus independent investigation,shall be final.id.at.that rule has been applied to preclude de novo review in custody cases where interviews with children in chambers were not made part of the trial court record.see schuyler haggart,or,review de novo of a change in custody from the mother to the father was waived where the trial court considered a report from a prior case and interviewed the parties daughter in chambers with the parties consent but neither the report nor a transcript of the interview was available to the court on appeal lackey lackey,review de novo of a custody order was waived where the trial judge decided custody after interviewing the parties children by stipulation.
the trial court interviews of the children in this matter do not preclude our de novo review,however.in contrast to the cases cited by grandparents,there is nothing in the record here from which we may imply that the parties consented to use of the interviews to decide the question before the is,whether the best interests of the children require that the original judgment be modified the reco
