appellant union pacific railroad company appeals from the district court conclusions of law and final judgment in the instant case.for the reasons discussed below,we reverse in part and affirm in part the district court opinion.
background 
background facts 
the parties stipulated to the following underlying facts.the clinton railroad bridge the clinton bridge,was constructed in.pursuant to,the construction of the clinton bridge was authorized by and constructed in accordance with permits issued by the united states coast guard.appellant is the owner and operator of the clinton bridge.
kirby inland marine,kirby is the owner and operator of the miss dixie,a river barge towboat in operation on the mississippi river.on may,the miss dixie its tow allided with the clinton bridge causing damage to the bridge and the miss dixie.on october,appellant filed the instant action alleging the damage to its bridge was caused by the negligence of the crew of the miss dixie by the unseaworthiness of that vessel.appellees denied that the crew was negligent or that the vessel was unseaworthy and asserted that appellant itself was negligent in the construction,design,care and maintenance of the clinton bridge.
to prove appellant negligence,appellees proffered a coast guard order to alter,issued on february,which found that the clinton bridge was an unreasonable obstruction to navigation.the order to alter was issued pursuant to the act,which authorizes the united states coast guard to investigate whether a bridge is unreasonably obstructing navigation and to order a bridge owner to alter a bridge which does indeed unreasonably obstruct navigation.
the parties entered into a settlement agreement however,the agreement was predicated on the district court deciding one specific legal issue does the act finding that the bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation render inapplicable any presumption that negligence of the barge crew was the cause of an allision between a moving vessel and a stationary bridge.union pac.kirby inland marine et,slip op.at,wl,the presumption in question is the longstanding oregon rule which raises a presumption that a vessel crew was negligent when a vessel strikes a stationary object such as a bridge.the oregon.under the parties settlement agreement,if the district court concluded that the oregon rule does apply,then kirby would pay an agreed amount alternatively,if the district court concluded that the oregon rule does not apply,then kirby would pay a smaller agreed amount.thus,the primary issue before the district court was whether the coast guard order to alter trumps the oregon rule.
district court decision 
although the district court initially stated that the oregon rule should apply,the district court eliminated the presumption by invoking the pennsylvania rule which is another longstanding admiralty principle.under the pennsylvania rule,w here any party violates a statutory or regulatory rule designed to prevent collisions,that party has committed per se negligence and that party has the burden of proving that its statutory fault was not a contributing cause of the accident.union pac.kirby inland marine et.al,slip op.at,wl,citing the pennsylvania,wall.the district court concluded that appellant violated of the act which states that no bridge shall at any time unreasonably obstruct the free navigation of any navigable waters of the united states.the district court found that a violation of is sufficient to invoke the pennsylvania rule and thus the normal presumption of fault that attaches to the vessel under the oregon rule is shifted back to the structure owner under the pennsylvania rule.union,at.
the district court also concluded that the coast guard order to alter was admissible pursuant to federal rules of evidence and c.id.at.appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and now asserts that the district court erred by concluding that the oregon rule does not apply to the instant case,and the order to alter is admissible.
ii.discussion 
a.the oregon rule 
we will first consider whether the district court erred by invoking the pennsylvania rule to trump the oregon rule and shift the burden of persuasion back to appellant.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.wiles capitol indem,cir citing lewis wilson,cir.
for the pennsylvania rule to apply,three elements must exist proof by a preponderance of the evidence of violation of a statute or regulation that imposes a mandatory duty the statute or regulation must involve marine safety or navigation and the injury suffered must be of a nature that the statute or regulation was intended to prevent.folkstone.csx,cir emphasis added.the act does not satisfy the prerequisites of the pennsylvania rule because it was not drafted to maintain marine safety to impose a specific duty or to prevent a specific sort of injury.
we find that the act is a funding statute and not a safety statute.congress stated that it drafted the act to provide an orderly method for the just apportionment of the cost of the reconstruction or alteration of bridges over navigable waters where navigation conditions require such reconstruction or alteration of bridges heretofore built in accordance with law house report,august,cong.sess.
the regulations implementing the act establish a lengthy administrative procedure for determining whether a bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation.see setting out complaint process,preliminary investigation,detailed investigation,public hearing,and administrative review.ultimately,the chief officer of the bridge administration the chief performs a analysis to determine whether the benefits to navigation exceed the government cost of altering the bridge.if the benefits exceed the costs,then the chief recommends that the coast guard issue an order to alter stating that the bridge unreasonably obstructs navigation.id.once the coast guard concludes that a bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation,the bridge owner must submit plans and specifications for altering the bridge solicit and submit bids and request an apportionment of costs which outlines which costs will be borne by bridge owner and the united states government.see.
looking at the act as a whole,a finding that a bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation is not a direct comment on the safety of the bridge.instead,the coast guard labels a bridge an unreasonable obstruction in order to facilitate the funding process.accordingly,we conclude that the act does not satisfy the first element of the pennsylvania rule because it was not drafted to protect marine safety,but to establish a procedure to provide government funds to assist bridge owners in altering their bridges.
the act also does not satisfy the other two prerequisites of the pennsylvania rule as it does not impose a specific duty or prevent a specific sort of injury.once the coast guard concludes that a bridge violates,the bridge owner is required only to prepare a plan for altering the bridge.this duty is very different from a duty to maintain lights and signals on a bridge or to promptly open a draw.see requiring a bridge owner to maintain such lights and other signals thereon as the commandant of the coast guard shall prescribe and to promptly open such draw upon reasonable signal for the passage of boats and other water craft.with respect to the latter duties,the application of the pennsylvania rule is justified because a bridge owner greatly increases the risk of allision by failing to promptly open a draw or by neglecting to maintain the bridge lights.conversely,a bridge owner failure to prepare a plan for altering a bridge will delay the funding process,but will not directly increase the risk of allision.
also,the goal of the act was to decrease the cost of navigation by using government funds to alter bridges which unreasonably obstruct such navigation.although the bridge alterations may reduce the amount of allisions,this is a collateral consequence and not a direct purpose of the act.to state it another way,the act was not designed to prevent any specific type of injury.thus,any injury suffered in admiralty
