in this admiralty case,the owner of a seagoing vessel appeals on behalf of its vessel in rem from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of new jersey denying its supplemental rule e f application to vacate a warrant of arrest for the vessel,to cancel and discharge substitute security and to dismiss a complaint brought by a charterer of the vessel in a claim for cargo damages although other issues are presented,we must first decide whether the provision for cargo damage claims provided for in the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,extinguished the maritime lien on the vessel.we decide that the running of the cogsa statute of limitations did extinguish the maritime lien on the vessel and that the district court therefore lacked admiralty in rem jurisdiction to issue the warrant of arrest for the vessel.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court denying the motion to vacate the warrant of arrest and other requested relief 
on november,petroleos mexicanos refinacion pemex chartered a ship,the tbilisi now renamed king a,from tbilisi shipping,pursuant to a contractual charter agreement.the vessel was to carry diesel oil and unleaded gasoline to several mexican ports.during the discharge of the cargo at guaymas,mexico,it was discovered that the two cargoes had been during their voyage on the tbilisi.tbilisi shipping did not dispute its liability for the contamination.pemex salvaged the contaminated cargoes,incurring a disputed amount of salvage costs and losses.pemex withheld of charter hire as security for its anticipated claim for damages.

in,prior to pemex presenting a claim to the arbitration panel,tbilisi shipping made an application to the arbitration panel for dismissal of pemex claim.tbilisi shipping contended that pemex claim was barred by the statute of limitations for cargo damage claims provided for in cogsa.the arbitration panel found that pemex claim was not barred by the statute of limitations,but the arbitrators instructed pemex to submit any claim it had against tbilisi shipping expeditiously.pemex submitted a statement of claim on january.the claim was solely against tbilisi shipping,in personam.
sometime during the arbitration,pemex discovered that tbilisi shipping had sold the tbilisi to king david shipping king david and that the vessel had been renamed king a.in early,pemex discovered that the king a was scheduled to call at a terminal in new jersey.in march,pemex filed its complaint in the district court for the district of new jersey naming the king a as an in rem defendant and the district court issued the warrant of arrest for the vessel.king david was advised of the issuance of the warrant of arrest and was given the opportunity to avoid the arrest by posting additional security.accordingly,king david p i club,also steamship mutual,issued another lou second lou in the amount of,plus interest,costs and attorneys fees.
on september,king david submitted an application in the district court to vacate the warrant of arrest pursuant to supplemental rule e f through the application,king david also sought to cancel and discharge the second lou and any bond demanded thereon and dismiss pemex complaint.the district court determined that a valid maritime lien on the vessel existed,and that the warrant of arrest was properly issued.the district court also determined that the complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations,and therefore the complaint need not be dismissed.on april,the district court denied the application to vacate the warrant.
king david appealed the district court denial of its application to this court.see petroleos mexicanos refinacion king a,cir.this court dismissed the action for lack of appellate jurisdiction as no final order from the district court had been issued.

when a maritime lien exists,the district court has admiralty jurisdiction and it is proper for the district court to issue a warrant of arrest for the vessel pursuant to supplemental rule c a i.king david contention that the district court improperly issued the warrant of arrest is based primarily on its statute of limitations defense.king david argues that the expiration of the cogsa limitation period extinguished any lien that pemex had on the vessel.because no lien on the vessel existed when pemex filed its complaint,king david argues,the district court lacked the admiralty jurisdiction to issue the warrant of arrest.

if the amount of security provided by the lou is insufficient to satisfy a judgment,the court ordinarily may authorize the of the vessel only if the amount of the original security was obtained through fraud or mistake.see moore angela,cir while it is true that a district court may require further security at any time,we interpret the phrase to mean substitute or replacement security,when a surety has become insolvent rather than additional security,except where the vessel was released by fraud,misrepresentation,or mistake of the court.internal citation omitted emphasis in original industria nacional del papel,ca.albert f,cir holding that a mistake sufficient to justify must be tinged with fraud or misrepresentation.
although in this case there was no fraud or mistake,the first lou expressly authorized pemex to seek additional security if the amount of its claim exceeded the amount secured by the first lou.generally,a lou would not contain such a provision.a standard lou serves as a complete substitute for the res,but here the first lou served only to secure the remittance of the withheld hire and not to prevent service of an arrest warrant on the vessel.accordingly,the first lou contained this unique contractual reservation of the right to later arrest the vessel.pemex,however,failed to take such action to increase its security until nine years had passed.king david contends that pemex had seven months from the issuance of the first lou to calculate the amount of its claim for cargo damages and to seek any additional security had pemex done so,king david argues,it would have undoubtedly been within the cogsa limitations period,but attempting to seek the additional security after the expiration of the limitations period renders pemex claim for additional security untimely.
critical to the resolution of this action is the interaction of two contractual provisions in the first lou language in the recital paragraph permitting later arrest of the vessel should pemex claim exceed the amount of the first lou,and the clause in paragraph six.
the recital paragraph states 
in consideration of pemex making a telegraphic remittance of outstanding hire in the amount of and in consideration of pemex refraining from arresting the tbilisi and from attaching other property of tbilisi shipping,their agents and operators,for its claim for alleged damage to a cargo of diesel and magna sin gasoline shipped under the captioned charter party except to the extent the claim exceeds the amount of security provided herein,namely

our decision turns on whether the terms of cogsa,including its statute of limitations,come within the applicable law referenced in paragraph six of the first lou,irrespective of the seemingly unlimited right to later arrest the vessel provided for in the recital paragraph of the same document.
if we decide that the limitations period did not bar pemex from seeking additional security at a very late date,we must determine that the district court issuance of the warrant of arrest for the vessel was proper.if we decide that pemex efforts were barred by the limitations period,however,we must reverse the district court judgment for lack of admiralty jurisdiction.we now turn to reasons supplied by the district court in refusing to vacate the arrest warrant.
even the most cursory reading of the district court opinion discloses that the district court made no mention of the critical paragraph six of the first lou that explicitly reserves any rights king david may have under applicable law.its opinion assumes that cogsa applies,but does not reconcile paragraph six with the recital paragraph language permitting later arrest of the vessel.instead,the district court writes a modest dissertation discussing the relationship between in rem and in personam claims.
in determining that pemex complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations,the district court relied on the reasoning of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in thyssen,calypso shipping,cir.although thyssen addressed different circumstances,the district court cited the case for its explanation of the close interrelation between in rem and in personam claims in the maritime context.we do not believe that thyssen was a proper analogy because that case addressed a situation wholly different from the one presented here.
in thyssen,the second circuit addressed whether the district court erred by dismissing a plaintiff in rem claims after a panel of london arbitrators ruled on the plaintiff in personam claims.specifically,the plaintiff in thyssen contended that english law had no mechanism for granting the arbitrators jurisdiction over the in rem claims,so any ruling it made on the in personam claims had no bearing on the in rem claims.thyssen,at.rejecting this argument,the thyssen court recognized that most maritime claims give rise to both in personam and in rem claims and stated,
under,the plaintiff may seize the ship in rem,obtain a bond,and proceed with arbitration.if the plaintiff wins but can not recover against the owner of the vessel,it can recover against the vessel itself.the in rem claim serves as a way of making sure that a plaintiff can recover if it wins in arbitration.any interpretation of the federal arbitration act that allowed an in rem claim to proceed after the failure of an in personam claim would undermine the purpose of the act with respect to maritime proceedings.

ultimately,relying on thyssen,the district court concluded,
the in rem and in personam claims are closely intertwined.in the case at bar the court agrees with pemex assertion that the action was timely filed as it was initiated pursuant to an ongoing arbitration and pursuant to the first lou.this action is not by the statute of limitations under cogsa.an arbitration was timely commenced,and the arrest of the vessel was sought in order to protect pemex interests during that arbitration.
petroleos mexicanos refinancion king a,wl,at.the district court conclusion that the complaint was not is hence rooted in two separate grounds pemex filed its complaint pursuant to the first lou and pemex complaint related back to the timely filed arbitration because pemex in rem claim was closely intertwined with its in personam claim.we will address each predicate of the district court decision,beginning with its determination that pemex complaint was filed pursuant to the first lou.
king david challenges the district court determination that the additional security was issued pursuant to the first lou.the district court did not explain what it meant by pursuant to the first lou,namely whether the terms of cogsa,including its statute of limitations,come within the applicable law referenced in paragraph six of the first lou,irrespective of the seemingly unlimited right to later arrest the vessel provided for in the recital paragraph of the same document.
this is a unique situation.usually,lous serve as a complete substitute for the res and therefore contain of rights clauses preventing the holder of the lou from later arresting the vessel and providing that the holder rights shall be precisely the same as they would have been had the vessel,in fact,been taken into custody by the united states marshal under said in rem process,and released by the filing of claim of owner and release bond.cont l grain fed.barge lines,cir,aff,d.under the unique set of circumstances here,however,pemex retained the right to later arrest the vessel should its claim exceed the amount of the first lou.the first lou,therefore,was only a partial substitute for the res and it contractually guaranteed the right to later arrest the vessel.the question before this court is,how does this unique right to later arrest the vessel interact with the clause of paragraph six 
it is axiomatic in contract law that two provisions of a contract should be read so as not to be in conflict with each other if it is reasonably possible.keystone fabric laminates,fed.ins,cir.pemex argues that the right to later arrest the vessel is paramount,and does not address paragraph six clause.king david argues that paragraph six reserved all defenses of the vessel and tbilisi shipping,including the cogsa statute of limitations.we must construe the first lou so as to give meaning to both the recital paragraph and paragraph six,two reconcilable provisions.read in conjunction with one another,they provide that pemex retained the right to later arrest the vessel,subject to the cogsa statute of limitations.
we agree totally with thyssen characterization of in rem and in personam claims as often closely linked,but find its reasoning inapplicable in furnishing the answer to the question presented in this case.apparently,the district court extrapolated from thyssen and reasoned that the close intertwining of the in rem and in personam claims permitted the relation back of the in rem action to the in personam arbitration,making pemex complaint timely.however,neither the district court nor our own research discovered any case law to support the proposition that the mere fact of interrelation provides a basis for relation back or a tolling of the statute of limitations.
king david challenges the district court relation back reasoning,contending that the arbitration and in rem proceeding are separate actions,and we agree with its analysis.king david notes that the vessel was not a party to the timely filed arbitration.see marine transit dreyfus.does not contemplate the vessel or other property,which may be seized,as being the party to the arbitration agreement.the arbitration was properly commenced against tbilisi shipping in personam and the first lou was obtained to secure any award in favor of pemex issued by the arbitrators against tbilisi shipping.as the vessel was not a party to the arbitration,king david contends,the complaint can not relate back to the arbitration.
although the vessel was not a party to the arbitration,this is not due to a pleading error on pemex part.an in rem action is cognizable only in federal court therefore the vessel could not have been a party to the in personam arbitration.madruga superior court.this does not,however,preclude an aggrieved party from utilizing admiralty remedies where,as here,the parties have agreed to arbitrate any disputes.the federal arbitration act faa specifically addresses this concern 
if the basis of jurisdiction be a cause of action otherwise justiciable in admiralty,then the party claiming to be aggrieved may begin his proceeding hereunder by libel and seizure of the vessel or other property of the other party according to the usual course of admiralty proceedings,and the court shall then have jurisdiction to direct the parties to proceed with the arbitration and shall retain jurisdiction to enter its decree upon the award.
as the thyssen court correctly stated,the faa thus permits a plaintiff to seize a ship in rem,obtain a bond,and then proceed with arbitration.thyssen,at.if the plaintiff wins but can not recover against the owner of the vessel,it can recover against the vessel itself.the in rem claim serves as a way of making sure that a plaintiff can recover if it wins in arbitration.id.citations omitted.
thyssen followed the approach sanctioned by the faa and began an in rem proceeding in federal district court on a claim for cargo damages.id.at.in exchange for release of the ship,thyssen accepted an lou from the vessel insurer.id.after securing in rem jurisdiction with the lou,the suit in the district court was stayed for the action to proceed to arbitration in london pursuant to an arbitration agreement.id.at.the london arbitrators were appointed,but the parties agreed to allow the commercial court in london to decide whether or not thyssen claims were.english law,like cogsa,includes a time bar on claims.id.at.that court decided that the claims were indeed and dismissed thyssen claims.id.the case then returned to the federal district court which confirmed the arbitration award and disposed of all of thyssen claims.id.on appeal,thyssen argued that as english law does not grant arbitrators in rem jurisdiction,the london arbitrators could not adjudicate its in rem claim and therefore the arbitrators dismissal should have no bearing on its in rem claim.id.at.
the second circuit in thyssen rejected this argument,holding that as a lmost all maritime disputes generate both an in personam and in rem claim if plaintiffs were able to bring in rem claims in court after the failure of their in personam claims before an arbitrator,parties would have no incentive to arbitrate maritime matters.id.the second circuit ruling was thus predicated on not undermining the purpose of the faa with respect to maritime proceedings.id.at.this is the source of the close intertwining cited by the district court in this case.
while seemingly related,this reasoning has no application to the case before this court.in thyssen,the appellant sought a second bite at the apple,attempting to proceed in rem against the vessel after its arbitration against the ship owner was dismissed.here,pemex prevailed in arbitration,but failed to properly secure an award with seizure before the statute of limitations had run.although the faa clearly would have permitted pemex to proceed in rem to seize the vessel to secure a later arbitration award,pemex failed to fully secure its claim in rem when it accepted an lou that limited the amount of recovery to absent further in rem proceedings.see.had pemex secured its claim with a standard lou,the lou would have served as a complete substitute for the res and its claim would have been fully secured.had pemex secured its claim with a later in rem proceeding pursuant to the lou,and within the cogsa statute of limitations,its claim would have been fully secured.instead,pemex accepted an lou that was only a partial substitute for the res and failed to act in a timely manner.
thyssen illustrates that maritime cases almost always involve both in rem and in personam claims and that in relation to the faa,they are particularly closely linked,but thyssen did not sanction relation back of these distinct,albeit related,actions.
because we hold that a close interrelation does not provide a basis for relation back,this case is controlled by third circuit precedent.in claussen mene grande oil,cir,this court examined whether a seaman complaint filed in in the district of delaware alleging injuries sustained in was even though the seaman had originally filed a timely complaint alleging the same claims in the southern district of new york.in determining that the seaman second complaint did not relate back to his first complaint,the court explained,an argument that an earlier suit filed on these claims in the southern district of new york less than three years after the accident somehow tolled the statute of limitations for the present entirely distinct action,as filed years later in the district of delaware,is wholly without merit.id.at.similar to the seaman in claussen,pemex here attempts to avoid a statute of limitations by relating its in rem claim against the vessel back to an entirely distinct in personam arbitration against tbilisi shipping.
here,as in claussen,the claim has no merit.although a standard lou would have served as a complete substitute for the res,and thereby provided sufficient security for pemex eventual damage award,the first lou was not a typical lou.instead,it limited recovery to and required later in rem action to secure any additional amount pemex may have sought.although the first lou provided for a possible later arrest of the vessel,that subsequent in rem proceeding is distinct from the arbitration.the facts underlying both actions are the same,but the parties are different pemex and the vessel in the in rem action and pemex and tbilisi shipping in the arbitration.
the personification theory,while criticized by academics,remains fundamental to american admiralty practice and is the theoretical foundation of the maritime lien.salazar atlantic sun,cir thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed.admiralty law does not contemplate the concept of relation back of in rem and in personam claims and thyssen provides no persuasive guidance on that issue.usually,a party will secure in rem jurisdiction over a vessel,within the limitations period,before seeking arbitration,so as to secure a possible in personam award.but,as discussed,the facts before us are highly unusual.we are loathe to create an ad hoc framework to allow for such novel relation back.accordingly,we are comfortable resting this portion of our opinion on the formalistic distinction that the ship and the shipowner are separate parties.
furthermore,it does not appear that the doctrine of equitable tolling would be applicable in this case.e quitable tolling is proper only when the principles of equity would make the rigid application of a limitation period unfair.miller dep t of,cir quoting shendock,office of workers comp.programs,cir en banc alteration in original.equitable tolling generally applies in three scenarios where a defendant actively misleads a plaintiff with respect to her cause of action where the plaintiff has been prevented from asserting her claim as a result of other extraordinary circumstances or where the plaintiff asserts her claims in a timely manner but has done so in the wrong forum.lake arnold,cir.none of these circumstances is present in this case,and neither the parties nor the district court cited or analyzed any of the factors.accordingly,it does not appear that equitable tolling was applicable to make pemex complaint timely.
in sum,paragraph six of the first lou provides that t his letter is provided entirely without prejudice to any rights or defense which the said tibilsi tbilisi shipping may have under applicable law.we are satisfied that cogsa qualifies as applicable law because it is undisputed that cogsa was incorporated into the parties charter agreement.reading paragraph six in conjunction with the arrest provision in the recital paragraph,we construe the first lou as permitting later arrest of the vessel subject to the statute of limitations.we conclude that neither the closely intertwined nor relation back arguments dilute the potency of our reasoning.accordingly,as pemex did not file its in rem complaint until some nine years had passed,we hold that the cogsa statute of limitations extinguished the maritime lien on the vessel,and that the district court therefore lacked in rem jurisdiction to issue the warrant of arrest for the vessel.
the judgment of the district court will be reversed and the district court is directed to vacate the warrant of arrest,to cancel and discharge substitute security and to dismiss the complaint.
i disagree with the majority for two reasons.first,pemex seizure of the ship was appropriate because the in rem and in personam proceedings were essentially the same claim,and the former relates back to the latter.second,the seizure was justified by the specific contract provision contained within the lou that reserved pemex right to seize the ship at a later date in the event the amount of its claim against tbilisi exceeded.thus,i respectfully disagree with the majority and i would affirm the district court decision.
as the majority explains,under a charter agreement,the vessel tbilisi commenced a voyage on december,carrying a cargo of diesel oil and unleaded gasoline on behalf of pemex.sometime in december,the oil and gasoline,causing pemex to withhold the charter fee owed to tbilisi shipping as security for its damages.
four months after the damage to pemex cargo,tbilisi demanded arbitration to claim the withheld charter fee.the arbitration began in april,well within the statute of limitations provided in the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,app.et.
tbilisi shipping insurer issued a letter of undertaking lou to pemex on may.the lou outlines that,in consideration of pemex payment of the withheld fee of to tbilisi shipping,the insurer would guarantee payment of damages up to the amount of the withheld fee.in addition,the lou explains that pemex would forego seizing the tbilisi,except in the event pemex claim exceeds the amount of the security,namely.
the arbitration proceedings were unusually long,and as of march,there was still no resolution.pemex learned at that time that the vessel,now renamed the king a,would dock at a port in new jersey.in an effort to secure its loss,which was now clearly in excess of the guaranteed in the lou,pemex sought to seize the ship.the majority now claims that the march seizure of the ship was because it did not occur within cogsa statute of limitations.
relation back 
pemex claims that its seizure of the king a is not barred by cogsa statute of limitations because the seizure of a ship is an in rem proceeding that,under current admiralty principles,relates back to the filing of the arbitration proceeding.under this doctrine,an act done at a later time is deemed by law to have occurred at an earlier time.black law dictionary ed see also garvin city of philadelphia,cir noting that the relation back doctrine aims to ameliorate the harsh result of the strict application of the statute of limitations.thus,pemex argues that the seizure of the in rem be treated as though it occurred at the time that the arbitration in personam filed in april.
there is no doubt that the seizure of a vessel in rem and an arbitration in personam have long been interconnected proceedings in maritime law.as section of the federal arbitration act faa,et,states
