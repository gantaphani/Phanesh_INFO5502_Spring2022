plaintiff diesel repower entered into a contract with defendant islander investments.the contract required diesel to repower islander vessel hero.to repower hero diesel was required to recondition and install a diesel engine,including a transmission and propulsion system.in return for repowering,the contract required islander to pay diesel for a reconditioned diesel engine and propulsion system and an estimated to for labor,of which was.
the district court found that diesel reconditioned an engine and attached a false engine plate to the engine.however the engine smoked and produced inadequate horsepower.diesel continued working on the engine.while diesel worked on the engine islander allegedly failed to pay the balance on outstanding invoices.therefore,diesel ceased work.
procedural history 
diesel filed its complaint on december,invoking admiralty jurisdiction.the in rem complaint attempted to enforce a maritime lien and recover the balance due under the contract.the complaint alleged that islander breached the contract by not paying for engine components,materials,supplies and labor.
islander,also invoking admiralty jurisdiction,answered and filed counterclaims of breach of contract,fraud,and negligence.the counterclaims alleged that diesel breached the contract by negligently designing,reconditioning,manufacturing,and assembling the engine and propulsion system,and by installing the defective engine improperly in an untimely manner.islander alleges that diesel actions caused islander damage.the alleged damages include the failure to receive the repowered engine,the cost of additional work on hero,the cost of removing the defective engine,the loss of use of hero,shipyard and docking cost,and the cost of purchasing and installing a new engine.
on july,the district court entered an order stating that the case would be set for trial.on june,discovery ended.the day discovery ended islander filed a motion for leave to amend the pleadings.the motion requested that the court allow islander to change the style of the case provide an alternative basis for recovery of punitive damages and assert that,pursuant to the saving to suitors clause,the court should apply alabama state law and not federal admiralty law.
islander brought its proposed amended pleadings under diversity jurisdiction and admiralty saving to suitors clause.however,it asserted the identical claims as originally pleaded under admiralty jurisdiction.count one of islander answer and counterclaims states that diesel was required to replace a tandem drive detroit diesel propulsion system.islander says that diesel designed,manufactured,reconditioned,assembled,sold,delivered and installed a propulsion system that was not capable of turning hero propeller at a speed necessary for safe,economical,and seaworthy operation.islander also says that it needed hero immediately and diesel failed to give the contract priority vessel down status.islander asserts that because of diesel actions it incurred expenses in making necessary alterations,repairs and other modifications.
diesel objected to islander motion for leave to amend the pleadings.
the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.it granted the motion in part thus allowing the name of the plaintiff to be changed from diesel repower systems,to its new corporate name diesel repower,the court denied the remainder of the motion because the amendment regarding punitive damages would expand the factual basis of islander causes of action and the amendment regarding the substantive law would be futile because federal maritime law governs the case.
the court conducted a bench trial and found that diesel was not tortious or malicious but that it breached the contract.the court found that diesel breached the contract because diesel did not change the pistons to comply with manufacturer specifications the cylinder head assembly was not set up to manufacturer specifications and the transmission was not the type specified in the contract or its equivalent and could not handle the level of horsepower that the engine was supposed to produce.next,the court found that the contract limitation on liability clause was applicable.therefore the court entered judgment for islander in the amount of and ordered islander to return the engine to diesel.
after the court entered its judgment,islander filed suit in alabama state court against diesel president personally alleging fraud in the inducement fraud in the performance fraudulent concealment a pattern or practice of fraudulent activity and fraudulent transfer.in federal district court diesel filed a motion to enjoin islander from prosecuting the state court action.the district court granted diesel motion to enjoin on september,and wrote order to follow.islander appealed.on december,the district court entered an order that clarified its september,order and granted in part and denied in part the motion to enjoin.the district court enjoined counts through but not count.
on may,diesel filed a suggestion of bankruptcy.accordingly,on june,this court stayed this appeal pursuant to a.the bankruptcy case was closed on may.therefore by operation of law the stay has been lifted and we proceed.see c.
motion for leave to amend the pleadings 
islander raises nine issues on appeal.first,we consider whether the court erred in denying the motion for leave to amend the pleadings.
we use the abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a district court decision on whether to grant a motion for leave to amend the pleadings.see thomas farmville,cir.the court must grant litigant motion for leave to amend the pleadings when justice so requires.a.the supreme court reasoned 
in the absence of any apparent or declared as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,futility of amendment,leave sought should,as the rules require,be freely given.
foman davis,d.
by its amendment islander wanted to convert its counterclaims brought under admiralty jurisdiction,and thus subject to admiralty law,to claims brought under admiralty saving to suitors clause and thus governed by state law.in the motion for leave to amend the pleadings islander asserted the identical claims originally pleaded under admiralty jurisdiction.the district court denied the motion on the ground that the amendment would not change islander cause of action or the application of federal law as the substantive law of the case.thus,allowing the amendment would be futile.
in this appeal islander asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for leave to amend the pleadings because the motion was filed more than three months before the trial,and did not assert new claims but recast its current claims as state law claims,diesel did not object on prejudice grounds,and the court did not find the amendment would be prejudicial.
islander assertions miss the essence of the district court order.the district court reasoned that to allow islander amended answer and counterclaims would be futile because substantively it did not matter whether the case was brought under admiralty or diversity jurisdiction.the claims were the same and whether brought under admiralty or diversity jurisdiction the substantive law that the court must apply was admiralty law.
thus the issue is whether the district court erred when it held that admiralty law would control the substantive portion of the case even if the district court granted the motion for leave to amend the pleadings and thereby allowed islander to proceed under diversity jurisdiction.if substantive admiralty law controlled then the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for leave to amend the pleadings.
jurisdiction 
we turn to the analysis of whether the district court correctly held that admiralty law would apply under both admiralty and diversity jurisdiction.the district court has original jurisdiction exclusive of the courts of the states of any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,sa
