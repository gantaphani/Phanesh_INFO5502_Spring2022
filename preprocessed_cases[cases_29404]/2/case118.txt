this case arises out of the staten island ferry crash into a maintenance pier on october.it calls on us to determine whether the city of new york practice of allowing the staten island ferry to be operated with only a single pilot in the pilothouse necessarily meets the standard of reasonable care as a matter of law.the city,as owner and operator of the ferry,appeals from a decision of the district court for the eastern district of new york korman,rendered after a bench trial,finding the city negligent and denying limitation of liability.for the reasons stated below we affirm,holding that the city did not act with reasonable care when it allowed a single pilot to operate the staten island ferry without at least one other person in or near the pilothouse,aware of the navigational circumstances,and ready to render or summon assistance in the event of an emergency.
the andrew barberi was one of several large passenger ferries owned and operated by the new york city department of transportation between whitehall terminal at the southern tip of manhattan and george terminal,staten island.the ferry was feet long and displaced long tons it could carry up to passengers,but on the day of the accident it was carrying an estimated people.the ferry typical speed at full ahead was knots about miles per hour and sea trials revealed that it could come to a full stop from that speed in about feet and within seconds.the barberi was a ferry with a pilothouse containing steering and throttle controls at each end.the ferry was equally suited to traveling in either direction,thus avoiding the need to turn around after leaving or before entering its slip.
on october,at about,the barberi left manhattan on its regularly scheduled trip across new york harbor upper bay to staten island.although it was windy about to knots,the weather was clear and presented no problems for the ferry.the ferry was under the command of captain michael gansas,but for this trip assistant captain richard smith was at the helm.in addition to being licensed captains,both the captain and assistant captain were certified as pilots,as required by coast guard regulations.both had more than a decade of experience with the staten island ferry and had consistently received good performance reviews.gansas,who had no reservations about smith abilities to pilot the ferry,was not in the operative pilothouse for this trip he spent the trip in the aft pilothouse preparing for an upcoming coast guard inspection.smith was accompanied in the operative pilothouse by a deckhand,joseph selch,who was assigned as a lookout for the trip.selch later told investigators that he noticed no problems with smith and they had a normal conversation during the trip.senior mate robert rush was also in the pilothouse for the second half of the trip,but he had no assigned duties with respect to navigating the ship on this trip and was seated on the settee,a bench at the rear of the pilothouse,where he had no view of the navigational situation out the pilothouse windows.
as the ferry reached the kill van kull buoy off the north end of staten island,about yards or half a mile from the george terminal,smith released selch from his lookout duties so that he could go assist in preparations for docking.as selch left the pilothouse,smith stood up at the controls,as was his custom.the ferry was traveling at its normal speed,approximately knots,as it passed the buoy.at this speed,it would take about two minutes to reach the slip at george terminal.on typical trips,the ferries would begin to slow down at the buoy,but on this trip the crew and passengers told investigators that they did not hear the engines slow down.
shortly after selch left the pilothouse,smith lost conscious or situational awareness.the ferry went off course and crashed at full speed into a concrete maintenance pier about yards south of the slip at the george terminal.smith remembers nothing from the time selch left the pilothouse until the crash.doctors later determined that his condition was caused by fatigue.rush,who was still seated on the settee,recalled smith standing up at the controls,but did not notice anything amiss until he felt the ship crash and then heard smith exclaim,jesus.the impact tore a gash in the starboard side of the hull on the level and destroyed about square feet of the pier.ten passengers were killed.nineteen passengers were seriously injured,one of whom died two months later.passengers suffered minor injuries.
smith was years old and was on several prescription medications for high blood pressure,high cholesterol,insomnia,and chronic back pain.on the day of the accident smith reported to work exhausted.the day before he had been working around the house and babysitting for his grandchildren.his chronic back problems were causing him difficulty sleeping and during that night he took some prescription drugs for his back pain.at work the next morning,he failed to report his fatigue or any of his medical conditions or medications to gansas or anyone else,and,in fact,had previously falsely stated on a required coast guard form that he had no medical conditions and did not take any medication.
on august,smith pleaded guilty to eleven counts of seaman manslaughter in violation of,for negligently causing the deaths of passengers,and to one count of making false statements to the coast guard in violation of a.in his allocution,smith admitted that he was criminally negligent in operating the ferry without reporting his poor physical condition and the medications that he had taken that morning.smith was sentenced primarily to months imprisonment.
patrick ryan,the city director of ferry operations at the time,was also indicted on eleven counts of seaman manslaughter and several counts of making false statements and obstruction of justice.on april,he pleaded guilty to seaman manslaughter for allowing the ferries to be operated in a criminally negligent manner by not enforcing the city internal rule that generally required the captain and assistant captain to be together in the operating pilot house while the ferry was underway,and to making false statements to the coast guard about his practices when he was a ferry captain.ryan was sentenced to one year and one day in prison.
on december,the city initiated an action seeking to limit its liability as owner and operator of the ferry pursuant to the limitation of liability act.all other actions were enjoined and over claimants including the appellees asserted and claims against the city in the limitation action.after the district court denied the claimants motion for summary judgment,the parties agreed that the limitation issue would be decided by judge korman based on a stipulated record and without a live trial.
in a detailed opinion dated february,the district court denied the city petition to limit its liability.in re city of new york,d.the district court found that the cause of the accident was that the assistant captain,smith,who was piloting the ferry,lost conscious or situational awareness in the brief period after he had released the lookout,but before docking the vessel,and that the accident could have been avoided if the captain,gansas,had been present in the pilothouse with smith.the district court also found that ryan,the city director of ferry operations,was negligent for failing to enforce a rule or otherwise to guard against the foreseeable risk of pilot incapacitation,and that his negligence was a substantial cause of the accident.the city was therefore not entitled to limit its liability because the negligent acts that caused the casualty were within the city privity or knowledge.
this appeal followed.
it has long been the rule in this circuit that we review a district court factual findings for clear error,but we review its ultimate conclusion of negligence de novo.payne united states,cir ching sheng fishery united states,cir.
a panel of this court recently questioned our circuit continued adherence to the de novo standard of review for questions of negligence in the face of nearly unanimous disagreement by the other circuits and commentators,all of whom would apply a more deferential standard.payne,at.but the panel in payne declined to refer the issue to the court en banc because the outcome of that case did not turn on the standard of review.id.at.likewise in this case,because we would affirm the district court finding of negligence on either a de novo or clear error standard of review we do not deem this case to be a suitable one to consider calling for en banc reconsideration.
we note only that the practice in our circuit is not so different from that of the other circuits.because the determination of negligence is so bound up with the specific and complex facts of each individual case,we have stated on more than one occasion that the trial court finding should ordinarily stand unless the court manifests an incorrect conception of the applicable law.esso standard oil gasbras sul,cir quoting radovich cunard steamship,cir see also cleary lines,cir per curiam.and even circuits that apply the clearly erroneous standard to negligence findings will apply a de novo standard when considering whether the district court properly defined the standard of care used to evaluate the conduct of the parties.in re paducah towing,cir see,clement united states,cir noting in negligence case that de novo review applies if district court applied erroneous legal standard to the facts miller united states,cir our review of what standard of conduct should have been utilized in a negligence finding is a legal question.the ultimate determination of negligence is a question that contains both factual and legal aspects,see moore federal practice a ed although appellate courts may differ in their exact formulations,most appear to take an approach that gives more deference to the trial judge when the question is predominantly factual and less deference when the question is predominantly legal.united states selioutsky,cir we review mixed questions of law and fact either de novo or under the clearly erroneous standard depending on whether the question is predominantly legal or factual.internal citations omitted.
the limitation of liability act limits the owner of a vessel liability for,among other things,any loss,damage,or injury by collision done,occasioned,or incurred without the privity or knowledge of the owner,to the value of the vessel and pending freight.b.the statute therefore alters the normal rules of vicarious liability.instead of being vicariously liable for the full extent of any injuries caused by the negligence of the captain or crew employed to operate the ship,the owner liability is limited to the value of the ship unless the owner himself had privity or knowledge of the negligent acts.see,carr pms fishing,cir tug ocean prince,united states,cir.where the owner of a ship is a corporation,the corporation is not entitled to limit its liability where the negligence is that of an executive officer,manager or superintendent whose scope of authority includes supervision over the phase of the business out of which the loss or injury occurred.coryell phipps.thus the city is not entitled to limit its liability if director of ferry operations patrick ryan admitted failure to enforce a rule,requiring the captain and assistant captain to be in the operative pilothouse while the ship is underway,constituted negligence that was causally connected to the crash.
under admiralty law,the owner of a ship in navigable waters owes a duty to its passengers to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.kermarec compagnie generale transatlantique,d.the city argues that reasonable care does not require two pilots in the pilothouse at all times and therefore ryan admitted failure to enforce a policy requiring two pilots was not negligent.counsel for the claimants conceded at oral argument that reasonable care might not always require two pilots in the pilothouse,but the claimants nevertheless argue that the city was negligent here because it took no steps to mitigate the risk of sudden pilot incapacitation.thus we must engage in the familiar task of determining the standard of reasonable care under the circumstances of this case.as we explain below,we believe that strict enforcement of nothing less than a rule,which essentially requires two licensed captains to be in the pilothouse at all times,would exceed the standard of reasonable care.but we find that the standard of care embodied in a coast guard regulation applicable to similarly sized ships carrying a similar number of passengers,which essentially calls for at least one person other than the pilot to be on watch in or near the pilothouse,accurately reflects the minimum safety precautions that the city must take under the circumstances of this case.because ryan failed to enforce not only a strict rule but any policy that would meet even this minimum applicable standard of care,we find that the negligence was within the privity or knowledge of the city.
in determining what the standard of reasonable care requires,we are mindful of the formula first stated by judge learned hand in united states carroll towing,cir whether the burden of adequate precautions b is less than the gravity of the injury l discounted by the probability that the injury will occur p,whether b pl.
the gravity of the potential injury if a ferry carrying more than a thousand commuters were to crash at full speed is well illustrated by the harm actually done in this loss of eleven lives,injuries to many more,and substantial property damage.
the burden to the city of taking adequate precautions is relatively small.the district court determined that enforcing a rule requiring gansas to be in the pilothouse with smith at all times would have avoided the accident because gansas could have taken control of the ship once he noticed that smith was incapacitated.the staten island ferry already employed two licensed captains for the barberi,as it was required to do by coast guard regulations so the cost of the additional precaution in this case would not have involved hiring another licensed officer.instead,the cost is reflected in whatever activity the second captain would have to forgo while the ship is underway in order to be in the this case,for example,gansas was preparing for a coast guard inspection during the trip so that preparation would have to be done at another time or by another by any displeasure felt by the city employees at the inconvenience of having to be present in the pilothouse at all times.on balance,the burden to the city of having a second person in or near the pilothouse at all times is relatively small.
the probability that the injury would occur in this the pilot would become suddenly incapacitated at a crucial moment and remain incapacitated long enough for the ship to crash into very small.but the risk,while small,is undoubtedly foreseeable.the city freely admits that it was aware of the possibility that a pilot could become suddenly incapacitated,just as any reasonable person would be aware of that possibility.nevertheless,the city submits that sudden incapacitation is a foreseeable risk that we accept all the time in myriad contexts without demanding stringent precautions.for example,every day millions of people drive cars without first ensuring that there is someone who will take the wheel if they are suddenly incapacitated.and the city points out that in other forms of mass transportation,such as buses and trains,we generally accept the risk that a driver could be suddenly incapacitated without ensuring that a second driver is waiting,ready at the controls to take over.surely the risk of death is at least as great with a bus traveling at miles per hour on a crowded highway as with a ferry traveling miles per hour in a harbor.yet we do not require two drivers on a bus.
it is true that in many contexts we do not consider the risk of sudden incapacitation to be an unreasonable one.see,page keeton et,prosser and keeton on torts at ed.no person so much as rides a horse without some chance of a runaway,or drives a car without the risk of a broken steering gear or a heart attack.but these are not unreasonable risks.but whether the risk of sudden incapacitation is considered unreasonable depends very much
