background 
on february,the cape flattery ran aground on a submerged coral reef off barbers point,oahu.cape flattery titan maritime llc,d.in response,the coast guard issued a notice of federal interest in connection with the vessel grounding and activated unified command to respond to the threat of potential oil discharge.id.under,cape flattery,as the vessel owner,was liable for the cost of removing the vessel from the reef.a a.cape flattery entered into an agreement with titan maritime to salvage the vessel the agreement.cape flattery,d at.
under the agreement,titan agreed 
to use its best endeavors to salve,as quickly as reasonably practicable,the cape flattery by means of the personnel and equipment specified in schedule,such other personnel equipment as may from time to time be agreed between titan and the owners representative and deliver the cape flattery to a place of safety.

the agreement also contains an arbitration clause.the clause,titled arbitration,provides 
any dispute arising under this agreement shall be settled by arbitration in london,england,in accordance with the english arbitration act and any amendments thereto,english law and practice to apply.
titan succeeded in removing the cape flattery from the reef and eliminating the threat of oil discharge.id.at.at some point in the cape flattery grounding or removal,however,serious damage was inflicted on the reef.under b,cape flattery is liable to the united states government for all damage to natural resources resulting from the grounding.see id.a e ach responsible party for a vessel which poses the substantial threat of a discharge of oil is liable for the damages specified in subsection b of this section that result from such incident.id.a owner of vessel is a responsible party id.b a damages recoverable under a include d amages for injury to or destruction of natural resources,which shall be recoverable by a united states trustee.on august,the government informed cape flattery that it would likely be liable for damages in excess of million.cape flattery,d at.
on october,cape flattery filed a complaint in the federal district court for the district of against titan,seeking indemnity contribution based on the damage titan allegedly caused through gross negligence in removing the cape flattery from the reef.see a person may bring a civil action for contribution against any other person who is liable or potentially liable under this act or another law.id.c parties rendering care,assistance,or advice in removing vessels only liable when grossly negligent.the complaint also sought to enjoin titan from requesting arbitration.
on december,titan filed a motion to compel arbitration based on the arbitration clause in the agreement.cape flattery,d at.on march,after several rounds of briefing and a hearing,the district court denied the motion.the court first rejected titan argument that english law governed the arbitrability of the dispute.id.at.the court concluded that under mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,federal arbitrability law applies to determine arbitrability.cape flattery,d at.the court noted the legal uncertainty concerning whether federal arbitrability law allows parties to agree to apply arbitrability law.id.it concluded that even if parties are allowed to contract out of federal arbitrability law,the parties in this case had not done so.id.at.
the district court then concluded that under federal arbitrability law,the current dispute did not aris e under the agreement.id.at.it first concluded that under our decisions in mediterranean enterprises,ssangyong construction,cir,and tracer research national environmental services,cir,the arising under language in the agreement signifies a narrow arbitration agreement.cape flattery,d at.under these cases,claims that relate only peripherally to the agreement are not arbitrable.id.at quoting tracer,at.the district court then held that because titan duty to prevent foreseeable damage to the coral reef is based on a federal statute and is thus separate from and above and beyond defendant duties under the agreement,id.at,cape flattery tort claims against titan are not arbitrable.

iii.discussion 
titan argues that the district court erred in deciding that federal arbitrability law applies,and in its application of that law.we address titan arguments in turn.
choice of arbitrability law 
the first issue is what law applies to determine the arbitrability of the dispute.titan argues that the agreement provision that a ny dispute arising under this agreement shall be settled by arbitration in london,england,in accordance with the english arbitration act and any amendments thereto,english law and practice to apply constitutes an agreement that english law applies to determine the arbitrability of a dispute.cape flattery argues that parties can not contract out of federal arbitrability law,and that even if they can,the parties did not do so in the agreement.
the federal arbitration act faa,et,creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const.neither the supreme court nor this court has decided whether federal arbitrability law allows contracting parties to agree to apply a law of arbitrability to interpret a given arbitration agreement.if the parties can agree to apply a arbitrability law,it is also undecided how courts should determine whether the parties have so agreed.
parties power to agree to non federal arbitrability law 
in defending their respective positions regarding the power of contracting parties to agree to a arbitrability law,cape flattery and titan rely on different supreme court decisions.cape flattery relies on mitsubishi motors.mitsubishi and soler entered into a sales agreement that included the following arbitration clause all disputes,controversies or differences which may arise between mitsubishi and soler out of or in relation to this agreement or for the breach thereof,shall be finally settled by arbitration in japan in accordance with the rules and regulations of the japan commercial arbitration association.at first two alterations in original.when a dispute arose,soler sued mitsubishi alleging,among other things,violations of the sherman act.id.at.in determining whether the dispute was arbitrable,the supreme court stated t he first task of a court asked to compel arbitration of a dispute is to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.the court is to make this determination by applying the federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the faa.id.at quoting moses cone,at.
cape flattery argues that because mitsubishi does not suggest any exception to the application of federal arbitrability law,courts should always apply federal arbitrability law to determine the arbitrability of a given dispute.it notes that district courts,including the district court in this case,have suggested,without directly holding,that federal arbitrability law may apply despite an agreement to apply arbitrability law.see cape flattery,d at suggesting that there may be a rule that the court should apply federal law in determining arbitrability of an agreement governed by the faa regardless of any provision chloe z fishing,odyssey re london,d,holding that for agreements covered by the faa,the faa provides an overriding basis for why the law under which the case arises must apply to the question of whether these parties agreed to arbitrate their disputes.
titan does not contest that federal arbitrability law applies generally,but argues that federal arbitrability law requires courts to enforce contracting parties agreement to apply arbitrability law.titan relies primarily on volt information sciences,board of trustees.in volt,the parties agreed to arbitrate any disputes pursuant to the arbitration rules in the california arbitration act caa.id.at.the question before the court was whether the faa preempts the caa and requires that,in disputes subject to the faa,federal rules of arbitration apply.id.at.the court noted that the faa preempts state laws that render arbitration agreements entirely unenforceable.id.at,citing southland keating,see also doctor associates,casarotto,faa preempts state law conditioning enforceability of arbitration clause on compliance with special notice requirements applicable only to arbitration provisions.it held,however,that the faa does not mandate certain rules of arbitration.there is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate.volt,at.titan argues that just as federal law will enforce an agreement to arbitrate pursuant to rules of arbitration,federal law should enforce an agreement to determine arbitrability based on arbitrability law.
we agree with titan that,based on volt,contracting parties have the power to agree to apply arbitrability law.the court stated in mitsubishi that courts should determine arbitrability by applying the federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.mitsubishi,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.but neither party in mitsubishi argued that anything other than federal arbitrability law applied to the dispute.thus,although mitsubishi states that federal arbitrability law applies to disputes under the faa,it does not address whether federal arbitrability law allows the parties to agree to a arbitrability law.volt statement that the federal policy is to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate,at,strongly suggests that courts should respect contracting parties agreement to be governed by arbitrability law.
our conclusion is consistent with decisions of our sister circuits.largely for the reasons just discussed,the fifth circuit held that contracting parties could agree to apply texas arbitrability law in a case governed by the faa.ford nyl care health plans of gulf coast,cir.several other circuits have applied arbitrability law in cases governed by the faa with less detailed discussion.see,motorola credit uzan,cir applying swiss arbitrability law in re oil spill by the amoco cadiz off the coast of france march,cir applying english arbitrability law.
we therefore hold that courts should enforce contracting parties agreement to have arbitrability governed by arbitrability law.
parties choice of arbitrability law 
the more difficult question is how courts should decide whether the parties have agreed to apply arbitrability law.the general rule in interpreting arbitration agreements is that courts should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of chicago,kaplan.the general rule would require the court to see whether the parties objectively revealed an intent to apply arbitrability law.id.if we were to apply the general rule in this case,it may well be that english law would apply to determine arbitrability.
there are,however,some situations concerning the determination of arbitrability in which courts require a higher showing of intent.in kaplan,the supreme court held that courts should be cautious in determining whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.the court held that c ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that they did so.id.at citation,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.under kaplan,the usual presumption that exists in favor of the arbitrability of disputes is replaced by a presumption against the arbitrability of arbitrability.id.the court reasoned that the question of whether a given dispute is arbitrable 
arises when the parties have a contract that provides for arbitration of some issues.in such circumstances,the parties likely gave at least some thought to the scope of arbitration.and,given the law permissive policies in respect to arbitration,one can understand why the law would insist upon clarity before concluding that the parties did not want to arbitrate a related matter.on the other hand,the question of who primarily should decide arbitrability is rather arcane.a party often might not focus upon that question and,given the principle that a party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration,one can understand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity on the who should decide arbitrability point as giving the arbitrators that power,for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge,not an arbitrator,would decide.
id.at internal citations omitted.
courts have taken different approaches to the question of how to determine whether the parties have agreed to apply arbitrability law.the fifth circuit in ford appears to have applied standard contractual analysis in concluding that texas arbitrability law applied.it held that the combination of a clause providing that any claim must be settled in accordance with the texas general arbitration act a,underlined statement on the first page of the agreement reading,notice this agreement is subject to arbitration under the texas arbitration act and the fact that the agreement drafters opposed arbitration all demonstrated that the parties intended texas law to govern the scope of the arbitration clause.ford,at.
the third circuit,on the other hand,has held that a general provision is not enough to displace federal arbitrability law.becker autoradio,becker autoradiowerk gmbh,cir.several district courts have taken the same approach as the third circuit.in chloe z fishing,d at,the district court concluded that a general provision is insufficient to overcome the overriding basis the faa creates for applying federal arbitrability law.in sea bowld marine group,ldc oceanfast,d,the district court held that a general provision was ambiguous concerning whether the parties specified the relevant arbitrability law.it reasoned that the agreement here contains and arbitration provisions that both reference foreign law.while these designations are relevant to the substantive law to be used,and the location of arbitration,they say nothing,and mean nothing,as to the threshold issue of arbitrability.id.at.the district court in this case generally followed the reasoning in sea bowld.see cape flattery,d at.
in concluding that a general provision does not constitute an agreement to apply arbitrability law,none of these cases specifically relied on kaplan.however,just as kaplan was concerned about interpreting a general arbitration agreement to constitute an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability,these courts were concerned about interpreting a general provision to constitute an agreement to apply arbitrability law.we share these concerns and conclude that our approach to this question should be guide
