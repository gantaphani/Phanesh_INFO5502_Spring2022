maritrend,appeals the district court ruling that it waived its maritime lien on a vessel to which it had provided stevedoring services.we reverse and remand this case for the entry of judgment in favor of maritrend on its in rem claim against the vessel.
background 
in july,maritrend contracted with serac company shipping serac,the agent for an undisclosed charterer,to provide stevedoring services to the sevilla wave in the port of new orleans.after providing those services,maritrend sent invoices to serac but never received payment 
seeking to recover the value of its services,maritrend filed an in personam action against serac in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana.maritrend later amended its complaint to add an in rem claim against the sevilla wave,which it simultaneously seized.pimpernel shipping company,pimpernel,claimed ownership of the vessel and filed an answer to the amended complaint.
after a full bench trial,the district court found serac liable in personam to maritrend for the claimed amount,plus interest but the court rejected maritrend in rem claim against the sevilla wave,concluding that maritrend had relied solely on serac credit for payment for its stevedoring services and had therefore waived its maritime lien against the vessel.maritrend timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the standard of review for a bench trial is well established findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed de novo.however,t he clearly erroneous standard of review does not apply to those factual findings made under an erroneous view of controlling legal principles.
creation and waiver of federal maritime liens 
congress enacted the federal maritime lien act fmla in to bring uniformity to the law governing maritime liens although congress recodified the fmla in as part of the commercial instruments and maritime liens act cimla it did not make any substantive changes to the law section a of the current codification provides that 
a person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner has a maritime lien on the vessel may bring a civil action in rem to enforce the lien and is not required to allege or prove in the action that credit was given to the vessel 
necessaries include stevedoring services and there is no dispute here that maritrend provided such services to the sevilla wave.it is likewise undisputed that serac had the authority to procure necessaries,including stevedoring services,for the sevilla wave.the only question before us is whether maritrend relied on the credit of the sevilla wave for payment for its services.
prior to the initial passage of the fmla,the law was settled that a federal maritime lien could arise only for necessaries furnished in reliance upon the credit of the vessel.credit to the ship,as distinguished from credit to the owner,was essential to the existence of a maritime lien.although a of the cimla,like former of the fmla,provides that the supplier is not required to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel,the supreme court has held that this language serve s only to remove from the creditor the burden of proving that he had relied on the credit of the vessel.we have therefore recognized that the idea of credit to the vessel being a prerequisite to a lien,and the concomitant principle that credit to the owner negates the lien,are still very much with us today.thus,under a,a presumption arises that one furnishing supplies to a vessel acquires a maritime lien,and the party attacking this presumption has the burden of establishing that the personal credit of the owner or charterer was solely relied upon.to meet this burden,evidence must be produced that would permit the inference that the supplier purposefully intended to forego the lien.
because the statutory presumption in favor of a maritime lien is a strong one,we are usually reluctant to conclude that a supplier has waived its lien we have held that the supplier primary reliance on the personal credit of a charterer is insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption.for example,in gulf trading transportation v.the vessel hoegh shield hoegh shield,the plaintiff brought an in rem action against a vessel to which it had supplied fuel within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states pursuant to a contract with the vessel english charterer after delivering the fuel,the plaintiff sent an invoice to the charterer in london,but the charterer never made payment in the action against the vessel,the vessel owner argued that the plaintiff had waived its maritime lien because according to the deposition testimony of the plaintiff credit agent,the fuel was supplied on the charterer credit there had been no conversations between the plaintiff and the vessel owner the plaintiff never sent an invoice to the vessel owner and the plaintiff took no action against the vessel until the charterer became insolvent although these facts clearly indicated that the plaintiff was relying on the charterer credit when it supplied the fuel,we held that they were insufficient to establish sole reliance on that credit or to permit an inference that the plaintiff purposefully intended to forgo its lien on the vessel 
similarly,we concluded in gulf oil trading caribe mar,that sole reliance on personal credit,as opposed to the credit of the vessel,was not established even though the creditor had a business relationship with the charterer,had extended large amounts of credit to the charterer in the past,and was aware of the prohibition of lien clause in the contract thus,the simple existence of a business relationship and credit arrangements could hardly be realistically construed as an intent or purpose by the creditor to waive its lien on the vessel.
despite our prior caselaw reiterating the difficulty of proving that a creditor has waived its lien,two cases subsequent to hoegh shield and gulf oil trading identify the circumstances that support a finding of waiver.in equilease sampson,this court determined that sufficient evidence exists to find that a creditor waives its right to a federal maritime lien when a creditor testimony that he relied solely on entities besides the vessel for credit is combined with unambiguous statements in the creditor original brief indicating the credit relied on was not the vessel the fact that the creditor also testified that t here was no intent for us to give up anything did not disturb the district court finding that any federal maritime lien that existed was waived because the bulk of the evidence and testimony showed that creditor did not rely on the credit of the vessel 
in racal survey,count fleet,this court found that a creditor had clearly indicated its intent to forgo a federal maritime lien based on the testimony of the creditor company president when asked whether the creditor was relying on the credit of the ship,the creditor president testified that there was no reliance because the customer was a stevedoring company,not the vessel or the vessels owner,and thus he had no contract or dealings with the ship in finding waiver,this court stated that a lmost nothing is more conclusive than such testimony on the critical issue of the reliance necessary to preserve the lien 
taken together,equilease and racal survey stand for the proposition that testimony regarding which party a creditor relied on can be determinative of whether the maritime lien was waived.but those decisions did not weaken the heavy burden placed on the party attacking the presumption.if the evidence shows that the claimant relied on the credit of the vessel to some extent,we will not find a waiver of the maritime lien 
c.the evidence at trial and review of the district court decision 
a bench trial in this case was held on january.at trial,the district court heard testimony and was presented exhibits on behalf of both parties.maritrend president william bergeron bergeron testified that maritrend initially rel ies upon the contract that we have with the party,but we always rely on a maritime lien right,as a fallback position.indeed,in his testim
