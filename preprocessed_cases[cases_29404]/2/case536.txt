background 
natco is engaged in the marine construction and dredging business.natco contracted with moody sons,moody and mobro marine,mobro for the lease of a crane to be used in a construction project that natco had undertaken in new york harbor.the crane was a,crawler crane that was to be secured to a barge named the mobro.moody and mobro contract with natco required them to produce the crane and barge in jacksonville,florida.natco entered into a contract with moran for the towage of the barge from jacksonville to new york.en route to new york,moran tug encountered stormy weather off the north carolina coast.the crane was lost overboard in the rough seas,and the mobro suffered minor damage as a result of the crane coming loose.
natco brought suit in admiralty against moran,moody,and mobro,and sought a declaration of the parties rights and liabilities under their respective contracts.moran counterclaimed against natco for breach of the towage agreement,for attorneys fees under that contract,and for indemnification or contribution if moran were found liable to moody and mobro.moody and mobro also counterclaimed against natco for breach of contract and collection costs,including attorneys fees.moran filed a crossclaim against moody and mobro for indemnification or contribution in the event it was found liable to natco.finally,moody and mobro crossclaimed against moran for negligence.all of the claims were tried by the district judge without a jury except for the crossclaims,which moran,moody,and mobro voluntarily dismissed prior to trial.
the district judge found that,under the language of natco towage contract with moran and charter contract with moody and mobro,natco had assumed the responsibility among all of the parties to ensure that the crane was properly secured to the mobro.the district judge also found that natco had failed to establish that moran was negligent in transporting the barge.accordingly,the district judge rendered judgment against natco on its claims and in favor of moran,moody,and mobro on their counterclaims.the only matters left unresolved by the district judge in this initial order were moran,moody,and mobro claims for attorneys fees the district judge ordered supplemental briefing to resolve these claims.natco appealed the district judge judgment on liability but settled with moody and mobro after filing its notice of appeal.this court affirmed the district judge judgment with respect to the issues between natco and moran.natco.moran towing,cir unpublished table decision.

second party natco shall fit out and maintain the tow for the voyage in a proper and sufficient manner in all respects,including,among others,lights,signaling equipment,manning,and shall comply with all requirements of the tow underwriters surveyors,and second party shall indemnify moran,the tug and their underwriters against,and hold them harmless from,any and all loss,damage or liability arising out of,or in any way contributed to by,unseaworthiness of the tow,or by any deficiency in,or failure of,its equipment or the personnel on board.
moran shall have all rights at law for the full towing charge and for all additional compensation and charges due it under this agreement,including cost of recovery of same.
the district judge found that,under the language of paragraph four,moran was entitled to recover the attorneys fees that it had incurred in defending the claims brought against it by natco,in prosecuting its counterclaim against natco,and in defending against moody and mobro crossclaim,but not for fees incurred in establishing its right to indemnity.moran submitted a claim for approximately in attorneys fees,but after reviewing the billing records,the district court awarded moran.natco now appeals the district judge interpretation of the indemnity agreement awarding moran its attorneys fees alternatively,natco contests the amount of attorneys fees awarded.
ii.discussion 
the prevailing party in an admiralty case is not entitled to recover its attorneys fees as a matter of course.noritake hellenic champion,cir attorneys fees generally are not recoverable in admiralty unless they are provided by the statute governing the claim,the nonprevailing party acted in bad faith in the course of the litigation,or there is a contract providing for the indemnification of attorneys fees.id.at.the district judge construed the terms of the towage contract to provide for natco indemnification of moran attorneys fees,a decision that natco now appeals.we review the district judge construction of the indemnity clause de novo.bankatlantic blythe eastman paine webber,cir.our duty is to examine the language of the indemnity provision in an effort to determine how broad of a scope the parties intended the clause to have.id.in determining this intent,contract provisions should be given their natural and most commonly understood meaning in light of the subject matter and circumstances,and the language should be read in common with the other provisions of the contract.id.quoting gibbs air canada,cir.
natco asserts that the indemnification provision of the towage contract was not intended to cover indemnification for any of the attorneys fees that the district judge awarded to moran the parties use of the phrase any and all loss,damage or liability in the indemnity provision,however,is consistent with the language of numerous other indemnification clauses that we have found to encompass attorneys fees despite the fact that attorneys fees were not specifically mentioned.see,signal oil gas barge,cir.finding attorneys fees recoverable when indemnity was provided for loss,cost,damage,expense,claims,actions and liability hobbs teledyne movible offshore,cir finding attorneys fees recoverable when indemnity was provided for loss,expense,claim or demand olsen shell oil,cir finding attorneys fees recoverable when indemnity was provided for all claims,demands and causes of action of every kind and character brown seaboard coast line,cir finding attorneys fees recoverable when indemnity was provided for any and all loss,cost,damage and expense stephens chevron oil,cir finding attorneys fees recoverable when indemnity was provided for any loss,expense,claim or demand.moran attorneys fees fall under this contract language because,after excluding moran claims for attorneys fees incurred in establishing its right to indemnity,moran is seeking to recover its attorneys fees not as attorneys fees qua attorneys fees,but as part of the reasonable expenses incurred in defending against the claim s.noritake,at.t he rule with respect to the kinds of damages covered by an indemnity agreement is that general,broad words operate to encompass most legitimate expenses,and it would be unrealistic not to regard the considerable sums moran spent in attorneys fees defending these claims and prosecuting its counterclaim as a legitimate loss.brown,at.
while moran attorneys fees constitute loss,moran may not seek indemnification from natco for them under the language of the towage agreement unless the fees are found to be arising out of,or in any way contributed to by,unseaworthiness of the tow,or by any deficiency in,or failure of,natco equipment or the personnel on board.natco urges us to read this provision narrowly and argues that,under the maxim contra proferentum,we must construe the language of the contract against moran because moran drafted it.however,contra proferentum is something of a fallback canon,and the foremost goal of contract construction is to give effect to the intent of the parties.bivens gardens office,barnett banks of florida,cir.th
