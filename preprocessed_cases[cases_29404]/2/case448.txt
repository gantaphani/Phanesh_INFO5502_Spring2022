we confront the constitutional limits of our extraterritorial jurisdiction in yet another major operation on the waters of the eastern pacific ocean.anatoli zakharov appeals his jury conviction for conspiracy to possess over kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute on board a vessel,and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute on board a vessel.he challenges the amended maritime drug law enforcement act mdlea,codified at app,as unconstitutional on the grounds that congress removed jurisdiction from the enumerated elements of the maritime offense that must be decided by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.he also challenges the district court failure to suppress evidence of his confession and the sufficiency of evidence supporting his convictions.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm zakharov convictions.first,the mdlea is constitutional as applied to zakharov.facts underlying statutory jurisdiction were not contested,and determination of constitutional nexus jurisdiction is properly within the province of the court,not the jury.second,we find the evidence sufficient to establish the required nexus between the united states and the defendant activities.third,the district court properly determined that zakharov confession should not be suppressed because the fourth amendment does not apply to aliens outside of the united states.fourth,the delay in bringing zakharov before a magistrate judge was not unreasonable under federal rule of criminal procedure a in light of the time necessary to transport him by sea to the united states.finally,evidence of zakharov confession was properly admitted,and sufficient evidence existed to allow any rational trier of fact to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.we uphold the convictions.
but,because we can not reliably determine from the record whether the sentence imposed would have been materially different had the district court known that the federal sentencing guidelines were advisory,united states ameline,cir en banc,we grant a limited remand as to the sentence imposed.
zakharov was a crew member aboard the svesda maru,a fishing vessel registered in the country of belize.on april,the vessel was miles off the coast of southern mexico in international waters when it was spotted by the crew of the uss rodney davis,a united states navy frigate performing drug interdiction and maritime patrol duties in cooperation with the united states coast guard.a coast guard law enforcement detachment boarding team deployed from the davis in a small boat and attempted to make contact with the svesda maru.the boarding team observed that the svesda maru was flying the belizean flag.when the svesda maru did not respond after she was hailed by the navy frigate,the coast guard team boarded the svesda maru and conducted a search of the vessel including a space accountability search.the davis boarding team was relieved by a second coast guard crew on the fifth day of the search.the second crew discovered more than kilograms of cocaine cleverly secreted in an area behind a fuel tank of the vessel 
following discovery of the cocaine,the coast guard seized the svesda maru pursuant to our bilateral treaty with belize and with the express permission of the belizean government.the svesda maru crew,all russians and ukrainians,were taken into custody aboard the coast guard cutter active.they were kept together on the deck of the cutter for the ten days it took to reach san diego,california.none of the svesda maru crewmen was interrogated while on board the coast guard ship.
the cutter arrived in san diego on may.prior to zakharov initial appearance before a magistrate judge,an agent of the united states drug enforcement administration dea interviewed him through a russian interpreter.the agent advised zakharov of his constitutional rights,and zakharov signed a miranda waiver.the interview lasted approximately one and to two hours.the agent testified that zakharov initially denied knowledge of the cocaine but was eventually persuaded to talk.zakharov then admitted that he was to be paid for the trip and that he and the crew knew that the vessel contained cocaine,but he claimed that only the captain knew all of the details of the voyage.he also claimed that this was his first experience smuggling cocaine.
later that day,a federal magistrate judge found probable cause to support the complaint against zakharov.zakharov initial appearance in court was on the following day.the magistrate ordered his detention without bail.zakharov was indicted on may,and he pled not guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute aboard a vessel and one count of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute aboard a vessel,in violation of the mdlea,app.a,c c,f j,and.in november,a jury in the southern district of california convicted zakharov on both counts.he was sentenced to months in custody to be followed by five years of supervised release.
zakharov first argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate his claims under the mdlea.he claims that the district court erred in failing to submit facts necessary to establish jurisdiction to the jury,and the government failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a nexus between the united states and the seized cocaine.
the mdlea prohibits drug smuggling activity by any person on board a vessel of the united states,or on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,or who is a citizen of the united states or a resident alien of the united states on board any vessel.app.a.the statute provides 
jurisdiction of the united states with respect to vessels subject to this chapter is not an element of any offense.all jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.
id.f.in united states,cir,we distinguished between statutory jurisdiction and the nexus requirement of constitutional jurisdiction.a court determines statutory jurisdiction by asking whether the vessel at issue is a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,which mdlea defines according to the ship nationality if any,its location,and any relevant agreements between the united states and foreign nations regarding the enforcement of united states criminal laws on vessels or in territorial waters subject to the nation jurisdiction.see app.c.in contrast,a court determines constitutional jurisdiction based on the nexus between the united states and the attempted criminal transaction.see,at.both jurisdictional inquiries must be satisfied where the mdlea is being applied extraterritorially.united states perlaza,cir.
zakharov argues that f violates the fifth and sixth amendments of the united states constitution and the requirement of apprendi new jersey,d,that all facts necessary to constitute a statutory offense must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.he asserts that congress can not define away facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense by labeling certain facts as of the crime.he argues that,by adopting f,congress impermissibly removed factual questions of statutory and constitutional nexus jurisdiction from the hands of the jury.we review de novo questions regarding the constitutionality of a statute.see united states bynum,cir.
in perlaza we made clear that,notwithstanding f,contested facts underlying the existence of statutory jurisdiction must be resolved by a jury perlaza,at.we ruled in light of the fifth and sixth amendments that such facts though not formally identified as elements of the offense charged must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at citation and quotation omitted.accordingly,insofar as zakharov claims that statutory jurisdiction is an element of the crime that must be proven to the jury,that argument is now moot.
moreover,there is no factual question pertaining to statutory jurisdiction for the jury to decide.there is no dispute for purposes of that the district court possessed statutory jurisdiction in the instant action the svesda maru was a vessel registered in belize,and the coast guard received consent to enforce united states law aboard her both expressly from the belizean government and pursuant to our bilateral treaty with belize see id.at app.c c extending statutory jurisdiction to a vessel registered in a foreign nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objection to the enforcement of united states law by the united states.
unlike statutory jurisdiction,the constitutional nexus requirement is not an express element of the crime but is a judicial gloss applied to ensure that a defendant is not improperly haled before a court for trial,at.to accord with due process,we require a sufficient nexus between the united states and the defendant activities before exerting jurisdiction over foreign vessels see perlaza,at see also,at,at united states medjuck,cir united states khan,cir united states davis,cir.nexus is a constitutional requirement analogous to minimum contacts in personal jurisdiction analysis,at.nexus has been treated as a of an offense both before and after apprendi,d.see bynum,at considering apprendi and stating that if a statute does not expressly require proof of a nexus between the criminal conduct and the united states,proof of such a connection is not an element of the offense citation omitted,at nexus is part of the jurisdictional inquiry,but it is an inquiry for the court,not the jury.
in this context,mdlea f merely codified this court longstanding rule that the constitutional nexus inquiry is a matter for the court determination.see,at citing and holding that,in the context of the mdlea,nexus is an inquiry for the court,not the jury.accordingly,we reject zakharov contention that the constitutional nexus inquiry must be submitted to a jury.
the next question is whether the district court properly determined that the evidence sufficed to establish a nexus between the united states and zakharov activities.see,at.due process requires a district court to find sufficient nexus even when the flag nation has consented to the application of united states law see perlaza,at.nexus may be established by a showing that an attempted transaction is aimed at causing criminal acts within the united states or that the plan for shipping the drugs was likely to have effects in the united states.united states medjuck,cir citing,at.in,we considered that the markings on the seized cocaine matched markings in a database of other cocaine seized in the united states the united states was the most likely destination for a large load of cocaine and the location of the vessel and the maps on board were consistent with a course bound for the united states.at.
here,extensive evidentiary hearings were held to determine whether sufficient nexus with the united states existed to establish jurisdiction.the district court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that the shipment of cocaine was likely to have effects in the united states.the court found that four of the twelve markings on the cocaine bundles were found previously in the united states based on the type of vessel,its location,and the kinds of navigational charts on the vessel,the cocaine was destined for the united states and it was unlikely that russia or europe was the intended destination for the cocaine.the district court based the last two findings on its determination that the testimony of zakharov expert witness,a former dea agent,was not as credible or persuasive as that of the government expert,a dea strategic intelligence analyst with over eighteen years of experience.see spain rushen,cir w hen a trial judge finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses,each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence,that finding,if not internally inconsistent,can virtually never be clear error.quoting anderson bessemer city,d.
zakharov makes very specific evidentiary challenges to the district court findings and questions its credibility determination.zakharov suggests that,because the government expert testified that russia also has a drug trafficking market and that europe was a possible market,it was erroneous for the district court to believe that the united states was the likely destination for the drugs.but many of the statements on which zakharov relies could support either witness conclusion in essence,zakharov claim constitutes no more than an argument that it would have been reasonable for the district court to believe his expert witness instead of the expert witness for the united states.zakharov argument does not create a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed by the district court in its credibility and factual findings.silva woodford,cir quotation and citation omitted.thus,the district court did not err.
next,we must determine whether these facts support a finding that the drug shipment would likely have had effects in the united states.the only significant distinction between the facts establishing nexus in and those in the instant case is that here there are fewer cocaine bundle markings that match bundles found previously in the united states.we considered matching markings to be t he most persuasive evidence in.at.there,five of the markings had been found only in the united states,while five others had been found predominately in the united states and in countries involved in the shipment of cocaine.id.further,three sets of the markings have been found together in seizures in the united states.id.
the connection is not as substantial here.only four of the twelve markings had been found previously in the united states.three of the matches may have been particularly significant,however,because they were found on cocaine packages in the united states roughly contemporaneously with the seizure of the svesda maru.
in any event,the location of the vessel,the large amount of cocaine,the types of navigational charts on board,and the existence of some matching logos are sufficient indicators of nexus for the exercise of united states jurisdiction to not be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.see id.at citing davis,at.we hold that the district court properly found sufficient nexus between the united states and the seized cocaine to support its jurisdiction.
zakharov contends that evidence of his statements made upon arrival in san diego should be suppressed because there was undue delay in determining probable cause in violation of the fourth amendment and in bringing zakharov before a magistrate judge in violation of federal rule of criminal procedure a.we review de novo a district court denial of a motion to suppress evidence,but the factual findings underlying the ruling are reviewed for clear error.united states,cir.we review for clear error the district court determination that delay is reasonable under rule a.see united states,cir.
zakharov claims that the united states failure to utilize helicopters,radios,fax machines,and other technology to obtain a probable cause determination before he was physically present in the united states constituted undue delay under the fourth amendment.the district court summarily held that zakharov could not prevail on the fourth amendment claim because the fourth amendment does not apply to aliens outside united states territory.in support the court cited united states,d,in which the supreme court held that the fourth amendment does not apply to searches and seizures by the united states against a alien in a foreign country.see id.at.see also id.at.a liens receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the united states and developed substantial connections with this country.citation omitted.the court noted that a warrant requirement for overseas searches could significantly disrupt the ability of the political branches to respond to foreign situations involving our national interest.id.at.
this holding forecloses zakharov claim.here,the alleged unconstitutional delay took place outside of the united states in international waters,and there is no suggestion that zakharov had any substantial connection to this country.see united states barona,cir holding that fourth amendment
