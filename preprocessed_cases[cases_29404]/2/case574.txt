in this original proceeding,globalsantafe gsf asks this court to direct the silica mdl pretrial court to vacate its order remanding this case to the trial court where it was originally filed.the pretrial court concluded that chapter of the civil practice and remedies code,applicable to certain cases and under which the case had been transferred to the pretrial court,was inoperative because it was preempted by the jones act,a federal maritime statute.we agree with gsf that the general procedural framework set out in chapter is not preempted,although we also hold that chapter provision relating to silica claims is preempted.we conditionally grant mandamus relief.
background 
in may,john lopez sued gsf under the jones act,alleging injuries from exposure to asbestos and silica while employed by gsf aboard a vessel lopez filed his jones act suit in state court,as allowed by federal law in the district court of harris county.
two years later,chapter of the civil practice and remedies code became effective adopting unique procedures for actions alleging injuries from silica and asbestos we focus here on the requirements relating to silica claims 
section requires silica claimants to serve a detailed expert report on each defendant.among other requirements,the report must be prepared by a physician who has specific qualifications and the physician or other medical professional employed by and under the direct supervision and control of the physician must perform a physical examination of the claimant and take a detailed occupational,exposure,medical,and smoking history 
the report must verify that the claimant suffers from one or more diseases based on recognized symptoms it must attach all medical evidence supporting the physician opinion the report must also verify that the physician has made certain causation findings regarding silica exposure and the claimant observed ailments the report must make these causation determinations depending on the type of disease asserted 
if the claimant is asserting a claim for silicosis,the report must verify a minimal level of impairment under section b,requiring at least class or higher impairment due to silicosis,according to the american medical association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment 
section a provides that t he mdl rules apply to any action pending on the date this chapter becomes law in which the claimant alleges personal injury or death from exposure to asbestos or silica,subject to certain exceptions.relevant mdl rules are set out in rule of the texas rules of judicial administration,created by this court pursuant to legislative authority the district court of harris county is the mdl pretrial court for suits alleging silica exposure generally,the mdl pretrial court decides all pretrial matters and then remands the case to the trial court 
section a provides,for actions filed on or after the statute september,effective date,the expert report must be served not later than thirty days after the defendant answers or otherwise appears.for actions filed after the effective date,the defendant may file a motion to dismiss if the claimant fails to file an expert report or files one that does not comply with section asbestos claims or silica claims 
for actions like this one filed before september,the mdl rules are inapplicable if the plaintiff files an expert report complying with the expert report requirements of chapter the report is due within days of chapter september,effective date if the plaintiff misses this deadline for filing a compliant report,the defendant may file a notice of transfer to the mdl pretrial court section b provides 
if the claimant fails to serve a report complying with section or on or before the day after the date this chapter becomes law under subsection a,the defendant may file a notice of transfer to the mdl pretrial court.if the mdl pretrial court determines that the claimant served a report that complies with section or on or before the day after the date this chapter becomes law,the mdl pretrial court shall remand the action to the court in which the action was filed.if the mdl pretrial court determines that the report was not served on or before the day after the date this chapter becomes law or that the report served does not comply with section or,the mdl pretrial court shall retain jurisdiction over the action pursuant to the mdl rules.
the notice of transfer automatically transfers the case without further court order subject to a motion to remand filed in the mdl court and a remand by that court if it determines that the plaintiff had filed a compliant report absent a successful motion to remand,cases thus transferred to the mdl court remain in that court until the claimant serves a chapter report 
contending that lopez did not file a report complying with chapter,gsf filed on december,a notice of transfer to the silica mdl pretrial court.lopez responded,arguing chapter was preempted by the jones act and urging the mdl pretrial court to remand the case to the trial court.the mdl pretrial court agreed.gsf sought mandamus relief in the court of appeals,which also sided with lopez by holding that chapter is preempted by federal law.gsf now seeks mandamus relief in this court directing the mdl pretrial court to vacate its remand order.
ii.discussion 
a.the asbestos litigation crisis addressed by chapter 
the statute enacting chapter and other codified provisions begins with legislative findings concerning asbestos and silica litigation.the legislature stressed the existence of an asbestos litigation crisis,noting that texas leads the nation in such suits it found that this problem is exacerbated by the filing of suit,sometimes to avoid limitations problems,before the claimant is suffering from any illness affecting his daily life the legislature made further findings that this litigation has resulted in the bankruptcies of many companies,the loss of thousands of jobs,enormous litigation expenses,overcrowded dockets that hamper the ability of seriously ill claimants to seek redress,and the bleeding of company assets lost to a crush of claims by those who are not functionally or physically impaired.it warned of a similar crisis looming over actions,evidenced by a recent spike in such claims,and raising some of the same concerns applicable to the asbestos crisis the statute further provides 
it is the purpose of this act to protect the right of people with impairing and injuries to pursue their claims for compensation in a fair and efficient manner through the texas court system,while at the same time preventing scarce judicial and litigant resources from being misdirected by the claims of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos or silica but have no functional or physical impairment from or disease 
to address the legislature stated purposes and concerns,chapter includes three components on which we focus.first,by requiring detailed expert reports early in the litigation process,chapter endeavors to assure that claims are not brought and pursued unless they are supported by reliable expert evaluations of the claimant 
second,chapter attempts to consolidate silica and asbestos cases in a single mdl court for pretrial proceedings the obvious advantages of such consolidation include the more efficient resolution of recurring issues by a court that acquires expertise in cases with related factual,procedural,and substantive legal issues and consistent rulings in such cases.the legislature has authorized mdl transfers where they will serve the convenience of parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of the consolidated actions.it has empowered the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to transfer related cases to mdl courts for consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings.in creating the silica pretrial mdl action,the panel observed 
one virtue of transferring related cases to a single pretrial judge is that issues,once raised,will be decided the same way in the future.a consistent and steady judicial hand at the helm should in fact promote agreements because lawyers will know where the court stands on recurring issues.as contested issues arise,the pretrial judge will make consistent rulings,which can then be reviewed by the appellate courts as appropriate.this,we think,serves rule goal that our system give related cases consistent and efficient treatment 
third,chapter requires claimants in some cases to establish a minimal level of impairment before their cases can proceed 
these procedures serve the stated legislative purpose of conserving judicial and litigant resources and directing those resources to persons most suffering from asbestos and silica injuries.of these three chapter components,we conclude that only the third is preempted by the jones act the other two are not preempted and should be followed in jones act cases 
mandamus relief is warranted 
a writ of mandamus will issue only if the trial court committed a clear abuse of discretion for which the relator has no adequate remedy at law the adequacy of an appellate remedy must be determined by balancing the benefits of mandamus review against its detriments in evaluating benefits and detriments,we consider whether mandamus relief will safeguard important substantive and procedural rights from impairment or loss.in addition to impairment of rights,we consider whether mandamus will allow the appellate courts to give needed and helpful direction to the law that would otherwise prove elusive in appeals from final judgments.
by remanding the case to the trial court,the mdl pretrial court in effect held that,at least as to lopez,chapter in its entirety is preempted by the jones act.this is so because chapter prescribes,as a result of a plaintiff failure to file an adequate section report,the defendant right to file a notice of transfer to the mdl pretrial court,as described above.that court then retains,dismisses,or remands the case back to the trial court depending on whether the report is filed.
the mdl pretrial court conclusion that chapter was preempted by the jones act was erroneous and mandamus relief is appropriate to correct the error.as we recently held in in re mcallen medical center,another case concerning legislatively mandated expert reports,mandamus relief is available when the legislature has enacted a statute to address findings that traditional rules of litigation are creating an ongoing crisis,and the purposes of the enacted statute would otherwise be defeated.these precise grounds for mandamus relief are again presented.here,the legislature has already balanced most of the relevant costs and benefits for us.
jones act preemption principles 
the jones act provides that a seaman injured in the course of employment may elect to bring a civil action at law against the employer.the act has been described as remedial,for the benefit and protection of seamen who are peculiarly the wards of admiralty.
the preemption of state law by the jones act is a unique corner of federal preemption law that must be applied with recognition that jones act cases can be brought in federal or state court while state law must sometimes yield to the need for a uniform and harmonious system of federal maritime law,this limitation still leaves the states a wide scope.congress could preempt the entire field of maritime law,but has instead left the states with a considerable legislative and judicial competence in the maritime field.where congress has acted in the admiralty area,state regulation is permissible,absent a clear conflict with the federal law.
federal preemption in this context does not always lend itself to simple resolution.as the united states supreme court observed in one jones act case,it would be idle to pretend that the line separating permissible from impermissible state regulation is readily discernible in our admiralty jurisprudence,or indeed is even entirely consistent within our admiralty jurisprudence.
the court,however,has laid down some general principles.on the one hand,substantive rights created by congress via the jones act must prevail over inconsistent state substantive law even where the suit is brought in state court on the other hand,it has held that state law characterized as procedural is not preempted the court has also recognized that federal maritime law follows a reverse erie doctrine of sorts,employing the use of substantive federal maritime law in state courts but recognizing that state procedural law can be followed 
our own cases have recognized this general proposition that a state court hearing a jones act case must apply substantive federal maritime law but follow state procedure,and have acknowledged the reverse erie nature of state court adjudication of jones act claims unfortunately,a simple rule of jones act that such cases litigated in state court follow federal substantive law and state procedural be fashioned from the extant jurisprudence.for example,even as to substantive remedies,we have recognized that state law remedies that do not conflict with federal law remedies are available to seamen.
in southern pacific jensen the united states supreme court held that a state workers compensation law was preempted by federal general maritime law.in an standard,the court held that a remedy is preempted by federal maritime law if the state remedy works material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law,or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.because the state law remedy in jensen was wholly unknown to federal maritime common law,incapable of enforcement by the ordinary processes of any court,and inconsistent with congressional policy to encourage investments in ships,as indicated by two federal statutes,the court held that the state remedy was preempted by federal law 
in american dredging miller,the court held in a jones act case that a louisiana rule making inapplicable the doctrine of forum non conveniens in maritime cases was not preempted by federal maritime law looking to the jensen standard quoted above,the court noted that the federal doctrine of forum non conveniens is a doctrine of general application and did not originate in admiralty therefore,the louisiana rule did not work material prejudice to a characteristic feature of general maritime law although recognizing that the state rule produced some disuniformity,the court rejected the argument that,under the jensen standard,the rule interfered with the proper harmony and uniformity of federal maritime law the court reasoned that the uniformity requirement is not absolute,especially on matters of procedure it noted that uniformity of process is not required by admiralty law,that the doctrine of forum non conveniens is nothing more or less than a supervening venue provision,and that venue goes to process rather than substantive which among various competent courts will decide the case.the court also noted it had previously held that venue in jones act cases brought in state court should be decided under state law and that j ust as state courts,in deciding admiralty cases,are not bound by the venue requirements set forth for federal courts in the united states code,so also they are not bound by the federal venue rule so to speak of forum non conveniens.
application of preemption principles to this case 
provisions 
the requirements embedded in chapter to assure reliable expert confirmation of diseases are not preempted by the jones act.nothing in the jones act exempts a seaman claiming a disease from establishing,through reliable medical proof,that he in fact suffers from such a disease.federal cases,beginning with daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,have in recent years established standards for the admission of expert testimony that focus on the trial court role in determining the reliability of such testimony.texas cases have developed similar standards that draw heavily from federal jurisprudence both federal and state law require expert testimony grounded in the methods and procedures of science.
to the extent that jones act jurisprudence recognizes a special standard for proving causation federal cases have held that this causation standard does not exempt jones act cases from the general rules for
