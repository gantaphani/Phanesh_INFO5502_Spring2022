in this personal injury action,the plaintiffs appeal a september,order granting defendant united states motion for summary judgment and dismissing without prejudice the plaintiffs claims against defendants algonac fire department,john stier,russ seder,jerry doan,and joe doan.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for the united states and remand the case for further proceedings,with the plaintiffs claims against the other defendants reinstated.
background 
on the night of august,richard and virginia sagan took their boat to little muscamoot bay near algonac,michigan.they intended to spend the night in the bay with their friends greg grizdowski and karen drobot.the sagans tied their boat to grizdowski boat in shallow water.at around,after he had been drinking for several hours,richard sagan took off his clothes and dove into the bay.his head struck the bottom of the bay,which was less than three feet deep at the point of sagan entry.his spinal column between the and levels was severed on impact.
realizing that her husband was in trouble,sagan jumped into the water,lifted sagan head,and screamed that he was not breathing.sagan dragged sagan toward the boat,yelling at her husband to wake up.sagan and grizdowski tried unsuccessfully to lift sagan onto grizdowski boat and then onto the sagans boat.grizdowski performed resuscitation on sagan,who began to breathe and moan.sagan breathing was impeded by water in his lungs.he told grizdowski that he had no sensation in his hands.
at,sagan used the radio on her boat to contact the macomb county sherriff department.at,the algonac fire department arrived on the scene in a boat.three minutes later,the united states coast guard arrived by boat and informed those present that a rescue helicopter was on its way and would take sagan to the hospital.sagan was secured to a backboard on the deck of the algonac fire and rescue boat.according to sagan,captain joe doan of the algonac fire department insisted that sagan immediately be taken to a hospital via an ambulance that was waiting a mile away from the boats.
the plaintiffs contend that the coast guard seized control of the situation and prevented the algonac boat from leaving,demanding instead that they wait for a coast guard helicopter.sometime after,the coast guard helicopter arrived on the scene shortly after the helicopter arrived,it was determined that the backboard to which sagan had been secured was incompatible with the device needed to lift him to the helicopter.the rescuers agreed that transferring sagan to a compatible backboard would risk further injury,and that instead the algonac fire department boat should transport sagan to the waiting ambulance.sagan was transferred to the ambulance at approximately 
sagan became a quadriplegic as a result of his dive into shallow water.within a month of his injury,he began to suffer from pneumonia,which his doctors attributed to the spinal injury effects on his breathing,to his having inhaled water,to his having suffered from hypothermia.he required complicated pulmonary care,including frequent suctioning,the use of albuterol,atrovent and serevent breathing treatments,and percussion and postural drainage therapy.he required assistance to perform most daily activities,including eating,bathing,and going to the bathroom.sagan also had numerous respiratory problems,including impaired swallowing and ineffective airway clearance and tracheostomy.he was unable to breathe effectively without ventilator assistance.
on february,the sagans sued the united states pursuant to the suits in admiralty act.et.their complaint alleged that the united states coast guard failed to exercise due care while attempting to rescue richard sagan after he dove into shallow water,and that the coast guard failure to exercise due care caused exacerbated injuries to sagan.
richard sagan died on august.according to the death certificate,the immediate cause of death was the quadriplegia from which sagan had suffered for approximately two years,and the underlying cause was pneumonia.
on august,plaintiff virginia sagan filed a second amended complaint in which she alleged that defendants algonac fire department,john stier,russ seder,jerry doan,and joe doan acted negligently toward richard sagan,and that their negligence proximately caused exacerbated his injuries.these defendants were all part of the effort to rescue sagan but were not associated with the coast guard hereinafter they will be called the algonac defendants.
the parties conducted discovery.on september,the defendants filed motions for summary judgment.a hearing was held on november,and the parties presented arguments in support of and in opposition to the motions.
in a memorandum opinion and order dated september,the district court granted defendant united states motion for summary judgment and dismissed without prejudice the claims against the algonac defendants for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see sagan united states,d.the district court found that the plaintiffs had failed to present enough evidence that the united states proximately caused sagan injuries to survive summary judgment.the district court then held that because the claim against the united states was dismissed,the claims against the algonac defendants must also be dismissed,because those claims were before the district court based on supplemental jurisdiction.
the plaintiffs filed this timely appeal in it,they allege that the district court erred in concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the united states negligence proximately caused richard sagan injuries.the plaintiffs ask that their claims against all parties be reinstated and that the matter be remanded to the district court.they further request that on remand,the case be assigned to a different district court judge to preserve the appearance of justice.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the judge is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a genuine issue for trial exists only where there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.id.at.
the plaintiffs claim against the united states 
the suits in admiralty act siaa is the exclusive remedy against the united states for maritime torts in contrast to the federal tort claims act,the siaa does not incorporate state tort law,inasmuch as maritime tort law is federal law.good ohio edison,cir.the siaa does not itself create a cause of action against the united states.see good,at.rather,a plaintiff must show that the united states would be liable under maritime tort law for the same conduct.
the united states coast guard does not have an affirmative duty to rescue persons in distress.federal law merely provides that the coast guard shall establish and operate rescue facilities and that it may render aid to protect persons and property at any time such facilities are available.see.however,once the coast guard undertakes a rescue operation,it must act with reasonable care.see patentas united states,cir.its actions are judged according to the good samaritan doctrine.see id.at.under this doctrine,a defendant is liable for breach of a duty voluntarily assumed by affirmative conduct,even when that assumption of duty was gratuitous.see id.citing indian towing united states.the restatement second of torts has described the doctrine as follows 
one who undertakes,gratuitously o
