milton rivera was injured cleaning the oil tank of a barge moored in new york harbor.soon thereafter,clean water of new york,which had subcontracted the work to rivera employer,found itself involved in a negligence action in a new york state court.see folksamerica reinsurance clean water of new york,d.clean water notified its insurer of the action,and the insurer successor in interest,folksamerica reinsurance company,went to federal court seeking a declaration that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify clean water.id.at.the insurance contract at issue contained a shiprepairers legal liability sll policy coupled with a modified comprehensive general liability cgl policy collectively,the policy.id.at.the district court block,determined that the contract was neither wholly nor primarily maritime in nature and dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.folksamerica appeals,and we vacate and remand because we find that the primary objective of the contract was to establish marine insurance.
background 
the parties,folksamerica and clean water,are a reinsurance company and a ship tank cleaning business,respectively.folksamerica is the successor in interest to christiania general insurance corporation of new york.id.at.on behalf of christiania,trident marine managers,a managing general agent of marine insurance,issued an insurance policy to eklof marine corporation,the corporate parent of clean water.folksamerica,christiania,and clean water are all new york corporations.
clean water cleans the tanks of coastal and vessels in new york harbor and prepares vessels for the shipyard and for changes of cargo.sometime prior to,clean water contracted to clean the oil tanks of barge.id.the barge,an vessel,was moored in the kill van kull tidal strait,a navigable waterway within new york harbor.see id.union maintenance corporation supplied clean water with workers for the cleaning,and on august,rivera,a union maintenance employee,was injured on the job.see id.rivera,perhaps overwhelmed by fumes,lost his grip on a ladder and tumbled backwards into an oil tank.thereafter,rivera brought suit against clean water in the civil court of new york,kings county,principally alleging negligence.id.
clean water sought defense and indemnification under the policy id.the policy lists over a dozen named insureds,consisting of eklof marine and its subsidiaries all of the insureds are marine companies whose business operations relate entirely to either ship repair,marine oil transport,marine cargo transport,or,in the case of clean water,ship tank cleaning.the policy has two sections defining coverage,section i,comprehensive general liability and section ii,shiprepairers legal liability.id.at.shared liability limits govern these sections the policy has one premium.clean water asserted its insurance claim under the cgl section of the policy.
on june,folksamerica filed a declaratory judgment action against clean water in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.folksamerica alleged admiralty jurisdiction and sought voidance of the policy,rescission,and a declaration that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify clean water.clean water raised various defenses,a counterclaim seeking reformation of the policy,and a challenge to the district court subject matter jurisdiction.
both sides moved for summary judgment.in defending the court admiralty jurisdiction,folksamerica contended,since the policy was issued to maritime companies,clearly covers their marine interests,and the underlying accident was on board a vessel in navigable waters,it is a policy of marine insurance.the admiralty question had implications beyond conferring federal jurisdiction.folksamerica pressed the court to employ the federal maritime doctrine of uberrimae fide,or utmost good faith,which provides that the parties to a marine insurance contract are held to the highest degree of good faith,whereby the party seeking insurance is required to disclose all circumstances known to it which materially affect the risk.atl.mut.ins.balfour maclaine int l in re balfour maclaine int l,cir hereinafter balfour internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.folksamerica asserted that clean water failed to disclose that it performed tank cleaning on others vessels and that the policy was therefore void.
clean water argued that folksamerica could not invoke admiralty jurisdiction.it characterized the cgl section of the policy as a standard all risk policy and contended that the maritime risks covered by the policy were merely incidental at best.the district court agreed.folksamerica,d at.
the court focused on the cgl section of the policy and found it did not constitute marine insurance.id.at.relying on benedict on admiralty,the court explained that,for a contract to have maritime character,there must be present a direct and proximate judicial link between the contract and the operation of the ship,its navigation or its management afloat.id.at quoting benedict on admiralty,at ed.the court characterized the cgl section as a standard comprehensive general liability policy of the type used by many businesses to cover a variety of losses which may arise in general operations.id.at.contrasting cgl insurance with the three traditional forms of marine insurance,cargo insurance,and protection and indemnity insurance,the court concluded that the cgl section simply lacks the genuinely salty flavor necessary to constitute a maritime contract.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court declined to consider the sll section.id.at.it reasoned that,while admiralty jurisdiction exists where the elements are merely incidental in an otherwise maritime contract,id.at citing atl.mut.ins.balfour maclaine int l,cir hereinafter atlantic mutual internal quotation marks omitted,coverage under section i can hardly be considered incidental to the policy as a whole,id.at.the court dismissed the complaint,and folksamerica timely appealed.
discussion 
this appeal turns on what would seem a simple inquiry is the policy a maritime contract giving rise to admiralty jurisdiction see jeffcott aetna ins,cir.unfortunately,there are few clean lines between maritime and contracts.norfolk ry.james kirby,pty,d.the boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts are conceptual rather than spatial,id.quoting kossick united fruit,d,and defined by the purpose of the jurisdictional protect maritime commerce,see exxon cent.gulf lines,d citing ins.dunham,wall,and sisson ruby,d.the supreme court has adopted a approach in defining these boundaries,see sisson,at.scalia,concurring,and has instructed that p recedent and usage are helpful insofar as they exclude or include certain common types of contract,kossick,at.
while t he precise categorization of the contracts that warrant invocation of the federal courts admiralty jurisdiction has proven particularly elusive,ingersoll milling mach.bodena,cir quoting leasing oceanic operations,cir,the abiding instruction of the supreme court is that we should look to the contract nature and character to see whether it has reference to maritime service or maritime transactions,norfolk ry.at quoting pac.hall.marine ry.shipbuilding.see dunham,wall.at.therefore,the contract subject matter must be our focal point.see,exxon,at.dunham,wall.at.
a.a threshold inquiry 
several of our cases,however,require that,prior to inquiring into the subject matter of the contract,we first make a threshold inquiry into the subject matter of the dispute.balfour,at.before attempting to categorize contractual rights as maritime or,a federal court must first consider whether an issue related to maritime interests has been raised.atlantic mutual,at see balfour,at thypin steel asoma,cir sirius ins.uk collins,cir.therefore,in examining whether admiralty jurisdiction encompasses a claim,a federal court must initially determine whether the subject matter of the dispute is so attenuated from the business of maritime commerce that it does not implicate the concerns underlying admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.atlantic mutual,at emphasis added.
this court has twice encountered disputes with connection s with maritime commerce simply too speculative and attenuated to justify admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.see balfour,at.in both atlantic mutual and balfour,this court considered claims for coffee that was lost from a mexican warehouse.see atlantic mutual,at balfour,at.the claims arose under an insurance policy cover ing cargo during land transport and warehousing,as well as during ocean carriage.sirius,at see balfour,at atlantic mutual,at.in both cases,the insurer filed declaratory judgment actions seeking determinations that the claimed losses had not been sufficiently substantiated.see balfour,at atlantic mutual,at.this court invoked its threshold inquiry and found admiralty jurisdiction lacking.see balfour,at atlantic mutual,at.we concluded that the disputes were too attenuated from maritime commerce to sustain admiralty jurisdiction because the insurance claims involved good without any inherently maritime character,sirius,at was designated for land transportation only,never became marine cargo,and never entered maritime commerce.see atlantic mutual,at balfour,at see also sirius,at.
here,the district court did not conduct this threshold analysis.in contrast to the above cases,the parties dispute concerns an insurance claim based on a injury sustained by a ship cleaner aboard an vessel in navigable waters.the business of ship maintenance has long been recognized as maritime and the insurance claim arising out of a related onboard injury has more than a speculative and attenuated connection with maritime commerce,atlantic mutual,at.coffee lost from a mexican warehouse clearly has little to do with the business of maritime commerce.id.however,it is fair to say milton rivera became a casualty of the business of maritime commerce the moment he tumbled from the tank ladder aboard the barge accordingly,this case easily survives the threshold inquiry.
moreover,we note some uncertainty as to the extent to which this court threshold inquiry test survives the supreme court most recent admiralty decision,norfolk southern railway james kirby pty,which the supreme court introduced as a maritime case about a train wreck.at.that decision involved a contract for the transportation of goods from australia to alabama.id.at.the dispute concerned a railroad liability for machinery damaged during a train derailment.id.at.the machinery had been transported by ship from sydney,australia,to savannah,georgia,and was en route from savannah to huntsville,alabama,when the train derailed.see id.at.the court focused entirely on the underlying contract and stated,to ascertain whether a contract is a maritime one,we can not look to whether a ship or other vessel was involved in the dispute,as we would in a putative maritime tort case.id.at.focusing on the contract subject matter,the court found admiralty jurisdiction.see id.at.although norfolk southern railway is readily distinguishable from atlantic mutual and machinery in norfolk southern railway had been shipped through maritime absence of any discussion by the supreme court of a threshold inquiry akin to that found in our precedents is notable.we simply highlight this discrepancy and leave for a more appropriate case the question of how norfolk southern railway might circumscribe our threshold inquiry doctrine,if at all.
b.the subject matter of the contract 
what then is the subject matter of the contract in question under the old,now outdated rule,admiralty jurisdiction was said to be reserved to contracts,claims,and services purely maritime,rea v.the eclipse.emphasis added.the test has,however,been loosened considerably.sirius,at parallel citations omitted.this court has recognized two exceptions to the general rule that mixed contracts fall outside admiralty jurisdiction.transatlantic marine claims agency,ace shipping,cir.the first of those exceptions,which folksamerica does not assert here,is that a federal court can exercise admiralty jurisdiction over a mixed contract if the claim arises from a breach of maritime obligations that are severable from the obligations of the contract.hartford fire ins.orient overseas containers lines uk,cir see,compagnie francaise de navigation a vapeur bonnasse,cir.the second exception,which folksamerica presses,allows courts to exercise admiralty jurisdiction where the elements of a contract are merely incidental to the maritime ones.transatlantic marine claims agency,at see sirius,at.in examining this incidental exception in the context of insurance policies,this court has often noted whether the portions of the examined policy were subject to separate premiums.see,balfour,at sirius,at atlantic mutual,at.
once again,the recent pronouncement of norfolk southern railway calls for reconsideration of our precedent.frequently,this circuit and others have examined the incidental exception in the context of intermodal transportation contracts,shipment contracts with sea and land components.see hartford fire ins,at transatlantic marine claims agency,at see also,danzig,berkshire fashions,hakusan ii,cir kuehne nagel ag geosource,cir.the court in norfolk southern railway critiqued the analysis employed in these cases,noting,it seems to us imprecise to describe the land carriage required by an intermodal transportation contract as incidental realistically,each leg of the journey is essential to accomplishing the contract purpose.at.the supreme court suggested a shift in analysis.the important question should not be whether the components of a bill of lading are incidental that analysis might encourage separate contract negotiations and curb the efficiencies present in an intermodal contract,see id.at,rather,should be whether the shipment contract primary objective is to accomplish the transportation of goods by sea,id.at.in pursuing this latter inquiry,the court explained that a bill of lading character as a maritime contract is not defeated simply because it also provides for some land carriage,id.at,and concluded that the intermodal contract before it was maritime conceptually,so long as a bill of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea,its purpose is to effectuate maritime thus it is a maritime contract geography,then,is useful only in a limited sense if a bill sea components are insubstantial,then the bill is not a maritime contract.id.thus,contrary to at least the terms of this court jurisprudence,the supreme court exercised admiralty jurisdiction over a contract with components deemed to be more than incidental.
the norfolk southern railway court analysis of an intermodal transportation contract suggests a global principle.in applying what we have previously called the incidental exception,we should focus on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce,id.at,rather than on whether the components are properly characterized as more than incidental or merely incidental to the contract.our incidental exception then might more accurately be termed the primary or principal objective exception.as an insurance contract is maritime to the extent that it is marine insurance,see jeffcott,at,admiralty jurisdiction will exist over an insurance contract where the primary or principal objective of the contract is the establishment of policies of marine insurance,dunham,wall.at.
the parties disagree as to whether and to what extent the contract established marine insurance.folksamerica focuses on the risks for which the policy was procured,insists those risks are maritime,and contends the policy is fundamentally marine marine insurance,issued to marine entities by a marine insurer,via a marine broker,to cover the insureds ship repair and cleaning operations,appellant br.at.clean water counters that even if the sll portion of this policy is marine,the cgl section is not.we conclude that the insurance contract at issue is primarily or principally concerned with maritime objectives,although there were incidental elements.accordingly,the district court erred in concluding that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking.
the cgl section 
clean water makes two chief objections to construing the cgl section of the policy as marine insurance.the first objection is a matter of form.clean water argues that,unlike a traditional marine insurance policy,a cgl policy is a shore side insurance form and that a reasonable person reading it would therefore conclude that it covered nothing but shore side risks.clean water second objection is based on coverage.it claims,the function of a dmiralty j urisdiction is to ensure uniformity of laws as they apply to the carriage of cargo e s and passengers upon navigable waters.the fact that this cgl policy covers none of these risks excludes it from consideration as a policy of marine insurance.appellee br.at.we reject both arguments.
first,despite clean water suggestion,a long line of precedent establishes that marine insurance need not take on a particular form.the supreme court first applied admiralty jurisdiction to an insurance contract in insurance dunham,wall.at.see also de lovio boit.story.the contract there insured a vessel against certain perils of the seas.dunham,wall.at.in his opinion for the court,justice bradley described marine insurance as a contract dependent on maritime casualties and affected by and mixed up with all the questions that can arise in maritime commerce.id.at.the court analogized marine insurance to other maritime contracts in which payment is made to depend on a maritime risk.id.at.significantly,and as we have noted elsewhere,the dunham court defined the term marine insurance in a general sense,and not in the particular sense of certain types of marine insurance related to the sea in a special way.jeffcott,at describing dunham.
over seventy years later,in jeffcott,this court revisited dunham description of marine insurance.the policies in hull policy and a shipowners liability a schooner,the dauntless.at.a september hurricane took the previously moored dauntless feet and left it flooded and severely damaged.id.when the insurer rejected the owner insurance claims,the owner filed a libel.id.the insurer challenged federal jurisdiction,objecting that the policies were not maritime in nature because they required the vessel to be laid up and out of commission at a shipyard.id.we disagreed,explaining that whether an insurance policy is marine insurance depends on whether the insurer assumes risks which are marine risks.id.the policies in jeffcott were simply marine insurance with a decrease d quantum of risk.id.we stressed their coverage,not their form a insurance company might be familiar with damage from fire,theft,storm it would not be prepared to assume such risks where the insured article was a ship.it would recognize that the risk took on a different character when a ship became the object insured.id.
the supreme court decision in wilburn boat fireman fund insurance,illustrates the primacy of substance over form in this regard.the court in wilburn boat exercised admiralty jurisdiction over a fire insurance policy dispute.the petitioners had purchased a policy to insure their houseboat against loss from fire and other perils.id.at.after a fire destroyed the boat,the insurance company refused to pay for the loss,asserting that the petitioners breached policy terms.id.the petitioners argued that texas law applied,see id.at,and that,at the time,no breach by an insured of the provisions of a fire insurance policy could be a defense to a suit under texas law unless the breach contribute d to the loss,id.at.this texas rule of law applied only to fire insurance polic ies.id.at.while the court was split over the question of whether the texas law should be given effect,not a single member of the court questioned the propriety of the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction over the fire insurance policy.see id.at.id.at.frankfurter,concurring id.at.reed,dissenting.
like a fire insurance policy,there is nothing intrinsically shore side about a cgl policy.indeed,other federal courts have treated cgl policies as marine insurance.in larson construction oregon automobile insurance,rev on other grounds,cir,the defendant issued the plaintiffs a comprehensive liability policy,insuring,among other things,their operations upon navigable waters of the united states.looking to the mobile nature of plaintiff maritime business,which consisted of loading barges,the court concluded that defendant policy of insurance assures against maritime risks and is thus marine in nature.id.citing jeffcott,at.in granite state minerals,american insurance,the district court held that a comprehensive general liability policy insuring a wharfinger against liabilities arising out of its operations was,likewise,a maritime contract.
two other circuits have treated cgl policies as marine insurance.gulf fleet marine operations,wartsila power,cir higginbotham,involved a dispute between a ship repairer and its insurer regarding coverage under a broad form general liability endorsement.the fifth circuit described the case as an admiralty case and applied the admiralty principles of wilburn boat to the ship repairer cgl policy.id.at.more recently,in great lakes dredge dock city of chicago,cir easterbrook,the seventh circuit exercised admiralty jurisdiction over cgl policies covering a marine excavation company,see great lakes dredge dock commercial union assurance,d.
ultimately,coverage determines whether a policy is marine insurance,and coverage is a function of the terms of the insurance contract and the nature of the business insured.thus,in royal insurance of america pier.partnership,cir,the ninth circuit found admiralty jurisdiction lacking even though the subject policies at first glance look ed like typical marine insurance policies with o ne incorporat ing the standard american institute hull clauses and the other written on a standard protection and indemnity form.in youell exxon,cir,vacated,d,on remand,cir admiralty jurisdiction not questioned in subsequent opinions,by contrast,we exercised admiralty jurisdiction over a insurance policy termed a global corporate excess agreement.
these cases illustrate that the form label given insurance policy will not always identify the nature of the risks the insurer assumes.rather,as the first circuit has explained,an insurance policy predominant purpose,as measured by the dimensions of the contingency insured against and the risk assumed,determines the nature of the insurance.acadia ins.mcneil,cir.neither the policy form nor its marine insurance title,therefore,is dispositive of the jurisdictional issue.kenneth volk,symposium,parsing the admiralty clause jurisdiction of marine insurance transactions,tul.simply classifying a cgl form as shore side can not resolve the question of whether a cgl policy is marine insurance.we must look to the risks the insurer assumed.
clean water contends that,because the cgl section excludes all the risks covered by hull and protection and indemnity p i insurance,the only risks covered by the section are shore side risks such as personal injury and property damage to third parties.we disagree.
in general,cgl insurance provides coverage for liabilities arising from bodily injuries and property damage.while cgl insurance originally may not have been intended to serve as marine insurance,the far flung activities of major corporate insureds have brought a number of maritime exposures within its scope.raymond hayden sanford balick,symposium,marine insurance varieties,combinations,and coverages,tul.the insurance agent in this case,trident marine,issues cgl policies only to marine companies,usually in conjunction with other marine coverages.issuance of insurance policies to maritime businesses seems to be a growing trend.see hayden balick,supra,at volk,supra,at see also william,insuring contractual indemnity agreements under cgl,mgl,and p i policies,tul,hal welch reginald white,iii,and the maritime industry,tul.
clean water is correct that its cgl policy excludes certain traditional marine risks.the policy requires that any and all vessels owned and or operated by the insured be separately insured for protection and indemnity p i risks and for collision and tower liability.p i insurance covers claims that arise in direct connection with the operation of an enrolled ship that the insureds own,operate,or charter,hayden balick,supra,at see also robert force,federal judicial center admiralty and maritime law,while collision insurance generally covers an insured liability to third parties for damages arising out of a collision involving the insured vessel in which the insured vessel is at fault,navigators ins.am.home assurance,wl,at,citing hayden balick,supra,at.a provision of the policy excludes coverage of risks included in certain p i and collision policies and all extensions of coverage thereto.
these exclusions,however,do not dispose of all of the insureds maritime risks.p i and collision policies leave significant gaps in the spectrum of maritime risks.the cgl section fills in some of these gaps.the basic format of the policy cgl section mirrors that of typical cgl policies,contain ing provisions affording coverage for,completed operations,and products hazards.barry ostrager thomas newman,handbook on insurance coverage disputes,at ed.in addition to these three aspects of coverage,the policy also provides pollution and limited contractual liability coverage.through tailored endorsements,the policy extends coverage to exposures particular to marine operations.seabulk offshore,am.home assurance,cir considering similar maritime endorsements.
typical cgl policies exclude liability for damages arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use,loading,or unloading of a watercraft.couch on insurance ed.the policy voids that exclusion with a watercraft liability coverage endorsement.a gulf of mexico extension endorsement extends coverage to operations of the named insured in the gulf of mexico.the policy contains an in rem endorsement extending coverage to any loss,otherwise covered even though asserted by an action in rem instead of an action in personam.there is little doubt that an in rem suit involving a vessel is decidedly is an admiralty proceeding.see,am.dredging miller,d citing the moses taylor,wall.another endorsement involves pollution coverage.it became obvious to the petroleum and tanker trades some time ago that extraordinary sources of financial protection would be necessary to meet the increasingly prohibitive costs of pollution and remediation activities.hayden balick,supra,at.the cgl section of the policy includes a buy back provision,permitting pollution coverage in certain circumstances.
in examining the modifications to the cgl policy and the insureds business operations in maritime transport,repair,and maintenance,we discern at least of coverage that should be deemed policies of marine insurance.they are,respectively,the completed operations hazard coverage,the products hazard coverage,the pollution coverage,and,perhaps,a portion of the premises and operation coverage.we agree with clean water,however,that the contractual liability coverage is not maritime in nature.
the first two marine aspects of coverage are the policy completed operations and products hazard coverage,both of which adopt broad form property damage exclusions.these areas of coverage have much in common.the completed operations provision has been construed to mean that once work is completed by an insured,damage that thereafter occurs to the work itself is not covered by the policy,but consequential damages to property outside the work product arising from completed operations are not excluded.gulf fleet marine operations,at.see generally roger henderson,insurance protection for products liability and completed every lawyer should know.the products hazard provision has been understood to exclude from coverage any obligation of the policyholder to repair or replace his own defective work or defective products,but to cover damages to the products of other than the named insured.gulf.marine george engine,cir.see generally henderson,supra.the policy sets the aggregate liability limit for the completed operations and products hazards at.
coverage for completed operations hazards,like the coverage here,can expose insurers to the costs of various maritime accidents resulting from an insured negligence.for instance,in gulf mississippi marine george engine,at,the fifth circuit considered a claim under,inter alia,the completed operations hazard of an insurance policy,seeking damages alleged to result from the defective installation of major components of certain vessels.likewise,in gulf fleet marine operations,at,the fifth circuit held that a completed operations hazard provision required an insurer to pay for damages to a vessel engine block and crankshaft that resulted from the insured faulty overhaul of the ship.gulf tampa drydock great atl.ins,cir holding that insurance lacking a completed operations hazard provision would not cover a repairer liability for damages to a vessel resulting from faulty workmanship.here,the insureds repair and maintenance operations create similar exposures.
a products hazard may require an insurer to cover liabilities similar to those arising from a completed operations provision.in todd shipyards turbine service,cir,for instance,the fifth circuit held that a ship turbine company products hazard policy covered damages to a vessel that resulted from faulty turbine blades,including damages for loss of use of the vessel,general expenses from the master accounts,and pilotage,wharfage,tub,repatriation and recrewing expenses,id.at.
the important difference between the products hazard and the completed operations hazard,of course,is that the products hazard ties damages to accidents caused by a particular product,rather than an operation.accordingly,the fifth circuit in gulf mississippi marine could apply products hazard coverage for liabilities arising from defects in the component parts designed and manufactured by an insured and installed into a vessel and completed operations hazard coverage to liabilities arising from improper installation of the component parts and other construction defects.at.
we view the coverage set out by the completed operations and products hazards provisions as marine in nature.several considerations inform this conclusion.first,as noted,the supreme court has instructed that p recedent and usage are helpful insofar as they exclude or include certain common types of contract,kossick,at,and here the most apposite precedent,gulf fleet marine operations,at,supports admiralty jurisdiction.in gulf fleet marine operations,as here,a cgl policy covered,inter alia,the completed operations liabilities of a ship repair and maintenance business.the fifth circuit,focusing on the completed operations coverage,treated the cgl policy as one of marine insurance and adopted the analysis presented in wilburn boat and other marine insurance cases.see id.at citing wilburn boat,and eagle leasing hartford fire ins,cir in the absence of specifically controlling federal authority,the law of the state where a marine insurance contract is issued and delivered governs the construction of its language.
second,the coverage afforded to a ship repair and maintenance business by the cgl completed operations and products hazards provisions falls within all of the various formulations of marine insurance.the risk of injuries from,and damage to,a ship after defective or faulty repair or maintenance is a maritime risk that includes the risk of the loss of the ship or goods in the language of dunham,wall.at.it is a risk peculiar to ship and sea as set out in jeffcott,at,and is related to hazards encountered in maritime transportation and vessels or the maritime industry,acadia ins,at.the coverage relates directly to the navigation,business or commerce of the sea,de lovio,cas.at,and applies both against marine risks and to maritime interests,damage to and injuries upon vessels,royal ins.of,at.
third,in the context of ship repair and maintenance businesses,the losses covered by the completed operations and products hazards provisions overlap with those covered by p i insurance.the district court cited benedict on admiralty for the proposition that p i insurance addresses losses such as those arising from the injury or death of seamen and passengers,unemployment caused by shipwreck,diversion expenses,stowaway and refugee liability,collision with other ships,quarantine expenses,and
