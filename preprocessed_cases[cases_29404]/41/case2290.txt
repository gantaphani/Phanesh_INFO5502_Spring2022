the main problem presented in these appeals by the secretary of health and human services hhs and loma linda university medical center,arising from a dispute over reimbursement under the medicare program,is one of statutory interpretation.the question is whether the provider reimbursement review board has jurisdiction over a medicare provider appeal of a cost that was allowable under the medicare regulations,but that the provider failed to include in the cost report submitted to the fiscal intermediary.the supreme court has commented on the issue,but not resolved it and the first and seventh circuits,which have decided it,answer the question differently 
we conclude that once the board acquires jurisdiction pursuant to a over a dissatisfied provider cost report on appeal from the intermediary final determination of total reimbursement due for a covered year,it has discretion under d to decide whether to order reimbursement of a cost or expense that was incurred within the period for which the cost report was filed,even though that particular expense was not expressly claimed or explicitly considered by the intermediary.in this,we join the first circuit similar view.mainegeneral med.ctr.shalala,cir,reh g denied,cir luke hosp.sec y of health human,cir.we therefore affirm on the secretary appeal,as well as on loma linda which in the main raises issues on which federal jurisdiction is lacking.
as a medicare provider,loma linda university medical center gets repaid for its services by submitting a cost report to a fiscal intermediary,in this case,blue cross of california,which audits the report and processes reimbursements on behalf of the secretary of hhs.intermediaries calculate the amount of total reimbursement due to providers and transmit the results in a notice of program reimbursement npr.a c.a provider which has filed a cost report and is dissatisfied with the intermediary final determination as to the amount of total program reimbursement may obtain a hearing before the provider reimbursement review board prrb,board with respect to such cost report.a.the prrb decision is final unless the secretary,acting through the administrator of the health care financing administration hcfa reverses,affirms,or modifies the decision.id.f.in either case,the final decision is subject to judicial review.id.
some years ago,loma linda inadvertently zeroed out reimbursable interest expenses in its cost report for the fiscal year,which it timely filed without any claim for interest expense.on september,the intermediary issued an npr it included no adjustments for interest expense.loma linda appealed to the board on march,identifying six aspects of the intermediary determination with which it was dissatisfied not including interest expense.eventually realizing its error,the hospital on may,filed a request with the board to add the interest expense issue to its pending appeal blue cross contested the board jurisdiction to entertain this request as there had been no intermediary determination concerning the issue and it was untimely the board issued a letter decision on august,accepting jurisdiction pursuant to a and a.
all issues but for interest were resolved and the parties stipulated that if the correct income offset had been used in the cost report,the allowable interest expense would have been.this left the board jurisdiction as the dispositive issue.in a decision filed september,the board found that no statutory or regulatory provision makes an audit adjustment a prerequisite for an appeal or a determination the intermediary actually made an audit determination regarding the offset amount when it accepted the interest income offset that eliminated the entire interest expense incurred by loma linda and both the interest expense incurred and the amount of the offset were covered on the cost report which was reviewed by the intermediary auditor.in its view,the error was clear and obvious,and should have been corrected by the intermediary.thus,the prrb concluded that jurisdiction was appropriate under a and a,as well as under d because both the offset amount and the incurred expense were covered by the cost report even if the intermediary had not considered the matter.on the merits,the board found that blue cross had incorrectly determined loma linda total reimbursable cost due to the understatement of interest expense in the amount of.
the hcfa administrator reversed he found bethesda hospital inapposite as no medicare law impeded loma linda from properly claiming a portion of the interest expense as reimbursable on its cost report a provider can not be dissatisfied with an npr when its cost report did not claim reimbursement as to a particular item therefore,this case lacks one of the core requirements of board jurisdiction provider dissatisfaction of a program reimbursement determination made by its intermediary.the administrator further observed that other routes are available for providers to correct cost reporting errors.finally,he noted that d does not itself confer jurisdiction,but rather sets the board powers and duties after its jurisdiction has properly been established under a.
the administrator decision was the agency final decision on the matter,from which loma linda sought review in district court under f.the court rejected loma linda threshold contention that the secretary waived his right to review the jurisdictional determination by ignoring the board determinations,reasoning that what mattered was the administrator reversal of the board actual hearing decisions.the court held that the administrator interpretation of the medicare act was arbitrary and capricious as it was contrary to the language and intent of a.finally,it refused to reach the merits of the interest expense issue on the ground that it only had jurisdiction over the final agency decision,the administrator dismissal of the administrative appeal for lack of jurisdiction.the district court ordered that the board last decision be reinstated,subject to the secretary reviewing the merits.both parties have appealed.
there is no dispute that a is the gateway provision for board jurisdiction.rather,the parties disagree about what a means when it allows a board hearing for a provider who is dissatisfied with a final determination of its intermediary.the secretary position is that a provider can not be dissatisfied with respect to costs for which it could have claimed reimbursement from its intermediary but did not.he maintains that the district court failed to recognize that his interpretation comports with the supreme court opinion in bethesda hospital,and further erred by relying on d as well as the first circuit reasoning in mainegeneral.loma linda,on the other hand,contends that the board obtained jurisdiction with respect to its cost report when it filed an appeal from blue cross final determination,and that the prrb thereafter had power under d to make revisions to matters covered by that cost report regardless of whether such matters were considered by the intermediary.
mindful of our obligations under chevron,we can not read the statute as the secretary does.chevron,natural res.def.council,d holding that courts owe deference to an agency permissible interpretation of a statute it administers when the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the particular issue.section a plainly says that a provider,such as loma linda,may obtain a board hearing with respect to the cost report when it is dissatisfied with the intermediary final determination of the amount of total reimbursement section a does not say that a hearing may be obtained with respect to items claimed on the cost report if the provider is dissatisfied with a final determination of its intermediary as to the amount of reimbursement due on each claim which the statute would do,in sum or substance,if the secretary interpretation were plausible.
loma linda was undoubtedly dissatisfied with blue cross final determination of the total program reimbursement due,for it appealed.its appeal was on time and the amount exceeded the jurisdictional minimum.at this point,the board had jurisdiction for a hearing that,according to the clear language of the text,was with respect to the cost report.this being so,d kicked in.as the supreme court put it,d sets forth the powers and duties of the board once its jurisdiction has been invoked.bethesda,at.those powers and duties are to base its decision on the record,which is to include the evidence considered by the intermediary and such other evidence as may be obtained or received by the board to affirm,modify,or reverse a final determination with respect to a cost report and to make other revisions on matters covered by such cost report even though such matters were not considered by the intermediary in making such final determination.a matter covered by such cost report is a cost or expense that was incurred within the period for which the cost report was filed,even if such cost or expense was not expressly claimed.id.at.adams house health care bowen,cir adopting the bethesda hospital definition.thus,d squarely allows the board to modify a final determination based on evidence that was not considered by the intermediary,and to make revisions on a cost or expense incurred during the year being reported even though the cost was claimed and the matter was considered by the intermediary.we can not see how congress could have intended an absolute exhaustion rule in the face of this explicit power.to the contrary,it appears to have spoken quite directly to the precise question and opted for board discretion to go beyond the record adduced for,and considered by,the intermediary.so,once jurisdiction over the cost report attached,and before a hearing had been held,loma linda could identify additional aspects of the intermediary determination that were covered in the cost report,and the board had authority to deal with them 
why this is so was explained in depth by breyer in luke.at.we understand the secretary argument that luke preceded bethesda hospital and could have been undermined by the supreme court rationale,but the first circuit persuasively rejected this possibility in mainegeneral.at 
in bethesda hospital,the court resolved a circuit split on whether a provider could meet the dissatisfied prerequisite of a by deliberately failing to seek reimbursement for a particular cost on its cost report that was disallowed by regulation,only to challenge the regulation before the board.it held that the plain language of a gave the board jurisdiction to hear such a challenge even though it had not previously been submitted to the intermediary at.however,in a passage upon which the secretary relies,the court noted that providers who wish to contest a regulation that the intermediary is bound to follow stand on different ground from providers who fail to request reimbursement for all costs to which they are entitled under applicable rules.while such defaults might well establish that a provider was satisfied with the amounts requested in its cost report and awarded by the fiscal intermediary,those circumstances are not presented here.id.at.although the contrast drawn is supportive of the secretary position,the court obiter dictum stops short of compelling a conclusion that a provider can never claim dissatisfaction unless it has included an allowable claim in the cost report.at most it suggests that failing to do so might well establish satisfaction.this is consistent with our interpretation of the interplay between a and d as conferring discretion on a board with jurisdiction over a cost report under a to base its decision on evidence or costs and expenses not claimed by the provider or considered by the intermediary if the cost or expense were incurred within the period for which the cost report was prepared.see bethesda,at.finding that its conclusion was required by a but was supported by the design of the statute as a whole as well as by d,and observing of d that it allows the board,once it obtains jurisdiction pursuant to subsection a,to review and revise a cost report with respect to matters not contested before the fiscal intermediary so long as the matter is covered by the cost report.
nor is our construction inconsistent with french hospital medical center shalala,cir,as the secretary submits.french hospital involved review of a final determination in a revised npr.we thought it was unclear whether a included revised as well as original nprs and deferred to the secretary interpretation,holding that in the context of cost report reopening,the board is constrained by the specific issues raised.id.at.this makes sense because,at that point,a provider should not be able to bootstrap dissatisfaction with a determination on reopening into a fresh look at the entire,original npr.by comparison,we stressed that w hen a provider appeals an initial npr under a,the scope of review is quite broad.once the three jurisdictional prerequisites are satisfied,the prrb has jurisdiction to review a broad range of issues.id.at.
likewise,we disagree with the secretary suggestion that adams house rejected the first circuit view that board jurisdiction is discretionary.what we did there was explain that the discretionary language in luke does not describe the board power to accept or reject appeals rather,i t describes the board options once an appeal is filed.at.we are guided by this construct here in holding that once jurisdiction has been obtained over a cost report because of a provider dissatisfaction with the intermediary final determination of the total reimbursable amount due,the board then has discretion to consider evidence that was not before the intermediary to affirm,modify or reverse the final determination and to revise matters covered in the cost report that the intermediary did not consider.
finally,the secretary urges us to accept his position for reasons of policy.he is particularly troubled by the prospect of increased,and complicated appeals,skirting available remedies and time limits,and gamesmanship.the short answer is that congress chose to give the board wiggle room to decide matters covered by a cost report that is properly before it which were not explicitly presented to,or considered by,the intermediary.a answer is that the board may address these or other concerns by making rules and establishing procedures necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of.e.and the specter of placeholder appeals seems provider economics,sophisticated though they may be,can not seriously be enhanced by plus years delay in resolving disputes over reimbursement.
consequently,we hold that the board had jurisdiction pursuant to a for a hearing with respect to loma linda cost report because the provider was dissatisfied with a final determination by blue cross as to the amount of total reimbursement due and other jurisdictional prerequisites were met.as a hearing had not yet been held when loma linda sought relief on an additional aspect of the intermediary final determination that was covered by the cost report,that is,a cost or expense that was incurred within the period for which the cost report was filed,the board had discretion to receive evidence and take action in accord with d on this matter even though the interest expense was not expressly claimed and had not been explicitly considered by the intermediary.
in its,loma linda first asserts that the administrator had no authority to reverse the board jurisdictional decision because the board circulated a letter ruling that it had jurisdiction which the secretary did not review within the days allowed by f aside from one exception not relevant here,the administrator may review any final decision of the board,including a decision under about the board jurisdiction to grant a hearing.a emphasis added.nothing in the regulatory framework indicates that a decision to accept jurisdiction is in any sense final.the board itself did not treat its letter rulings as final as it made findings and conclusions concerning jurisdiction in its hearing decisions.those decisions triggered the administrator window.
before the district court,loma linda sought,in addition to medicare reimbursement for interest expenses,an award of interest pursuant to f the court concluded that its own scope o
