this case involves an idaho county attempt to recover damages under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,for additional monies it claims to have expended on public health care and law enforcement services for undocumented immigrants.canyon county commenced this action against four companies and one individual under rico civil enforcement provision,c,alleging that defendants engaged in an illegal scheme of hiring harboring undocumented immigrant workers within the county,and that their actions forced the county to pay millions of dollars for health care services and criminal justice services for the illegal immigrants.
the district court concluded that the county did not have statutory standing under c because the county did not meet the threshold requirement that a civil plaintiff be injured in his business or property by reason of the alleged rico violation.consequently,the court dismissed the county complaint.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm the district court.we agree with the district court that the county has failed to allege that it was injured in its business or property.we also conclude that,with respect to almost all of the defendants alleged rico violations,the county can not show that its claimed injuries were proximately caused by defendants conduct.for both of these reasons,the county lacks statutory standing to pursue its federal rico claims.
background 
civil enforcement under rico 
rico focuses on racketeering activity,which the statute defines as a number of specific criminal acts under federal and state laws.see.as relevant to this case,acts which are indictable under of the immigration and nationality act ina are included in the definition of racketeering activity.f.ina codified as amended at criminalizes the bringing in,transportation,harboring,and employment of undocumented aliens.
substantive violations of rico are defined in.under c,it is illegal for any person to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of an enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,where that enterprise affects interstate commerce.it is also illegal for any person to conspire to do so.d.a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity,as defined in,within a period of ten years.
under rico civil enforcement mechanism,a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of may sue therefor in any appropriate united states district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,including a reasonable attorney fee c.to have standing under c,a civil rico plaintiff must show that his alleged harm qualifies as injury to his business or property and that his harm was by reason of the rico violation,which requires the plaintiff to establish proximate causation.holmes sec.investor prot,d sedima,imrex,d.
ii.canyon county complaint 
the county first amended complaint complaint names as defendants syngenta seeds,syngenta,sorrento lactalis,sorrento,swift beef company swift,harris moran seed company harris,and albert pacheco.because we are reviewing the dismissal of the complaint,we assume that the factual allegations of the complaint,summarized below,are true.
according to the complaint,each of the four defendant companies knowingly employed harbored large numbers of illegal immigrants within canyon county,in an illegal immigrant hiring scheme.the companies actions have damaged the county because the county has paid millions of dollars for health care services and criminal justice services for the illegal immigrants who have been employed by the defendants in violation of federal law.the individual defendant,pacheco,has engaged in a policy of wilful blindness and harboring of illegal immigrants,in his role as director of a local social service agency,which has resulted in similarly increased costs for the county.
defendants syngenta and harris are both growers and processors of agricultural commodities.the county claims that both companies have deliberately hired hundreds of workers who the companies knew were not authorized to work in the united states.working with a farm labor contractor,ag services,the companies agreed to employ undocumented immigrants supplied by ag services.the contractor acts as a front for syngenta and harris in addition to supplying workers,the contractor channels the workers wages to them,completes fraudulent employment eligibility forms for the workers,and supplies the workers with false documents.the companies have thus allegedly violated both a which criminalizes knowing hiring of more than ten unauthorized aliens during a single year,and a a iii which criminalizes harboring of unauthorized aliens.
the county further alleges that syngenta and harris have each formed an enterprise with the farm labor contractor,and that the companies sustained custom of hiring harboring undocumented workers amounts to a pattern of racketeering activity.as a consequence,the companies have allegedly violated c,by participating in the conduct of an enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.
the complaint contains similar allegations against sorrento,a cheese processor,and swift,a meat packer,the only difference being that sorrento and swift have allegedly formed enterprises with a different labor contractor,labor ready.
the county claim against defendant pacheco is distinct,as it is not based on the hiring of undocumented immigrants.instead,the county alleges that pacheco,in his position as executive director of the idaho migrant council,has directed his staff to assist immigrant workers in fraudulently applying for public benefits,despite pacheco knowledge that the workers lacked legal status in the united states and were ineligible for such benefits.in directing his staff to take these actions,pacheco has allegedly committed a pattern of racketeering activity,by knowingly harboring undocumented immigrants in violation of a a iii.thus,based on his association with the migrant council,which is asserted to be a rico enterprise,pacheco has allegedly violated c and d 
iii.dismissal by the district court 
defendants filed motions to dismiss the county complaint,challenging both the county standing under rico and the adequacy of the county allegations of substantive rico violations.the district court granted defendants motions and dismissed the complaint in its entirety.it held that the county lacked statutory standing to bring its federal rico claims because it had not been injured in its business or property by the alleged conduct constituting the rico violations.
in evaluating whether the county had alleged injuries of a type cognizable under c,the district court first discussed the tort doctrine known as the municipal cost recovery rule,drawing on our decision in city of flagstaff atchison,topeka santa fe,cir.in city of flagstaff,we held that,under arizona law,a municipality could not recover the cost of public services for fire or safety protection from a negligent tortfeasor.id.at.we did,however,recognize several exceptions to the municipal cost recovery rule,including exceptions allowing municipal recovery where it is authorized by statute or regulation and where the acts of a private party create a public nuisance which the government seeks to abate.id.at.
noting that the county appeared to concede the existence of the municipal cost recovery rule,the district court rejected the county argument that its claims fit within either the exception for suits to abate a public nuisance,or the exception for suits authorized by statute.first,the district court stated that the county was not acting in its governmental capacity to abate a nuisance,but suing for treble damages under civil rico.it then considered the county argument that the rico statute itself authorized its recovery.the court rejected this contention,citing what it characterized as extensive persuasive authority from other circuits to the effect that a municipality may not recover under rico for alleged injuries to its governmental functions.
thus,relying on the municipal cost recovery rule and on case law from other circuits,the district court concluded that the county claim for the costs of municipal services did not qualify as an injury to business or property within the meaning of rico.on this basis,the court dismissed the federal rico claims against all defendants and entered judgment against the county the county timely appealed.

discussion 
a civil rico plaintiff only has standing if,and can only recover to the extent that,he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation.sedima,at.see c.below,we examine whether the allegations in the county complaint meet the requirements for standing under rico civil suit provision,c.we discuss first whether the county has alleged the requisite type of injury,then whether the defendants alleged rico violations could have proximately caused the county injury.
canyon county has failed to allege that it has been injured in its business or property 
to determine whether a plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that he has been injured in his business or property,we must examine carefully the nature of the asserted harm.our circuit requires that a plaintiff asserting injury to property allege concrete financial loss.oscar.students coop.ass n,cir en banc.financial loss alone,however,is insufficient.without a harm to a specific business or property categorical inquiry typically determined by reference to state is no injury to business or property within the meaning of rico.diaz gates,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.
in this case,the county bases its rico claims on the fact that it has paid millions of dollars for health care services and criminal justice services for the illegal immigrants who have been employed harbored by the defendants in violation of federal law.the county argues that it has sufficiently alleged that it has been injured in its property because it claims to have been forced to spend money.according to the county,a ny involuntary expenditure of money is a loss of property.however,a government entity can not rely on expenditures alone to establish civil rico standing,and there is no indication that the county holds a property interest in the law enforcement or health care services that it provides to the public.
government expenditures alone are insufficient to qualify as injury to property 
in the ordinary context of a commercial transaction,a consumer who has been overcharged can claim an injury to her property,based on a wrongful deprivation of her money.see reiter sonotone,d interpreting provision of the clayton act that grants standing to any person injured in his business or property by an antitrust violation.as the supreme court reasoned in reiter,i n its dictionary definitions and in common usage property comprehends anything of material value owned or possessed.money,of course,is a form of property.id.at.citation omitted.thus,the court concluded that where petitioner alleges a wrongful deprivation of her money because the price of the hearing aid she bought was artificially inflated,she has alleged an injury in her property id.at.
similarly,government entities that have been overcharged in commercial transactions and thus deprived of their money can claim injury to their property.see chattanooga foundry pipe works city of atlanta.holding that city claim that it was overcharged for its purchases of water pipe qualified as allegation that it was injured in its property by being led to pay more than the worth of the pipe county of oakland city of detroit,cir outlying counties sustained an injury in their property when they paid the allegedly excessive charges to detroit for treatment and disposal of sewage.
but the law commonly distinguishes between the status of a governmental entity acting to enforce the laws or promote the general welfare and that of a governmental entity acting as a consumer or other type of market participant.see,alfred snapp son,puerto rico ex rel.barez,d distinguishing between the sovereign,and proprietary interests of governmental bodies.when a governmental body acts in its sovereign or capacity,seeking to enforce the laws or promote the public,it can not claim to have been injured in its property for rico purposes based solely on the fact that it has spent money in order to act governmentally.all government actions require the expenditure of money in this sense,insofar as the government acts through public servants who are paid for their services.if government expenditures alone sufficed as injury to property,any rico predicate act that provoked any sort of governmental response would provide the government entity with standing to sue under c an interpretation of the statute that we think highly improbable.we find it particularly inappropriate to label a governmental entity injured in its property when it spends money on the provision of additional public services,given that those services are based on legislative mandates and are intended to further the public interest.
b.the county does not have a property interest in services it provides to enforce the laws and promote the public welfare 
as the county can not satisfy the requirement of injury to a specific property interest based solely on its expenditure of money to provide public services,we must examine whether the county can claim a property interest in the services themselves.we conclude that the government does not possess a property interest in the law enforcement or health care services that it provides to the public therefore,a governmental entity is not injured in its property when greater demand causes it to provide additional public services of this type.
we base this conclusion on several factors.first,the ordinary meaning of the term property does not include the interests of local governments in performing functions such as policing,caring for the indigent sick,and otherwise protecting the of the public.moreover,following diaz instruction to determine whether the relevant state law recognizes the alleged property interest,we see no indication that idaho law creates a entitlement in such services on the part of counties.see diaz,at.the county has made no showing that idaho law grants counties a protectable legal interest in the public services they provide,and we have found none.the persuasive authority of other jurisdictions tilts against such an interest.id.plaintiff claim for lost wages due to false imprisonment alleged harm to a property interest,because california law recognizes the torts of intentional interference with contract and interference with prospective business relations see also living designs,dupont de nemours,cir plaintiff claim alleging diminished litigation settlement due to the defendant fraud alleged injury to a property interest,because fraudulent inducement is an actionable tort under hawaii law,cert.denied,d.
second,the supreme court has interpreted the statutory provision that served as a model for c to exclude claims for damages to governments interests.the civil enforcement provision of the antitrust laws,of the clayton act,provides a private right of action to any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws a.because congress based the rico private right of action on,courts have often,though not invariably,interpreted the two statutory provisions in a like manner.see,holmes,at.sedima,at.interpreting the clayton act,the court has read the phrase injured in his business or property to encompass only injury to a state commercial interests,meaning the interests of the state as a party to a commercial transaction.reiter,at.if a similar interpretation of the identical phrase is applied in the rico setting,a government claim for its law enforcement and health care expenditures would not qualify as injury to property.
in hawaii standard oil,d,the state of hawaii sued four petroleum suppliers for antitrust violations.hawaii raised claims in three capacities a claim in the state proprietary capacity for overcharges it paid directly as a consumer of petroleum products a claim in its parens patriae capacity as a representative of the state citizens and a class action claim on behalf of all consumers in the state.id.at.to support the claims brought in the state parens patriae capacity,hawaii alleged various harms,including loss of its citizens revenues,increases in taxes as a result of lost revenues,lost opportunities in commerce,and frustration of state measures to promote its citizens welfare.id.at.the court held that the state,acting in a parens patriae capacity to redress injury to its general economy,had not been injured in its property and thus lacked standing to recover damages under of the clayton act.the court stated 
like the lower courts that have considered the meaning of the words business or property,we conclude that they refer to commercial interests or enterprises.when the state seeks damages for injuries to its commercial interests,it may sue under.but where,as here,the state seeks damages for other injuries,it is not properly within the clayton act.
id.at.citations omitted.
the court also relied on,an adjacent provision permitting the federal government to recover damages whenever injured in its business or property by an antitrust violation.that provision,the court wrote,did not permit the united states to recover for economic injuries to its sovereign interests,as opposed to its proprietary functions.id.at.similarly,the court held,which uses identical language,does not authorize recovery for economic injuries to the sovereign interests of a state.id.
later,in reiter,the court clarified that states could claim to have been injured in their property when alleging harm to their interests as consumers,despite the reference in hawaii to the state commercial interests 
the phrase commercial interests was used in hawaii as a generic reference to the interests of the state of hawaii as a party to a commercial transaction.this is apparent from hawaii explicit reaffirmance of the rule of chattanooga foundry and statement that,where injury to a state occurs in its capacity as a consumer in the marketplace through a payment of money wrongfully induced,treble damages are recoverable by a state under the clayton act.
as used in the clayton act private right of action,then,the phrase business or property excludes states interests in their sovereign or capacities,but does include states interests as ordinary marketplace actors.we believe that this interpretation of the phrase business or property should apply in the context of a civil rico claim,as well.
the second circuit has already applied hawaii and reiter in this way.in town of west hartford operation rescue,cir,the court considered a town civil rico claims against abortion protesters who had demonstrated for two days at a local clinic.according to the town,the protesters activities amounted to extortion against the town under the hobbs act and thus were a pattern of racketeering activity.id.at.the town alleged that the protesters had limited the police department ability to respond to other public safety needs,and caused extraordinary police overtime wage expenses,among other harms,all of which amounted to injury to the governmental functions and property of the town.id.at.
the court first concluded that extortion under the hobbs act required the obtaining of property from another by wrongful means and that neither altered official conduct nor overtime police expense qualified as property for this purpose.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,the town had failed properly to allege any rico predicate acts and there was no plausible basis for assertion of the rico claim.id.at.the court then analyzed whether the town had alleged injury to its business or property resulting from the rico violation,as required for civil rico standing.relying on hawaii and reiter for the proposition that a governmental entity may recover for such injury only when it functions as a party to a commercial transaction,the second circuit held that i njuries of the sort asserted by the town do not fall within the ambit of section c.id.at.
thus,the second circuit held that the town claimed injuries stemming from the burden the protesters placed on the town police included expenditures for increased overtime not qualify as injury to the town business or property.rather,these were injuries to the town sovereign or interests of the sort held in hawaii 
the injuries claimed by the county in this case,increased expenditures for law enforcement and health care services,are analogous to those that the second circuit ruled in town of west hartford.the county sustained these injuries in its sovereign capacities,and may not claim the costs as damages to its property for purposes of civil rico standing.
we note finally that the common law doctrine barring government recovery of the costs of public safety services in tort supports our holding.the rationale underlying the municipal cost recovery rule is twofold that there is little reason for courts to use tort law to unsettle expectations and disrupt the existing,funded system of providing public safety services and that it is not the courts role to disturb the legislature decision to fund such services as a part of its overall fiscal policy choices.see city of flagstaff,at.a number of courts have applied this rule to bar recovery by local governments of public safety expenses 
in this instance,we are not dealing with state common law,but with a statutory cause of action created by congress.therefore,we are not concerned that our court might upset the local legislative body fiscal policy by allowing recovery for public safety services.instead,the question is one of congress intent,specifically whether congress meant to disrupt settled expectations and alter the system of funding local government services.we recognize that congress could have used its powers to do so,enabling local governments to pursue treble damages under rico for injuries arising from their provision of governmental services.but had congress intended such a result,we believe that congress would have been more explicit the term business or property does not readily connote a government interest in the services it provides in its sovereign or capacity as we think it unlikely that congress intended this type of recovery under rico,and because idaho legislature has assigned the fiscal burden for law enforcement and health care services differently,it is not our place to disturb these decisions.
contrary to the county argument,in holding that the costs of their law enforcement and public health care services are not recoverable damages under civil rico,we are not inserting an additional injury requirement into c.rather,our holding is based on the statutory language itself.we simply do not think that the term business or property can be interpreted to encompass the sorts of interests that the county relies on in this case.
in light of the foregoing reasoning,we conclude that the county lacks rico standing and can not bring suit under rico for the injuries that it asserts in its complaint.
ii.canyon county can not show that the alleged rico violations proximately caused its injuries 
even if the county claimed injuries were cognizable under c as injuries to property,the county complaint is flawed in another critical aspect most of the defendants alleged rico violations do not bear a direct connection to the county asserted harms.see anza.at when a court evaluates a rico claim for proximate causation,the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff injuries.
a.the county claims against the defendant companies 
canyon county alleges that it has paid millions of dollars for health care services and criminal justice services for the illegal immigrants who have been employed by the defendants in violation of federal law.we conclude that the county can not,as a matter of law,show an adequate causal nexus between the four defendant companies employment of undocumented workers and the financial harm the county claims to have suffered.
a showing that the defendant violated,the plaintiff was injured,and the defendant violation was a but for cause of plaintiff injury is insufficient to meet the requirement in c that the plaintiff injury be by reason of the rico violation.holmes,at.rather,a plaintiff must also show that the defendant rico violation proximately caused her injury.id.at.proximate causation requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.id.
in holmes,the court applied the proximate cause requirement to preclude a rico suit by a plaintiff whose injury was entirely contingent on the injury of direct victims.id.at.in that case,a number of conspirators had allegedly engaged in a fraudulent stock manipulation scheme which led to the insolvency of two securities.as a result of the insolvency,the could no longer meet their obligations to their customers,and the plaintiff,the securities investor protection corporation sipc,was forced to cover the debts.id.at.sipc asserted the customers claims against the conspirators,arguing that the customers had been injured by reason of the conspirators fraudulent scheme in violation of rico.the court disagreed,noting that the conspirators have allegedly injured these customers only insofar as the stock manipulation first injured the and left them without the wherewithal to pay customers claims.id.at.finding the link too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the customers harm,being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the,the court concluded that proximate causation was lacking.id.
subsequently,in anza,the supreme court clarified that the holmes proximate cause requirement not only bars rico suits by derivative victims,or those whose injuries are purely contingent on the harm suffered by direct victims,but generally precludes recovery by those whose injuries are only tenuously related to the rico violation at issue.at.under anza,courts must scrutinize the causal link between the rico violation and the injury,identifying with precision both the nature of the violation and the cause of the injury to the plaintiff.see id.at.where the violation is not itself the immediate cause of the plaintiff injury,proximate cause may be lacking.
in anza,ideal steel supply company sued its competitor,alleging that the competitor had violated rico by conducting its business through a pattern of defrauding the state of new york of sales tax payments.id.at.according to ideal,the defendant was able to undersell ideal by not charging sales tax on cash purchases,and thus deprived ideal of sales it otherwise would have made.id.at.the court concluded,however,that the competitor alleged violations could not have proximately caused ideal injuries,because t he cause of ideal asserted harms is a set of actions offering lower prices entirely distinct from the alleged rico violation defrauding the state.id.at.
in support of this conclusion,the court discussed the rationale for the requirement that the plaintiff harm directly result from the alleged rico violation.id.citing holmes,at.first,the court cited the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.id.the court emphasized the attenuated causal chain between the defendant tax fraud and the plaintiff loss of sales.it noted the difficulty of determining whether the defendant lower prices were in fact based on the defendant fraudulent failure to pay sales tax,or whether other causes determined the defendant pricing.id.the court also pointed out that the plaintiff lost sales could have resulted from a host of factors other than its competitor fraud.id.
second,the court discussed the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if ideal were permitted to maintain its claim.id.at.a court would have to determine the portion of ideal damages resulting from the rico violation,by evaluating the relative causal role of the defendant fraud in lowering the defendant prices,and the relative causal role of those lowered prices in diminishing ideal effect,requiring a complex apportionment of fault among various causes.id.the proximate causation requirement is meant to prevent these types of intricate,uncertain inquiries from overrunning rico litigation.id.
finally,the court referenced the consideration of whether the immediate victims of an alleged rico violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.id.in the case before the court,the state of new york could be expected to pursue its own remedies for the fraud practiced upon it by the defendant.thus,the court found no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms to permit rico suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly.id.
under anza,we must determine whether the county meets the proximate cause requirement by examining whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff injuries.id the basis of the rico violation,according to the county complaint,is the defendant companies knowing hiring of undocumented immigrants.the alleged harm is the county increased expenditures on health care and criminal justice services.here,just as in anza,the cause of the plaintiff asserted harms is a set of actions increased demand by people within canyon county for public health care and law enforcement services entirely distinct from the alleged rico violation the defendants knowing hiring of undocumented workers.
the three rationales for the proximate cause requirement described in anza also suggest that the county harm fails the proximate cause test.id.at.as to the first consideration,the difficulty of assessing causation,the asserted causal chain in this instance is quite attenuated,and there are numerous other factors that could lead to higher expenditures by the county.in fact,it is not clear how the companies hiring of undocumented immigrants would increase demand for health care and law enforcement within canyon county.further,holding employers liable for the actions of their employees that are not even recognized as being a basis for respondent superior liability would be contrary to centuries of precedent concerning proximate causation.
the causal chain would also be difficult to ascertain because there are numerous alternative causes that might be the actual source or sources of the county alleged harm.increased demand for public health care and law enforcement may result from such varied factors as demographic changes alterations in criminal laws or policy changes in public health practices shifts in economic variables such as wages,insurance coverage,and unemployment and improved community education and outreach by government.
second,the proceedings required to evaluate the county injury would be speculative in the extreme,perhaps more so than those discussed in anza.id.at.a court would be forced to evaluate the extent to which the companies illegal hiring practices had created increased demand for county services.this would not consist of simply estimating the number of undocumented immigrants employed by the companies and their average usage of county services.rather,the court would have to construct the alternative scenario of what would have occurred had the companies employed legally authorized workers,and determine how this might have affected the county total population,and how these alternative workers might have differed from the undocumented workers in their consumption of county services,if at all.this would be an intricate,uncertain inquiry of the type that the anza court warned against.id.
given the of the complaint in meeting anza proximate cause requirements,we need not inquire into the question of whether there are more immediate victims of the defendants alleged rico violations who are likely to sue.see newcal,ikon office solution
