appellants delores berg and thomas dicecco are medicare beneficiaries who suffer from medical conditions that caused significant dental problems,and they received dental services to correct those problems.but the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs denied coverage for those services.appellants contend that this denial was premised on the secretary unreasonable interpretation of the medicare act,which contravenes the intent of congress and violates appellants right to equal protection under the fifth amendment.we affirm the district court,holding that the statute under which the secretary denied coverage is ambiguous on the question appellants raise that chevron deference applies that the secretary interpretation of the statute is reasonable and that the denial does not violate appellants fifth amendment rights 
berg is a medicare advantage beneficiary.she suffers from sjogren syndrome,which has left her unable to produce saliva.as a result,she lost teeth,her gums deteriorated,and her bite collapsed.berg lack of saliva made her prone to gum infections,which put her at risk of a heart infection.in response to the grave conditions and risks caused by sjogren syndrome,berg dentist recommended a treatment plan that would develop and reconstruct a leveled bite,with procedures including a partial denture,several crowns,and bridgework.berg underwent the recommended procedures on february,at a total cost of.
berg submitted a claim for these services to her medicare advantage provider.her provider denied the claim because berg was enrolled in a plan that did not cover r outine dental care such as cleanings,fillings,or dentures or other dental services.berg provider sent her appeal to an independent outside review entity,which told berg that the dental services related to sjogren syndrome do not fall within the limited dental coverage of her medicare advantage plan and denied her appeal.berg then appealed to an administrative law judge alj,who ruled that the services berg received were excluded by medicare exclusion.although the plan representatives and the alj acknowledged that berg dental problems stemmed from her sjogren syndrome,the alj concluded that the services at issue did not fall under any exception to the dental exclusion because berg dental work was the primary procedure,rather than necessary to or incident to any medicare covered procedure.the medicare appeals council mac adopted the alj decision and denied berg appeal,explaining,services performed in connection with the care,treatment,filling,removal,or replacement of teeth or structures directly supporting teeth are not covered and,to the extent coverage is provided,it is only under limited circumstances not applicable to this case.
thomas dicecco,is a medicare beneficiary under parts a and b.in,several years before becoming eligible for medicare,dicecco received an allogeneic transplant to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia.he received a donor lymphocyte infusion in june.as a result of these treatments,dicecco developed disease,with a resulting loss of salivary function.as it did with berg,dicecco lack of saliva led to tooth loss.dicecco tooth decay was so severe that it caused certain teeth to just crack off,and forced him to use a feeding tube for nearly a year.more than a decade after dicecco transplant,his dentist prescribed a course of treatment,responding to the disease with frequent examinations and restorative dental work such as fillings and crowns.dicecco had this treatment from april to july.dicecco then submitted a claim for reimbursement for resin,crown,and fluoride treatments to his medicare part b contractor.his contractor denied the claim in full,and an independent contractor upheld the denial.dicecco appealed to an alj,who recognized that dicecco needed the dental care because of his disease but upheld the denial because dental services are excluded from medicare coverage regardless of the medical need for those services.the mac adopted the alj decision and acknowledged that dicecco need for dental services was provoked by a medical condition.but the mac explained that the relationship between dicecco disease and his dental services does not,by itself,qualify the dental services for medicare coverage.dicecco treatments would be covered only if they were furnished along with a covered procedure that was performed by the dentist on the same occasion.
berg and dicecco joined a lawsuit filed by ronald fournier,who raised similar claims to those of berg and of dicecco the plaintiffs challenged the mac decisions,which were the secretary final decisions in their cases,and sought declaratory and injunctive relief advocating the views that the secretary decision to deny coverage for their extraordinary,medically related dental services violated hhs policy,the medicare act,and their right to equal protection.the district court held that substantial evidence supported the secretary decisions denying coverage to berg and dicecco,that the secretary statutory interpretation excluding coverage was reasonable,and that the secretary policy does not violate the equal protection guarantee in the fifth amendment due process clause.this appeal followed.
this appeal centers on the broad exclusion of dental services from medicare coverage,so we discuss the development of that exclusion.congress established medicare in as title xviii of the social security act medicare act,stat.medicare provides medical services to the aged,the disabled,and those who have renal kidney disease.the secretary of health and human services administers the program,and she has authority to prescribe necessary regulations,a,and determine which claims will be covered,a.the secretary may issue national coverage determinations to define what services are considered reasonable and necessary.f b.
medicare provides institutional care,including inpatient hospital services,through part a,a,and authorizes payment for supplemental and outpatient services in part b.part c,known as medicare advantage,allows beneficiaries to receive services authorized under parts a and b through or plans.a a,a b i.
medicare coverage is broadly limited to services that are medically reasonable and necessary.see a a c.medicare coverage is also subject to specific restrictions,one of which,prominent here,excludes most dental services from reimbursement.that exclusion denies payment for any expenses incurred 
for services in connection with the care,treatment,filling,removal,or replacement of teeth or structures directly supporting teeth,except that payment may be made under part a of this subchapter in the case of inpatient hospital services in connection with the provision of such dental services if the individual,because of his underlying medical condition and clinical status or because of the severity of the dental procedure,requires hospitalization in connection with the provision of such services 
a.the exclusion,without the exception for inpatient services under part a,was included in the initial form of the medicare act.see,a,stat.the senate report accompanying the medicare act said that this exclusion was intended to make clear that the services of dental surgeons covered under the bill are restricted to complex surgical procedures and that routine dental treatment filling,removal,or replacement of teeth or treatment of structures directly supporting the teeth would not be covered,at,reprinted in.this explanation moves us towards the core of the problem presented on this appeal.when the secretary first promulgated regulations under the dental exclusion in a,she added the word routine to the statutory exclusion,excluding coverage for r outine dental services in connection with the care,treatment,filling,removal,or replacement of teeth,or structures directly supporting the teeth.
congress also limited coverage for dental services in a second way by restricting the definition of physician.the medicare act distinguished between complex,covered dental procedures and common,excluded procedures by defining physician to include dentists and oral surgeons only when they performed a surgery related to the jaw or any structure contiguous to the jaw or b the reduction of any fracture of the jaw or any facial bone,r,stat.
covered services,such as surgery related to the jaw,often require individual procedures,such as tooth removal,that standing alone would not be covered as primary procedures.as a result,the secretary needed to determine when a dental service was provided in connection with a covered primary procedure such that the dental service would be covered.shortly after passage of the medicare act,the director of the bureau of health insurance answered this question in policy guidance to clarify the coverage of secondary dental services in his intermediary letter of january.
the director reasoned that because a dentist was defined as a physician only when performing surgery related to the jaw or structures contiguous to the jaw including the reduction of any fracture of the jaw or any facial bone,all such surgical procedures performed by a dentist would be covered unless specifically excluded.by contrast,any services rendered in connection with the examination,care,treatment,filling,removal,or replacement of teeth and any services rendered in connection with the examination,care,or treatment of structures directly supporting the teeth were excluded the director explained that medicare would cover these procedures when performed on the same occasion by a dentist as an incident to and as an integral part of a covered procedure or service performed by him.if an excluded service were the primary procedure,however,that procedure and any adjuncts would not be covered regardless of the complexity or difficulty of the procedure.this is known as the same physician rule.see wood thompson,cir.
congress revisited the exclusion of primary dental services in,when it amended a to give coverage for dental services under part a in the case of inpatient hospital services in connection with a dental procedure where the individual suffers from impairments of such severity as to require hospitalization,c,stat.the next year,congress again amended this subsection to clarify the coverage of inpatient dental services,allowing coverage only if the patient underlying medical condition and clinical status require d hospitalization in connection with the provision of such services,k,stat.in response to these amendments,the secretary issued a new regulation t o conform the regulatory language regarding hospital admissions for excluded dental services with the statutory language.this revision removed the word routine from the coverage exclusion and noted that the statutory amendment,k,confirmed the substantive position taken in the proposed regulations.see also i.
in,congress amended the medicare act to expand the role of dentists in two ways.first,the definition of physician was amended to include a doctor of dental surgery or of dental medicine who is legally authorized to practice dentistry by the state in which he performs such function and who is acting within the scope of his license when he performs such functions,a,stat.see also r.the accompanying house report stated that there are some services which are covered under medicare only if performed by a physician but are not covered when furnished by a dentist.at,reprinted at.the amended language provide d the same coverage for services performed by a dentist that is provided for services performed by physicians.id.
second,congress granted admitting privileges to dentists and expanded coverage of inpatient dental services.before the amendment,inpatient dental services were covered only when a patient was hospitalized for an underlying,nondental condition.see id.coverage was precluded where,in the judgment of the patient dentist,the severity of the dental procedure alone require d hospitalization.id.congress amended the section to cover hospital stays based on a dentist or physician certification that hospital inpatient services are necessary for the performance of noncovered dental procedures either because of the severity of the dental procedure or the patient underlying condition warrants such hospitalization.id.at.these changes were meant to bring parity to the role of dentists and provide for greater inpatient dental coverage under part a,not expand the provision of outpatient dental services under part b,so the exclusion of routine dental services remain ed in effect.id.at.
these changes to the role of dentists did not change the scope of coverage of dental services on an outpatient basis,and the text of the dental exclusion has not changed since passage,apart from the allowance for inpatient coverage under part compare,a,stat,with a.medicare contractors must still determine whether dental services are provided in connection with a covered,primary service.as a result,the rule remains in effect.the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms medicare benefit policy manual cms manual describes the rule in language similar to that found in the intermediary letter,explaining 
if an otherwise noncovered procedure or service is performed by a dentist as incident to and as an integral part of a covered procedure or service performed by the dentist,the total service performed by the dentist on such an occasion is covered.
centers for medicare medicaid,publ,medicare benefit policy manual,ch,at see also id.ch.
an exception to the rule allows for reimbursement of dental services provided in preparation for a covered procedure performed by a different physician the extraction of teeth to prepare a patient jaw for radiation treatment of neoplastic disease.id.at ch.most often,a dentist will extract the patient teeth and a radiologist will administer the radiation treatments.id.in a similar situation,medicare covers dental examinations on an inpatient basis as part of a before kidney transplant surgery.centers for medicare medicaid,publ,medicare national coverage determinations manual.this examination is only provided on an inpatient basis,so it now likely falls under the general allowance for inpatient services under part in both situations,however,the purpose of the dental procedure is not the care of teeth or structures supporting teeth but the preparation for a subsequent,covered procedure.
we have jurisdiction under g,g,and b a and.we review a district court decision upholding the mac decisions de novo.conahan sebelius,cir.we review de novo a district court constitutional rulings,wright incline vill.improvement,cir,as well as its decisions on questions of statutory interpretation,portland adventist med.ctr.thompson,cir.
appellants contest the mac rulings denying coverage for their dental services by challenging the secretary underlying policy decision to exclude dental procedures that are not performed at the same time and by the same dentist as a covered procedure.appellants contend that the secretary has not carried out congress intent to cover complex surgical procedures and that the secretary coverage policy is irrational and thus violates the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.we consider first statutory interpretation,and then the constitutional challenge.
when we review an agency interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering,f irst,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we will not impose our own construction on the statute.id.at.instead,we ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.if the agency construction is permissible,we defer to it.see palomar med.ctr.sebelius,cir.
before we address whether in the statute congress has spoken clearly,we must identify the precise question at issue.appellants do not allege that they received dental services in connection with a covered procedure.because they do not,the rule does not come into play,and any ambiguity in the secretary implementation of that rule is not relevant here 
appellants also do not allege that they received dental care on an inpatient basis,and they do not seek reimbursement under part a.as a result,they do not qualify for a inpatient exception.appellants received outpatient services and sought reimbursement under part b,so they can not benefit from the coverage rules provided for inpatient care under part accord chipman shalala,cir.any ambiguity in the provision does not reach appellants.
appellants are in a third category.they received primary dental services on an outpatient basis and sought coverage under part appellants contend that those services should be covered because they were medically necessary to prevent potentially fatal heart infections.the secretary disagrees,arguing that a unambiguously rejects appellants claims services in connection with the care,treatment,filling,removal,or replacement of teeth or structures directly supporting teeth are excluded from coverage,so primary dental services that are not provided on an inpatient basis are excluded by the statute.according to the secretary,the relationship between appellants services and their risk of infection is irrelevant.
having distinguished appellants situation from related questions about dental coverage under medicare,we do not think that congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.section a prohibits medicare coverage of expenses for services in connection with the care of the teeth.it is arguable,however,that the secretary could interpret appellants services to have been provided not in connection with the care and treatment of teeth,but rather in connection with a medical need to prevent heart infections.viewed in this light,the services provided here could plausibly be viewed as either in connection with the care of teeth or with alleviating a symptom caused by a serious prior disease,namely sjogren syndrome or disease.we can see that there are fair arguments on both sides of the issue and conclude that the statute is ambiguous.accordingly,we turn to the second step of chevron.see at.
having concluded that a is ambiguous as to the extent of the exclusion,we now address whether the secretary construction of that exclusion is reasonable.see id.the secretary did not issue her interpretation through rulemaking or formal adjudication,so we must first determine what level of deference we should give to her interpretation.see united states mead,d.appellants contend that the secretary interpretation of a does not merit chevron deference because the interpretation,as published in the cms manual,does not carry the force of law.instead,appellants suggest that the secretary interpretation is entitled to respect only to the extent that it has the power to persuade under skidmore swift.see christensen harris county,d interpretations such as those in opinion letters like interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of law do not warrant deference.under that standard,appellants believe,the secretary interpretation is unpersuasive.
the secretary agrees that her interpretation in the cms manual does not by itself carry the force of law.see a aljs and the mac are not bound by manual instructions.instead,the secretary explains that her interpretation deserves chevron deference because the process of adjudication leading to the mac decisions was provided for by congress and the secretary interpretation was given effect through this relatively formal administrative procedure.mead,at.
under mead,we will give chevron deference to an agency interpretation of a statute only when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.price stevedoring servs.of,cir en banc quoting mead,at.
the secretary interpretation meets the first prong of the mead test.the secretary has general rulemaking authority under a.congress decided that medicare should pay for reasonable and necessary medical expenses,but it also restricted coverage of outpatient dental care.congress delegated to the secretary the authority to promulgate regulations and make initial determinations with respect to benefits within the bounds of these provisions.a.the authority to promulgate regulations indicates that congress delegated to the secretary to make rules carrying the force of law.see mead,at citing eeoc arabian am.oil,d explaining that we give no chevron deference to agency guideline where congressional delegation did not include the power to promulgate rules or regulations.
addressing the second prong of mead,we ask whether the secretary interpretation of the dental exclusion was promulgated in the exercise of that authority to make rules carrying the force of law.id.at.the answer depends on the form and context of that interpretation.price,at.that the secretary reached her interpretation through means less formal than notice and comment rulemaking does not automatically deprive that interpretation of the judicial deference otherwise its due.barnhart walton,d.the secretary interpretation of the dental exclusion is similar in both form and context to the interpretation given chevron deference in barnhart,id.at,and we follow barnhart to conclude the secretary interpretation meets the second prong of the mead test.
in barnhart,the supreme court reversed a fourth circuit decision holding that a section of the social security act forbade the secretary interpretation of the meaning of the word inability in the definition of disability.id.at.the statute defined disability as an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.id.emphasis omitted quoting d a.under the secretary interpretation,this duration requirement was prospective if the inability was ongoing at the time of adjudication.but if an applicant inability resolved itself in less than months,the applicant would not be found disabled and would receive no benefits,even if the inability were one that initially might have been expected to last that long.id.the supreme court first examined and upheld this definition as the agency interpretation of its own regulation.id.at citing auer robbins,d.
the petitioner in barnhart objected to the court application of auer,however,because the regulation in question came into effect long after the agency denied his claim for benefits,possibly in response to the litigation.id.at see walton apfel,cir,rev sub nom.barnhart,at the proposed regulation did not apply retroactively.but the court explained that the agency interpretation would warrant chevron deference even if it had not been bolstered by the rulemaking.id the court reasoned that the interstitial nature of the legal question,the related expertise of the agency,the importance of the question to administration of the statute,the complexity of that administration,and the careful consideration the agency has given the question over a long period of time all indicate that chevron provides the appropriate legal lens through which to view the legality of the agency interpretation here at issue.barnhart,at citing mead.
the secretary interpretation here exhibits those factors.the legal question is interstitial the dental exclusion is clear,with clear exceptions,wood,at,and the secretary interpretation fills the interstices dividing the exceptions from the exclusion.the rule limiting coverage is important to the secretary administration of medicare given the scarce resources available and the vast number of claims that medicare engenders.barnhart,at.that vast number of claims,each of which involves distinct medical facts,speaks also to the complexity of administering medicare and the consequent need for agency expertise and administrative experience.id.
the origins and legal contexts of the two interpretations are also similar.the interpretation in barnhart originated in a letter,was later published in a state manual,and was included in social security rul
