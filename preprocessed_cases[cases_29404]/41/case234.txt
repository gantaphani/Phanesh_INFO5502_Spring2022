this is an appeal from a preliminary injunction entered by the district court.that court enjoined the commonwealth of massachusetts from implementing an emergency regulation reducing the rates that the state pays under the state medicaid program to pharmacies to reimburse them for prescription drugs furnished for the use of medicaid patients.the background events are as follows.
medicaid is a program to assist the poor,elderly,and disabled in obtaining medical care.under the medicaid act,which is title xix of the social security act,the federal government provides financial support to states that establish and administer state medicaid programs in accordance with federal law through a state plan approved by the department of health and human services hhs.one requirement is that the state have a scheme for reimbursing health care providers.a,a.
massachusetts participates in medicaid and its plan,known as masshealth,is administered by an entity the division based in the state executive office of health and human services the executive office.laws.ch.the division fixes the rates it will pay to reimburse providers for numerous health services.these include the furnishing by pharmacies of prescription drugs for medicaid patients.
this reimbursement is calculated separately for the cost of the drug to the pharmacy and for the cost of dispensing it.the former,with which this case alone is concerned,is governed by federal,and state formulas of some complexity,but the only method at issue here calls for reimbursement for the pharmacy estimated acquisition cost.massachusetts defines this cost as an estimate of the price generally and currently paid by eligible pharmacy providers for the most common package size.id.
this general and current price is calculated as a percentage of a wholesaler acquisition cost wac for each drug in question.although how the wac numbers are derived is not fully explained by the parties,the commonwealth says that it is effectively the wholesale catalogue price for the drug but that the real price may often be a few percentage points lower for drugs and many points lower for generics because of common discounts,for speedy payment whether there may be other pertinent costs not included in wac,and how profits are provided,is less clear.
in a new hhs report suggested that a number of states were overpaying for drugs.office of the inspector,dep t of health human,medicaid acquisition cost of generic prescription drug products.massachusetts was then using a wac plus formula to reimburse pharmacies.the state legislature for fiscal year ordered a reduction,directing the division to determine whether wac minus would suffice to ensure enough participating pharmacies to supply patient needs.the division held hearings in september and sought data from massachusetts pharmacies as to their costs of acquisition of individual drugs.the pharmacies generally refused to provide the data,claiming that such data was proprietary.
at the hearings,chain pharmacies such as brooks and cvs conceded that they usually obtained branded drugs at wac minus for prompt payment and paid even less for generics,but the three largest chains said they would no longer serve masshealth if payment were reduced to wac minus.they claimed inter alia that masshealth prescriptions involved extra work and that certain costs like overhead and storage were not included in the wac figures.in sum,they said that they would lose money if they continued at the proposed reduced rate.
in a report issued in october,the division concluded that the pharmacies acquired the branded drugs at wac and generics at less and that while other costs were incurred the massachusetts pharmacies had not documented them.div.of health human,commonwealth of massachusetts,report to the general court reimbursment for prescribed drugs.the recommendation was to reduce payments to wac plus partly to cover other unquantified costs and partly to ensure that masshealth members will have sufficient access to prescribed drugs.id.this new wac plus rate was implemented immediately and is not at issue in this case.
on march,the division adopted emergency amendments to its regulations,lowering the rate to wac plus effective april.according to the division,only one pharmacy had dropped out of masshealth under the wac plus rate,persuading the division that a small further reduction would save money and not curtail supply.the notice adopting the new change,and other changes not here involved,proposed a public hearing in may but made clear that the division believed it was entitled to implement the new wac plus rate in advance of any hearing.
to challenge that contention and the proposed lower rate,the long term care pharmacy alliance long term brought the present action in the district court.long term represents a set of closed pharmacies that provide drugs not to the general public but only to nursing home and other institutional patients.seeking a preliminary injunction,long term claimed that the division failure to provide a prior hearing violated one provision of the medicaid act and its reduction within five months and without new evidence or findings violated another provision of the statute.the respective statutory provisions are a a and a a.
in a nutshell,the first of these medicaid act we will call subsection a requires inter alia that a public process be used to set rates of payment for hospital services,nursing facility services,and services of intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded,in which providers,among others,can comment on proposed rates.the second provision,subsection a,in substance requires inter alia that rates for services in general be sufficient to enlist enough providers to provide services similar to those generally available in the area.
the district court granted the preliminary injunction on april.long term care pharmacy alliance ferguson,d.it directed that the reduced wac plus rate not be applied to prescription drugs supplied to masshealth nursing home patients until after notice and comment rulemaking under subsection a and not be applied to such drugs provided to any masshealth patient until,following the rulemaking,the commonwealth made findings satisfying the subsection a requirements.id.at.the commonwealth appealed from this preliminary injunction which remains in effect today.
because the division gave notice of the new rates shortly before adoption and thereafter held public hearings,the question arises whether this case is moot.neither party argues for mootness,but in a footnote the commonwealth anticipates a mootness objection and argues against it.if the controversy were now academic,this would hazard our article iii jurisdiction,mangual,cir,requiring us to dismiss sua sponte,allende shultz,cir,unless the case fell within the exception for issues that are capable of repetition,yet evading review.pac.terminal icc.
the case is not moot.although notice and opportunity for comment have both now been provided,the division has not adopted a final version of the rate based on the finding under subsection a deemed by the district court to be required.possibly,the division has withheld a order and made no finding precisely because it wants to vindicate its authority for use in the future.still,the injunction currently precludes the division from implementing the reduced wac plus rate and it does so based on an alleged violation of subsection a not yet cured.and,if subsection a applied,even more specific findings would also be required by regulations pertaining to services covered by that section.see note,above.the controversy is therefore not moot and we need not consider whether the recurring issues exception would otherwise apply.
turning then to the district court decision to issue the injunction,there is no reason to repeat the familiar test for preliminary injunctions,new comm wireless,sprintcom.cir,or parse the various standards of review that may be implicated.water keeper alliance of defense,cir.in this case,the only issues that need be decided to resolve the controversy are issues of law subject to plenary review.id.
we begin with subsection a which was the basis for the first part of the district court injunction and requires,in relevant part,that a state plan provide 
a for a public process for determination of rates of payment under the plan for hospital services,nursing facility services,and services of intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded under which 
i proposed rates,the methodologies underlying the establishment of such rates,and justifications for the proposed rates are published,
ii providers,beneficiaries and their representatives,and other concerned state residents are given a reasonable opportunity for review and comment on the proposed rates,methodologies,and justifications,
iii final rates,the methodologies underlying the establishment of such rates,and justifications for such final rates are published 
broadly speaking,subsection a requires something on the order of notice and comment rulemaking for states in their setting of rates for reimbursement of hospital services,nursing facility services,and services of intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded provided under the medicaid act.am.soc.of consultant pharmacists concannon,d,accord children seashore house waldman,cir,cert.denied,d.the commonwealth assumes that if long term members are providing nursing facility services,such members represented by long term are entitled to sue as providers in federal court to enjoin violations of subsection a that affect their interest.
it is quite possible that under emergency conditions subsection a may not automatically require notice and comment before a new rate goes into effect but the commonwealth has not argued on appeal that exceptional circumstances excused a procedural requirement that would otherwise apply.and the findings required by the regulation would remain an obstacle.instead,the commonwealth main response is that long term members simply do not provide services encompassed by subsection a and so the notice and comment provisions have no application to rates set for reimbursing its members.
in the abstract,this is not a surprising position.the commonwealth,through its reimbursement program,buys prescription drugs for masshealth patients.in the absence of a statute,nothing whatever would require the state to provide notice and comment,or any other kind of process,before deciding how much it was willing to pay for any or all drugs.retail pharmacies that supply masshealth customers directly are subject to the same wac plus something rate and have no protection under subsection a or under the first prong of the district court injunction.see am.soc.of consultant pharmacists,d at.
however,subsection a does provide notice and comment rights as to rates set for nursing facility services and long term members seek to bring themselves within this statutory umbrella.they say also that their own operations are different from,and more expensive than,those of retail pharmacies supplying masshealth patients who walk into drug of the extra packaging and tracking needed for residents of nursing homes.apparently nursing homes use the specialized closed pharmacies precisely to do these tasks on a basis.
the statutory coverage issue is not straightforward.the critical phrase in the statute is nursing facility services which is in turn defined to mean 
services which are or were required to be given an individual who needs or needed on a daily basis nursing care provided directly by or requiring the supervision of nursing personnel or other rehabilitation services which as a practical matter can only be provided in a nursing facility on an inpatient basis.
f.this language gives some aid to the commonwealth because drugs are certainly not provided only in nursing facilities on an inpatient basis.on the other hand,drugs are somewhat closer to the core function of nursing home operations than,say,the provision of a gift shop or fresh flowers in the rooms.
the district court points to another section of the statute obligating nursing facilities to provide nursing and related services of a high order,medically related social services,and pharmaceutical services,b a but this language is inconclusive.it says that providing drugs is essential in a nursing home,something we already know so presumably the nursing home would be reimbursed for drugs it supplied itself and could insist on reimbursement rates that were adopted under subsection a after notice and an opportunity to comment.
yet it can not be enough to trigger subsection a that long term members happen to be doing something providing drugs for which reimbursement rates would require notice and comment rulemaking if done directly by the nursing home.here the supplier claiming reimbursement is not the nursing home but the closed pharmacies.as we have noted,retail pharmacies that provide prescription drugs for medicaid patients who walk into drugstores are not covered by subsection a.the who provides may be as important to subsection a as the what.
language being less than plain,we ordinarily would look to purpose and legislative history,stoutt banco popular de puerto rico,cir,but we have been furnished with nothing that is helpful.indeed,congress may not have had a specific intention as to nursing homes and closed pharmacies it could have thought that embattled care facilities like hospitals and nursing homes needed special protection from arbitrary rates but that ordinary pharmacies did not and never considered the problem of a care facility outsourcing a small part of its customary function,with claims under subsection a being made not by the facility but by the provider.on balance,the more straightforward reading of nursing home services encompasses services provided by the nursing home and not services provided to the nursing home or its patients by independent suppliers like closed pharmacies.as a matter of crude analogy,the closed pharmacies look more like suppliers to the nursing home than providers of nursing home services and,whatever extra benefits they provide,long term members,in supplying the raw drugs to the nursing homes,look a lot like retail drug stores supplying masshealth patients.statutory language,without a rationale for the result,is rarely conclusive but it is a start.
turning to imputed purpose,it is easy to imagine why congress wanted special protection for care facilities.their structure makes them especially vulnerable to slow destruction by underfunding by contrast,the market reaction is likely to be quick and decisive if the commonwealth seeks to underpay for drugs,whether provided by ordinary retailers or closed pharmacies.if wac plus is not enough to elicit an adequate supply,the division will simply be forced to pay more and promptly so.thus,whether or not congress even thought specifically about closed pharmacies,the likely purpose for its broader distinction suggests a rationale that leaves closed pharmacies on the unprotected side of the line and outside subsection a.we so hold.
this brings us to subsection a which presents an interpretive problem of quite a different kind.whereas subsection a has a narrow subject rates for three specified sets of services and confers procedural rights on designated persons or entities including providers,subsection a has much broader coverage,sets forth general objectives,and mentions no category of entity or person specially protected.the state plan,says subsection a,must 
provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan including but not limited to utilization review plans as provided for in section i of this title as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
this subsection,unlike subsection a,is not confined to particular services.although the statute does not provide any procedure for the determination of such method
