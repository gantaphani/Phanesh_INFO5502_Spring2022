nancy dickenson,as the conservator for sandra robinson,appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of cardiac and thoracic surgery of eastern tennessee,c t and robert rosser in this diversity action for medical malpractice.the issue on appeal is whether the district court properly excluded the proffered testimony of dickenson medical experts.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to c t,reverse and remand for further proceedings with respect to rosser,and vacate the order excluding the testimony of john penek.
background 
robinson underwent heart bypass surgery on november.the surgery was performed by richard michalik,a cardiac surgeon employed by c rosser,a pulmonologist,was called upon by michalik to provide robinson with postoperative respiratory care.following the removal of robinson ventilation tube,she suffered brain damage due to insufficient oxygen.the lawsuit brought on robinson behalf alleged that her injuries were caused by the purportedly premature removal of her ventilation tube following surgery.
by consent of the parties,the case was assigned to a magistrate judge for disposition.summary judgment in favor of both defendants was granted on the ground that no witness for robinson could competently testify concerning the standard of care applicable to either c t or rosser.the plaintiff argues on appeal that the district court erred by not allowing cardiac surgeon dudley johnson,a practitioner from wisconsin,and pulmonologist john penek,a practitioner from new jersey,to provide such testimony.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,thermoscan,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendants on the sole ground that the plaintiff failed to present admissible evidence concerning the standard of care applicable to either c t or rosser.see rodgers monumental life ins,cir a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element necessarily renders all other factors immaterial.whether the district court grant of summary judgment was proper consequently turns on the appropriateness of its decision to exclude the testimony of the plaintiff experts.
b.the district court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of johnson regarding the alleged negligence of rosser 
johnson stated in his affidavit that he is involved with extubation decisions on almost a daily basis.his curriculum vitae indicates that he has practiced as a surgeon since,and that he has performed thousands of operations.he explained his familiarity with the standard of care for postoperative cardiac patients in kingsport,tennessee as follows 
the published literature that explains the medical community published information that describes the community in general my own knowledge and experience with the type of cardiac surgery being performed and the management of the patient post operatively statements of rosser and michalik contained in their depositions wherein they describe the standard of care statements of rosser and michalik contained in their depositions wherein they describe their educational background and training and reviewing the medical records of sandra robinson.
johnson elaborated on his experience with extubating postoperative patients in his deposition 
over the past three years,how many patients have you managed that are on a ventilator that require in,in excess of a three day stay on the ventilator 
a.the majority of my patients.
okay,how many would that be 
maybe two hundred.
q d o you often request a pulmonary consult for your patients 
very commonly,yes.
okay.and at what point would you request a pulmonary consult 
sometimes even if they have a long history of lung problems.i ask them to see them and follow with us together as we take care of the patients.and commonly afterwards.it could be anywhere.right away or a day or two later if the patients are still in respiratory difficulty.
okay.who would make the decision to extubate a patient 
either can,and we have always agreed.and i cancelled extubations on a number of occasions.and then there has been a rare case where the patient needs to be extubated and i do it.i do,i mean,it my patient and i can do whatever i want,but,but i would discuss it with the pulmonary person and we will discuss whether we think the patient is ready to be extubated or not.
okay.just take me through your process of determining whether a patient can be extubated 
on my patients it rather uncommon to extubate them at the day of surgery.most of them,as i mentioned,are long,difficult cases.i commonly spend ten to fourteen hours in surgery on my patients.there so much to do with them,the next day if blood gases are normal,the assist on the respirator is way down,he moving air in and out well,his lung capacity is,very adequate on how much he can take a deep breath and breathe,he obviously,he or she is alert and neurologically intact.the cardiovascular system would be stable.normal heart function.normal blood pressure.chest would certainly be satisfactory in terms of no diffuse infiltrates and better than,certainly not worse than what it had been before.
despite johnson extensive experience,the district court did not allow him to testify regarding the medical services rendered by rosser on the ground that johnson testimony was unreliable under the gatekeeping principles set forth in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,and its progeny.the district court elaborated on its reasons in the following two paragraphs of its opinion 
johnson deposition testimony reveals that he is not competent to testify concerning the standard of care applicable to a pulmonologist at least as concerns extubation of a ventilation tube.johnson,obviously,is a cardiac thoracic surgeon,not a pulmonologist and he is not trained in pulmonology.he has never qualified as an expert witness in a suit against a pulmonologist.johnson deposition revealed that he knows very little about ventilating medical equipment or the settings to be used.he has never written an article on pulmonology,and could not identify any articles about pulmonology which he has read.looking to issues,there was no peer review regarding his opinion regarding rosser negligence.he could not identify what journals were authoritative that would be applicable to the facts surrounding plaintiff condition.more importantly,he could not say what journals he read or considered in arriving at his opinion and his methodology.also,at various points in his testimony he contradicted his affidavit.for example,he stated in his expert report that he examined the plaintiff chest in arriving at his opinion.but during the deposition,he testified that he in fact never looked at the plaintiff.
in sum,under daubert and its progeny,expert testimony must meet a threshold requirement of reliability.there simply must be more than johnson bare assertion to show that rosser deviated from the standard of care in kingsport,tennessee.the court is not saying that a cardiac surgeon can never be a reliable expert when testifying in matters involving pulmonology,or even anesthesiology or some other medical specialty.however,the purported expert must demonstrate a familiarity with accepted medical literature or published standards in these other areas of specialization in order for his testimony to be reliable in the sense contemplated by federal rule of evidence.for these reasons,the motion for summary judgment of defendant rosser shall likewise be granted.
the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by rule of the federal rules of evi
