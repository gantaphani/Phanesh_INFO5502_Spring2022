this case concerns several contract and tort claims arising out of the planning,construction,and operation of a medical office building in cheyenne,wyoming.that project turned out to be a financial disaster for the plaintiff,memorial hospital of laramie county,which has sued its consultant and de facto landlord,healthcare realty.the district court dismissed all of memorial hospital claims on summary judgment.because we find that there are disputed issues of fact material to two of these tortious misrepresentation and contractual bad reverse the district court decision in part and affirm in part.
background 
a.the parties dealings 
in the late,memorial hospital of laramie county united medical center began planning the construction of a new medical office building on its campus in cheyenne,wyoming.in,memorial hospital retained a realty management,hrm,a wholly owned subsidiary of healthcare realty trust,hrt.we will call them both healthcare realty,for simplicity sake.healthcare realty had expertise in building and managing medical office buildings,and the hospital asked the company to assess the market for such a building and the feasibility of constructing and managing it.
in,healthcare realty provided memorial hospital with a feasibility study and funding analysis,which concluded that market demand was sufficient for a building and advised that the building should be less than square feet.the study specifically warned that a large facility might be unprofitable because it would be hard to rent that much space.the report also presented five funding and ownership options for the building.the first four were each accompanied by an analysis of advantages and disadvantages.the hrm ownership under a property operating agreement was billed as a response to the unfavorable accounting and the negative operational results associated with the other options and listed no disadvantages.id.at.
under the suggested operating agreement,the hospital would control tenancy and operational decisions but healthcare realty would finance the construction and hold title to the building,allowing the hospital to benefit from favorable accounting treatment.id.each month,the hospital would pay the deficiency,if any,between the net operational cash flow of the facility and hrm yield requirement on its equity investment in the facility.id.at.in other words,healthcare realty would own the building,but memorial hospital would assume most of the associated financial risks.
in response to healthcare realty warnings about facility size,the hospital explained in a letter that it purposely oversized the structure to allow for expansion and believed a larger facility eventually will be fully occupied.app.the hospital therefore retained healthcare realty to perform further modeling on a larger building.healthcare realty agreed to create,prepare,and refine a series of ownership models and ownership scenarios for a proposed gross square foot facility.id.at.a memorial hospital executive sent a letter to healthcare realty,saying that the hospital desires hrt participation in the project in some form,regardless of ownership.id.at.the letter acknowledged that because of healthcare realty concerns about the size of the building,any agreement to build a large building would require memorial hospital to provide financial guarantees.
on april,the parties executed a letter of intent,stating that they would enter into an operating agreement similar to the one detailed in the feasibility study,for a building currently estimated at rentable square feet at a cost of approximately million.id.at.over the course of the next several months,healthcare realty provided the hospital with analyses of the financial outlook for a building with gross rentable square feet.these materials were styled as an assessment of the property operating agreement apoa and an assessment of building vacancy abv.app.the abv calculated what the hospital surplus or shortfall would be over the first five years of operation given different levels of occupancy.the apoa is a single page document that explains the basic structure of the operating agreement and provides two examples of memorial hospital financial obligations,showing a surplus for the hospital in the sixth year if the building were occupied.
on november,the hospital and healthcare realty entered a property operating agreement poa.healthcare realty agreed to build and own a medical building on the hospital campus.the hospital retained certain approval and management rights and agreed to pay a monthly operations payment.this payment was an operations base of per month plus inflation and capital additions,minus any net revenues from the building.id.at.the agreement also gave the hospital an option to purchase the facility after twenty years.exhibits,including two budgets relevant to this litigation,were also attached.
over the ensuing months,several developments affected the financial health of the project.first,memorial hospital initiated several revisions to the construction plan that required the outlay of unbudgeted money by healthcare realty.second,building space did not lease quickly.third,it became apparent that the building actual costs would be substantially higher than healthcare realty original budgets had indicated.
in light of these developments,the parties executed three amendments to the poa.first,on february,healthcare realty agreed to purchase medical office space occupied by one medical provider elsewhere in cheyenne to induce it to lease space in the new building.second,on august,the parties agreed to push the commencement date of the agreement back from november,to april.third,effective july,healthcare realty agreed to exclude some tenant improvement costs from its calculation of the hospital operations base and to postpone the date upon which the hospital became responsible for operations payments.in the third amendment,the parties also included a ratification clause that represented that neither party was in default under the poa.
as of november,the medical office building was occupied and the hospital yearly shortfall under the operating is,the amount it owed healthcare,or nearly ten times the figure projected in the abv.
b.this litigation 
on july,memorial hospital sued healthcare realty in federal district court in diversity alleging four causes of action the tort of negligent misrepresentation,for which the hospital sought damages misrepresentation in contract,for which the hospital sought rescission breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing in tort and contract,for which the hospital sought damages and mutual mistake in contract,for which the hospital sought rescission and restitution.healthcare realty counterclaimed for a declaration of contract validity and for damages based on anticipatory breach of contract.
the district court granted summary judgment in healthcare realty favor on each of memorial hospital claims.as to negligent misrepresentation,the court held that omitted figures,projections,and opinions did not satisfy the elements of the tort.as to the contractual misrepresentation claim,the court found that the sheer impossibility of a return to the stage counsel ed against the equity of rescission,and that the record was devoid of a genuine issue of material fact that the complained of misrepresentations were anything other than opinions,projections,and predictions of future occurrences,not statements of existing fact.app.as to the good faith and fair dealing claim,the court found that under wyoming tort law the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing applied only in the employment and insurance contexts,and that under tennessee contract law healthcare realty delivered on what it promised in the contract the building to memorial hospital exact structural preferences.id.at.n ot a single financial projection or cost estimation was promised or expressly guaranteed by hrt at peril of breach.id.at.as to the mutual mistake claim,the court held that the mistake was not mutual because the evidence did not establish that healthcare realty was mistaken.last,the court declared moot healthcare realty counterclaim for declaratory judgment 
ii.discussion 
preliminary matters 
this is a summary judgment motion,which we review de novo while viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to memorial hospital.it is also a diversity case,which means that we apply state law with the objective of obtaining the result that would be reached in state court.butt bank of,cir.to determine what states laws apply,we use the rules of wyoming,because that is where the district court sat.klaxon stentor.century real estate meraj int l inv,cir.the parties agree that these rules provide that the hospital tort claims are governed by wyoming law and its contract claims are governed by tennessee law.
negligent misrepresentation in tort 
despite achieving occupancy in the new medical office building,memorial hospital owed healthcare realty almost one million dollars under the agreement in.the hospital maintains that healthcare realty led it to believe that it would owe substantially less by that time,and might even be turning a profit.the hospital claim that healthcare realty committed negligent misrepresentation should survive summary judgment.
negligent misrepresentation is a tort.under wyoming law 
o ne who,in the course of his business,profession or employment,or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest,supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information,if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.
richey patrick,quoting restatement second of torts emphasis omitted.as described in greater detail below,memorial hospital has presented evidence from which a reasonable jury might conclude that healthcare realty negligently supplied it with false information about the financial prospects of the office building,on which it justifiably relied in entering the real estate deal.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this claim.
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant on the ground that the statements by healthcare realty on which memorial hospital relies were mere predictions or projections,and thus outside the scope of the tort of negligent misrepresentation under wyoming law.the wyoming supreme court has held that statements of opinion or intent are generally exempt from the tort of negligent misrepresentation.see birt wells fargo home.in birt,wells fargo made comments to and birt implying that their application for a home loan would be approved.relying on those statements,the birts signed an expensive construction contract.when their loan was denied,they sued for negligent misrepresentation.the wyoming supreme court refused to hold wells fargo liable because it found that the misrepresentation tort did not apply to promises,but only to facts.the court explained that the extension of negligent misrepresentation to situations involving future intentions would endow every breach of contract with a potential tort claim for negligent promise.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
on the other hand,in gould james,the wyoming supreme court held that a salesman who misrepresented the value of land in texas and its suitability for citrus trees could be held liable,because his expertise and knowledge made his statements facts rather than opinions.where the parties have unequal knowledge and a special relationship,the court explained,statements of value can be actionable facts.id.at.gould concerned fraudulent rather than negligent misrepresentation,but we see no reason that wyoming would adopt a different distinction between facts and opinions in the two torts.
we believe that some of the statements made by healthcare realty in connection with its analysis of the financial viability of the new facility constitute actionable facts and so fall under the tort of misrepresentation as interpreted by the wyoming courts.as in gould,the parties to this case had a special,as client and paid healthcare realty,as an expert in the field,was hired precisely because of its superior knowledge of the field.when a paid consultant,relied on for its expertise,fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating information supplied for the guidance of others in their business transactions,the consultant is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to the clients by their justifiable reliance upon any false information supplied.
in light of the wyoming supreme court holding in birt,we emphasize that the tort of negligent misrepresentation extends only to the misrepresentation of underlying facts it does not extend to promises or predictions.wyoming tort law does not make a consultant its clients insurer against unanticipated developments,even if a more skilled prognosticator would have done a better job at anticipating the future.therefore,healthcare realty is not liable merely because the predictions it made did not come true.its statements must be judged strictly according to information available at the time they were made,and not with the benefit of hindsight.nonetheless,the data from which predictions are derived may be factual in nature,and an expert has a duty of care in selecting the facts on which its analysis is based.
memorial hospital has identified at least four false statements of fact that,it says,underlay healthcare realty financial projections.based on our review of the record,the hospital has demonstrated a genuine material dispute as to three of those misstatements.we discuss each in turn.
budget line item 
as part of its analysis of the financial viability of the project,healthcare realty prepared a detailed budget it called the consolidating development budget,including the project estimated expenses for accounting,leasing,marketing,and many other professional costs.app.for accounting,the budget estimated for marketing,for leasing,the chart simply says,a hyphen.id.the chart treats the as if it were arithmetically equivalent to zero.in fact,healthcare realty later revealed,the figure for leasing costs should have been.thus,the subtotal and total costs contained false information,because they relied on treating the applicable leasing costs as if they were zero,rather than a substantially higher number.if the hospital justifiably relied on this information and healthcare realty failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in providing it,healthcare realty is liable.richey,at.
the district court dismissed this claim because it thought substituting for was only nondisclosure,not misrepresentation.the court explained that it lack ed the wizardly power to turn nothing into something for purposes of summary judgment.app.however,in the charts presented,healthcare realty treated the hyphen as if it meant not nothing,but zero.zero is a number,not the absence of one.see generally robert kaplan,the nothing that is a natural history of zero.the usage in the budget is slightly confusing because,in the other budget attached to the poa,healthcare realty did use the numeral instead of a hyphen.app.but in the budget charts where hyphens appear,they are added as if they were zeroes.thus,a reasonable jury could find that the projected leasing cost of zero given on line was false information supplied to the hospital.
a jury could also infer that listing the cost for leasing as zero,rather than using whatever underlying data were available,was negligent.when revising the budget in march,healthcare realty substituted a projected expenditure of,explaining that it had originally expected that the project management and contingency dollars would cover the cost of leasing and that subsequent events had made this impossible.id.at.this suggests that healthcare realty was aware that leasing costs would be above zero,but instead of revealing this fact in the budget,buried the number in other line items.we can not say,on this record,whether that treatment was reasonable.if subsequent events were responsible for making the zero estimate unrealistic,healthcare realty could not be held liable for misrepresentation.without more information regarding these calculations,however,a jury might conclude that healthcare realty representation that leasing would cost no money was a misstatement that the consultant knew at the time to be false.but that is a material issue of fact.the misrepresentation claim therefore survives summary judgment.
tenant allowance 
the budget also contained an entry of several million dollars for a tenant allowance.app.this allowance was money given to the tenants to outfit their suites for medical use.the budget entry was based on an estimate of per usable square foot.memorial hospital has presented several emails that suggest that healthcare realty the contract was a typical suite would in fact require between and per square foot.app.it has also presented evidence that some potential tenants found the allowance not adequate to do a medical suite.app.memorial hospital claims that keeping the figure in the budget rather than a higher figure,and failing to make clear that the allowance would not actually cover all of the improvements that tenants would demand,was negligent misrepresentation.
the district court dismissed this claim as a matter of law,holding that because the tenant allowance was an estimate,it should be characterized as an opinion under wyoming law.app.other items on the budget have the notation,signifying that they were estimated.app.the tenant allowance,however,noted just that it was b ased on usf.app.if healthcare realty meant that per square foot was enough to outfit the medical suites,that is a fact that it was required to derive.
in a march letter to the hospital,healthcare realty explained that it was forced to give the tenants significantly more than much as per square the tenants expected the allowance to cover virtually all costs of their suite construction.app.however,the hospital claims that it and the tenants were originally told that the would be an adequate amount for a reasonable tenant finish.aplt br.one letter in the record by a tenant also suggests that he was led to believe that no additional funds would be necessary.app.a reasonable jury could infer from this evidence that healthcare realty knew at the time that the per square foot allowance was insufficient to cover what had been promised to the tenants.
we do not agree with the district court that projections of this sort,when made by expert consultants,are mere opinions that can not be deemed misrepresentations of fact.as in gould,where an expert valuation of land was actionable,at,we believe that the amount of money reasonably necessary for a medical tenant to outfit an office is a matter of fact indeed,a consultant expertise in such matters is precisely what the client is paying for.we do not mean to wyoming law would not a projection of this sort could be held to be a misrepresentation merely because it turned out to be incorrect.but there is evidence here that healthcare realty knew at the time that was inadequate to prepare a medical suite.the hospital should be allowed to prove that this figure was false and that healthcare realty failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in including this figure in their estimate and in representing what it would purchase,based on the information available to it when it prepared the budget.
year apov predictions 
in its assessment of building vacancy,healthcare realty provided figures for the net rental income in the first five years of the project as a function of the amount of the building rented.app.in the two lines representing and occupancy,the abv assumes that net rental income would increase about annually for the first five years.mysteriously,the year calculation in the apoa assumed an increase of approximately over the net rental income reported for year in the abv.neither document explicitly notes this underlying change the assumption is buried in the arithmetic.this assumption of a sudden increase in income allowed healthcare realty to estimate a surplus,rather than a deficit,for the project in year.if healthcare realty had continued to apply the increase for the sixth year,it would have predicted a shortfall of more than.the hospital claims that healthcare realty unexplained prediction of a bubble was without foundation and therefore negligent,or even fraudulent.
the district court dismissed this claim on the ground that the two charts were projections and calculated opinions,rather than statements of existing or cognizable fact.app.however,as discussed above,under wyoming law,when an expert projects figures based on underlying data,he must use reasonable care and competence in selecting the data.
memorial hospital claims that in fact,healthcare realty estimates of the rental rates were tied to the consumer price index aplt br.at,which would make the estimated increase false.indeed,in a later memorandum concerning the lease of one of the building tenants,healthcare realty explicitly predicted the revenue from that lease to increase at cpi annually.app.a reasonable jury could infer from this record that healthcare realty estimated the year increase in the building revenue at one amount while reporting it as another,and thus conveyed false information.
at oral argument,healthcare realty said that it typically expects a jump in rate increases sometime between the fifth and eighth year because the first leases in a new building must be low in order to attract tenants,and those leases are five to eight years long.if this claim makes its way into the record and proves to be true,it might rebut the hospital allegation that the increase was a negligent misrepresentation.but that is an issue to be established at trial.on this record,a reasonable jury could infer that the increase was false and chosen without reasonable care,so material issues of fact on this point preclude summary judgment.
operating cost budget 
the operating budget estimated operating costs at per rentable square foot.they turned out to be,as healthcare realty admitted,per rentable square foot instead.memorial hospital claims that the figure was a misrepresentation.however,it points to nothing in the record that demonstrates that this projection was predicated on any factual data that were false,or negligently calculated,at the time.the figure was in the hospital original complaint,but no discussion of this point appears in its brief in response to the motion for summary judgment.the district court did not discuss this issue in dismissing the hospital claim.
the hospital only evidence that the figure was a misrepresentation is that years later the actual figure turned out to be higher.the tort of negligent misrepresentation does not,however,create a duty to be clairvoyant.unlike the representations discussed above,there is nothing other than hindsight to show that healthcare realty violated a duty of care here.the hospital fails to point to any evidence supporting its claim that healthcare realty was negligent,so there is no genuine issue of material fact on this point.
other aspects of the misrepresentation claim 
in two footnotes,the district court held that even if the hospital could establish that healthcare realty had conveyed false factual information,its misrepresentation claim would also fail as a matter of law because the hospital could not prove it had reasonably relied on the figures or that healthcare realty had been negligent.we reverse these alternative holdings.
the district court held that the claim that healthcare realty had been negligent failed as a matter of law because the hospital had only shown one or two potentially unfounded estimates amidst thousands of pages of projections.app.it is true that,even on generous estimates,the negligent misrepresentations identified by memorial hospital account for far less than half of the ultimate shortfall.a jury might find that the plaintiffs would have proceeded with the project even if these misstatements had not been made,in which case healthcare realty would not be liable.but we can not say,on the summary judgment record,that the identified misstatements were so minor that they could not have affected memorial hospital decisions on the margin they were sign
