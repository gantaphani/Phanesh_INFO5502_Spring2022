defendant larry coccia appeals,on several grounds,his conviction for possession of a firearm while subject to a domestic restraining order,pursuant to g.we affirm.
we present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict,see united states boulerice,cir,reserving a discussion of some facts for our analysis.coccia,a retired air force officer,was in the midst of a difficult divorce in pennsylvania in.a pennsylvania family court had issued a domestic restraining order against coccia on april.the order forbade him from abusing,harassing,or threatening his wife or children,and from possessing,transferring or acquiring any weapons for one year from the date of the order.
to increase his chances of securing more favorable visitation rights with his children,coccia traveled to new england to seek a favorable psychological evaluation from an ivy league doctor.ultimately,he secured an appointment with a psychiatrist,margaret mcgovern,in wellesley,massachusetts.coccia met with mcgovern on three consecutive days in november.
during the first session,mcgovern became spooked by her new patient,who refused to provide any information about where he was staying.concerned for her safety,mcgovern arranged to have her daughter call during the second session to confirm that she was safe.matters worsened at the second session.coccia stated that he might plan a bombing or disperse anthrax that he was capable of such things based on his military experience that mcgovern would read about his actions in the papers that he would go after president bush and that he had been previously caught with firearms in his car in maryland in violation of a judge order.mcgovern was sufficiently troubled by coccia comments that she called the fbi before the third session two fbi agents,accompanied by two wellesley police officers,including detective jill mcdermott,met with mcgovern shortly before the appointment.mcgovern and the officers agreed that,in light of coccia comments,a more extensive psychiatric evaluation was warranted.
coccia arrived in a rental car,with his personal possessions,and parked in mcgovern circular driveway directly in front of her front door mcgovern met with coccia,informed him that she had called the fbi,and notified coccia that fbi agents were waiting for him.thereafter,while the officers and agents met with coccia,mcgovern prepared a pink paper,an order from a medical professional providing for the involuntary commitment and psychiatric evaluation of an individual thought to be a danger to himself or others coccia was upset and hostile.he discussed his divorce,the custody proceedings,and his intent to relocate to colorado.but he did not answer the officers questions about where he was staying in massachusetts.upon learning that his car would be towed,coccia refused to give his car keys to the officers or consent to a search of the vehicle.while awaiting the ambulance,coccia called his sister in michigan to tell her what was happening to him.
after coccia was taken away,detective mcdermott and her partner arranged to tow coccia vehicle.a subsequent inventory search at the wellesley police department impound lot revealed several knives,a replica pistol,and a rifle case.at this point,detective mcdermott and her partner obtained a search warrant.after obtaining the warrant,the officers opened coccia rifle case,which contained an assault rifle and approximately rounds of ammunition.the officers also found documentation regarding the divorce and child custody actions,a copy of the restraining order,a knapsack containing over in cash,and a receipt for a recent purchase of ammunition.
coccia was indicted on one count of violating g,which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone subject to a domestic restraining order.he moved to suppress the firearm on the ground that the decision by the wellesley police officer to impound his vehicle violated his fourth amendment rights.he argued that the seizure of his vehicle was unreasonable because he could have made other arrangements to remove it from mcgovern driveway.at the suppression hearing,mcgovern and mcdermott testified for the government.terri torres,coccia sister,and tim aiken,a friend of coccia,testified for the defense that other arrangements could have been made for coccia vehicle.the district court denied the motion and held that the towing decision was reasonable under the circumstances.
at trial,the government presented the testimony of mcdermott and a firearms expert,as well as documentary and physical evidence.coccia elected to represent himself,with standby counsel assisting him,and took the stand on his own behalf.he testified that he was heartbroken by his family situation and desperately trying to improve it,had not said anything inappropriate to mcgovern,had purchased the gun and ammunition as an investment many years before,had never fired the gun,had never seen the restraining order,and was in the process of moving to colorado.coccia parents and sister testified regarding coccia character and family travails.
the jury convicted him,and the district court,departing upward from the applicable guidelines sentencing range based upon coccia dangerousness,sentenced him to sixty months imprisonment.this appeal followed.
coccia raises several challenges to his conviction.first,he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress.second,he asserts that the court erred in denying his motion for acquittal on the ground that the pennsylvania restraining order did not contain the restrictions explicitly required by g c ii.third,he contends that g is unconstitutional under the second amendment,the tenth amendment,the due process clause of the fifth amendment,and the commerce clause 
motion to suppress 
coccia contests the towing of his car from mcgovern property as an unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment the government responds that the decision by the police officers to impound the car was a reasonable exercise of their community caretaking function.
we consider coccia claim under a bifurcated standard.see united states kornegay,cir.we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusion de novo.see united states meada,cir.in so doing,we will uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.united states garner,cir.
generally,a law enforcement officer may only seize property pursuant to a warrant based on probable cause describing the place to be searched and the property to be seized.see horton california,d.there are,however,exceptions to this requirement,including the community caretaking exception see cady dombrowski,d.the community caretaking exception recognizes that the police perform a multitude of community functions apart from investigating crime.in performing this community caretaking role,police are expected to aid those in distress,combat actual hazards,prevent potential hazards from materializing and provide an infinite variety of services to preserve and protect public safety.united states,cir.relevant here,the community caretaking function encompasses law enforcement authority to remove vehicles that impede traffic or threaten public safety and convenience.see dakota opperman,d.
coccia acknowledges the community caretaking exception,but,citing opperman and colorado bertine,d,he argues that the community caretaking exception does not apply to the impoundment of his car because the government failed to establish that the car was towed from mcgovern property pursuant to standard operating procedures.we disagree with his contention that the absence of standardized criteria invalidates the impoundment at issue in this case.
neither opperman nor bertine holds that the impoundment of a vehicle conducted in the absence of standardized protocols is a per se violation of the fourth amendment.indeed,opperman does not even concern impoundments.its focus is on the need for standards to govern inventory searches conducted after a lawful impoundment.see also florida wells,d stating that criteria or standardized routine must guide an officer discretion during an inventory search united states hellman,cir it is the inventorying practice and not the impounding practice that,if routinely followed could render the inventory search a reasonable search under opperman.
bertine as well was concerned primarily with the constitutionality of an inventory search.it is true that the court did state that the impoundment of the car in that case was reasonable under the fourth amendment because it was conducted pursuant to standard criteria and was based on something other than the suspicion of criminal activity.at.contrary to coccia suggestion,however,we do not understand bertine to mean that an impoundment decision made without the existence of standard procedures is per se unconstitutional.rather,we read bertine to indicate that an impoundment decision made pursuant to standardized procedures will most likely,although not necessarily always,satisfy the fourth amendment.see miranda city of cornelius,cir t he decision to impound pursuant to the authority of a city ordinance and a state statute does not,in and of itself,determine the reasonableness of the seizure under the fourth amendment.see also united states goodrich,d,stating that impoundments conducted pursuant to standardized procedures fall within a safe harbor of constitutionality.
courts,including this one,have frequently held that impoundments of vehicles for community caretaking purposes are consonant with the fourth amendment so long as the impoundment decision was reasonable under the circumstances.see,cir collecting cases.this reasonableness analysis does not hinge solely on any particular factor.see united states miller,cir concluding that the seizure of a boat was constitutional under the community caretaking exception,without regard to the existence of standard procedures,because the officers conduct in boarding the boat was reasonable under all of the circumstances miranda,at stating,in an impoundment case,that the question upon review of a search or seizure is not whether the search or seizure was authorized by state law.the question is rather whether the search was reasonable under the fourth amendment.
we have explained previously that it is inappropriate for the existence of and adherence to standard procedures to be the sine qua non of a reasonable impound decision 
virtually by definition,the need for police to function as community caretakers arises fortuitously,when unexpected circumstances present some transient hazard which must be dealt with on the spot.the police can not sensibly be expected to have developed,in advance,standard protocols running the entire gamut of possible eventualities.rather,they must be free to follow sound police procedure,that is to choose freely among the available options,so long as the option chosen is within the universe of reasonable choices.where the police have solid,reasons for impounding a car,there is no need for them to show that they followed explicit criteria in deciding to impound,as long as the decision was reasonable.
at.we did not decide in whether standard procedures could be required where,as here,the impoundment was followed by an inventory search,but we do not think a per se rule requiring such standards would be appropriate.at.as explained in,standard protocols have limited utility in circumscribing police discretion in the impoundment context because of the numerous and varied circumstances in which impoundment decisions must be made.see id.at.moreover,a police officer discretion to impound a car is sufficiently cabined by the requirement that the decision to impound be based,at least in part,on a reasonable community caretaking concern and not exclusively on the suspicion of criminal activity.bertine,at.accordingly,the impoundment of coccia car did not violate the fourth amendment merely because there was no evidence that the impoundment was done pursuant to police protocols.
as we held in,whether a decision to impound is reasonable under the fourth amendment is based on all the facts and circumstances of a given case.see id.at stating that to find whether the impoundment of a car was reasonable a court must look to all the facts and circumstances of the present case in light of the principles set forth in prior decisions.for several reasons,the decision to tow coccia car from mcgovern property was reasonable.
first,coccia was being removed from mcgovern property in an ambulance for a psychiatric evaluation,and there is no claim that the decision to evaluate coccia was pretextual.because coccia would be indisposed for an indeterminate,and potentially lengthy,period,the officers properly made arrangements for the safekeeping of the vehicle,which was packed with his personal belongings.because coccia car was filled with many of his belongings,it was a possible target for theft or vandalism.see united states,cir breyer,impounding a vehicle to protect it from theft or vandalism is reasonable under the community caretaking exception.
second,towing the vehicle reduced the risk of a future confrontation between coccia and mcgovern.coccia knew that mcgovern had been involved in the decision to commit him and there was testimony that coccia was angry about the commitment.under the circumstances,the officers were reasonable in concluding that removing coccia car from mcgovern property would eliminate the need for coccia to return to mcgovern property to collect his car and thereby reduce the possibility of a violent altercation.
third,coccia comments to mcgovern led to a concern that coccia car might contain items constituting a threat to public safety,such as explosive material,chemicals or biological agents.pursuant to the community caretaking function,police may conduct warrantless searches and seizures to take possession of dangerous material that is not within anyone control.see cady,at.finding warrantless search proper under the community caretaking exception where the officers reasonably believed that a gun was abandoned in the trunk of a car.
finally,there was no obvious alternative means for removing the car other than impoundment.the only call that coccia made before going to the hospital was to his sister in michigan,and he did not inform the officers of another means to remove the car.in these circumstances,the officers were reasonable in concluding that there was no one immediately available to take the car see united states,cir caselaw supports the view that where a driver is arrested and there is no one immediately on hand to take possession,the officials have a legitimate reason from impounding the car.
despite these facts supporting the reasonableness of the impound decision,coccia argues that the impoundment was unreasonable because officer mcdermott admitted that she wanted to search the car,and that the impoundment was unlawful under massachusetts law.neither contention is persuasive.
that officer mcdermott may have favored impounding the car,in part,because she wished to search its contents is not dispositive.a search or seizure undertaken pursuant to the community caretaking exception is not infirm merely because it may also have been motivated by a desire to investigate crime.as long as impoundment pursuant to the community caretaking function is not a mere subterfuge for investigation,the coexistence of investigatory and caretaking motives will not invalidate the seizure,at see also bertine,at.search is valid if it is not for the sole purpose of investigation.as discussed above,there were legitimate community caretaking justifications for impounding coccia car and there was no evidence that these justifications were merely pretext for an investigatory search 
finally,assuming that the legality of the impoundment under state law is relevant to the fourth amendment inquiry,the impoundment of coccia car did not violate massachusetts law.under.ch,d,a car may be only be towed from private property at the request of the car owner or the property owner.see commonwealth brinson.officer mcdermott testified that mcgovern wanted the car removed from her property.this testimony was supported by mcgovern statements to the officers that she feared coccia.the officers could have reasonably inferred from mcgovern statements that
