this case arises from the comprehensive settlement agreement reached in among major american tobacco companies and states,including,that sued them for reimbursement of medicaid and other costs attributable to smoking.pursuant to the settlement agreement,will receive approximately billion over the next years.the plaintiffs are medicaid recipients who suffer from illnesses.the plaintiffs assert that to the extent the settlement funds to be received by the state of exceed the state actual expenditures for illnesses on behalf of medicaid recipients hereafter the overage,the state of is required by b to distribute that overage to medicaid recipients.although the plaintiffs sued state officials in their official capacities,not the state of directly,the district court dismissed the lawsuit,determining it was barred by sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.
we conclude,pursuant to the doctrine of ex parte young,that the suit is not barred by sovereign immunity.we further conclude,however,that the claims the plaintiffs allege are precluded by congress amendment to the medicaid statute,which provides that tobacco settlement funds received by a state may be used for any expenditures deemed appropriate by the state.see d b ii.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal on that basis.
on january,sued the major domestic tobacco companies,seeking damages for costs related to injuries suffered by its medicaid recipients.lawsuit was based upon a variety of theories including false advertising,fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation,civil conspiracy,negligence,products liability,and restitution for health care costs for recipients of public assistance.on november,along with other states that had filed similar actions against the tobacco companies,entered into a global settlement.under the master settlement agreement msa,which memorialized the global settlement,the tobacco companies agreed to take steps aimed at reducing or eliminating tobacco use by minors and educating the public at large about the dangers of tobacco use.msa,at,available at.the tobacco companies also agreed to pay various sums to the settling states over years,in amounts to be calculated based upon a complex formula.id.at.it is estimated that at the end of the payout,the state of will have received as much as billion.

the plaintiffs are medicaid recipients who suffer from illnesses.they filed this lawsuit against officials of the state of,alleging that the officials violated,and continue to violate,the federal disbursement rules for medicaid recovery set forth in b.specifically,the plaintiffs assert that a portion of funds received by the state of constitute amounts previously assigned to the state by them and other recipients of public assistance upon receipt of medical benefits for their illnesses.they allege that the state officials are thus required to determine what portion of the funds are attributable to their medicaid assigned claims ascertain how much money the state has spent for treatment of illnesses on behalf of recipients of public assistance and distribute the overage,if any,to eligible medicaid recipients.the plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the state officials to comply with the federal medicaid distribution rules set forth in b.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint solely on the ground of sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.the district court granted that motion,and did not consider the merits of the plaintiffs claims.this appeal followed.
the defendants argue that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs lack standing and their claims are not ripe for adjudication.because standing and ripeness are threshold requirements,without which neither the district court nor this court has jurisdiction,we address these issues first.see pritikin dep t of energy,cir.
t o satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show he has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the defendants contend that the plaintiffs injuries are not concrete and particularized because the amendment to the medicaid statute,codified at d b ii,removed any stake the plaintiffs might have had in the settlement funds.additionally,the defendants argue that because the settlement funds resulting from the will be paid out over years,the plaintiffs asserted injuries are too speculative.
at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice lujan,at.in this case,the plaintiffs allege that,pursuant to the msa,will receive the settlement proceeds through annual payments over the next years and that the state officials will cause all of those proceeds to be used for the state own purposes,depriving its medicaid recipients of any overage which is payable to them under b.these allegations are sufficient to allege both that a concrete injury actually occurred,and that a future injury will likely occur.see nelsen king county,cir citing city of los angeles lyons,d,and littleton,d.whether the amendment to the medicaid statutes frees to do with the proceeds as it sees fit is a question of law that does not affect the plaintiffs standing to bring this suit.see davis passman,d noting that question of whether a plaintiff has standing to bring suit,and thus whether the court has jurisdiction to hear the controversy,is separate from the question of whether a plaintiff has a cause of action.the plaintiffs have standing.
we also conclude that the plaintiffs claims are ripe for adjudication.a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.internal quotation marks omitted.texas united states,d quoting thomas union carbide agric.prods,d quoting charles wright et,federal practice and procedure,at.the defendants contend that the plaintiffs claims are not ripe for adjudication because too many speculative contingencies must be fulfilled before the plaintiffs can successfully challenge the allocation of the funds.for example,the defendants argue that,until the end of the period,it can not be determined whether any portion of the funds received by the state of will constitute an overage allegedly distributable to medicaid recipients.
despite the contingencies noted by the defendants,the state of has created a dedicated fund for settlement proceeds,and has allocated its first payment under the to that fund.because has taken this course of action,the question regarding the state proper usage of the settlement funds is no longer an abstract disagreement over administrative policies,abbott labs.gardner,d overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.taking the plaintiffs allegations as true,the effect of the state decision to allocate the money has already been felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.id.at.the plaintiffs claims are ripe for adjudication.
we next consider the parties sovereign immunity arguments although the plaintiffs sued state officials,not the state of,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs complaint was nonetheless barred by sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.we review de novo a district court determination that a suit against a state official is barred by the state eleventh amendment immunity.romano bible,cir.
a state sovereign immunity from suit in federal court normally extends to suits against its officers in their official capacities.see,natural res.def.council cal.dep t of,cir.the supreme court set forth an exception,however,in ex parte young.under the ex parte young doctrine,a plaintiff may maintain a suit for prospective relief against a state official in his official capacity,when that suit seeks to correct an ongoing violation of the constitution or federal law.ex parte young,at.see also armstrong wilson,cir rejecting the argument that ex parte young applies only to constitutional,not statutory,violations.the ex parte young doctrine is founded on the legal fiction that acting in violation of the constitution or federal law brings a state officer into conflict with the superior authority of the constitution,and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.young,at.
whether the ex parte young doctrine applies in this case turns primarily upon one question is the relief the plaintiffs seek prospective,aimed at remedying an ongoing violation of federal law,or is it retrospective,aimed at remedying a past violation of the law the district court concluded that the relief the plaintiffs seek,although couched in terms of declaratory and injunctive relief,actually requests retrospective monetary damages.relying on two district court decisions,the district court reasoned that because the state became entitled to the funds at the time the was signed,the entry of an injunction or declaratory judgment requiring state officials in the future to distribute to the plaintiffs the overage described in b would be equivalent to an order telling the state how to disburse funds from its treasury.the district court,therefore,determined that the plaintiffs claims were for money damages against the state and ran afoul of the eleventh amendment.we disagree.
the supreme court explicated the distinction between permissible prospective,and impermissible retrospective,relief for purposes of the ex parte young doctrine in a series of cases in the.in edelman jordan,d,the court held that an injunction requiring a state official to conform his administration of a federal welfare program to federal law was prospective and thus not barred by the eleventh amendment,but that an order that the official remit the amounts he had wrongfully withheld in the past was retrospective and thus impermissible.see id.at.the court acknowledged that the distinction between prospective and retrospective relief would not in many instances be that between day and night,id.at.it stated firmly,however,that where a decree grants relief measured in terms of a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials,it is in practical effect indistinguishable in many aspects from an award of damages against the state and is barred by the state sovereign immunity,id.at.
the court narrowed the scope of edelman broadly phrased prohibition in two later cases.in milliken bradley,d,the court clarified that a prospectively oriented injunction could have a direct and substantial impact on a state treasury without running afoul of the rule in edelman,so long as the expenditure of funds was ancillary to the injunction primary objective which,in milliken,was remedying the unconstitutional segregation of the detroit public schools.id.at.see also id.at.in contrast to edelman,there was no money award here in favor of respondent bradley or any members of his class.in quern jordan,d,a continuation of the edelman litigation,the court clarified that an injunction requiring the state to provide notice to the plaintiff class about the availability of state administrative remedies for the past deprivation of benefits was permissible,because it was more properly viewed as ancillary to the prospective relief already ordered by the court.id.at.see also id.at.rejecting the state official argument that giving the proposed notice would lead inexorably to the payment of state funds for retroactive benefits,because the causal links were indirect at best and not directly imposed by the federal injunction.
the supreme court again addressed the distinction between permissible prospective,and improper retrospective,relief in papasan allain,d.there,the court stressed that young applicability has been tailored to conform as precisely as possible to those specific situations in which it is necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights and hold state officials responsible to the supreme authority of the united states.internal quotation marks omitted.id.at.quoting pennhurst state sch.and hosp.halderman,d quoting young,at.the court explained that the inquiry must focus on the purpose of the relief sought 
relief that in essence serves to compensate a party injured in the past by an action of a state official in his official capacity that was illegal under federal law is barred even when the state official is the named defendant on the other hand,relief that serves directly to bring an end to a present violation of federal law is not barred by the eleventh amendment even though accompanied by a substantial ancillary effect on the state treasury.
papasan,at.applying this analysis,the court in papasan held that the plaintiffs breach of trust claim was barred by the eleventh amendment because even though the requested remedy was couched in terms of declaratory relief,that remedy sought to correct a past legal wrong and would require the repayment of an accrued monetary liability.id.at.on the other hand,the plaintiffs equal protection claim,alleging that there was a present disparity in the distribution of benefits of the state school lands,was not barred by the eleventh amendment.id.at.the court explained that although the current disparity in benefits might have resulted directly from the state past illegal actions relative to the trust,the essence of the equal protection allegation is the present disparity in the distribution of the benefits of assets and not the past actions of the state.id.at.the plaintiffs sought prospective relief to remedy that disparity,and the court held the equal protection cause of action which sought to achieve that result was permissible under the eleventh amendment even though it might require the expenditure of state funds.id 
turning to the circumstances of the present case,two of our sister circuits have analyzed the question whether the relief sought by tobacco settlement plaintiffs is barred by the eleventh amendment they have come to conflicting conclusions.in harris owens,cir,the tenth circuit stated that a lthough the eleventh amendment bars compensatory relief for past injuries,relief that serves directly to bring about an end to a present violation of federal law is not barred by the eleventh amendment even though accompanied by a substantial ancillary effect on the state treasury.id.at quoting papasan allain,d.the court in harris concluded that the eleventh amendment would bar recovery only of those funds already paid to the state,but that w ith respect to funds that have not been received,the officials have not yet violated federal law the relief sought was therefore prospective in character id.at.the court held that the ex parte young doctrine applied,and the plaintiffs claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were not barred by the eleventh amendment.id.
by contrast,the sixth circuit in barton summers,cir,like the district court in the present case,determined that although the state was to receive its portion of the settlement funds in installments over years,the state had a present financial interest in the money.id.at.because it did,the court held that an injunction or declaratory judgment dictating how that money had to be distributed would
