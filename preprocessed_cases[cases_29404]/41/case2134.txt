background 
mauricio centeno has been deaf since birth and his first and primary language is american sign language asl.asl is a visual,language,and its grammar and syntax differ from the grammar and syntax of english and other spoken languages.see swenson potter,cir,dissenting calloway boro of glassboro dep t of police,d.in many cases,there is no correspondence between signs in asl and words in the english language.see king bd.of educ.of allegany county,e very english word does not have a corresponding sign in asl,and every sign does not have a corresponding english word.centeno reads and writes in english at the fourth or fifth grade level.centeno supervisors were aware that centeno was not able to read written english very well no later than.
from until,centeno worked as a junior clerk in the accounts payable division of the accounting department at a ups facility in gardena,california.the parties do not dispute that centeno was able to complete his job duties without the assistance of an asl interpreter.the dispute centers on whether ups provided centeno with reasonable accommodations for certain benefits and privileges of employment that did not affect his ability to complete his job duties.those benefits include weekly meetings,job training,and understanding the company sexual harassment policy.
from until december,the accounting department,which includes the accounts payable division and the accounts receivable division also,held weekly meetings.beginning in may,the accounts payable division held separate monthly meetings.centeno supervisors expected him to attend the weekly and monthly meetings.
jenny chan was centeno direct supervisor,and gertraud schulz was chan manager and supervisor.schulz usually hosted the weekly departmental meetings,and chan hosted them when schulz was not available.the weekly meetings typically took more than thirty minutes,and some meetings took more than an hour.in advance of the meetings,schulz sent out a written agenda,typically consisting of three,four,five one line descriptions of topics to be covered.topics included changes to employee benefits,quarterly earnings,vacation and holiday scheduling,new human resources rules,safety regulations,a charitable fundraising drive,an employee opinion survey,the company code of business conduct,computer virus scans,referral bonuses,and possible reorganizations and reductions in force.at these meetings,employees had the opportunity to make general announcements.some meetings included group discussions.
chan hosted the monthly meetings of the accounts payable division.chan distributed an agenda at the beginning of each monthly meeting,and she presented information at these meetings.
the primary accommodation that ups provided to centeno at these meetings took the form of notes in the english language.when chan presented at a meeting,she provided centeno with information by email and with typewritten notes that she created after the meeting.she based these notes on her memory of what was said in the meeting and on any handwritten notes she took during the meeting.during her presentations,however,chan wrote down only the main point of what she was saying,and she did not always write down the questions and answers from the meeting.
centeno testified that he felt frustrated with the system of chan emailing him her notes after the meetings.when chan emailed centeno her meeting notes,sometimes centeno went to her and wrote notes telling her that he did not understand what chan had written.centeno also did not like getting the notes after the meeting because he did not get the information at the same time as everyone else in the accounting department.he did not get a chance to ask questions or give his ideas with everyone else.
centeno asked many times to have an asl interpreter to sign for him at meetings.on august,centeno wrote a letter to chan and schulz requesting an asl interpreter for future meetings.he requested asl interpreters for the meetings several more times in,and.
during centeno september performance evaluation,after ups had denied centeno initial requests for an asl interpreter,centeno requested that ups provide him with a contemporaneous record of the meetings.ups implemented this accommodation in october by arranging for an employee to sit next to centeno and write out notes of what was happening during the meeting so that centeno could read them.one employee who was enlisted to take notes in chan place complained to chan that it was so much to write.once this contemporaneous system was in place,chan stopped regularly providing centeno with written meeting summaries after the meetings.according to centeno,this system did not work very well.they could not write out everything.they would write just short little words and keep telling me to wait.i could not really understand what was going on.centeno sometimes fell asleep at monthly meetings when there was no interpreter.a document includes chan notation to remind centeno to stay awake at work.in march,centeno sent an email to an investigator from the eeoc saying,i want interpreter with me for commcaite sic with them for discuss more than writing the note is so slow and waste time for them have wait listen from me.according to chan,ups legal department told ebonye kaufman in human resources that ups did not need to provide an interpreter for regular meetings that were less than two hours long,and kaufman shared this information with chan.according to chan,kaufman directed chan to take notes at meetings and to email those notes to centeno.
in,ups occasionally provided centeno with an asl interpreter for the monthly meetings,and starting in july,ups provided an interpreter for each monthly meeting.kaufman testified that she strongly recommended to schulz that ups provide an asl interpreter for departmental meetings.schulz testified that i t was her decision to approve an interpreter for the monthly meetings but not for the weekly meetings.
an eeoc investigator instructed centeno not to attend meetings where there would be no asl interpreter.on april,centeno emailed chan and schulz to inform them that he would not attend that week meetings because there would be no interpreter.someone from ups human resources department filled out a pittsburgh form to create a formal record of centeno refusal to attend the meetings.in handwriting underneath this typewritten text is the word insubordination.chan,schulz,and centeno initialed the form.the form was included in centeno personnel file,and,according to schulz,it was designed to give him an opportunity to understand that he expected to attend,in this case,a meeting.
because schulz told centeno that he was required to attend the meetings that week,centeno attended them.centeno then reiterated that he was not going to attend any more meetings where there would not be an interpreter,and he stopped attending weekly meetings after april.schulz testified that even though she regarded the meetings as mandatory,she was told that if centeno does come it okay.
in july,centeno complained to chan by email that she had not sent him the meeting summary until after he had left work as a result,centeno had not been aware that two visitors would be coming through the facility the following day,and he had not had an opportunity to clean his work area or dress accordingly.chan testified that she was frustrated by repeatedly getting these kinds of messages from centeno.
in march,centeno had a meeting with human resources to discuss his need for an asl interpreter at the weekly meetings.ups provided an asl interpreter for the human resources meeting.centeno stated that he does not understand some written communications,and he requested that ups provide an interpreter for all team meetings that last more than fifteen minutes.centeno supervisors would regularly tell him to use an dictionary to look up words he did not understand.centeno requested another meeting with chan and human resources where an interpreter would be present.during that meeting,centeno stated that he does not understand or comprehend some written communication.
job training 
in centeno,and performance reviews,centeno supervisors identified a goal of improving centeno skills in using the excel spreadsheet program.schulz testified that supervisors repeatedly recommended that centeno take excel training.in april,chan reminded centeno of this goal.centeno replied that he had tried to use the training program for excel,but could not read it.in a performance review for the period from september,through august,ups included the following notation in centeno development plan excel a course reminder again.ups set december,as the deadline for centeno to complete the excel course.in september,ups for the first time provided an asl interpreter to assist centeno with excel training.
discipline and the policy 
on april,centeno signed ups professional conduct and policy.he testified that he did not understand the policy,but that somebody said look that up in the dictionary,but he did understand the words.he did understand after that.
in late april,centeno had an incident with in the lunchroom.some of his were banging on the table,and centeno told them to stop.he became angry,said an inappropriate word and made an inappropriate gesture,and left.
on may,centeno had a meeting with cheryl nishimura,a supervisor in the human resources department,to discuss the incident.nishimura provided an asl interpreter to be sure that centeno understood nishimura and nishimura understood centeno.centeno apologized and acknowledged that he had used inappropriate language and an obscene gesture.
on may,in a meeting without an asl interpreter,chan and nishimura gave centeno a written warning about his behavior in the lunchroom.nishimura manager said that it was appropriate to type out the explanation and that an interpreter did need to be present for the meeting with chan.the written warning stated that centeno behavior and actions have been interpreted as inappropriate.it stated that i mmediate,marked and sustained improvement of centeno is required.any repetition or continuation of the behavior noted above,or any other serious deficiency in your performance will result in further disciplinary action,which may include termination of your employment.
during the meeting on may,centeno wrote a note indicating that he did not understand the written warning.nishimura and chan instructed centeno to underline the words he did not understand.among the words he underlined were inappropriate,forbidden,conduct,and termination.according to nishimura,t hen we wrote notes and brought a dictionary to explain the meaning of words centeno did not understand.
centeno signed a clean copy of the warning,acknowledg ing receipt of a copy of this written warning,but he testified that he did not understand the warning.he recalled that chan or nishimura told him to use a dictionary to look up the words that he did not understand,but he did understand the words.he did understand after that.on may,centeno indicated that he wanted to meet with human resources about the written warning because he did not understand it.nishimura understood that centeno was trying to tell her that he did understand the written warning.nishimura was surprised because she felt that at the may meeting centeno had understood.
on may,centeno met with nishimura and chan,with an asl interpreter present,to clarify any issues about the to centeno understanding about the discipline.centeno confirmed,through the interpreter,that he understood.
on september,schulz emailed centeno to let him know about a harassment awareness quotient questionnaire and ups professional conduct and policy.schulz instructed centeno to complete the questionnaire,and then to sign off and date the professional conduct and policy.centeno underlined many words in the policy that he could not understand,and he informed chan that he did not understand them.he then gave schulz the policy with the underlined words,and schulz understood that centeno did not understand the underlined words.centeno also circled eleven of the twenty statements on the questionnaire,indicating that he did not understand those prompts and could not determine whether they were true or false.chan directed centeno to use a dictionary to look up the words he did not understand in the policy and on the questionnaire.ups did not provide centeno with an interpreter to translate those documents.
procedural background 
on september,the eeoc filed a complaint alleging that ups engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of disability by failing to reasonably accommodate centeno deafness.on april,ups filed a motion for summary judgment as to all claims.
the district court granted ups motion for summary judgment,concluding that ups undertook the interactive process with centeno,and provided a variety of accommodations that effectively enabled centeno to perform the functions of his job and that gave him access to the privileges and benefits of his employment.the court found that providing,agendas,and summaries in connection with the weekly meetings discharged ups duty under the ada as a matter of law.the court further found that t here is no evidence that centeno missed out on any significant privileges or information due to ups failure to provide him with an asl interpreter for any meetings.with respect to the policy,the court found that t here is no evidence that these materials were training,or that they related to centeno job functions or to the privileges or benefits of his employment.the court found that there was no evidence that centeno tried to use the dictionary but it was ineffective.
the district court issued its final judgment on september,and the eeoc filed a timely notice of appeal on november.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the party and decide whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.fed.trade comm stefanchik,cir citation and footnote omitted.
the ada prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job training and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.the parties agree that centeno is a qualified individual and that the focus of his claim is on the privileges of his employment.
t he ada says that discrimination includes an employer not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified employee,unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.airways,barnett,quoting b a alterations and emphases in original.ups does not argue here,and did not argue before the district court,that centeno proposed accommodations would impose an undue hardship.the court analysis therefore focuses on whether,in regard to the privileges of centeno employment,ups provided reasonable accommodations to centeno known physical limitations.ups argument on appeal is that it reasonably accommodated centeno because its modifications were effective.
eeoc regulations define the term reasonable accommodation to include m odifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities.o iii.an ineffective modification or adjustment will not accommodate a disabled individual limitations.barnett,at.ineffective modifications therefore are not acc
