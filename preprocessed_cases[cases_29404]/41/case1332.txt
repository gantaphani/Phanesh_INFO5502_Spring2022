julie stephens long employment with the teachers retirement system of the state of illinois trs came to an end on february.while trs maintains that it fired her for poor performance,long believes that she was fired in retaliation for taking leave under the family and medical leave act fmla.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of trs,which long now appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
trs administers the pension plan that provides monthly retirement benefits to approximately retired teachers throughout illinois.
jon bauman served as the executive director of trs.he held ultimate responsibility for the organization activities and he possessed final authority for all disciplinary actions including the suspension and termination of employees.human resources director,gina larkin,reported directly to bauman and oversaw all personnel activities at trs.before disciplining an employee,larkin worked in conjunction with the appropriate department manager in order to determine a recommended course of action that she would present to bauman.
at trs,the member services division facilitates all retirement,disability and survivor benefit claims.terry viar,director of member services,reported directly to bauman and oversaw the payment of benefits to trs members.the benefits department,a subsection of member services,processes all retirement benefits.deputy director of the benefits department sally sherman managed the benefits department and reported directly to viar.
to expedite the payment of benefits,trs allows its members to receive their benefits through an electronic fund transfer eft,whereby trs deposits benefit payments directly into a member bank account.within the benefits department,the payroll and insurance department payroll processes direct deposit forms for members opting to receive their payments via eft.payroll insurance manager marshall branham oversaw the daily administration of benefits for trs members,including the timely processing of eft payments.branham reported to sherman.
long began working at trs in september.starting in,long worked in payroll in the position of payroll clerk iv.her primary responsibilities included enrolling members in the eft program,entering eft information into a database,verifying bank routing and account numbers and responding to change of address requests from beneficiaries.branham was long direct supervisor.
when she initially started in payroll,long received favorable performance reviews.over time,though,errors in her work and increasing absences led to lower reviews.in june,she missed of her scheduled working days.in july,her absences rose to of her scheduled days.additionally,although branham asked long in to train employees from other departments on the eft process,she had not done so as of june.on july,branham met with long to inform her that because of her absenteeism,he planned on withdrawing his recommendation that she receive a promotion.long agreed with his assessment regarding her absenteeism.at the meeting,branham also instructed her to train employees within the data services department on the eft process by september.
in september,trs traced several errors within the eft system to long.for example,she improperly recorded a bank account number which resulted in trs sending a member benefit payment to the wrong location.she also improperly documented an address which resulted in a member estranged receiving sensitive financial information about the member.on september,the members called trs to complaint about the difficulty they had receiving their benefit payments.although long had responsibility for responding to member communications regarding eft transactions,she was absent from work that day,so other trs employees fielded the calls.the next day,branham met with long to discuss her eft errors and the impact that her absences had on other trs employees.branham also informed long that she had not processed payroll deduction plan applications in a timely manner which resulted in trs moving responsibility for processing the applications to another department.once again,branham urged long to train other trs employees on the eft process.he summarized the meeting in a memorandum dated september.
in the fall of,larkin held two meetings with branham and sherman to discuss long performance.through the meetings,larkin learned that long entered incorrect addresses in the eft database,entered incorrect routing numbers and did not complete her tasks in a timely manner.she also discovered that in addition to the member complaints that trs received,long fellow employees complained about her performance.branham and sherman informed larkin of their belief that long errors resulted in trs failing to get its checks to its members.
based on long many absences,on september,sherman informed long that she might be eligible for leave under the fmla.long then applied for intermittent fmla leave for medial epicondylitis tennis elbow.trs approved her request for fmla leave in october and instructed long to notify her supervisors when she would be absent because of her medical condition.long informed trs that her absences on september and,were related to the condition.in november,long modified her fmla application to request intermittent leave to treat ovarian cysts.after trs approved the revised application on december,long informed her employer that the following absences related to fmla leave october,and november,and and january.she was also absent from work for nine days in december and five days in january.the record indicates that those absences were not fmla related.
in late december or early january,larkin met with branham and sherman again.at the meeting,branham and sherman informed larkin that long performance had not improved,and as a result,trs failed to get benefits payments to its members.branham also told larkin that he found a large backlog of eft forms that long had not entered into the system on several occasions.branham expressed frustration with long absenteeism and suggested that trs should fire long.
after receiving branham suggestion,larkin reviewed long performance evaluations,the member complaints related to her work and the comments from branham and sherman.larkin then met with bauman twice in january to discuss long performance.at the january,meeting,larkin recommended that bauman terminate long.after reviewing long performance evaluations and discussing member complaints with branham,bauman decided to fire long on february,based upon the member complaints and the misdirected checks.when he made the decision to fire her,bauman did not have any knowledge of long fmla leave.
on august,long filed suit,claiming that trs fired her in retaliation for taking fmla leave.the district court granted summary judgment for trs,finding that long failed to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether trs fired her in retaliation for taking fmla leave.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.see ridings riverside med,cir.summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.to defeat a motion for summary judgment,the nonmoving party must present more than just bare allegations.de la rama.of human,cir.the party must present evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the nonmoving party.id.quoting rozskowiak vill.of arlington heights,cir.
as a preliminary matter,long attempts to question the district court decision to strike portions of her affidavit that contradicted her previous deposition testimony.although she has not formally presented the issue for review,she implicitly questions the ruling at several points in her brief and states in a footnote that the district court erroneously struck portions of long affidavit.long does not develop the argument or cite to specific portions of the record that would illustrate how the district court erred.
to present an argument on appeal,a party must develop its position by providing citation to the relevant portions of the record and supporting authority.see fed.a a.u nsupported and underdeveloped arguments are waived.united states turcotte,cir.a party may waive an argument by disputing a district court ruling in a footnote or a assertion that lacks citation to record evidence.see beamon marshall ilsley trust,cir see also united states white,cir argument raised in passing in a footnote deemed waived.
in claiming that the district court erred in striking portions of long affidavit that conflicted with her deposition testimony,long does not identify the proper standard of review or the legal standard for striking affidavits as inapposite to deposition testimony.her statement contains no citation to the record to show which portions of the affidavit she believes were improperly stricken or why they were improperly stricken.because long has failed to properly present the issue of whether the district court erred in striking portions of her affidavit,she has waived the argument.
the fmla allows eligible employees to take unpaid leave to tend to a serious health condition.see.additionally,the fmla prohibits employers from discriminating against employees who have taken fmla leave.see see also king preferred technical group,cir.an employee may proceed under the direct or indirect methods of proof to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the fmla.see ridings,at.long attempts to proceed under the direct method only.
a plaintiff proceeding under the direct method of proof must produce direct or circumstantial evidence that the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer decision.lewis sch.dist,cir.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the direct method of proof,the plaintiff must present evidence of a statutorily protected activity a materially adverse employment action taken by the employer and a causal connection between the two.caskey,cir.direct evidence typically consists of an admission by the decisionmaker that he acted with retaliatory intent.see id.circumstantial evidence allows the finder of fact to infer that retaliatory animus motivated the decisionmaker to take an adverse employment action against the employee.see id.circumstantial evidence may include suspicious timing,ambiguous oral or written statements,or behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group.see nichols,cir.
the parties do not dispute that long engaged in a protected activity when she took fmla leave or that she suffered an adverse employment action when trs terminated her.to support her contention trs fired her because she took fmla leave,she offers the following pieces of circumstantial evidence branham statements,failure of trs to follow its internal discipline procedures when it fired her and the sudden decline in her performance reviews around the time that she took leave.
long claims that branham recommended to bauman and larkin that trs should fire long because he held animus towards her for taking fmla leave.to support that contention,she points to several of branham statements regarding her absences.for example,long points to a memorandum that branham drafted to memorialize a meeting that he held with long.in the memo,branham noted that he met with long to discuss her absences and the impact that the absences had on payroll overall workload.additionally,in his deposition,branham stated that absenteeism affected long performance from june through january.he attributed some of payroll overall problems to long absences,such as eft backlogs and missed member complaints.he also stated that long absences had a negative impact on the morale of other payroll employees because they had to perform long duties in addition to their own during her absences.
although long claims that branham memo provides evidence of his retaliatory animus towards her fmla leave,branham met with long and drafted the memo before she even applied for fmla leave.branham met with long to discuss her absences and eft errors on september.on september,he drafted his memo to summarize the meeting.sherman did not inform long about her potential eligibility for fmla leave until september,days after branham held the meeting and drafted the memo that discussed long absences.because long had not even applied for fmla leave when branham discussed long absences and drafted the memo to summarize the meeting,those statements that he made in the meeting and the memo can not provide evidence that he held a retaliatory animus towards long use of fmla leave.see durkin city of chicago,cir an employer can not retaliate if there is nothing for it to retaliate against.
long also claims that branham statements during his deposition reveal that he held a retaliatory animus towards her based on her fmla leave.although he attributed long performance problems to her many absences,he stated that her absences from june through january created problems such as eft backlogs and missed member complaints.long string of absenteeism began in june when she missed of her scheduled days,and continued into july when she missed of her scheduled days.on july,branham held a meeting with long to inform her of the toll that her absenteeism was taking on her performance when he told her that he had to withdraw his recommendation that she receive a promotion based solely on her many absences.in september,before she even applied for fmla leave,branham traced many errors within payroll to long and held a meeting with her on september,to discuss her performance issues.even when trs approved her application for fmla leave in october and she indicated that some of her previous absences were related to her medical condition,the earliest date that she indicated was september,after branham had already documented that her absences were negatively affecting her performance.any comment that branham made regarding absences before long even applied for fmla leave could not have been evidence of a retaliatory intent on his part.
even assuming that branham deposition testimony reveals that he held retaliatory animus towards long,to demonstrate a causal connection between a protected activity and an adverse employment action,a plaintiff must provide direct or circumstantial evidence that the decisionmaker has acted for a prohibited reason.a decisionmaker is the person responsible for the contested decision.rogers city of chicago,cir emphasis in original quoting chiaramonte fashion bed group,cir.statements by subordinates normally are not probative of an intent to retaliate by the decisionmaker.willis marion county auditor office,cir.
at trs,only bauman has the authority to make personnel decisions regarding employee discipline,including whether to suspend or terminate an employee.branham only recommended to larkin that trs should fire long he did not make the ultimate decision.bauman made the decision after consulting with larkin,branham and sherman.therefore,even if branham held retaliatory animus towards long,to show a causal connection between her fmla leave and her termination,she must show that bauman acted for a prohibited reason.the record does not contain any evidence that bauman fired long because she took fmla leave in fact,the record shows that he did not even know that long took fmla leave when he fired her.because bauman did not know that long took fmla leave,he could not have possibly terminated her for that reason.
although a plaintiff must generally provide evidence that the decisionmaker acted for a prohibited reason to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,courts have imputed the retaliatory intent of a subordinate to an employer in situations where the subordinate exerts significant influence over the employment decision.see,metzger.state police,cir brewer bd.of trs.of the of,cir rozskowiak,at rogers,at noting potential for employer liability if decisionmaker merely a biased subordinate recommendation.this theory of liability,known as the cat paw doctrine,see willis,at,has received inconsistent treatment in this circuit.some cases hold that a subordinate must have a singular influence over the employment decision,see staub proctor,cir,and others do n
