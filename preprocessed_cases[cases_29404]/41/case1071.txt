leroy mcknight,nicholas klayo,and robert griffin plaintiffs are former employees of general motors corporation gm who accepted the early retirement option provided in gm pension plans.each plaintiff also applied for,and received,social security disability insurance benefits ssdib following retirement.pursuant to provisions of the gm pension plans,plaintiffs retirement benefits were reduced by the amount received from the government in ssdib benefits.the primary issue on appeal presents,in part,a question over which the circuits are split whether disabled former employees have standing under title i of the americans with disabilities act,et.ada,to bring suit against their former employers for discrimination with respect to the payment of fringe benefits.plaintiffs contend that such employees do have standing under the ada,and,moreover,gm pension plans do not provide equal access to disabled and employees.the district court disagreed with plaintiff contentions and granted summary judgment in favor of gm.
for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the plaintiffs do not have standing under title i of the ada to pursue their claims.furthermore,we note that,even if plaintiffs had standing,their claims would fail on the merits.we therefore affirm the district court.
a.the pension plans 
plaintiffs challenge provisions in two pension plans offered by gm the general motors employees pension gm pension plan and the general motors retirement program for salaried employees gm retirement program collectively,the pension plans.the pension plans have similar provisions providing for the payment of basic and supplemental benefits to individuals choosing to retire early after thirty years of service.both pension plans also provide for a reduction in supplemental benefits if a beneficiary becomes eligible for ssdib prior to reaching the age of and one month.
pursuant to article ii,section of the gm pension plan,an employee who retires after thirty years of service will receive a monthly early retirement supplement,in addition to the basic pension payment,until age and one month.section provides 
a an employee who retires under section and who retires within five years of the last day worked for the corporation will receive,in addition to the pension,certain supplements as set forth below 
if the employee retires under section or section of this article ii with or more years of credited service at the date of retirement,such employee shall be entitled to a monthly early retirement supplement until age and one month in an amount which when added to the monthly pension under this plan will equal the amount of total monthly benefit provided in the table set forth below,subject to subsequent provisions of this section table omitted.
the plan further provides for a reduction in supplemental benefits if,prior to the age of and one month,the employee becomes eligible for ssdib 
b the early retirement supplement under provision a of this section for an employee who retires at the employee option shall be calculated assuming that the basic pension commences immediately after retirement,and such early retirement supplement and the interim supplement under provisions of a of this section shall be reduced for any month prior to age and one month,for which the employee becomes or could have become eligible for a federal social security benefit,by an amount equal to the amount of the temporary benefit to which the employee would have been entitled if retired under section b of this article ii.
similarly,the gm retirement program also provides for basic and supplemental benefit payments and contains a nearly identical passage allowing for the reduction of supplemental benefits in light of ssdib eligibility 
b the early retirement supplement under subsection a of this section for an employee who retires voluntarily shall be calculated assuming that the basic benefit commences immediately after retirement,and such early retirement supplement under subsection a of this section shall be reduced for any month prior to age and one month for which the employee becomes or could have become eligible for a federal social security benefit,by an amount equal to the amount of the temporary benefit to which the employee would have been entitled if retired under section of this article 
in both pension plans,the temporary benefit the amount by which the supplemental benefit is apparently about equal to the amount the beneficiary receives from the government in the form of ssdib the district court explained the significance of this plan structure both the pension plan and the retirement program were designed to achieve what is referred to as benefit integration with social security benefits.benefit integration permits a higher level of income to all employees by allowing benefits under such plans to take credit for other income streams that a participant may be entitled to receive.
b.the plaintiffs 
leroy mcknight worked for gm as an hourly employee until january.on february,mcknight retired under the gm pension plan after completing more than thirty years of service.in november,mcknight began receiving ssdib benefits,and,accordingly,gm reduced mcknight supplemental pension payments.gm also claims that,as a result of mcknight ssdib eligibility,it overpaid mcknight.
robert griffin worked for gm as a salaried employee for years and,subsequently,transferred to american axle and manufacturing.after more than thirty total years of service,griffin retired on december,and he now receives a retirement benefit from the gm retirement program for his years of gm credited service.griffin was awarded ssdib effective april,and his retroactive award resulted in an overpayment by gm of in supplemental benefits.
also a former salaried gm employee,nicholas klayo retired on january,under the gm retirement program,after thirty years of credited service.klayo was awarded ssdib effective december,and his retroactive award resulted in an overpayment by gm of in supplemental benefits.
plaintiff carol dudek does not appeal the decision of the district court.
procedural history 
on october,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in federal district court,alleging that gm enforcement of the gm pension plan and the gm retirement program violated the ada,the employee retirement income security act erisa,and michigan persons with disabilities civil rights act.on august,gm filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted gm motion on march.the district court concluded that plaintiffs did not have standing under title i of the ada,and,even if they did have standing,plaintiffs had no viable ada claim,as they had equal access to gm pension plans.the court further found that gm pension plans did not violate erisa.finally,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court decision only with respect to their claim under title i of the ada.

pursuant to title i of the ada,an employer is prohibited from discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability with respect to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.the act defines a qualified individual as someone with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.the plain language of the act thus allows only those who are qualified individuals to bring suit.weyer twentieth century fox film,cir.accordingly,we must first resolve the threshold issue of whether gm employees who have been adjudged disabled by the social security qualified individuals with standing under title i of the ada.
whether disabled former employees are qualified individuals under title i is an issue that has divided the circuits.the second and third circuits take the minority former employees who are totally disabled can be considered qualified individuals with standing to bring suit under title see ford,cir castellano city of new york,cir.the majority former disabled employees can not be considered qualified individuals has been explicitly adopted by the ninth and seventh circuits.see morgan joint admin,cir weyer twentieth century fox film,cir see also smith midland brake,cir seemingly adopting majority position in dicta.this court and others have also addressed the issue,but prior to the issuance of a potentially relevant supreme court decision,robinson shell oil,d.see parker metro.life ins,cir articulating majority position parker i,opinion vacated and decided on other grounds,cir en banc parker ii gonzales garner food,cir same see also beauford father flanagan boys home,cir articulating majority view in rehabilitation act context.
in parker i,this court examined,inter alia,whether an employer long term disability plan,which provided different benefits for mental disabilities and physical disabilities,violated title i of the ada.at.the parker i panel upheld the district court determination that the plaintiff,a disabled former employee,lacked standing under title i of the ada because she was not a qualified individual with a disability under the ada.id.at.the court explained,
under the district court interpretation of the plain meaning of that statute,the plaintiff was at no time a qualified individual with a disability.at the time she could perform the essential functions of her job,she was not disabled for purposes of her long term disability claim,and therefore was not covered by the disabilities act,and at the time her insurance benefits were terminated,she could no longer perform her job.
id.at.agreeing with this reasoning,the court relied in part on beauford father flanagan boys home,a case in which the eighth circuit found that similar language in the rehabilitation act did not apply to disabled employees unable to perform the essential functions of their jobs.id.citing beauford,at.the parker i court further noted that the legislative history of the ada also supported this interpretation of qualified individual the legislative history indicates that the main purpose of title i was to ensure that disabled persons could obtain and keep employment,and therefore,it was not intended to provide relief for the plaintiff.id.
in parker i,the eeoc argued in an amicus brief that the statutory language of b indicates that a former employee who can no longer perform his job is a qualified individual with disabilities.id.section b explains that the term discriminate includes participating in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting a covered entity qualified applicant or employee with a disability to the discrimination prohibited by this subchapter such relationship includes a relationship with an organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the covered entity.b emphasis added.this provision,the eeoc argued,indicates that congress intended the ada to cover discrimination in the provision of fringe benefits accordingly,the fact that a narrow interpretation of qualified individual would bar most employees from challenging discrimination in the provision of disability benefits strongly suggests that this interpretation is incorrect.parker i,at.the parker i court rejected this argument,noting that t he circularity of this reasoning is apparent.id.
additionally,the parker i court rejected the plaintiff contention that she was a qualified individual because she had the employment position of a benefit recipient.id.the court dismissed this argument as mere creative thinking,as benefit recipient does not appear anywhere in the statute itself.id.at.ultimately,the court relied on the plain language of the statute,concluding,we should not try to rewrite the statute in a way that conflicts with what appears to be fairly clear language.id.at.any remedial gap resulting from this plain language,the court explained,is for congress to remedy.id.
the parker i opinion was technically vacated by this court grant of rehearing en banc.the en banc court,however,did not address the title i issue,noting that parker did not seek rehearing on the disposition of her title i claim.parker ii,at.although the en banc decision did not address the title i claim,the decision did fully affirm the district court judgment.id.we also note that other courts have relied on the parker i panel title i discussion even after the opinion was vacated.see fobar city of dearborn heights,see also weyer,at hatch pitney bowes,d,eeoc group health plan,d.
plaintiffs assert that,regardless of its precedential status,the parker i panel discussion of title i should be revisited in light of robinson shell oil,d.in robinson,the supreme court considered whether the plaintiff in a title vii action could sue his former employer for postemployment actions allegedly taken in retaliation for the plaintiff filing of an eeoc claim.id.at.the court held in favor of the plaintiff,concluding that former employees are covered by section a of title vii.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court laid out a roadmap for statutory interpretation.the court began 
our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.
the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.
id.at.internal citations omitted.while at first blush,the term employees in a would seem to refer to those having an existing employment relationship with the employer in question,the court explained that this narrow interpretation of the term can not withstand scrutiny in the context of a.id.at.specifically,the court noted,neither a nor title vii definition of employee contains any temporal qualifier indicating that a only applies to former employees.id.at.furthermore,the court observed,while some provisions of title vii clearly used the term employees to mean current employees,other sections used the word to mean something more inclusive than current employees.id.at.the court concluded,once it is established that the term employees includes former employees in some sections,but not in others,the term standing alone is necessarily ambiguous.id.at.
having found that the term employees as used in a is ambiguous,the court resolved the ambiguity by examining t he broader context provided by other sections of the statute.id.at.in determining that employees includes former employees,the court noted that several other sections of the statute plainly contemplate the use of the remedial mechanisms of title vii by former employees,and,moreover,such broad interpretation of the term comports with the purpose of the antiretaliation provisions of the statute.id.at.a narrow interpretation of the term,the court reasoned,would vitiate much of the protection afforded by a,as it would allow an employer to retaliate with impunity against an entire class of acts under title example,complaints regarding discriminatory termination.id.
plaintiffs urge this court to reconsider parker i conclusion in light of robinson and join the second and third circuits in holding that disabled former employees can bring suit under title i of the ada.we decline to do so.rather,we adopt the majority position and conclude that former disabled employees do not have standing under title i of the ada.
