in this appeal,carolyn kochert challenges the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendants on kochert claims alleging violations of sections and of the sherman antitrust act.mindful of the supreme court admonition that the purpose of federal antitrust law is not to protect businesses from the working of the market it is to protect the public from the failure of the market,see spectrum sports,mcquillan,d,we conclude that kochert does not have antitrust standing,and so we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
carolyn kochert,began practicing anesthesiology in lafayette,indiana in.from to,kochert practiced at both of the hospitals in lafayette,home hospital and elizabeth medical center semc.in,home hospital and defendant anesthesia associates entered into a contract granting anesthesia associates,an anesthesiology practice group,exclusive rights to provide anesthesia services at home hospital.it is undisputed that exclusive services arrangements between anesthesiology practice groups and hospitals are commonplace in this industry and do not inherently raise anticompetitive concerns.after being offered the contract for anesthesia services at home hospital,anesthesia associates offered anesthesiologists with privileges at home hospital subcontracts to provide anesthesia services at home hospital.kochert received a subcontract,which was eventually extended to.although kochert home hospital subcontract was not renewed in,she continued to provide anesthesia services at semc.
in,home hospital and semc merged to form defendant greater lafayette health services glhs,which administered both hospitals.soon thereafter,lafayette anesthesiologists,a practice group of which kochert was a member,obtained an exclusive anesthesiology contract at semc,in which kochert participated.when this contract expired in,glhs did not renew its ties with lafayette anesthesiologists and instead contracted with anesthesia associates to provide exclusive anesthesia services at semc.anesthesia associates contract to provide exclusive anesthesia services at both home hospital and semc has been extended several times and the current extension terminates october.
kochert claims that lafayette anesthesiologists was the only group within an hour of lafayette that could provide a competitive check on anesthesia associates.due to anesthesia associates exclusive contracts,kochert alleges that she has been unable to practice anesthesiology at home hospital since march and at semc since.kochert claims that consumer welfare decreased because of the exclusive contracts with anesthesia associates.for instance,she states that before home hospital awarded the exclusive contract to anesthesia associates in,there were no reported problems with anesthesiologists leaving operating rooms or otherwise failing to monitor patients undergoing surgery,while such problems became commonplace after the grant of the exclusive contract to anesthesia associates in.she also claims that the exclusive contracts increased anesthesia services prices and increased delayed surgeries due to the unavailability of anesthesia associates anesthesiologists.defendants counter that short absences of anesthesiologists during surgical procedures is commonplace,and they cite a report by the american society of anesthesiologists that determined the quality of anesthesia care at home hospital to be good.
allegedly because of the limitations on her anesthesiology practice,kochert began considering a practice in pain management in.she received board certification in pain management in,and later that year opened a pain management practice advanced pain management.by august,kochert was practicing pain management full time.kochert claims that she did not enter that field voluntarily,but rather was forced into pain management practice due to the operation of the exclusive anesthesia associates contracts.she claims that she made written requests to exercise her privileges in anesthesiology at glhs in and.kochert continues to practice pain management at home hospital and semc today.
in september,kochert brought this antitrust suit against glhs,anesthesia associates,and john walling glhs ceo.she alleged that she suffered antitrust injury as a direct consequence of the defendants actions excluding competition from the market and that the defendants exercised monopoly power in the market.to support her claims,kochert attempted to introduce the testimony of several experts,including bruce seaman,an economist.seaman opined that the relevant product market was anesthesia services,and offered three versions of the relevant geographic market the broadest of which included tippecanoe county and seven contiguous counties.
defendants glhs and anesthesia associates filed daubert motions to exclude seaman testimony,arguing that seaman had incorrectly defined the relevant product market,used incorrect methodology in defining the relevant geographic market and unreliable definitions,and failed to do a dynamic analysis.after extensive hearings and oral arguments regarding the daubert issue,the district court admitted seaman expert testimony,noting that the fact that the evidence passed muster under a daubert relevance and reliability analysis did not ensure or decide whether such evidence is ultimately persuasive.the question of the evidence persuasiveness,the district court stated,would be decided either during summary judgment or at trial.
a month later,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all counts and claims.the district court found that kochert had no antitrust standing and had not met her burden of proving an antitrust violation.the court ruled that kochert could not withstand summary judgment on the antitrust violation in part because she could not show that the defendants alleged practices had produced any effects in the relevant geographic market specifically,the district court held that seaman geographic market was too narrow for two reasons the results of his analysis for this area did not yield results sufficient to accept his definition of the market,and seaman analysis ignored commercial realities of the area.
the district court also concluded that kochert failed to demonstrate that the exclusive contract between glhs and anesthesia associates constituted an unlawful tying arrangement the contract between anesthesia associates and glhs did not constitute an illegal group boycott of kochert no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defendants caused actual harm to competition,or that glhs is able to restrain trade due to its market power the defendants lacked the requisite specific intent necessary for a conspiracy to monopolize in violation of the sherman act res judicata barred kochert count v group boycott claim kochert could not succeed on her essential facility claim because alternative facilities are available and kochert indiana state antitrust claims could not survive summary judgment.
kochert now appeals the grant of summary judgment.

article iii standing 
the defendants argue,for the first time on appeal,that kochert lacks standing under article iii of the united states constitution.of course,defendants are not precluded from raising this claim because such a challenge to the court jurisdiction may not be waived.see,city of dallas,d.indeed,we are under an independent obligation to examine our own jurisdiction,and standing is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional doctrines.id.quoting allen wright,d,brackets omitted.generally,all that is required to demonstrate article iii standing is injury in fact plus redressability.see gypsum indiana gas,cir sanner bd.of trade of city of chicago,cir stating with more specificity that the party must personally have suffered an actual or threatened injury caused by the defendant allegedly illegal conduct,the injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant challenged conduct,and the injury must be one that is likely to be redressed through a favorable decision quoting valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church and state,d.
the defendants argue that kochert can not demonstrate that her injury is fairly traceable to their challenged conduct,and cite our sanner decision,where we concluded that soybean farmers who refrained from selling soybeans due to the depressed price of the cash market lack ed standing under article iii to pursue their antitrust claims.see sanner,at.we reasoned in sanner that these farmers could not establish the traceability prong of the article iii standing inquiry because the decision not to sell could have been motivated by many factors and it would be impossible to weigh the impact of the alleged violation on this omission.see id.at.defendants analogize this to kochert situation by arguing that she is incapable of demonstrating that her decision to exit the anesthesia services market was the exclusive product of their anticompetitive actions.they point to the timing of her exit from the anesthesia services market and portions of her deposition testimony suggesting that other considerations may have played a role.
we do not agree that kochert lacks article iii standing.as discussed infra,the defendants have raised a significant challenge to kochert antitrust standing.but the article iii standing inquiry does not require kochert to prove as much.see,florida seed,monsanto,cir antitrust standing requires more than the injury in fact and the case or controversy required by article iii of the constitution.a question of material fact remains as to whether kochert suffered an injury as a result of defendants actions since kochert can construct a reasonable causality chain linking her injury to defendants actions.what remains in question is whether any of defendants actions were anticompetitive and,if so,whether the anticompetitive actions led to kochert injury.we think it more appropriate to assess these questions in the context of antitrust standing and antitrust injury.
antitrust standing and injury 
the supreme court has observed that a ntitrust laws in general,and the sherman act in particular,are the magna carta of free enterprise as important to the preservation of economic freedom and our system as the bill of rights is to the protection of our fundamental personal freedoms.united states topco associates,d.section of the sherman act provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.the purpose of the act is to assure customers the benefits of price competition.see associated contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters,et,d discussing the legislative history.the supreme court has stated that the central interest of the act is protecting the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market.id.we have similarly observed that t he principal purpose of the antitrust laws is to prevent overcharges to consumers.premier constr.contractors ass n,cir.
given the intent of our antitrust laws,courts have developed the doctrine of antitrust standing and the subsidiary doctrine of antitrust injury in order to assure efficient use of the resources of the courts towards achieving these goals.see generally william page,the scope of liability for antitrust violations,stan,see also gypsum indiana gas,cir questioning the wisdom of the antitrust standing nomenclature in light of the potential for confusion with article iii standing.under section of the clayton act,any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the united states in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent.a.the supreme court has cautioned that this seemingly broad language must be interpreted more narrowly in light of congressional intent as revealed by the legislative history.see associated contractors,at.thus,not all persons who have suffered an injury flowing from an antitrust violation have standing to sue under.in re industrial gas antitrust litigation,cir.under our precedent,only those parties who can most efficiently vindicate the purposes of the antitrust laws have antitrust standing to maintain a private action under.serfecz jewel food stores,cir quoting in re industrial gas,at.kochert must demonstrate that she meets the requirements of both antitrust injury and antitrust standing to succeed on the merits of her tying,boycott,and conspiracy claims under the sherman act.see greater rockford energy and technology shell oil,cir a showing of both antitrust injury and antitrust standing are necessary to proceed under.
antitrust injury 
the threshold question for our inquiry is whether kochert has suffered an antitrust injury.kochert must demonstrate that her claimed injuries are of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and reflect the anticompetitive effect of either the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.int l union of operating eng rs,local,cir quoting brunswick pueblo,d.kochert cognizable injuries are variations on the theme of lost income in her anesthesia practice.we must determine whether these alleged injuries are the result of defendants allegedly anticompetitive acts.
but first,we must assess what anticompetitive behavior is at stake here.the parties dispute the starting point of defendants anticompetitive acts.the most obvious point in time is,when glhs formulated its exclusive contract with anesthesia associates.before this point,lafayette anesthesiologists had an exclusive contract with semc while anesthesia associates had an exclusive contract at home hospital,and,therefore,the lafayette market was serviced by two competing anesthesia services groups.only after glhs contracted exclusively with anesthesia associates in were the doctors of lafayette anesthesiologists and hence kochert completely foreclosed from practicing anesthesia services at either of the two lafayette hospitals.this time line creates an obvious problem for kochert because the record makes clear that she was no longer a practicing anesthesiologist at this point 
recognizing this problem,kochert argues that the real starting point of defendants anticompetitive acts is,when anesthesia associates declined to renew its subcontract with her.kochert theory is that this event set off an anticompetitive chain reaction which culminated in her complete exclusion from the lafayette anesthesia services market in.kochert does not contend that the activity,viewed independently,constituted anticompetitive activity under the sherman act.indeed,her expert,seaman,testified at his deposition that the events in kochert chain prior to did not independently raise any major anticompetitive concern.the only independent event seaman identified as having anticompetitive effects was glhs discontinuation of the exclusive contract between semc and lafayette anesthesiologists.seaman,however,also advanced kochert chain reaction theory of anticompetitive effects.
we agree with the district court that kochert chain reaction theory must be rejected.kochert has offered no precedential support for the proposition that a court should look backward from the point of the actual anticompetitive activity in search of the genesis of the acts that eventually allowed the anticompetitive behavior to occur.such an examination would have no logical starting point in this case.kochert argues for,which coincides with the point at which her injuries accrued,but one could just as easily argue that the starting point of the chain reaction was,when home hospital first awarded an exclusive contract to anesthesia associates.but the contracting is not logically the first domino because it clearly was not part of an anticompetitive scheme.the same logic applies to the denial of renewal of ko
