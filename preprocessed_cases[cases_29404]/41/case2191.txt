in this appeal,qui tam relators michael meyer and patricia szerlip contend that the district court erred by granting a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction brought by horizon health corporation,summit medical center,and sukhdeep grewal collectively appellees.the principal issues on appeal relate to whether relators fraud allegations are based on a public disclosure,and,if so,whether the relators were the original source of those allegations.having jurisdiction under,we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
in,relators meyer,szerlip,and vicki weatherford sued appellees,asserting claims under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act,the act.meyer and szerlip were psychiatric nurses employed by summit weatherford was employed by horizon as the senior bridges program director.the senior bridges program was a geropsychiatric unit managed by horizon at a facility owned by summit.
the gravamen of relators allegations assert that appellees fraudulently billed medicare for patient services.specifically,relators contend that appellees admitted patients to the senior bridges program despite knowing that those patients,who suffered from dementia,could not benefit from the program.appellees received a considerably larger daily medicare reimbursement for a patient in the senior bridges program than for a patient in the regular unit.
after a long delay in its decision,the government in may declined to intervene.relators then filed their first amended complaint fac against appellees in september.appellees moved to dismiss the fac,asserting that relators failed to allege the fraud with particularity.the district court granted the motion to dismiss,but permitted relators to file a second amended complaint sac,which they filed in may.appellees moved to dismiss the sac under.b and b.in september,the district court granted appellees motion,dismissed the complaint,and granted relators leave to file a third amended complaint tac.after relators filed the tac,appellees moved to dismiss the tac under.b and b,which the district court denied.
in march,relator weatherford withdrew from the suit.in august,appellees moved to dismiss the tac under.b,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the allegations of the remaining relators,meyer and szerlip,had been publicly disclosed by weatherford suit and they were not original sources of the allegations.the district court granted the motion,dismissed the tac,and this appeal follows.
discussion 
i.the district court did not err by granting appellees motion to dismiss.
relators contend first that the district court improperly granted appellees b motion to dismiss the tac.specifically,relators challenge the district court determinations that the tac was based on prior public disclosure and that the relators did not qualify as original sources of the allegations.we review a district court conclusion that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction de novo and the findings of fact relevant to that determination for clear error.see ambulance,california,cir.
the act prohibits false or fraudulent claims for payment to the united states,a,and authorizes civil actions to remedy such fraud to be brought by the attorney general,a,or by private individuals in the government name,b.but the act provides that 
n o court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
the bar in e a sets up a inquiry.first,we must determine whether there has been a prior public disclosure of the allegations or transactions underlying the qui tam suit.ambulance,at.if and only if there has been such a public disclosure,we next must inquire whether the relator is an original source within the meaning of e b.id.relators,as the qui tam plaintiffs,bear the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.united states alcan eng g,cir.we now turn to this analysis.
public disclosure 
relators filed this suit in april after very similar allegations were publicly disclosed in a suit that weatherford filed in state court in october.accordingly,the district court dismissed relators suit,holding that the weatherford suit was a public disclosure and that relators qui tam allegations plainly share a substantial identity with the allegations disclosed through the weatherford complaint filed in state court in.whether a particular disclosure triggers the jurisdictional bar of e a is a mixed question of law and fact,which we review de novo.ambulance,at.
the question potentially implicates two distinct but related determinations.first,we must decide whether the public disclosure originated in one of the sources enumerated in the statute.id.when a public disclosure originates in one of these sources,we must then determine whether the content of the disclosure consisted of the allegations or transactions giving rise to the relator claim,as opposed to mere information.id.quoting hagood sonoma county water agency,cir.for a qui tam suit to be based upon a prior public disclosure,e a,the publicly disclosed facts need not be identical with,but only substantially similar to,the relator allegations.see united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft,cir see also united states ex rel.biddle bd.of trustees of leland stanford,cir a claim is based upon public disclosure when the claim repeats allegations that have already been disclosed to the public.
here,relators concede that weatherford filed her suit nearly six months before they filed this suit the weatherford suit contains similar fraud allegations and a lawsuit can publicly disclose allegations or transactions under the act.relators argue only that they made the first public disclosure when they presented evidence to the government through their counsel to medicare fraud investigator steven lack,on july,fully three months before the weatherford lawsuit.in other words,their suit is not subject to the act bar because they were the first to disclose the medicare fraud.we reject this contention.
even accepting relators assertion that they disclosed the allegations of medicare fraud to the government before weatherford filed her suit,we reject relators argument because it fails the first prong of the test described in ambulance serv 
public disclosure may occur in only three categories of fora in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation or in the news media.e a ambulance,at.relators apparent argument is that they made the first public disclosure by informing the government of the allegations during a meeting with investigator lack.but relators offer no argument and cite no authority in support of their contention that such a private disclosure to a government employee is a public disclosure,as the act defines the term.
in any event,relators argument,which asks us to read into the act a fourth forum for a public disclosure,is foreclosed by caselaw.for example,this court has held that information that was disclosed in private is not a public disclosure under the act united states ex rel.schumer hughes aircraft,cir quoting united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante prudential ins,cir,vacated on other grounds by,d see also united states ex rel.devlin california,cir holding that,although a newspaper article was a public disclosure,a relator private disclosure to a reporter in advance of publication was not a public disclosure.this rule applies even when the private disclosure is made to a government employee.see hughes aircraft,at.moreover,a public disclosure is restricted to information that is actually made public as opposed to material that is only theoretically available upon the public request.id.at quoting united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.thus,even when the government has the information,it is not publicly disclosed under the act until it is actually disclosed to the public.see id.
accordingly,even if relators disclosed the alleged medicare fraud to investigator lack before weatherford filed her suit,such a disclosure would not be a public disclosure within the meaning of the act.and because it would not qualify as a public disclosure,relators argument that they first publicly disclosed the allegations must be rejected.
original source 
because the weatherford suit publicly disclosed the allegations in relators suit,we must next consider whether relators are original sources under the act.see e a,b ambulance,at.an original source is an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.e b see also rockwell int l united states,d.this court has held that to be an original source,a relator must satisfy an additional requirement under e a that is not in the statute in haec verba,namely that he had a hand in the public disclosure of the allegations that are a part of his suit.united states ex rel.zaretsky johnson controls,cir alteration in original quoting wang fmc,cir.thus,the requirements for the exception are as follows 
to qualify as an original source,a relator must show that he or she has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based,voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing his or her qui tam action,and had a hand in the public disclosure of allegations that are a part of the suit.
united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.relators contend that the district court erred by concluding that they were not original sources under the act.we disagree.
initially,we note a potentially fatal defect with relators argument.the pages of relators opening brief do not easily reveal why the district court allegedly erred in concluding that relators were not original sources.as discussed above,relators argue that there was no prior public disclosure of the allegations and assert that the conversations with investigator lack were a public disclosure.but in the course of making that short argument they also baldly conclude that they meet the ninth circuit test for original sources.an appellant brief must contain appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.fed.a emphasis added.this court deems issues unsupported by argument to be abandoned.see self directed placement control data,cir.the exegesis in relators reply brief is marginally clearer,but the reply brief is ordinarily not the place for such an analysis in the first instance on appeal.see alcan eng g,at holding that such arguments are waived.
in any event,we conclude that the district court did not err by determining that relators were not original sources.to establish the proposition that they were original sources,relators must show that they possessed direct and independent knowledge of the information on which their allegations are based.see e b rockwell.at.to show direct knowledge,the relator must show that he had firsthand knowledge of the alleged fraud,and that he obtained this knowledge through his own labor unmediated by anything else.alcan eng g,at internal quotation marks omitted.a relator has independent knowledge when he knows about the allegations before that information is publicly disclosed.id.harshman knowledge was independent because it preceded the public disclosure in the earlier complaint.
here,the tac alleges fraud solely regarding the treatment and billing for the patient referred to as patient thus,relators must have direct and independent knowledge of the treatment and billing of patient a.the district court found that relators had no such direct and independent knowledge.we conclude that the record supports the district court.
the tac contains no allegation that relators had direct and independent knowledge of appellees alleged attempt to defraud the government with respect to patient see rockwell.at stating that courts examine the allegations in the amended complaint to determine whether a relator qualifies as an original source under the act.similarly,relators declarations filed in opposition to appellees motion to dismiss contain no assertion that relators had direct and independent knowledge of appellees allegedly fraudulent billing for patient a services the tac and declarations reveal,at most,that szerlip knew about alleged fraud,not that she had direct and independent knowledge of the alleged fraud.this is an important distinction.the district court did not clearly err by determining that relators lacked the requisite direct and independent knowledge of the alleged fraud to qualify as original sources.
we note additionally that relators have not established another prerequisite to be an original source that they had a hand in the public disclosure of allegations that are a part of the suit.wang,at see also johnson controls,at stating that relators must play a role in the public disclosure at issue.the district court determined that relators did not have a hand in the weatherford suit,which publicly disclosed the allegations,because they were not parties to the weatherford suit.but we need not determine whether a relator must actually be a party to a prior lawsuit that publicly discloses the allegations to have a hand in the public disclosure.it is sufficient to say that neither the tac nor relators declarations filed in opposition to appellees motion to dismiss the tac include any assertion that relators had a hand in the weatherford suit public disclosure of the allegations.
the district court did not err by determining from the record before it that relators neither had direct and independent knowledge of the alleged fraudulent practices surrounding patient a nor had a hand in the public disclosure of those allegations.
ii.relators have withdrawn their challenge to the sac.
relators contend in their opening brief that the district court erred by concluding that the sac failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of.b and dismissing the sac on that basis.appellees argue that relators can not challenge the district court dismissal of the sac because relators filed the tac,which supersedes and waives any error involving the sac.in their reply brief,relators concede the issue,acknowledging that by filing the tac,they can not challenge the district court dismissal of their sac.because relators have expressly withdrawn this issue,we do not consider it.
iii.appellees motion to strike.
appellees move to strike pages five through of relators reply brief,which contain new legal argument and record citations and,strike relators supplemental excerpts of record because the documents contained therein are not part of the district court record.
as noted throughout this opinion,we have not relied on the arguments that relators first raised in their reply brief.appellees also assert that we should not consider the supplemental declarations filed with the ex parte application for leave to file additional evidence.the district court denied relators application to file these supplemental declarations,noting that they were untimely filed as a result of relators deliberate choice not to respond fully to the motion to dismiss and would amount to an inequitable surreply.relators have proffered no argument regarding why the district court abused its discretion by refusing to accept these untimely materials.but because our holding does not rely on either the arguments that relators first raised in their reply brief or the supplemental declarations,we deny appellees motion to strike as moot.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court dismissal of the tac with prejudice.we also deny appellees motion to strike certain matters sought to be presented by relators.each party shall pay its own costs on this appeal.
i agree with the majority that the weatherford suit cons
