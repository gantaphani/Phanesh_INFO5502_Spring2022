since,battle has been a package division manager for ups in little rock,arkansas.he supervises approximately employees at ups centers to ensure that they meet monthly performance goals.battle main source of information is a daily operations report detailing the performance statistics for each center.division managers are required to focus on the worst performers and determine why goals are not met,why problems occurred,and how best to correct them.the division manager then reports proposed solutions,as well as other statistics,to the district manager.
in february,dwayne meeks became battle district manager.from the outset,battle claims that meeks required him to research and memorize extensive,unpredictable,and useless information from the daily operations report.if he did not answer the questions meeks asked,meeks berated him in front of other employees.after meeks arrival,battle became increasingly frustrated and depressed,eventually suffering a nervous breakdown in may.on may,he requested fmla leave for stress,which ups immediately granted.
shortly before his fmla leave expired,battle wrote a letter on july,informing meeks it was increasingly difficult for him to understand,concentrate on,and perform many tasks that meeks required just before his fmla leave.to facilitate his return to work,battle requested an agenda before each meeting with meeks,and demanded to be returned to his job as it existed before meeks arrived.in the alternative,battle requested an extended leave of absence.meeks immediately forwarded this letter to ups human resources manager,daniel minesinger.
on august,battle met with meeks and minesinger.battle presented his july letter,now signed by his primary physician indicating agreement with battle stated limitations and accommodation requests.battle also presented a release from a different physician that did not indicate any limitations or necessary accommodations.after discussing battle restrictions and the apparent contradiction between the physicians,minesinger told battle that he could either return to work immediately without accommodation,or have his primary physician complete an ada accommodation form for ups.battle responded he could do his job with the accommodations described in the july letter,and agreed to ask his primary physician to complete an ada accommodation form.minesinger relayed battle request for accommodation to ups regional office.
on august,the regional occupational health manager sent battle an acknowledgment of his request for workplace accommodation and enclosed an ada accommodation form to complete and return.the health manager informed battle that ups could not assess his request until it received the completed medical form.rather than complete the form,on august,battle submitted a report from his treating physician,gale.according to it,battle was substantially impaired in his abilities to think,concentrate,and function at work.the report stated that battle would be able to return to employment with appropriate psychiatric treatment,medication,and reasonable workplace accommodations.
after ups again notified battle that it could not process his request until he submitted an ada accommodation form to the regional office,on august,battle returned the form along with a second medical report from gale.the form stated that battle was not able to perform all physical and mental functions of his position,but specified that he needed accommodation only as to unassigned tasks and lack of consistent defined agendas.gale specified that battle could perform all essential job functions for his position as defined and provided by ups.
on september,battle met with paul kula,ups workplace planning manager,to discuss in detail specific accommodations.battle told kula that he could perform all essential functions of his position without accommodation.when kula asked why he needed accommodation,battle responded that he could not memorize all the information required by meeks,and that he needed an agenda before each meeting with meeks to be adequately prepared.battle defined these tasks as marginal.he also said he needed advance notice before meeks asked about anything not related to the normal flow of business.while kula assured battle he was not rejecting the request for accommodation,he told battle he needed more information about the proposed agenda and a better definition of outside the normal flow of business.in response,battle asked for a job description to better define his requested accommodation.kula told battle he could not provide this information,but battle agreed to give the issue more thought and get back to ups with his requests.
after the meeting,gale wrote ups on september.he again stated that battle was fully capable of performing all essential functions of his position.kula answered this letter on october by telling battle that,while gale latest report was encouraging,the medical information did not clearly state that battle could adequately perform his job functions without accommodation.kula again requested more information from battle about his request for an agenda in order to determine whether this could be a reasonable accommodation.
on october,battle sent ups a new report from gale indicating that battle ability to think,concentrate,and memorize was not substantially limited to such a degree that would prevent his return to work in a normal workplace environment.ups acknowledged receipt of gale new report,stating that it believed battle no longer needed accommodation.ups confirmed that battle job functions would not change upon his return to work,and suggested that battle contact ups for a date.battle returned to work at ups on october,where he continues to work successfully as a division manager under meeks supervision.
shortly before his return to work,battle sued ups for disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ada,fmla,adea,and acra.the ada and acra claims were tried to a jury.at the close of battle evidence,ups sought judgment as a matter of law,arguing that battle evidence was insufficient to prove that he was disabled,that ups failed to engage in a interactive process to accommodate his disability,and that his requested accommodation was reasonable.ups also argued that battle claim for punitive damages under the ada was unsupported by the evidence.the district court granted ups motion,but allowed the case to proceed on the issue of ups liability under the ada and acra.the jury determined that ups had not engaged in intentional disability discrimination,but that it had failed to reasonably accommodate battle disability.after the verdict,ups renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,reiterating the same arguments raised during trial.the district court denied ups motion.both parties appeal.
