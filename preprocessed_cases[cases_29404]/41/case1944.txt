debra shaw brought the present employee retirement income security act of erisa action against her employer seeking to recover benefits she alleged were due her under a health benefit plan.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of shaw,and we affirm.
background 
debra shaw is iowa last known polio victim.shaw contracted the infectious disease at nineteen months of age in june of,which inhibited the normal growth of the muscles in her left leg.at a young age,shaw left calf muscle was so severely deformed and undersized that it was unable to support any weight,causing her to resort to the assistance of a full leg brace in order to walk.throughout the course of her life,shaw has undergone various medical procedures in an attempt to alleviate her condition,each with only limited success.although she is presently able to walk unaided,shaw balance and gait are still hampered,as her left leg is slightly shorter than her right.shaw suffers from persistent physical pain in her knee,ankle,and lower back,due to the inability of her left calf to support significant weight.shaw deformity also serves as a constant visual reminder of her affliction,resulting in considerable emotional distress.
sometime in september of,shaw was seen in consultation by marie montag regarding the possibility of reconstructive plastic surgery on her left calf.montag determined that a viable treatment option existed,known as tissue expander reconstruction surgery,which would add weight and definition to shaw calf and thereby reduce her physical pain.excited by the prospect of living a normal and healthy life,shaw began the process of obtaining the preauthorization for the surgery from her employer,the mcfarland clinic,mcfarland.
mcfarland is one of the largest clinics in iowa,offering a wide array of healthcare services to residents of over thirty communities located in central iowa.to provide its employees with healthcare coverage,mcfarland sponsors the mcfarland clinic,health benefit plan the plan,a health benefit plan covering any expenses incurred by both an employee and his or her dependents for medically necessary services.before an employee undergoes any hospitalization or medical procedure,however,he or she first must obtain preauthorization from mcfarland according to the terms of the plan,p reauthorization allows mcfarland to evaluate the medical appropriateness of services and provides the employee with assurance that the hospitalization or procedure is medically necessary and will be covered.at.
on september,montag,on shaw behalf,wrote to mcfarland requesting preauthorization for tissue expander reconstruction surgery.on december,mcfarland denied shaw request on the basis that the requested procedure was cosmetic surgery,and therefore was not covered by the plan.over the next several months,shaw and several other physicians wrote to mcfarland,urging it to reconsider the denial of preauthorization.by letter dated january,montag stated 
i do concede that placement of calf implants would indeed improve shaw cosmetic appearance but this increased weight and volume of the affected leg would also improve her balance and thereby cause an improvement in her gait overall.shaw has had problems with pain in the left ankle and knee as well.these are quite probably due to abnormal stresses on these areas due to her asymmetric balance and these symptoms also could be helped by placement of prosthetic implants.
on january,two of mcfarland own physicians,diane cardwell,and terry mcgeeney,opined that the reconstructive surgery should be covered under the plan,insofar as it provided coverage for cosmetic implant s secondary to a medical condition,id.at,such as breast implants following a mastectomy.on january,and again on april,shaw made impassioned pleas for preauthorization.each of these requests fell on deaf ears.on may,mcfarland finally denied shaw request for preauthorization,forcing shaw to pay for the reconstructive surgery out of her own pocket.
on may,shaw commenced the instant action under a b of erisa,a b,alleging that mcfarland denial of preauthorization was an abuse of discretion insofar as tissue expander reconstruction surgery was covered under the terms of the plan.in the alternative,shaw complaint alleged that mcfarland denial of preauthorization was a breach of its fiduciary duty owed to her as an individual beneficiary of the plan.on for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of shaw.see shaw mcfarland clinic,d.the district court found that mcfarland abused its discretion as plan administrator in denying shaw request for preauthorization,awarding her plus interest accrued since may.the district court later awarded shaw attorney fees and costs pursuant to g.
on appeal,mcfarland argues that the district court erred in awarding shaw any relief,including attorney fees and costs,insofar as her action is barred by the statute of limitations 
ii.analysis 
the parties do not dispute that shaw cause of action for abuse of discretion accrued on may,the date on which mcfarland finally denied her request for preauthorization.see union pac.beckham,cir t he general rule in an erisa action is that a cause of action accrues after a claim for benefits has been made and has been formally denied.instead,the parties dispute on appeal focuses on whether shaw commenced her action in a timely manner.since erisa does not contain its own statute of limitations governing actions to recover benefits,we must look to iowa law and borrow the most analogous statute of limitations.see johnson state mut.life assurance of,cir.because it arises out of an agreement entered into with mcfarland,shaw action is most analogous to a cause of action for breach of contract.see adamson armco,cir at least in this circuit,it is settled that a claim for erisa benefits is characterized as a contract action for statute of limitations purposes.
the present difficulty arises from the fact that iowa law provides two separate statutes of limitation applicable to a contract action,one general and the other specific.as a general matter,a claim brought under erisa relating to a contract of insurance is governed by a statute of limitations.see iowa code see also hamm allied mut.ins,iowa.if,however,the contract arises out of an employment relationship and an employee seeks to recover wages from her employer,it is subject to a statute of limitations.see iowa code.
in determining which of these two periods of limitation to apply,we may inquire as to how iowa law would characterize shaw action.see johnson,at united auto.workers hoosier cardinal,d noting that there is no reason to reject the characterization that state law would impose unless it is unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with national labor policy.according to mcfarland,shaw action is one that iowa law would treat as an action for wages under the iowa wage payment collection act iwpca,iowa code et,and is therefore subject to a statute of limitations under iowa code.because shaw filed suit on may,three years after her cause of action accrued,mcfarland asserts that it is.
since its enactment,iowa courts have repeatedly stated that the purpose of the iwpca is to facilitate the public policy of allowing employees to collect wages owed to them by their employers.hornby state,iowa.toward this end,and taking into consideration the highly evolving nature of employee compensation,the iwpca sets forth an expansive definition of wages,encompassing much more than the paycheck.the iwpca provides in relevant part 
wages means compensation owed by an employer for 
any payments to the employee or to a fund for the benefit of the employee,including but not limited to payments for medical,health,hospital,welfare,pension,or,which are due an employee under an agreement with the employer or under a policy of the employer.the assets of an employee in a fund for the benefit of the employee,whether such assets were originally paid into the fund by an employer or employee,are not wages.
expenses incurred and recoverable under a health benefit plan.
iowa code c and d.if the benefits shaw presently seeks to recover may be said to fit comfortably within one of these two statutory definitions of wages,mcfarland would be correct to assert that shaw action is.we believe,however,that neither definition is applicable under the facts presented on appeal 
section c,by its plain language,is inapplicable to shaw action.the benefits that she seeks to recover do not constitute payments to the employee,because even assuming that mcfarland had granted preauthorization,any payment for shaw medical expenses would have been made directly to her healthcare provider in addition,the benefits do not constitute payments to a fund for the benefit of the employee.we submit that this reference was meant to encompass only those funds in which the employee could be said to have an interest separate and distinct from other employees,a fund for retirement,pension,or.see,phipps iasd health servs,iowa holding that an employee individual share in the revenue of a company,due under a policy of the employer,constituted wages within the meaning of c.in this case,there is no evidence that mcfarland maintained individual healthcare funds for each of its employees that could be drawn upon by that employee.finally,c does not apply because d sets forth a definition of wages specifically addressing the type of benefit mcfarland claims to be at issue compensation due under the terms of a health benefit plan.see united states,d noting that it is a basic principle of statutory construction that a specific statute controls over a general provision,particularly when the two are interrelated and closely positioned.
mcfarland also claims that shaw action is one for wages,as that term is defined in d.this presents a closer question.although d defines wages as e xpenses incurred and recoverable under a health benefit plan,this definition is similarly inapplicable to the present case.like the district court,we believe the iwpca only treats as wages those e xpenses by the employee which are authorized by the employer and incurred by the employee.iowa code emphasis added.thus,for a medical expense to constitute wages within the meaning of d,it must be one that the employee has been authorized by her employer to incur.see shaw,d at thus,expenses under a health benefit plan are not wages unless they are both incurred and recoverable,authorized and incurred.this is not true here,as mcfarland explicitly refused to grant preauthorization for shaw surgery 
in short,because shaw claim against mcfarland does not fit within either of the aforementioned definitions of wages,she has no cause of action under the iwpca.this being the case,its statute of limitations is inapplicable to limit her erisa cause of action.instead,shaw action against mcfarland most closely resembles an insured party claim against his insurer for denial of coverage and breach of contract,and is governed by a statute of limitations.this result is consistent with the general principle of iowa law that when a court has to choose between competing statutes of limitation,any doubt as to which to apply will generally be resolved in favor of the application of the statute containing the longest limitation.halverson lincoln commodities,iowa internal citation and quotation omitted.
finally,we note that mcfarland has not appealed the district court award of damages to shaw nor its finding that mcfarland abused its discretion by denying preauthorization.see supra.thus,these issues are not presented for our review.our holding that shaw action is not disposes of mcfarland claim that shaw was not entitled to costs and attorney fees,as mcfarland argument to the contrary was premised upon its view that shaw action was untimely.furthermore,our affirmance of the district court on shaw abuse of discretion theory makes it unnecessary for us to reach the issue of her recovery on an alternative theory of breach of fiduciary duty.nevertheless,to the extent the district court award of damages may have alternatively been premised on its determination that mcfarland acted in bad faith and breached a fiduciary duty owed to shaw,we part company with the district court.needless to say,the supreme court has made clear that an individual generally may not recover monetary damages based upon a plan administrator breach of fiduciary duty,see.mut.life ins.russell,d t he entire text of persuades us that congress did not intend that section to authorize any relief except for the plan itself,especially when another enforcement provision of erisa provides an adequate remedy.see varity howe,d.
iii.conclusion 
based on the foregoing,we hold that an employee action alleging the improper denial of preauthorization for health benefits by her employer is most analogous under iowa law to an action for breach of a written contract.because shaw instituted the present action against mcfarland well within the applicable statute of limitations,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
because the majority opinion misreads iowa law and fails to follow circuit precedent,i respectfully dissent.
first,shaw complaint clearly alleges jurisdiction under e,and states shaw is bringing this cause of action pursuant to a b.in the district court and on appeal,shaw argues her employer,acting as plan administrator,abused its discretion under the erisa plan,and breached its fiduciary duty with respect to erisa.shaw clearly has not alleged or argued an ordinary breach of contract action.
second,the majority contends shaw action resembles an insured claim against her insurer for denial of coverage and breach of contract.shaw obviously did not bring a claim as an insured against an insurer,and,as explained above,did not sue for an ordinary breach of contract.shaw filed an erisa lawsuit as an employee covered by an employer erisa plan,arguing abuse of discretion and breach of fiduciary duty.the resemblance falls short.
i will discuss first the statute of limitations for shaw abuse of discretion claim,and then address the statute of limitations for shaw breach of fiduciary duty claim.
statute of of discretion 
shaw first argues her employer,acting in its capacity as plan administrator,abused its discretion in denying her health benefits under the employer erisa plan.erisa does not have an express statute of limitations for a cause of action based on abuse of discretion by the plan administrator.as the majority recognizes,we must look to,and borrow from,the most analogous iowa statute of limitations.see johnson state mutual life assurance of,cir.the majority concludes shaw action is most analogous to a general cause of action for breach of contract,rather than the specific iowa wage payment collection act iwpca.however,the iwpca expressly applies to the employee and employer relationship,including payments for health benefits due an employee,and expenses incurred and recoverable under a health benefit plan.iowa code c d.the iwpca seems obviously the most analogous statute of limitations,more analogous than a general statute of limitations for breach of contract actions.
iowa code section defines wages as a ny payments to the employee or to a fund for the benefit of the employee,including payments for medical,health,hospital,which are due an employee under an agreement with the employer or under a policy of the employer,iowa code c,and e xpenses incurred and recoverable under a health benefit plan,id.d.the unmistakable language of these sections establishes the iwpca covers shaw claim.
the majority attempts to distinguish section d by stating the iwpca only treats as wages those expenses of the employee that are preauthorized by the employer and incurred by the employee.because mcfarland did not authorize payment of the expenses in this case,the majority opines the expenses can not constitute wages.such a strained interpretation of the iwpca would allow the statute to apply only when the plan administrator authorizes payment.this view would result in real anomalies in future cases.
it is undisputed the expenses here were incurred.based on shaw reading of the health benefit plan,as well as her doctor reading of the plan,shaw contends her expenses are recoverable,which is precisely the issue for resolution.the terms incurred and recov
