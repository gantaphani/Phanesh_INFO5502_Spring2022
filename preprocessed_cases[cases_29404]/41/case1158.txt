this is a tragic case.in november,ariel perez,perez hung himself from a bedsheet tied to a vent in his single cell in the oakland county jail in pontiac,michigan,resulting in his death three days later.perez father,ariel perez,perez,the personal representative of perez estate,brought a action in the district court against the oakland county,michigan,at the jail roberta rice,the oakland county sheriff and several of his deputies and jail psychiatrist sarath hemachandra,perez argues that the defendants violated perez eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by failing to provide appropriate mental health treatment and suicide monitoring the defendants filed for summary judgment,and the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting summary judgment on all of the federal claims and declining supplemental jurisdiction on all claims.perez timely appealed.
background 
perez prior terms of incarceration at oakland county jail 
perez was born in.he did not complete high school and was diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and as being learning disabled when he was six years old.perez began serving sentences in the oakland county jail at a fairly young age.in february of,when he was years old,he pleaded guilty to two charges of felony larceny from a building and was given a sentence on may.it was initially determined that due to perez age he should serve his time in a boot camp.however,after he reported to a boot camp counselor that he was experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices telling him to quit or escape,perez was transferred to the oakland county jail in late june.when perez arrived at the jail,he was met by defendant roberta rice,an inmate caseworker.perez told rice that he had been hearing voices for the past two years telling him to hurt himself,but he did not listen to the voices.he also stated that he had tried to hang himself at the ages of and.
rice determined that perez should get a psychiatric evaluation,which was conducted by sarath hemachandra on july.hemachandra noted perez history of hearing voices and considering suicide,his learning disability,his adhd diagnosis and the fact that perez had taken ritalin as a child.hemachandra diagnosed perez with schizoaffective disorder,a personality disorder and a learning disorder.he prescribed psychiatric medication,individual counseling and substance abuse counseling.he also noted that perez should be watched closely.
perez was housed with a roommate and placed on a active behavior watch abw,based on the assessments of rice and hemachandra.on july,rice met with perez because he was refusing to take his zyprexa medication.rice decided to discontinue the abw following this meeting.
on august,perez was in a crisis state,and jail staff determined that he was suicidal.they placed him in an attorney booth until he could be seen by rice.rice met with perez,and he indicated that he was considering hurting himself by cutting his wrist with a razor or hanging himself with a sheet.he said i feel like i going crazy.rice told perez that she wanted him moved to the front holding tanks so that he could be closely supervised.he stated that he would commit suicide if he was placed in such a holding tank,but the move was made,and he was placed on an active suicide watch asw.
rice met with perez the next day,august.perez stated that he felt better and wanted to be moved out of the holding cell.he indicated that he had no suicidal thoughts or intentions,and he said he would not cause trouble if moved to the main jail.rice downgraded perez status from asw to abw.she thought he seemed stable,and she approved his reassignment to the main jail.
rice again met with perez on september,after perez he been placed in an observation cell as a result of a fight he had had with another inmate.perez stated that he was not suicidal,that he had been taking his medications and that he had been doing fine prior to the fight.rice brought up the idea of perez being placed in a single cell due to his trouble getting along with other inmates,and perez agreed to this.rice also determined that perez did not appear suicidal and no watch was necessary.jail officials asked rice if perez could be placed in an cell,but she said this placement was inappropriate in light of perez age,mental health treatment and learning disability.perez continued to be incarcerated without incident until his release on october.
perez was again incarcerated at the oakland county jail for two days in late april,after an altercation with his father.while perez was at the jail,rice responded to a phone call from perez sister,jennifer perez.jennifer perez told rice that perez had not been compliant with his mental health treatment,that he had been hearing voices telling him that he was no good and that he should kill himself and that her father wanted perez to get treatment.rice gave jennifer perez the name of the medications perez had been given while he was incarcerated and the phone numbers of collaborative solutions and mercy network.perez was again incarcerated at the oakland county jail in late august,but the reasons for this incarceration are not clear from the record.
between his april and august incarcerations,perez received treatment at joseph mercy hospital and the north oakland medical center nomc for depression and suicidal thoughts.a petition for hospitalization was prepared on perez behalf,a doctor diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia and he was given antipsychotic medication.additionally,he was placed in a psychiatric ward at nomc from through early june.in early october,perez went to the nomc emergency room and stated that he was hearing voices telling him to hurt his sister and break into a restaurant.perez was again diagnosed with schizophrenia and another petition for hospitalization was prepared on his behalf.
incarceration period during which perez committed suicide 
on october,perez returned to the oakland county jail after violating his probation.early in the morning on october,perez told a guard that he was hearing voices.he asked to speak to a counselor immediately but said he did not feel suicidal.a half hour to an hour later,perez attempted suicide by tying his pants around his neck and the bars of his holding cell.a deputy placed perez on asw status,and he was placed in an observation cell.rice came to see him soon after,and she continued the suicide watch.perez was also seen by hemachandra on an emergency basis that day.perez told hemachandra that he had attempted suicide in order to see a counselor and obtain medication lithium and zypreza,which he had been taking prior to his incarceration sooner.hemachandra prescribed these medications and recommended that perez be kept under close supervision.
perez and rice met on october,and perez stated that he felt better since receiving the medication and that he did not feel suicidal.he told rice that he had not wanted to kill himself when he attempted suicide,but instead,he had made the attempt because he wanted to be taken out of the holding cell and given medication.rice discontinued perez asw status and approved his transfer back to the general prison population,finding that he was cooperative and his thought process appeared to be within the normal limits.he was moved to a cell on october.
on november,rice and perez met again,following a report she received that perez was refusing to take his medication.perez told rice he thought he did not need the medication and that he had lied about his symptoms in the past in order to get the medication hoping that it would help him cope with his term in jail.he said he had been depressed in the past but that he had become a christian and had a purpose in life.he further stated that he did not feel suicidal and that he wanted a cell assignment that would allow him to work on his general educational development test ged.rice noted that perez appears manipulative in order to get his way,that he did not appear suicidal and that he appears stable at this time.she determined no watch was needed.
on november,perez was evaluated again by hemachandra.hemachandra report from this session documented perez history of adhd,cannabis dependence,suicide attempts,paranoia and mood swings.hemachandra asked perez if he had been hearing voices,and perez said that he had not.he said he never had and that he lied about hearing voices in order to get medication to help his insomnia and depression.hemachandra again diagnosed perez with schizoaffective disorder,cannabis dependence,a learning disorder and a personality disorder.he did not,however,find evidence of suicidal intent.hemachandra recommended perez be given individual counseling and substance abuse counseling.he also prescribed zyprexa and lithium for perez and explained to perez that it was important for him to take these medications.
on november,perez met with rice after deputy john jorganson requested perez be approved for single cell housing because perez had been stealing from other inmates in his cell.perez admitted to rice during their meeting that he had been stealing from the other inmates.perez also told rice that he was not taking his psychiatric medication since he believed he did not need it.rice asked perez why he had not discussed this decision with hemachandra,and perez responded by telling rice that his cellmates encouraged him to continue getting the medication so that he could sell it to them.perez stated he did not feel suicidal,he had frequent contact with his family and he was not feeling depressed or anxious.rice found that perez insight appears limited and judgment appears poor but that he did not appear at risk of suicide,was stable and could be housed in a single cell without supervision.
the next day,november,rice reviewed perez case with hemachandra because of perez refusal to take his medication.consistent with the standard protocol designed to minimize unused medication in the jail environment,hemachandra discontinued perez medications but moved perez next scheduled psychiatric appointment up from november to november.
on november,in the evening,deputy michael monroe was working in the area where perez was housed.he was relieved that evening by deputy terry montgomery.clock rounds of perez cell were performed at pm and pm,a gap of minutes.perez was not on any kind of special watch.according to other inmates,perez placed a sheet over his cell during this period,which blocked the view into the cell.after their pm rounds,jail personnel discovered that perez had hung himself with a bed sheet that had been tied to the vent of his cell.he died on november,from injuries sustained as a result of this action.
district court action 
on january,perez brought an action with respect to these events in the district court.the claim initially involved only oakland county and its jail personnel,but sarath hemachandra and roberta rice were later added as defendants.perez argued that the defendants violated perez eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.he also filed state law claims with the district court.
following discovery,all defendants filed motions for summary judgment.after perez filed a brief in opposition to these motions,the district court issued a memorandum opinion granting summary judgment for the defendants and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.perez filed a timely appeal with this court in april.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.farhat jopke,cir stemler city of florence,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is not a genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding the motion,a court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.to withstand summary judgment,the must show sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.see klepper first am.bank,cir.
claims against roberta rice 
perez argues that the district court was correct when it found that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether rice acted with deliberate indifference in violation of perez eighth amendment rights,but the court erred when it found that rice was nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity,and thus her motion for summary judgment should be granted.
eighth amendment claim 
section prohibits any person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state from depriving any citizen of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.perez argues that perez eighth amendment right under the united states constitution was violated.the eighth amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.const.amend.viii.
as applied to prisoners,this constitutional guarantee encompasses a right to medical care for serious medical needs,including psychological needs.see estelle gamble,d.however,the eighth amendment prohibits mistreatment only if it is tantamount to punishment,and thus courts have imposed liability upon prison officials only where they are so deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of prisoners as to unnecessarily and wantonly inflict pain.horn madison county fiscal court,cir.a serious medical need is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor attention.blackmore kalamazoo county,cir citing gaudreault municipality of salem,cir,reh g en banc denied.negligence or medical malpractice alone can not sustain an eighth amendment claim,absent a showing of deliberate indifference.estelle,at.
deliberate indifference as analyzed by this court has both an objective and a subjective component.see comstock mccrary,cir.in cases involving an inmate medical needs,the need must be,objectively,sufficiently serious.farmer brennan,d citing wilson seiter,d.in considering the subjective component,this circuit has emphasized that a plaintiff must produce evidence showing that the official being sued subjectively perceived facts from which to infer substantial risk to the prisoner,that he did in fact draw the inference,and that he then disregarded that risk.comstock,at.the subjective component requires that an official who actually knew of the serious medical need possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind in denying medical care.miller calhoun county,cir quoting farmer,at.deliberate indifference requires a degree of culpability greater than mere negligence,but less than acts or omissions for the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.id.at.quoting farmer,at.the supreme court has also said,an official failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not,while no cause for commendation,can not under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.farmer,at.
this court has held that deliberate indifference may be established by a showing of grossly inadequate care as well as by a decision to take an easier but less efficacious course of treatment.terrance northville reg l psychiatric,cir quoting mcelligott foley,cir.however,the circuit cases upon which terrance was based note that a showing of grossly inadequate care satisfies only the objective prong of the deliberate indifference standard.plaintiff must still present evidence of a prison official subjective awareness of,and disregard for,a prisoner serious medical needs.see campbell sikes,cir.additionally,in an en banc decision regarding a prison suicide,this circuit emphasized that the plaintiff had to show that the defendant prison psychiatrists must have known of,and yet disregarded,an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.see williams mehra,cir en banc.
here,perez argues that rice violated perez constitutional rights by failing to provide appropriate mental health treatment or monitoring while he was being held in the oakland county jail in the fall of.the district court found,and we ultimately agree,that perez showed a genuine issue of material fact as to whether rice conduct satisfied both the objective and subjective components of the deliberate indifference standard.we also agree with the district court,however,that this is a very close,and thus difficult,case.
perez had to show that rice was aware of a serious medical need his mental illness as manifested in suicide risk and that she acted with deliberate indifference to that need.a genuine issue of fact regarding the objective component of the standard can be met by a showing that perez posed a strong likelihood of another suicide attempt.see gray city of detroit,cir barber city of salem,cir.perez had threatened and attempted suicide on several occasions in the past and had been placed on behavior and suicide watches during his periods of incarceration at the oakland county jail.perez attempted suicide in his cell in october,only a month or so before his successful suicide in november.this october attempt prompted rice to place perez in an observation cell under an active suicide watch and hemachandra to recommend that perez be kept under close observation.additionally,hemachandra testified that past threats or attempts at suicide are considered when determining whether an individual is suicidal,though someone who has previously considered or attempted suicide will not necessarily do so again.hemachandra also testified that a patient who fails to take prescribed psychotropic medication posed a risk of becoming depressed,of inability to control moods and of becoming ultimately suicidal.perez oakland county,d.perez also presented expert testimony stating that individuals who suffer from schizophrenia and have made past suicide attempts are more likely than others to attempt suicide again.id.
despite this evidence,there are certainly reasons to doubt the objective conclusion that perez posed a strong likelihood of another suicide attempt.hemachandra,a trained and licensed psychiatrist,opined that perez gave no indication of suicidal intention during his final evaluation on november.additionally,rice counseling notes during the time period of early to show that perez denied any suicidal intention,and they reflect rice conclusion that perez was not suicidal or otherwise in need of an enhanced watch status.ultimately,however,we find that viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,there is a question of fact remaining as to whether there was a recognizable significant likelihood of perez attempting suicide.
the district court also correctly found that a genuine issue of fact remains on the subjective component of this rice acted with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need of which she was aware.throughout her time treating perez,rice made the decision,on several occasions most recently a month before he committed suicide,to place perez on an elevated watch status and to house perez in an observation cell or with roommate s.viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to perez,this evidence can be construed as demonstrating that rice had the subjective knowledge,at least at times,that perez posed a risk of suicide.thus,there is a question of fact remaining whether rice knowingly disregarded this risk by moving perez to single cell housing on november,without first requesting a medical judgment from hemachandra whether this placement was appropriate for perez.rice notes of her november,counseling session can also be viewed as focusing unduly on perez problems with other inmates,without considering his mental health needs and whether he would be at risk of suicide if placed in a single cell.id.at.
the district court also correctly found that rice can not rely on hemachandra november,assessment of whether perez was suicidal he determined that perez was not on that date because the situation did not remain stable between that date and the date rice assigned perez to a single cell.rice learned during this time that perez was refusing to take his medication without hemachandra consent or direction and also that perez was experiencing problems getting along with other inmates.
once again,however,the record is not on this issue.as the district court noted,a reasonable juror could construe rice november and november,reports stating that perez did not appear suicidal to mean that rice did not subjectively perceive the danger posed by perez condition and thus could not have acted with deliberate indifference,whether or not she should have perceived such a risk,or whether or not she should have trusted her own judgment about perez state,given the changed circumstances since hemachandra most recent evaluation of perez.however,we ultimately agree with the district court that viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to perez,as we are compelled to do see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d,there is a genuine question of material fact remaining as to whether rice acted with deliberate indifference to perez serious medical needs.
taken together,the evidence regarding the objective and subjective inquiries for deliberate indifference create a genuine issue of material fact whether rice demonstrated deliberate indifference by disregarding a risk of known serious harm to perez by making housing decisions for him without consulting a medical professional.this,however,is a conclusion which we can reach only with some reluctance in view of the uneven quality of the record.
qualified immunity claim 
under the qualified immunity doctrine,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability from civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.walsh cuyahoga county,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.q ualified immunity is an immunity from suit,not just from an ultimate assessment of damages.archie lanier,cir citing mireles waco,d.this immunity shields officials as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.myers potter,cir quoting anderson creighton,d,reh g reh g en banc denied.
the purpose of the qualified immunity defense is to protect public officials from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability.vakilian shaw,cir quoting blake wright,cir.in skousen brighton high,this court noted that 
the philosophy behind the doctrine of qualified immunity is a desire to avoid the substantial costs imposed on government,and society,by subjecting officials to the risks of trial.such burdens include distraction of officials from their government duties,inhibition of discretionary action,and deterrence of able people from public service.
skousen brighton high,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in evaluating a qualified immunity defense,this court engages in a analysis.we first determine whether,on the facts alleged,the official violated a constitutional or statutory right.walsh cuyahoga,cir citing sample bailey,cir.we view the facts alleged in the light most favorable to the party seeking to defeat immunity,in this case perez.myers potter,cir.if the plaintiff does not establish the violation of a constitutional or statutory right,the inquiry ends there and the official is entitled to immunity.see midkiff adams cty.reg.water,cir,reh g reh g en banc denied.
here,we have already determined that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether rice violated perez eighth amendment constitutional right.thus,though it is a close case,we can not hold that rice is entitled to qualified immunity on summary judgment based on the first step of the qualified immunity analysis.
we thus move to the second step of the qualified immunity test we determine whether the right violated was clearly established at the time of the violation.myers,at citing estate of carter city of detroit,cir.the burden of showing that the right was clearly established rests squarely with the plaintiff.key grayson,cir quoting cope heltsley,cir.
the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,d.moreover,the plaintiff must show that the right was clearly established in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.id.at.if reasonable officers could disagree about the lawfulness of the conduct in question,immunity must be recognized.key,at.
in order to determine if the law is clearly established such that a reasonable official could determine that her actions were unlawful,we look principally to the law of this circuit and to the supreme court.lavado keohane,cir poe haydon,cir.however,we have held that the lack of supreme court or sixth circuit precedent is not a sufficient condition for concluding that the law is unclear on the subject and thus that qualified immunity must be granted to a defendant.mccloud testa,cir.t he decisions of other courts can also clearly establish the law,but they must point unmistakably to the unconstitutionality of the conduct and be so clearly foreshadowed by applicable direct authority as to leave no doubt in the mind of a reasonable officer that his conduct was unconstitutional.summar bennett,cir internal citation omitted.
for a right to be clearly established,there need not be a case with the exact same fact pattern,or even fundamentally similar or materially similar facts rather,the question is whether the defendants had fair warning that their actions were unconstitutional.cummings city of akron,cir quoting hope pelzer,d.united states lanier,d general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,and in some instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question,even though the very action in question has not previously been held unlawful internal citation omitted feathers aey,cir an action unlawfulness can be apparent from direct holdings,from specific examples described as prohibited,or from the general reasoning that a court employs.
for perez,this precedent taken together means he must show that binding authority would have alerted reasonable people in rice position that her conduct was unlawful.in the context of a prisoner eighth amendment claim,such precedent had to alert rice that her conduct was deliberately indifferent to a strong likelihood that perez would try to kill himself.
we ultimately find that rice is entitled to qualified immunity because no law exists that would clearly establish for a person in rice position that she was violating perez eighth amendment rights.perez is correct that perez right not to have prison officials treat his known serious medical need with indifference,including psychiatric and psychological counseling and medication,was clearly established by binding case law at the time of his death in november.in april we stated the applicable general proposition it is well settled that the deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the eighth amendment.terrance northville reg l psychiatric,cir,quoting estelle gamble,d.this court has also said more specifically that a prisoner psychological needs may constitute serious medical needs,especially when they result in suicidal tendencies.comstock mccrary,cir quoting horn madison county fiscal court,cir.
these established principles,however,were not enough,on their own,to alert a reasonable caseworker that rice conduct was deliberately indifferent under the circumstances.w e do not assess the right violated at a high level of generality,but instead,we must determine whether the right is clearly established in a more particularized sense.myers potter,cir quoting anderson creighton,d.because most legal rights are clearly established at some level of generality,immunity would be impossible to obtain if a plaintiff were required only to cite an abstract legal principle that an official had clearly violated.martin heideman,cir.
for example,in brosseau haugen,d,the supreme court evaluated the qualified immunity claim of an officer who had shot an individual who had been attempting to flee from officers in motor vehicles.the supreme court found the cases relevant to the situation brosseau confronted to be ones that considered whether to shoot a disturbed felon,set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight,when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that flight.id.at.quoting saucier katz,d.brosseau has been interpreted to mean that the law is not clearly established when it is heavily dependent on the specific facts of each case and no case squarely addresse s the facts of this case.lyons city of xenia,cir citing randall city of fairbanks,d.
in comstock mccrary,this court held that once a prisoner has been deemed suicidal,it is clearly established that the prisoner is entitled to continuing medical treatment.here,perez was not deemed to be suicidal at the time he was moved to the single cell.additionally,perez was not generally deprived of medical treatment involving his mental health needs.thus,perez would have to prove that his son right to have his serious medical needs treated without deliberate indifference encompassed a right to a correct assessment of his suicide risk or an effective arrangement.see danese asman,cir the right that is truly at issue here is the right of a detainee to be screened correctly for suicidal tendencies and the right to have steps taken that would have prevented suicide.the general right to medical care,for example,is not sufficient to require a police officer to have known that he had to determine that danese was seriously contemplating suicide and stop him from following through.perez identifies no published decision of the supreme court or this court requiring such a determination,nor have we found any.
if no binding precedent is available that directly holds that conduct materially or fundamentally similar to rice was unlawful in under the circumstances,as is the case here,the court may still find that rice violated a clearly established right through one other avenue showing a generally applicable principle from either binding or persuasive authorities whose specific application to the relevant controversy is so clearly foreshadowed by applicable direct authority as to leave no doubt in the mind of a reasonable officer that his conduct was unconstitutional.high fuchs,cir quoting summar bennett,cir.
however,perez failed to show such a principle.on the contrary,by october this circuit published case law had established that inmates have no general right to be correctly screened for suicidal tendencies.danese asman,cir,cited by davis fentress county,cir nor has this court recognized a generalized right of a prisoner to be protected against committing suicide.the circuit published case law also held that the generalized right of a prisoner to be free from deliberate indifference to a known serious medical need can not support a finding that there was a clearly established right to be protected from committing suicide.rich city of mayfield heights,cir.
we acknowledge that rice may have demonstrated poor judgment in several ways.she made critical decisions based ultimately on her own assessment of perez risk of suicide,even though she had and prevention training but no advanced psychiatry or psychology degree she may have underestimated perez risk of suicide additionally,making a decision or recommendation without first consulting perez treating physician or prison psychiatrist hemachandra may have been.these arguable errors might make rice liable for negligence or negligent infliction of emotional distress,but those are properly the subject of tort claims,not an eighth amendment claim.we find no case law to suggest that any of these errors clearly violated perez eighth amendment rights.
finally,we must consider perez claim that rice is not entitled to qualified immunity because her conduct involved performance of a ministerial,rather than a discretionary,function.it is well established that only officials performing discretionary,as opposed to ministerial,functions,are entitled to qualified immunity.davis holly,cir.however,we decline to address the merits of this argument because perez waived this issue by not raising it at the district court.we do not consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal unless the party shows that refusal to consider the argument would result in a miscarriage of justice.united states isaiah,cir.perez does not argue that such a miscarriage of justice would occur here,and we do not believe it would.perez only reply to rice waiver argument is t he issue most certainly is properly before the court.rice brought her motion for summary judgment,in part,based on a qualified immunity argument.the district court held she is entitled to qualified immunity.perez filed an appeal which challenges that rice is entitled to qualified immunity.pl.reply br.perez argument fails because he had a chance to respond to rice motion for summary judgment in the district court and did not raise the ministerial function argument.because this specific argument was made for the first time on appeal and our decision not to address the issue does not result in a miscarriage of justice,we decline to consider the issue.see isaiah,at.for these reasons,we find that the district court was correct in granting summary judgment for rice based on her entitlement to qualified immunity.
claim against oakland county 
plaintiff brought a federal claim against defendant oakland country.a municipality or in this case a county can not be held liable under for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.gregory shelby county,cir citing monell dep t of social,d.in monell,the supreme court held that a municipality can,however,be found liable under where a policy of the municipality itself causes the constitutional violation at issue.the court said,i t is when execution of a government policy or custom inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under.monell,at.this court has likewise said,f or liability to attach,there must be execution of a government policy or custom which results in a constitutional tort.gregory at.additionally,perez must show that through its deliberate conduct,the county was the moving force behind the violation of his constitutional is,he must show that the county action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct casual link between the county action and the deprivation of federal rights.gregory,at quoting board of county comm rs of bryan county brown,d.
the deliberate indifference standard applies to the county.see gray city of detroit,cir barber city of salem,cir.the county has a duty to recognize,or at least not to ignore,obvious risks of suicide that are foreseeable,and to take reasonable steps to prevent an inmate suicide w here such a risk is clear.gray,at.however,d eliberate indifference remains distinct from mere negligence.where a city does create reasonable policies,but negligently administers them,there is no deliberate indifference and therefore no liability.gray,at cir.d eliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault,requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.board of county comm rs of bryan county brown,at.in evaluating claims against counties,we consider legitimate governmental interests such as the allocation of resources,including time,personnel,and money.roberts city of troy,cir.
here,perez must identify an oakland county policy or custom that demonstrated deliberate indifference to the serious mental health needs of inmates at the county jail.liability would rest,if at all,on the actions of rice in the context of the county policy,since we found that she violated perez eighth amendment rights.see watkins city of battle creek,cir.perez argues that the county policy that demonstrates deliberate indifference and that is a violation of the eighth amendment is allowing personnel such as rice to make the ultimate decision about the housing assignments of mentally ill inmates.
the district court found that perez failed to show a genuine issue of fact as to whether the county demonstrated deliberate indifference by allowing case workers like rice to make housing decisions that sometimes implicated the medical needs of inmates.perez oakland county et,d.we agree.perez provides no evidence that this practice has ever resulted in a suicide or attempted suicide by another inmate,either at the county jail or in another jail across the country.it does not seem obvious,as perez argues pl.br,that allowing a caseworker in mental health needs and suicide to occasionally make housing decisions that affect the mental health of inmates would result in a suicide,and the lack of statistics to support this conclusion furthers the argument that there was a lack of foreseeability.see gray,at finding no deliberate indifference partly because the plaintiff decedent was the only individual who had committed suicide in a city of detroit facility in the past years.we agree with the district court that supplying expert testimony that the county practice is inadequate and poses a risk to inmates does not support the conclusion that the county acted with deliberate indifference to perez mental health needs,though it might support the conclusion that the county was negligent.a finding of negligence does not satisfy the deliberate indifference standard.see gray,at molton city of cleveland,cir.
perez also argues,in support of its position of deliberate indifference,that the county policy of allowing a caseworker like rice,as opposed to a medical professional,to make screening and placement decisions,is unusual.critical decisions as to the care and treatment of these mentally ill inmates are not typically made by officials.pl.br.this statement is contrary to perez own expert,houston,who testified that such prisoner screening and placement decisions are commonly made by officials in prisons across the country,although he apparently considered that practice 
q.so is it your testimony that the practice across this country in county jails is that most county jails are in conformance or nonconformance with this standard 
a.as you have phrased it,not in conformance.
because the vast majority of county jails out there have individuals who are trained in suicide identification and prevention who are not psychiatrists,correct 
and these people every day make determinations whether or not somebody is suicidal or potentially suicidal,correct 
good.and you would agree that across this country,the vast majority of decisions as to whether or not an individual is suicidal or potentially suicidal are not made by psychiatrists or clinical psychologists in the county jail correctional setting,correct 
perez also fails to show a genuine question as to whether there was a direct casual link between the county action and the deprivation of federal rights.gregory,at.in fact,perez seems to be arguing,at least in parts of his brief,that if rice simply followed the county policy and left perez in the cell,it is unlikely that perez would have committed suicide 
pursuant to the policy,perez should have never been housed in a single cell without any special watch what rice did when she placed perez in a single cell without any special watch and with the tools necessary for perez to easily harm himself presumably the bedsheet was the worst possible thing she could have done.arguably,doing nothing and maintaining the status quo by keeping perez in the cell would not have been good,but perez would probably be alive today.
pl br.emphasis added.perez contends that by placing the decedent in a single cell just before his suicide,caseworker rice wholly disregarded jail policy pl br.emphasis added requiring that inmates indicating potentially suicidal behavior shall be housed in a multiple cell with appropriate supervision watch recommended.id.quoting,perez.opp to sj,ex,cty.jail policy dated.further,perez argues rice was aware of jail policies regarding housing of mentally ill inmates and potentially suicidal inmates,yet she disregarded them rice conduct can basically be summarized as follows first,she ignored jail policy regarding the housing of potentially suicidal inmates it simply can not be objectively reasonable to completely disregard a written jail policy regarding housing.id.at.these arguments and evidence further suggest a lack of a link between county policy and perez suicide.in fact,they suggest that,if another case worker had simply followed county policy,perez suicide could have been prevented.thus,while these arguments may provide further support of rice negligence,they indicate that there may not even have been a link between county policy and perez suicide.
for these reasons,we find that the district court was correct in granting oakland county summary judgment.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for roberta rice and for oakland county.
i concur in the result and join in all portions of the lead opinion except section.specifically,i join in affirming summary judgment for oakland county for the reasons stated by judge cudahy.i also join in affirming summary judgment for prison caseworker roberta rice on the basis of qualified immunity because it would not have been clear to a reasonable person in her position that her conduct was unlawful in the situation she confronted.see saucier katz,d see also baranski unknown agents of the batf,cir en banc a government agent is entitled to qualified immunity unless he violates a clearly established constitutional right.
i respectfully disagree,however,with judge cudahy conclusion that perez established a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether rice conduct violated the eighth amendment section.in my view,the record does not support the allegation that rice acted with deliberate indifference to perez known serious medical need as we have defined that term in the context of prisoner suicide.
the lead opinion asserts that a genuine issue of fact regarding the objective component of the deliberate indifference standard can be met by showing that perez posed a strong likelihood of another suicide attempt.emphasis added.the lead opinion correctly states the legal standard for deliberate indifference in the context.in our circuit,
the proper inquiry concerning the liability of a city and its employees in both their official and individual capacities under section for a jail detainee suicide is whether the decedent showed a strong likelihood that he would attempt to take his own life in such a manner that failure to take adequate precautions amounted to deliberate indifference to the decedent serious medical needs.
gray city of detroit,cir emphasis added quoting barber city of salem,cir.
but the record simply does not show a genuine issue as to whether perez satisfied this standard.again,to conclude that rice violated perez eighth amendment rights,it is not enough to establish that she may have acted with deliberate indifference to some possibility of suicide,or even a likelihood of suicide.this is a critical distinction the record might show a genuine issue as to whether rice acted with deliberate indifference to a real,even a substantial risk of suicide,but it does not permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude rice was aware of a strong likelihood of suicide and acted with deliberate indifference to that very high level of risk.
as the lead opinion notes,
there are certainly reasons to doubt the objective conclusion that perez posed a strong likelihood of another suicide attempt.hemachandra,a trained and licensed psychiatrist,opined that perez gave no indication of suicidal ideation during his final evaluation on november.additionally,rice counseling notes during the time period of early to show that perez denied any suicidal intention,and they reflect rice conclusion that perez was not suicidal or otherwise in need of an enhanced watch status.
i agree,and the record does not create a genuine issue as to whether perez posed a strong likelihood of another suicide attempt at that particular time.judge cudahy approves the district court view that 
rice can not rely on hemachandra november,assessment of whether perez was suicidal he determined that perez was not on that date because the situation did not remain stable between that date and the date rice assigned perez to a single cell.rice learned during this time that perez was refusing to take his medication without hemachandra consent or direction,and also that perez was experiencing problems getting along with other inmates.
the lead opinion does not explain,however,how knowledge that perez was not getting along with other inmates equates or necessarily leads to knowledge that there was a strong likelihood that he would try to kill himself.judge cudahy does not identify any expert opinion or other evidence that supports such a correlation.with regard to rice learning that perez had been refusing to take his medication since his november visit to hemachandra,it is important to note why perez apparently refused to take the medication during that period.as rice knew from her own conversation with perez just before the fateful housing decision,the reason perez eschewed the medication was simply because he did not feel suicidal and had plans to improve his life on various fronts.
as permitted by her employer,rice participated in monitoring and interacting with perez and making treatment and related housing decisions.the record does not suggest that her final housing and decisions were taken with deliberate indifference to a strong likelihood of assuming arguendo that there was such a strong likelihood.where a prisoner has received some medical attention and the dispute is over the adequacy of the treatment,federal courts are generally reluctant to second guess medical judgments and to constitutionalize claims which sound in state tort law.westlake lucas,cir.judge cudahy attempt to establish the genuine possibility that rice perceived such a strong likelihood of suicide at the relevant time is unavailing.the lead opinion asserts,
throughout her time treating perez,rice made the decision,on several occasions most recently a month before he committed suicide,to place perez on an elevated watch status and to house perez in an observation cell or with roommate s.viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to perez,this evidence can be construed as demonstrating that rice had the subjective knowledge,at least at times,that perez posed a risk of suicide.
the fact that rice knew perez was or might be suicidal at earlier times simply does not support the inference that rice knew that perez posed a risk of suicide at the later time,when perez appeared and claimed to be in a state of mind.
as a caseworker who had both some relevant training and familiarity with perez,rice acted in reliance on her interaction with and observation of perez,and on perez repeated,very recent statements that he had lied about wanting to commit suicide,seeking only to obtain medication to help him cope with incarceration rather than his medical condition,he had continued lying about his suicidal ideation and mental state to both hemachandra and rice in order to obtain medication to sell to fellow prisoners,he believed that he still did not need,and so was refusing to take,that medication,and he had a newfound religious faith that gave him purpose,as well as a desire to better himself and prepare for the future by earning a ged.soles ingham,d worker was entitled to summary judgment on claim although she knew prisoner had recently attempted suicide and still reported feeling somewhat depressed,she was not deliberately indifferent by returning prisoner from observation cell to general population,where examination five days earlier showed significant improvement in prisoner mood and attitude,prisoner seemed less agitated and told her he had not experienced suicidal thoughts for at least a week,and guards contemporaneously reported that prisoner had been less withdrawn and was interacting more normally with others,aff.cir.accordingly,this was not a case where the most recent information available to the prison official suggested a alone a strong suicide.this information,in fact,suggested quit
