in this social security appeal,petitioner appellant robert selian appeals from a january,final judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york sharpe,affirming the social security commissioner denial of selian application for disability insurance benefits.selian seeks disability benefits on the ground that he is unable to work because he suffers from fibromyalgia,shoulder tendinitis,and depression.on appeal,he contends that the administrative law judge alj made several errors in reviewing the commissioner denial.first,he argues that the alj determination that his alleged fibromyalgia was not a severe impairment was not supported by substantial evidence.second,he argues that the alj erred in finding his testimony about his pain not credible.third,he contends that the alj determination of selian residual functional capacity was not supported by substantial evidence,and that the alj incorrectly relied on the medical vocational guidelines to determine what work selian could perform instead of obtaining the testimony of a vocational expert.
we hold that the alj finding that selian did not suffer from fibromyalgia was not supported by substantial evidence.we likewise hold that the alj residual functional capacity determination that selian could perform light work was not supported by substantial evidence.finally,with respect to the alj reliance on the medical vocational guidelines,we hold that the alj erred in failing to determine whether selian reaching limitation was,which would preclude reliance on the guidelines and require the testimony of a vocational expert.
background 
history of physical and mental impairments 
selian began seeing mark corey on january,complaining of chronic pain in both shoulders,shortness of breath,and severe fatigue.corey found that selian had some tenderness in his shoulders and weakly positive impingement in both shoulders.selian exhibited a good range of motion,and of his shoulders showed no significant findings.corey diagnosed selian with bilateral rotator cuff tendinitis and probable epicondylitis,tennis elbow,and initially treated selian tendinitis by injecting both of his shoulders with lidocaine a pain reliever and depo medrol a corticosteroid.
following this evaluation,selian filed his initial application for disability insurance with the social security administration ssa on february.in this application,he claimed that he suffered from torn rotator cuffs in both shoulders,tendinitis in both elbows,and an underactive thyroid gland.on february,after selian complained of continuing pain in his right shoulder,corey prescribed celebrex for selian pain,assessed selian as having persistent chronic tendinitis,and recommended that he follow up with an orthopedist.approximately one month later,on march,james naughten gave selian a consultative physical examination.selian complained to naughten about his injuries and asthma.he reported that he experienced sharp pain,made worse by lifting,but that his medication helped manage the pain.during naughten physical examination,he observed that selian stance was normal and that selian could perform a full squat,but also that selian walked with a stiff gait and was unbalanced when walking on his heels and toes.selian did not need any assistance to walk or to change his clothes,but he had mild difficulty getting on and off the examination table and rising from a chair.
naughten also administered several physical tests during this examination.the test was negative on both sides,and selian displayed a full range of motion in his elbows,forearms,wrists,hips,knees,and ankles.examining selian shoulders,naughten administered several tests and found that selian range of motion in his shoulders was limited.selian also had reduced sensitivity to touch and pain in both shoulders at the acromioclavicular ac joints.his hand dexterity and finger dexterity were intact,but his grip strength was reduced on both sides.an of his left shoulder suggested the possibility of rotator cuff impingement syndrome.naughten acknowledged in his notes that selian had a history of bilateral injuries,asthma,and substance abuse.naughten concluded that selian would have no limitations in his ability to see,hear,talk,sit,or stand,but would have moderate limitations in walking,climbing stairs,pushing,pulling,and reaching.he also opined that selian could lift and carry a mild degree of weight on an intermittent basis.
the same day that selian saw naughten,he also saw dennis noia,who performed a consultative psychological examination.selian reported that he was experiencing difficulty sleeping,a decreased appetite,and multiple symptoms of depression,including dysphoric moods,crying spells,guilty feelings,hopelessness,and difficulties with memory and concentration.at the time of the examination,selian was taking cymbalta an,which had improved his condition but had not eliminated his symptoms.noia found that selian intellectual functioning was in the average range,and that his judgment and insight were good,but also that his recent and remote memory skills were mildly impaired.noia diagnosed selian with a depressive disorder.in noia opinion,selian was able to understand and follow simple and some complex tasks,both with supervision and independently.he could learn new tasks,make appropriate decisions,appropriately relate to and interact with others,maintain attention and concentration on tasks,and follow a routine.
by selian next appointment with corey on may,selian had developed upper back spasms.he reported that another doctor felt that he had fibromyalgia.on physical examination,selian displayed a reasonable range of motion in his shoulders but with marked muscular tenderness posteriorly and tender points in various locations.corey assessed f pain,which he determined was also associated with selian sleeping and mood problems.he prescribed selian elavil an antidepressant,and encouraged selian to follow up with a psychiatrist.
a few weeks later,on april,a psychologist,kamin,conducted a psychiatric assessment of selian.kamin indicated that selian had mild limitations in his daily activities,that he had mild difficulties maintaining social functioning,and moderate difficulties maintaining concentration,persistence or pace.in terms of selian mental functional capacity,kamin concluded that selian was moderately limited in his ability to understand and remember detailed instructions,but that he could remember short and simple instructions or work locations and procedures.selian appeared moderately limited in his ability to respond appropriately to changes in his work setting.kamin ultimately concluded that selian allegations of psychiatric symptoms were partially credible but not to the extent that he alleges,and that he was able to perform simple tasks.
on june,selian saw deena schwartz,a nurse practitioner,for chronic pain and dysphoric mood.selian told nurse schwartz that he had difficulty falling asleep at night and would wake up three hours later,and that he was napping during the daytime.he said that he thought he had fibromyalgia,and possibly c hronic f atigue s yndrome.nurse schwartz noted that her examination with respect to selian mental status was essentially unremarkable.she also indicated that selian mood was initially stable and cooperative but later degenerated he became irritable and impatient,and his affect became arrogant and sarcastic.schwartz indicated that she thought selian had a r eactive and irritable mood but no clear b ipolar symptoms or other psychiatric diagnosis.she recommended that selian continue therapy.
selian returned to corey on june,for a follow up,and reported that he had seen a counselor.in his words,his sleep difficulties had improved and his back pain was pretty much resolved,although he continued to feel pain in his shoulders.his affect was reasonably appropriate.he no longer had much posterior muscle tenderness.corey assessed depression with some improvement and chronic pain syndrome with mild improvement,and increased selian elavil dosage.
on september,selian returned to corey and reported improvement in his pain from a out of on the pain scale to a out of.he also stated,however,that he was having problems with his memory,as well as grogginess,trouble sleeping,and an increased appetite and weight gain.corey determined that selian was exhibiting fibromyalgia which apparently improved with elavil excessive fatigue due to sleep disturbances and sleep apnea,cognitive difficulties related to depression,and hypothyroidism,the last of which was unlikely to cause his symptoms 
selian began mental therapy in september,according to nurse schwartz treatment notes,and he spent much of his time offering reasons why he needs disability benefits.selian complained of chronic daily pain and said that he could not move,walk or sit,and that the elavil sort of work ed.his mood was neutral and he had a full range of affect.schwartz stated that she thought selian suffered from an adjustment disorder due to chronic pain,and also noted that selian was recovering from cocaine addiction.she found inconsistencies in selian reported history and behavior and suspected he was malingering to obtain disability benefits.she prescribed him prozac on a trial basis.
selian saw schwartz again on december,and reported that he had run out of medication.schwartz explained to selian that this was inconsistent with his medical history his last prescription had been refilled less than three weeks earlier,with three refills.selian complained that he had been in so much pain recently,and he became agitated when schwartz addressed his medication.schwartz restarted him on prozac and wrote another prescription for it.
on july,virginia bronson,a licensed social worker,completed a questionnaire regarding selian mental condition.she indicated that selian had moderate limitations in the areas of maintaining attention and concentration for extended periods of time,performing activities within a schedule,maintaining regular attendance and punctuality,completing a normal work day and work week without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms,and performing at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number of rest periods.she indicated that selian had marked limitations in his ability to carry out an ordinary routine without special supervision interact appropriately with the public accept instruction and respond to criticism appropriately get along with coworkers and appropriately respond to ordinary stressors and changes in the work setting.bronson also indicated that selian mental condition would cause him to have more than three absences from work per month.
corey completed a questionnaire for selian on july.he indicated a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and possible tendinitis,noting that selian condition is largely subjective in nature.corey opined that selian would need to take rest breaks of more than one minutes rest period per hour while working.he also stated that selian could not sit for six or more hours a day and could stand for at least two hours in an workday.he explained that selian medication would affect his concentration and ability to sustain a work pace at least moderately.
based on a referral from corey,paul dura,a rheumatologist,undertook a consultative examination of selian on may.selian reported a history of fibromyalgia and depression to dura and described a variety of pains in his body,as well as fatigue.selian told dura that he was unable to walk from his house to the mailbox and back and that he walked with a stiff gait.on physical examination,dura found that selian appeared healthy,and that he was able to get on and off the examination table and a stool without difficulty.selian exhibited a good range of motion.dura found no swelling in selina shoulders,but also observed that moving selian shoulders caused him some discomfort.dura noted numerous soft tissue tender points,and reported to corey that selian appear ed to have fibromyalgia syndrome and perhaps early degenerative arthritis.
work history 
from until,selian held a series of physically taxing unskilled jobs.his last job was as a delivery driver at grieves darien pharmacy,which job required him to lift at least pounds.selian stopped working as a driver because he was physically unable to continue to do the job.in an effort to find jobs that did not require him to lift significant amounts of weight,he held various,unskilled jobs from through.selian held only a ged and had not had employment other than in manual labor jobs that required him to lift significant amounts of weight.for example,as a road painter,he had to lift a spray painter that weighed pounds onto a truck as an employee at a gardener center,he had to carry heavy bags of mulch.
by the time selian started a job as a gas station attendant in early,he could no longer lift the hoods of cars or squeeze the handles of the gas pumps.he quit after two months,in may.his last job was at the oswego penny saver newspaper company,which he held from november to december,where he stacked,packed,and stored bundles of papers.he quit on december,because his shoulder pain was too intense to continue.he has not held employment since.
hearing before and decision of the administrative law judge and appeal to the district court 
after selian filed for benefits,the commissioner denied his application at the initial review stage on april.selian requested an administrative hearing,which was held before the alj on april.at that hearing,selian testified that he had not worked since december because of the pain in his shoulders.selian further testified that,at the time of the hearing,he had torn both rotator cuffs,degenerative arthritis in his shoulders,tendonitis in both elbows,fibromyalgia in his back,pain in his hip,wrist,and knee,fatigue,and depression.he stated that he had difficulty following conversations,lost his train of thought,and could not watch television because it left him dizzy and confused.he testified that he napped during the day and had difficulty sleeping at night.on a scale of one to ten,selian rated his shoulder pain and fibromyalgia as an between an eight and a nine.
according to selian,he could not dress himself,wash his hair,shave,or put his shoes on.he used a seat in his bathtub to wash himself and had a safety bar installed in the tub.because of his depression,he did not socialize with others,sometimes neglected his personal hygiene,and could not handle stress.
in terms of physical capabilities,selian testified that he sat most of the day but needed to alternate between sitting and standing because of hip pain.he said that he could not stand for more than ten minutes,and could only walk to the mailbox and back with difficulty.he could not reach overhead with either arm,and he was unable to carry any amount of weight.
after considering the record,the alj denied selian application for benefits.following the social security commission analysis,see infra,the alj first found that selian had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since his alleged onset date of june.the alj next found that,for the period before january,when selian first saw corey,selian had not provided any evidence of a medically determinable impairment.for the period beginning january,however,the alj concluded that the evidence showed that selian had two severe impairments degenerative joint disease of the shoulders and a mood disorder.despite corey diagnosis,the alj rejected selian contention that he had fibromyalgia,finding that the medical evidence did not show he had fibromyalgia.the alj then concluded that these impairments did not meet or equal any per se impairment listed in part,subpart p,appendix.
accordingly,because selian disorders were not per se impairments,the alj next determined selian residual functional capacity rfc.she found that he could lift and carry up to pounds occasionally and pounds frequently,and that,during an workday,selian had no limitations on standing or sitting and could walk for a total of two hours.the alj further found that selian could only occasionally push,pull,and reach in all directions.with respect to selian mental limitations,the alj found that selian could understand,carry out,and remember simple instructions respond appropriately to supervision,coworkers,and usual work situations and deal with changes in his routine work setting.the alj therefore concluded that selian could perform light work as defined in the social security regulations.see b.
given selian rfc of light work,the alj found that he could not perform any of his past relevant work.the alj thus determined whether selian rfc and his work history showed that selian could perform other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy.applying the medical vocational guidelines set forth at part,subpart p,appendix the grids,the alj found selian not disabled and denied his claim.this decision became the final decision of the commissioner on october,when the appeals council denied selian request for review.
on november,selian commenced the instant action in the district court,challenging the commissioner denial of his application for benefits.specifically,selian contested the alj assessment of the medical records and opinions,the alj finding of selian rfc,and the alj assessment of specific findings by selian treating physicians.on january,the district court issued a memorandum decision and order affirming the alj denial of benefits.the district court found that the alj had properly evaluated the opinions of naughten,corey,and noia,and that the alj findings regarding the mental portion of selian rfc had been made properly and were supported by substantial evidence.selian astrue,cv gls,wl,at.the district court concluded that substantial evidence supported the commissioner decision that selian was not disabled and denied selian appeal.the clerk of the court entered final judgment in favor of the commissioner on january,and selian timely filed his notice of appeal on february.

in reviewing a final decision of the ssa,this court is limited to determining whether the ssa conclusions were supported by substantial evidence in the record and were based on a correct legal standard.talavera astrue,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also g.s ubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether the agency findings were supported by substantial evidence,the reviewing court is required to examine the entire record,including contradictory evidence and evidence from which conflicting inferences can be drawn.mongeur heckler,cir per curiam.we conduct a plenary review of the administrative record,and our focus is on the administrative ruling more than on the district court decision.moran astrue,cir.if there is substantial evidence to support the determination,it must be upheld.see also g.
to be found eligible for disability insurance benefits,an applicant must show that he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d.in evaluating disability claims,the ssa follows a process mandated by the relevant regulations 
first,the commissioner considers whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity.if he is not,the commissioner next considers whether the claimant has a severe impairment which significantly limits his physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.if the claimant suffers such an impairment,the third inquiry is whether,based solely on medical evidence,the claimant has an impairment which is listed in appendix of the regulations.if the claimant has such an impairment,the commissioner will consider him per se disabled assuming the claimant does not have a listed impairment,the fourth inquiry is whether,despite the claimant severe impairment,he has the residual functional capacity to perform his past work.finally,if the claimant is unable to perform his past work,the commissioner then determines whether there is other work which the claimant could perform.

selian first argues that the alj erred in concluding that selian fibromyalgia was not a medically determinable impairment.specifically,selian contends that the alj improperly disregarded the diagnosis of selian treating physician,mark corey improperly substituted her own medical judgments and confused and misstated the medical evidence.we agree.
the record indicates that corey diagnosed selian with fibromyalgia.the opinion of a treating physician on the nature or severity of a claimant impairments is binding if it is supported by medical evidence and not contradicted by substantial evidence in the record.burgess astrue,cir green younger barnhart,cir holding alj erred in not giving treating physician diagnosis of fibromyalgia controlling weight c noting that treating physicians offer a unique perspective to the medical evidence that can not otherwise be obtained from the record.in order to override the opinion of the treating physician,we have held that the alj must explicitly consider,inter alia the frequently,length,nature,and extent of treatment the amount of medical evidence supporting the opinion the consistency of the opinion with the remaining medical evidence and whether the physician is a specialist.burgess,at.
the alj erred in its treatment of corey opinion in several respects.first,she misconstrued the record.for example,she quoted a portion of corey medical notes where he wrote that selian response to prednisone was not suggestive of fibromyalgia as evidence that selian did not suffer from the disorder.but this ignored the context of the notation.corey full notes stated that selian response to prednisone is curious and not suggestive of fibromyalgia although he clinically appears to have it advised strongly to see rheumatology.admin.emphasis added.the alj made no effort to reconcile this apparent inconsistency.similarly,the alj concluded that corey diagnosis of fibromyalgia differed from dura diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome,without explaining why she concluded that the diagnoses were different.this failure was especially problematic considering that dura letter appears to concur with corey diagnosis.see balsamo chater,cir holding alj may not arbitrarily substitute her own judgment for competent medical opinion internal quotation marks omitted see also valet astrue,cv kam,wl,using the terms fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia syndrome interchangeably.
moreover,instead of addressing corey diagnosis on its merits in accord with burgess,the alj credited the findings of naughten over corey views,even though naughten performed only one consultative examination and this examination occurred before corey suspected that selian might have been suffering from fibromyalgia.we have previously cautioned that aljs should not rely heavily on the findings of consultative physicians after a single examination.see cruz sullivan,cir.again,the alj made no effort to reconcile the contradiction or grapple with corey diagnosis.the failure to provide good reasons for not crediting corey diagnosis by itself warrants remand.snell apfel,cir see c.
additionally,the alj improperly substituted her own criteria as to what is necessary to establish a fibromyalgia diagnosis without support from medical testimony.she concluded that n one of the other symptoms associated with fibromyalgia such as sleep,gastrointestinal issues,have been documented so as to warrant a diagnosis consistent with accepted medical practice
