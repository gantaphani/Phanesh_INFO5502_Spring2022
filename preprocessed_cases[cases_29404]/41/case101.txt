the issue in each of these consolidated cases is the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim for failure to accommodate an employee disability as required by title i of the americans with disabilities act ada,and of the rehabilitation act.the district court dismissed each under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.we vacate and remand.
it takes nimble footwork to reach that exact issue.the appellants in these suits,israel sepúlveda and marta velázquez,are public school teachers in ponce,puerto rico.the appellees are the puerto rico department of education its secretary,rafael aragunde and the school director and appellants supervisor,alexis oliveras.aragunde is sued in his official capacity oliveras is sued in his personal capacity.
the appellants claims and the district court resolution of them are largely similar,but differ somewhat in the details.sepúlveda alleged that he suffered a stroke while teaching and required heart surgery.the nature of his continuing impairment is unclear,but he claims that his doctor ordered him to apply for accommodations upon his return to work.the provision of a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability is required by.see also definition of disability definitions of qualified individual with a disability and reasonable accommodation.for five school years the school made accommodations for sepúlveda,providing him a classroom on the first floor,a reduced class size of pupils most years,and at least for some years a rest period things changed in the year,after the secretary had issued instructions to keep class size at a minimum of.allegedly as a consequence,the school director enlarged sepúlveda class to,but provided a neophyte teacher to share the duties.
sepúlveda claims that the new arrangement is an unreasonable refusal to accommodate,resulting in emotional consequences with physical symptoms requiring treatment,and he seeks monetary and equitable relief.his citation to legal authority is vague,but the district court understood him to raise claims of unlawful discrimination under title i of the ada,prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by employers title ii of the ada,same,by government entities of the rehabilitation act,same,by recipients of public funding and title vii of the civil rights act of,et prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sex,race,religion,national origin.the district court dismissed all claims of personal liability against the school director,oliveras and all title vii claims.it dismissed the ada title i claim for failure to allege how the smaller class size would allow sepúlveda to go on teaching and the rehabilitation act claim for the same reason.the court cited its ruling in a prior case to hold that title ii of the ada did not reach claims and in the alternative rejected the title ii claim on the same grounds invoked for title i.with all federal claims gone,the court also dismissed without prejudice claims brought under the puerto rico civil code,for which supplemental jurisdiction was sought.
velázquez alleges that she suffers from a throat condition known as aphonia,with symptoms including excessive coughing and shortness of breath,which was allegedly aggravated by dust and debris stemming from construction at the school some years ago.also on doctor orders,she sought accommodations for her disability and for school years was provided with accommodations virtually identical to sepúlveda,although her maximum class size was generally rather than.when the secretary instructions were circulated,her class size,too,was increased up to thirty students,without a team teacher,and she,too,alleges that ensuing emotional and physical stress required treatment.she seeks equitable relief and damages,in pleadings the district court read to raise the same claims it found sepúlveda did.here,again,the court dismissed the personal liability claims,all claims under title vii,and the title ii claim on the ground that the title does not refer to employment discrimination this time providing no alternative basis.here,though,the court addressed the appellees sovereign immunity defense,which it had not reached in sepúlveda case.the court sustained the defense,dismissing the title i claim against the department in toto and against the secretary insofar as velázquez sought monetary damages.that left the title i claim for equitable relief against the secretary,on the theory of ex parte young,which the court dismissed for the same reason given in the other case,a failure to allege in the pleadings how the pupil size accommodation requested would enable her to teach but the larger class size would not.the rehabilitation act claim,as before,went the way of that under title i,and supplemental jurisdiction over actions under the civil code was again declined without prejudice.
the briefs for the appealing plaintiffs primarily address the district court failure to apply properly the standard of review under rule b,and do not take issue with any of its conclusions of statutory interpretation or immunity from suit.we thus infer that all claims of error are waived,except as to the sufficiency of allegations as stating claims that the department and its secretary are responsible under title i or of the rehabilitation act for failures to make reasonable accommodations for disabilities.while it is true that both appellants briefs do refer to their title ii pleadings,they go no further than paraphrasing the statutory text and neglect to address the district court ruling that title ii does not cover employment discrimination.such passing and conclusory references are inadequate to press an issue on appeal.
the statement of a claim of actionable failure to make reasonable employment accommodation for disability under either title i of the ada or of the rehabilitation act must allege a disability covered by the statute,the ability of the plaintiff to do a job with or without accommodation as the case may be,and the refusal of the employer,despite knowledge of the disability,to accommodate the disability by reasonably varying the standard conditions of employment.enica principi,cir.the district court found the allegations deficient with respect to the third element

we think that the district court demanded more than plausibility.each set of pleadings includes two significant sets of allegations.first,for a period of four or five school years the school administration provided the reduced class size in response to the respective plaintiff request,supported by some sort of medical certification attesting to its legitimacy.in each complaint,those years of requested accommodation are put forward as establishing,in effect,a of adequacy under the statute in response to an implicit acknowledgment that a statutory disability required the provisions that were made 
second,each set of pleadings describes changed facts beginning in the year,in which instructions from the defendant secretary resulted in raising the class size to with a young team teacher to share the load with sepúlved
