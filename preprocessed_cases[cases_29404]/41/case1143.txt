in this appeal,defendant,humana military healthcare services,appeals the district court order finding defendant liable to plaintiffs,baptist physician hospital organization,and baptist hospital of east tennessee,for breach of contract and awarding plaintiffs in compensatory damages,as well as in prejudgment interest.plaintiffs properly invoke diversity of citizenship as the basis for federal jurisdiction in this case.see.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order.
background 
this tennessee breach of contract suit was previously before this court.see baptist physician hosp,humana military healthcare,cir hereinafter baptist physician i.that appeal arose when the district court granted summary judgment to defendant on plaintiffs breach of contract claim,and separately dismissed plaintiffs remaining claims as untimely.on appeal,this court reversed and remanded.
baptist physician i aptly set forth background relevant to the initial contract between the parties 
pursuant to authority delegated to it by congress,the department of defense established the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed services,called champus,in.champus beneficiaries include retired armed forces personnel and dependents of both active and retired military personnel.in,the department of defense established tricare,a managed health care program operating as a supplement to champus and involving the competitive selection of private contractors to financially underwrite the delivery of health care services under champus.the overall goal of the tricare program is to improve the quality,cost,and accessibility of healthcare to the nation military through the mechanism of a managed care program,and one aspect of the new tricare program was the establishment of civilian preferred provider networks.see p.tricare management activity,which was previously known as office of champus,is the government office charged with the responsibility of administering.
in january,humana military healthcare services,was awarded the tricare contract for regions and,which covers seven states and includes the state of tennessee.under the contract,humana became the managed care support contractor charged with the responsibility of establishing and managing a civilian preferred provider network throughout the seven state area.humana established the preferred provider network by entering into contractual arrangements with individual champus participating providers of medical services,one of which was baptist.broadly speaking,tricare preferred network providers agreed to accept from a managed care support contractor lower reimbursement rates than those authorized under the champus reimbursement system,with the understanding that in exchange they would see an increase in directed volume.these discounted rates might be expressed as discounts from the maximum allowable rate under the champus diagnostic grouping system drg,or as a fixed per diem rate,or as some other rate of reimbursement.
in the early spring of,baptist physician hospital organization,and baptist hospital of east tennessee,or more simply baptist,entered into negotiations with humana to become a tricare preferred network provider.
baptist physician i,at.
at trial,the parties presented a more detailed picture of their relationship preceding,during,and subsequent to executing the letter of agreement hereinafter agreement,by which plaintiffs contracted to provide care to tricare beneficiaries in defendant network on august,defendant director of network development,richard mancini mancini,signed the agreement on defendant behalf.therein,defendant contracted to reimburse plaintiffs according to the terms of a hospital payment arrangement.as the court in baptist physician i explained,the parties adopted 
a system of discounted reimbursement from the champus rates depending on the number of other tricare providers in the area t he hospital payment arrangement was expressed as a percentage discount off the champus drg reimbursement rate with a stop loss provision in the italicized language below consisting of an increased rate of payment for certain inpatient claims as an alternative to a percentage discount from standard government rates.the purpose of the provision is to reduce the risk of losses to baptist in large individual cases that baptist believed the percentage discount off champus drg rates would create.the contractual provision was expressed as follows 
baptist health system as exclusive provider 
discount from champus drg rates any case with provider charges greater than,reverting to a discount from provider charges.
outpatient 
discount from champus allowables.
baptist health system additional provider 
discount from champus drg rates any case with provider charges greater than,reverting to a discount from provider charges.
outpatient 
discount from champus allowables.
baptist health system additional providers 
discount from champus drg rates any case with provider charges greater than,reverting to a discount from provider charges.
outpatient 
discount from champus allowables.
emphasis added.under each tier,baptist and humana agreed to the stop loss language which increased reimbursement to baptist when a particular inpatient hospital stay exceeded a certain dollar amount.in such cases,the reimbursement rate would not be a percentage discount off the champus drg rate,but rather would revert to a percentage discount off the provider charges,which are the charges the hospital would otherwise charge for the services rendered.
an example illustrates how the stop loss provision would work.suppose a certain hospital stay resulted in provider charges of,but the maximum champus drg reimbursement rate for this particular stay is only.without the stop loss provision,baptist as the exclusive tricare provider under the above agreement would receive,which represents a discount from the champus drg rate and an effective discount from provider charges.under the stop loss provision,however,baptist would receive,or a discount from the provider charges.in effect,the stop loss provision operates to increase the net overall discount for the business associated with the tricare program.
as illustrated above,for certain claims the reimbursement amount calculated as a percentage of provider charges was greater than of the champus drg rate.
baptist physician i,at.at the time he signed the agreement,mancini knew defendant had no intention of paying the stop loss claims pursuant to the agreement inasmuch as they exceeded champus allowable charges.
two days after he executed the agreement,in an august,letter to plaintiffs representative,jim goodloe,mancini wrote as follows 
jim,as we move toward the next round of negotiations,specifically inpatient per diem rates,i want to make sure we both understand that your claims will be paid according to a discount from government allowables.i know there has been some question that you wanted to be paid more than the government provides,but we are allowed to pay your facilities any greater than the rate.accordingly,the per diem rates that we agree upon will need to be comparable as provided for in paragraph m of our contract.
baptist physician hosp,humana military healthcare,d,hereinafter baptist physician ii.the district court found that this letter concerned physician reimbursement terms,and not the stop loss provisions 
the agreement contemplated additional negotiations in september to establish a system of reimbursement on a per diem basis and,at trial,mancini testified that he believed that the parties would have dispensed with the stop loss provisions at that time.no subsequent renegotiation occurred,and the stop loss provisions remained in effect throughout the life of the agreement.mancini further testified that defendant did not pursue renegotiation because the process would have clarified that defendant intended to cap payments at government allowables,and not to pay according to the agreement.
in august,plaintiffs lacked the personnel and technology necessary to closely monitor payments from third party payors,including defendant,to insure payment of submitted claims according to negotiated contract terms.however,over the course of the agreement with defendant,plaintiffs took steps to improve claims tracking.to start,plaintiffs purchased software called pcms capable of auditing payments and exposing payment variances.this software required plaintiffs to load their contracts into the system before it could adequately monitor payment compliance.plaintiffs also hired a contract analyst,anahita hodge hodge,primarily assigning her to scrutinize payments from third party payors.ultimately,plaintiffs loaded their contract with defendant into the pcms system in november.
in early,hodge identified the underpaid stop loss claims and,in february,requested that defendant reprocess the claims in compliance with the terms of the agreement.in a july,letter to defendant government benefits administrator,hodge again requested the additional stop loss reimbursement.subsequently,hodge spoke to carmen montanez montanez,then one of defendant employees,who informed her that defendant would not pay the full stop loss amount on the contested claims.during the conversation,montanez cited the policies and procedures and told hodge that those policies foreclosed defendant from paying rates in excess of the champus.in the months that followed,plaintiffs at no point communicated to defendant an intent to drop the stop loss claims.ultimately,defendant sent plaintiffs a letter on february,notifying plaintiffs that it was exercising its right to terminate the agreement,effective may.defendant terminated the agreement due to plaintiffs continued insistence that they be reimbursed according to the agreement stop loss provisions.
between july,and may,life of the inpatient claims for medical care rendered at plaintiffs facilities exceeded the stop loss threshold.in each instance,plaintiffs did not receive reimbursement according to the stop loss provisions.rather,without plaintiffs knowledge,defendant capped reimbursement at of the champus.applying the stop loss provisions of the agreement,plaintiffs should have received in payment of those claims.in actuality,defendant paid only,thus yielding an underpayment of on the stop loss claims 
the district court considered several issues at trial on remand,including whether the parties modified the agreement so that claims would be paid under the champus payment system as opposed to the stop loss provisions whether plaintiffs waived their claims whether equitable doctrines barred plaintiffs claims and whether defendant was entitled to recover alleged overpayments on outpatient claims.ultimately,the district court ruled in favor of plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim,and against defendant on its defenses of modification,estoppel,failure to mitigate damages,and laches.the district court further found that defendant failed to prove damages,a required element of its counterclaim.in an opinion dated february,the district court awarded plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim,along with prejudgment interest totaling.defendant timely appealed.
discussion 
i.the district court did not err in deeming capital reimbursement evidence irrelevant 
as a matter of law,the district court concluded that t he monies paid to plaintiffs pursuant to capital reimbursements are totally irrelevant to the agreement at issue,would have been paid with or without an agreement between the parties,and were not paid pursuant to the agreement.baptist physician ii,d at.defendant vehemently disagrees and,in fact,rests the weight of its appeal on this very question.because the district court disposition does not elucidate the rationale underlying its conclusion that capital payment evidence was irrelevant,we review the matter de novo as a conclusion of law kalamazoo river study group,at.
the relevance of the proffered capital payment evidence substantially turns on a question of regulatory interpretation.that is,whether capital payments flow only to those preferred network providers subject to the payment system,or whether providers which contract for alternative payment methodologies may also receive capital payments consistent with the regulations.as a corollary,we must also consider the significance of certifications submitted to obtain capital payments,wherein providers document the total number of inpatient days provided to all patients in units subject to payment,as well as the t otal allowed champus inpatient days provided in units subject to payment.see a iii g vi vii.
as with all matters of regulatory interpretation,we look first to the plain and unambiguous meaning of the regulation,if any.see henry ford health shalala,cir quoting bartlik dep t of labor,cir we read statutes and regulations with an eye to their straightforward and commonsense meanings,and where the regulation language reveals an unambiguous and plain meaning,our task is at an end.defendant fails to identify provisions either in the applicable regulations or the authorizing statutes that plainly sets forth the meaning of the regulations.nor could it,for the regulations do not squarely address this question.
we next look to the regulatory scheme,reading the regulation in its entirety to glean its meaning.in so doing,we find that the regulations do not preclude capital payments to preferred network providers which,by agreement with managed care support mcs contractors,receive reimbursement for inpatient care under alternative payment methodologies.as detailed in the tricare regulations,
t he tricare program implements management improvements primarily through managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers implementation of these management improvements includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed under champus this section establishes those special rules and procedures.
a.while managed care contractors may enter into special arrangements with preferred network providers consistent with the special rules and procedures set forth in the tricare regulations,champus regulations remain effective and applicable to tricare providers unless the special rules and procedures state otherwise.
as champus providers,by default,plaintiffs were entitled to receive capital payments regardless of their agreement with defendant.federal regulations permit all champus providers to receive capital payments to offset the costs of treating champus beneficiaries.see a iii g under,a tricare preferred network provider is not rendered ineligible for capital payments merely because they have negotiated an alternative payment methodology for reimbursement.regulations implementing the tricare program provide that where rules,procedures,rights and obligations under tricare differ from those under champus,those set forth in the tricare regulations take precedence and are binding.a.illustratively,the tricare reimbursement manual the manual cites to as authority for its discussion of capital payments.accordingly,where the tricare regulations do not explicitly conflict with the champus regulations,those regulations apply to tricare as well.
defendant directs our attention to the section of the manual that discusses adjustments to payment amounts,such as capital payments,and,specifically,to the introductory paragraph on applicability.there,the manual states 
this policy is mandatory for reimbursement of services provided by either network or providers.however,alternative network reimbursement methodologies are permitted when approved by tma and specifically included in the network provider agreement.
policy manual,ch,section at i available at at emphasis added the agreement at issue does not specifically include language excepting plaintiffs from the category of providers typically eligible to receive capital payments under the regulations.
in fact,that same section of the manual details the entitlement to,and procedures for payment of,capital costs.more specifically,it establishes the obligations of both the provider and the mcs contractor.in a subpart with the heading negotiated rates,the manual states 
if a contract between the msc prime contractor and a subcontractor or institutional network provider does not specifically state the negotiated rate includes all costs that would otherwise be eligible for additional payment,such as capital and dme,the mcs prime contractor is responsible for reimbursing these costs to the subcontractors and institutional network providers if a request for reimbursement is made.
id.at.available at at emphasis added defendant,as the mcs contractor for its region,negotiated rates with plaintiffs,an institutional network provider consistent with the manual,the agreement could have expressly stipulated that payment at the negotiated rate would incorporate capital payments.the agreement did not make plaintiffs receipt of reimbursement under the stop loss provisions conditional upon forbearance from receipt of capital payments plaintiffs therefore remained entitled to receive capital payments notwithstanding the operation of the negotiated alternative to the rates.
this reading of the regulations is reinforced by the department of defense dod intent in implementing the tricare program.in response to its proposed rule,dod received comments suggesting that the final rule should more specifically detail special reimbursement methods for network providers under p.dod responded 
the rule provides added flexibility to vary payment provisions from those established by regulation,to accommodate local market conditions.to attempt to specify in advance the possible reimbursement approaches would defeat our purpose of providing a flexible mechanism.we also disagree that network rate setting should be the same as under standard champus rules a key aim of managed care programs is to negotiate lower rates of reimbursement with networks of preferred providers.
tricare program uniform hmo benefit special health care delivery programs,at,now codified at.although the parties here did not negotiate lower rates of reimbursement for the stop loss claims,defendant did have increased flexibility in negotiations enabling it to insure access to health care for the tricare beneficiaries in its region.
we additionally note that this result is manifestly consistent in purpose and effect with more traditional champus reimbursement methods,which permit payment of capital costs along with additional payments for outlier cases.a.specifically,the regulations provide reimbursement greater than the standard for cost outliers and for outliers.id.at a iii e ii providing additional payment for a ny discharge which has standardized costs that exceed a n established threshold id.at a iii e i additional payment for a ny discharge which has a los exceeding a threshold established.the additional outlier payment in no way diminishes the provider entitlement to capital payments under the same regulatory provision.id.at a iii g.thus,plaintiffs receipt of both capital payments and inpatient reimbursement under the stop loss provisions runs consistent with the apparent intent of the regulators to appropriately reimburse more costly patient care.
other portions of the regulations demonstrate the dod did not intend to preclude capital payments to providers under special programs,even though they may be reimbursed in excess of government allowable rates.for example,under the supplemental care program,a program related to champus,the military provides payment for health care services rendered at civilian facilities for its active duty members.see a.the regulations implementing the supplemental care program acknowledge that the champus provider reimbursement regulations generally will guide payment and administration of supplemental care claims.c.however,the regulations further establish exceptions and clarifications to the general rule.see d.specifically,the regulations clarify that annual cost for capital costs that are available under the champus payment system are also available,upon request,under the supplemental care program.d.notwithstanding the entitlement to capital payments,that same subsection goes on to clarify that for some providers,payment in excess of champus allowable amounts may be authorized.id.at d.accordingly,the supplemental care program regulations demonstrate that dod contemplated simultaneous entitlement to capital payments and payments exceeding typical champus allowable amounts.
in view of the foregoing,we hold that the regulations authorize capital payments to tricare preferred network providers regardless of the methodology employed to reimburse claims for inpatient it be the system,or some alternative.
we next examine the significance,if any,of the capital payment certifications.because the regulations authorize capital payments for all providers,we find the certifications do not somehow operate to make plaintiffs application for and receipt of capital payments dispositive.defendant would rely on plaintiffs capital payment certifications as evidence of mutuality of assent to modify the agreement.to that end,defendant seizes upon language contained on the capital payment certification forms and in correspondence between plaintiffs and defendant government benefits administrator.the certification forms refer to inpatient days as p rovided in units subject to payment,while the correspondence characterizes capital payments as reimbursement under the champus drg based payment system.see,at,
looking first to the plain language of the regulations,we find that plaintiffs hospitals were subject to the payment system.the champus regulations provide 
ii applicability of the drg system.
b services subject to the payment system.all normally covered inpatient hospital services furnished to champus beneficiaries by hospitals are subject to the champus payment system.
d hospitals subject to the champus payment system.all hospitals within the fifty states which are certified to provide services to champus beneficiaries are subject to the payment system except for hospitals units which are exempt.
a ii d emphasis added.typically,only hospital units exempt from the medicare prospective payment system are exempt from the champus payment system.id.at a ii d.additionally,a ll hospitals subject to the champus payment system may be reimbursed for allowed capital costs by submitting a request to the champus contractor.id.at a iii g.
the capital payment provision of the champus regulations lists the information required in order to verify the appropriate capital payment amount.among this list,the regulation directs providers to submit t otal inpatient days provided to all patients in units subject to payment and t otal allowed champus inpatient days provided in units subject to payment.id.at a iii g vi vii emphasis added.the regulations notably do not define payment.nor do the regulations clarify whether payment in the former context refers collectively to medicare and champus inpatients,to some broader group,or to champus alone 
the manual makes clear,however,that tricare uses the certification forms to insure that it does not pay capital costs for patients whose other primary health insurance fully covered the patient charges.policy manual,ch,section at available at at setting forth the method of calculating capital payment and noting t hroughout these calculations claims on which made no payment because other health insurance paid the full amount are not to be counted.the manual details the steps that providers must follow in determining the total allowable capital payment for drg discharges.id.to begin,providers calculate the total inpatient days.according to the manual,providers should exclude 
any days determined to be not medically necessary,and 
days included on claims for which made no payment because other health insurance paid the full amount.
id.emphasis added.later in the same section,the manual clarifies that tricare will not make capital payments for claims of beneficiaries that were paid by medicare.id.at.f available at at rather,it expressly states that tricare capital cost payments will be made only on claims on which tricare is the primary payer.id.thus,the point of the certification forms is to separate the claims for which serves as the primary payor from those where third parties foot the bill.
as careful review of the regulations makes abundantly clear,the champus regulations were never thoroughly amended following implementation of the tricare program to allow for the possibility that mcs contractors would enter into alternative payment arrangements with health care providers in their networks.in fact,the dod final rule implementing the tricare program proves as much.tricare program uniform hmo benefit special health care delivery programs,at,now codified at our regulatory approach is to leave the existing champus rules largely intact and to create new sections and to describe the tricare program and the uniform hmo benefit.as a result,the claims forms and the capital payment request forms that the regulations require tricare providers to use essentially pound a square peg to a round hole.they simply do not neatly fit together.
furthermore,as a strictly factual matter,defendant proffered capital payment evidence does not tend to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable than it would be otherwise.see.importantly,the agreement at issue remained in effect from august,to may.accordingly,only plaintiffs certifications for purposes of capital payment during fiscal years fy through would even arguably be relevant.in plaintiffs fy submission,they certified t otal inpatient days b ased on discharges within the reporting period.at from,when tricare modified the certification form to request t otal inpatient days p rovided in units subject to payment,plaintiffs certification forms did not set forth a number.at,rather,on each occasion,plaintiffs directed the government benefits administrator to use system data.id.in fy,plaintiffs failed to timely submit certification for capital payments.thus,none of plaintiffs requests for capital payments during the relevant period affirmatively certified that the stop loss claims were subject to payment rather,defendant own government benefits administrator put forth the numbers that included plaintiffs stop loss inpatients.it strikes this court as disingenuous that defendant now seeks to rely on those certifications to establish mutuality of assent to modification of the agreement,and communication of intent to waive its rights under the stop loss provisions.this is particularly so because evidence and postdating the relevant period clearly demonstrates that plaintiffs applied for and received capital payments at times not covered by the agreement.
whether viewed as a legal conclusion or an evidentiary ruling,we affirm the district court view on the significance of capital payment evidence.
ii.additional claims on appeal 
on appeal,defendant challenges several of the district court conclusions of law,alleging plaintiffs application for and acceptance of capital payments effectively modified the contract such that the stop loss claims would be subject to the payment system plaintiffs waived their rights to payment under the stop loss provision and decisively communicated intent to waive by certifying,for purposes of capital payment,that those claims were subject to payment,def.br.at additionally,defendant asserted defenses of equitable estoppel,failure to mitigate,and laches finally,defendant claims the district court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest.
no valid modification occurred 
defendant posits that plaintiffs application for and acceptance of capital payments effectively modified the contract.in defendant view,plaintiffs demonstratively assented to modify the agreement by certifying that the inpatient stop loss claims were subject to the payment system.moreover,defendant contends that the capital payments themselves constitute consideration.the district court concluded that t he evidence did not reveal a meeting of the minds or an exchange of consideration necessary to support defendant claim of modification.baptist physician ii,d at.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.see kalamazoo river study group,at.in doing so,we uphold the district court determination that the parties did not validly modify the agreement.
tennessee substantive law controls in the instant case,as it comes before us on diversity.in tennessee,the parties to an existing contract can modify its terms at any time.bonastia berman.however,an existing contract can not be unilaterally modified.balderacchi ruth.rather,valid modification requires the same mutuality of assent and meeting of the minds as required to make a contract in the first instance.see also prudential,mills.additionally,consideration must be exchanged to effect modification of an existing contract.boyd mccarty.importantly for our purpose today though,p erforming what was already promised in the original contract is not consideration to support a second contract.dunlop tire rubber serv.merch,citing am.fruit growers,hawkinson.
to show mutual assent,defendant relies on the certifications plaintiffs submitted requesting capital payments.we can not agree that the certifications manifest plaintiffs intent to modify the agreement and forego payment under the stop loss provisions therein contained.as previously discussed at length,neither the statute,nor the implementing regulations,nor the policy manual preclude plaintiffs,as preferred network providers,from requesting and receiving capital payments.this is so notwithstanding the operation of an agreement establishing a negotiated rate of reimbursement for inpatient care which exceeds of the.although defendant,and other mcs contractors,can expressly provide that negotiated rates include costs otherwise additionally payable under the statute and regulations,such as capital costs,providers remain eligible to receive such additional payments upon request.see policy manual,ch,section at.available at.
defendant analogizes the instant case to bonastia.there,a company hired the plaintiff as an account manager and by letter conveyed that plaintiff annual salary will be for the next two years.bonastia.at.on his first day of work,the plaintiff signed a document acknowledging that he read and received the company employee handbook and agrees to abide by the policies,procedures,and rules it contains.id.the document continues,however,and clarifies that the employee handbook is not,and is not intended to be,a contract of employment,and that the plaintiff employment is at will.id.nearly a year later,the plaintiff signed yet another copy of the acknowledgment form.id.less than two years after reporting to work,the company terminated the plaintiff,who then sued for breach of an employment contract.id.at.the court in bonastia assumed that the company letter constituted a binding employment contract,but found the second acknowledgment form modified that contract to create an employment arrangement.id.at.
bonastia is not on point.defendant likens plaintiffs capital payment certifications to the acknowledgment form in bonastia.the acknowledgment form indicates an agreement to comply with the policies and procedures of the employee handbook.the capital payment certifications,however,do not reference the regulations,policies,or procedures governing and,even if they did,those regulations and policies comprise a complex federal regulatory scheme devoid of a definition of payment.ambiguously,the phrase units subject to payment appears at two places in the certification under inpatient days and under total inpatient days.see at what is more,the information certified must comport with information submitted in the hospital medicare cost report and payment is a phrase with its origins under the medicare program.thus,unlike the rather straightforward acknowledgment form in bonastia,the signature of which could appropriately be taken to manifest intent,plaintiffs certifications for capital payment in the case at hand can not be employed to demonstrate plaintiffs intent.
at any rate,defendant can not show valid consideration.the agreement did not strip plaintiffs of their entitlement to capital payment,even for the stop loss claims.in making capital payments to plaintiffs,defendant government benefits administrator merely performed consistently with a duty under the agreement and the app
