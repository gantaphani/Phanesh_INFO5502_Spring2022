frank mastera pled guilty in to two counts of unlawful firearm possession.upon the recommendation of the investigation report psi,the sentencing judge determined that mastera fell within the ambit of the armed career criminal act acca,which provides mandatory minimum penalties for defendants with a history of violent felony convictions.the judge determined that mastera had committed the requisite three prior felonies,and accordingly sentenced him to the acca minimum penalty of fifteen years in prison.in addition,prior to sentencing,mastera submitted a request for funds,in the amount of,for an expert psychological evaluation to determine whether he had a diminished capacity that would allow for a reduced sentence.the district court denied this request.
mastera now appeals both the district court decision to sentence him under the acca and that court denial of funds for a psychological evaluation.we find no error,and so affirm.
background 
mastera pled guilty to one count of possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon,in violation of g,and one count of possessing a stolen firearm,in violation of j.the armed career criminal act,which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment,applies to felons convicted of firearm possession under g and who have at least three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.see e.the predicate convictions must be for crimes committed on occasions different from one another.e.
the district court found that mastera had four qualifying convictions one for stalking,one for assault with a dangerous weapon,and two for separate incidents of breaking and entering.mastera concedes that the assault conviction properly counts as an acca predicate.but he contends that there was insufficient evidence for the district court to determine that either of the breaking and entering convictions was a conviction for a violent felony as defined in e b.he also argues that the stalking conviction and one of the breaking and entering convictions derive from conduct committed on the same occasion,and thus can count as only one predicate conviction rather than two.in sum,mastera claims,he had only two predicate convictions,not the requisite three,and thus the district court erred in sentencing him under the acca.
mastera also requested the district court to grant funds for a psychological evaluation to determine if he had a diminished capacity that might qualify him for a reduced sentence,because as a person of limited means,mastera could not afford to pay an expert himself.his submission to the court alleged that he was an alcoholic who suffered from insomnia and racing thoughts and that as a child he had endured abuse.he admitted that he was not on any medication except to treat acid reflux disease.the court denied mastera request,sentencing him to a term,the mandatory minimum under the acca.
ii.discussion 
mastera appeals both the district court determination that he qualified as an armed career criminal and the court denial of funds for a psychological evaluation.we address the two issues in turn 
adjudication under the armed career criminal act 
mastera argues that the district court improperly sentenced him under the acca because there was insufficient evidence to conclude he had the required three predicate violent felony convictions.the district court found that mastera had four such convictions.here,mastera attacks two of those determinations.whether a defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal is a question of law that we review de novo.united states moore,cir.
overlap between paragraphs and 
mastera first claim is that two of his prior convictions,those laid out in paragraphs and of the psi,were erroneously counted as two separate acca predicates instead of as just one.paragraph describes a conviction for breaking and entering in the daytime,and paragraph describes a conviction for stalking both convictions were in the crime of stalking undoubtedly satisfies the acca definition of a violent felony because it has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,e,and mastera does not argue otherwise he contends,however,that it was improper to count his paragraph and convictions as two separate acca predicates,because the two convictions do not arise from acts committed on occasions different from one another as required by e.the breaking and entering,the argument goes,was part of the same course of conduct that made up the stalking charge,and since massachusetts law defines the crime of stalking to require multiple acts,the occasion underlying the stalking encompasses,and thus is not different from,the occasion underlying the breaking and entering.whether two crimes occurred on separate occasions within the meaning of the acca requires a examination of the totality of the circumstances.united states stearns,cir.
mastera correctly asserts that,under massachusetts law,stalking requires a pattern of conduct or series of acts.see.laws ann.ch,see also commonwealth alphas,stalking by following requires more than two incidents of following commonwealth kwiatkowski,stalking by harassment requires more than two incidents of harassment.
the record does not indicate that the september breaking and entering was one of the incidents composing the stalking charge of which mastera was convicted in.because there is no evidence that the acts underlying paragraph also underlie paragraph,we need not decide what outcome that situation would require.mastera has offered evidence only that the two crimes took place on consecutive days and had the same victim.neither of these facts necessarily prevents a finding that the crimes occurred on separate occasions,see stearns,at,and in fact the record suggests that the breaking and entering had an endpoint,after which any subsequent crimes would be considered separate.see id.the district court did not err in concluding that the breaking and entering offense and the stalking offense occurred on two separate occasions and that each could be counted as a separate acca predicate conviction.
breaking and entering in the daytime paragraph 
mastera next raises a challenge to the validity of paragraph as an acca predicate conviction.he admits that he was convicted and sentenced in on one count of breaking and entering in the daytime with intent to commit a misdemeanor.he argues,however,that under the supreme court recent decision in shepard united states,d,there was insufficient evidence to allow the district court to conclude that this breaking and entering qualified as a violent felony under the acca 
legal background 
the acca includes burglary in its enumeration of qualifying violent felonies.e b i.however,the crime of burglary does not have the same elements in every jurisdiction.to clear up potential confusion and ensure consistent application of the acca across state lines,the supreme court has read the acca definition of burglary to refer to what we called generic burglary,an unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or structure,with intent to commit a crime.shepard.at quoting taylor united states,d.this generic definition,which is limited to burglary of a building,is narrower than the crime as defined by some states,which define burglary more broadly,as by extending it to entries into boats and cars.shepard.at.massachusetts is one of the handful of states with a broader definition of burglary 
because of this inconsistency,in states like massachusetts,a sentencing judge can not necessarily tell,simply from the fact that a defendant has been convicted of burglary,whether that conviction was for breaking and entering into a building in which case it would qualify as an acca predicate or whether the conviction was for breaking and entering into a ship or motor vehicle in which case it would not qualify as an acca predicate.thus,before counting a massachusetts burglary conviction as an acca predicate,a sentencing court must somehow determine that the burglary did,in fact,involve a building.this is because any sentence under the acca must rest on a showing that a prior conviction ne
