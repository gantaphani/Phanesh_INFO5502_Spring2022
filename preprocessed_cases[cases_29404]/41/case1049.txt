james scott,a prisoner who is serving a life sentence,alleges that the defendants,all of them physicians,were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs in connection with his treatment for prostate cancer.defendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to rule b and motions for summary judgment.the district court dismissed scott claims against all defendants.we affirm the district court judgment as to ambani,faghihnia,and sullivan,vacate the judgment as to antonini,and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in march,scott was informed by ambani that he had an elevated antigen psa,indicating a possibility of prostate cancer.ambani performed a biopsy but did not find any cancer.ambani recommended that scott follow up with his regular physician in approximately one year.scott alleges that ambani refused to pursue additional testing for prostate cancer.he also alleges that ambani failed to comply with michigan department of corrections mdoc policy directives requiring him to place scott in a chronic care clinic and to place him on a therapeutic diet.as a result,scott claims that he suffered distress from thinking that he could be dying from cancer and experienced a delay in receiving proper treatment for his condition.ambani also refused to prescribe pain medication to treat scott lower back pain.
scott was transferred to another facility and came under the care of faghihnia from october until february.he alleges that faghihnia was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by denying him an annual health screening in,refusing his requests for additional cancer testing,and denying him lab work at his screening.
scott annual screening in october revealed an elevated psa level.he also complained of pain in his upper thigh and lower back.as a result,he was referred back to ambani for a second biopsy.in january,ambani performed the biopsy which revealed prostate cancer.scott was then referred to sullivan,a radiation oncologist,for treatment.
scott indicated to sullivan that for religious reasons,he did not wish to undergo any treatment which might affect his fertility.sullivan told him that if the cancer was located only in the prostate,he would not receive radiation treatment to his seminal vesicle.scott alleges that additional testing showed that his cancer was confined to the prostate but that,nonetheless,his seminal vesicle was exposed to radiation treatment.
once scott treatment was complete in august,he was referred to antonini to monitor his health for side effects from the radiation.in february,scott reported to antonini that he was in great pain and had developed a hard testicular lump.antonini denied scott request to refer him back to sullivan and also refused to prescribe pain medication.instead,antonini referred him to another doctor for a colonoscopy.
in may,scott saw a nurse because he had a lump on his eyelid and was still in great pain from his testicular lump.the nurse communicated scott problems to antonini,but he said that he did not have time to examine scott.his pain eventually dissipated.
in june,scott underwent a colonoscopy.the colonoscopy indicated that his previous pain was the result of radiological side effects from cancer treatment.in august,antonini examined scott testicular lump and ordered an ultrasound.the ultrasound indicated that the lump was a cyst that had burst.
scott filed his complaint in january.the defendants are named in their individual and official capacities and,with the exception of sullivan,were employed by or under contract with mdoc.sullivan was employed by the university of michigan.
the district court granted faghihnia and antonini motion to dismiss,sullivan motion for summary judgment,and ambani motion to dismiss.
standard of review 
this court uses a de novo standard when reviewing a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to either rule b or rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.see kottmyer maas,cir ciminillo streicher,cir.
in reviewing a dismissal under rule b,all allegations in the complaint should be taken as true,and the complaint is to be construed liberally in favor of the party opposing the motion to dismiss.westlake lucas,cir davis elliot caribbean utils,cir.dismissals of complaints under the civil rights statutes are scrutinized with special care.westlake,at.
discussion 
in dismissing scott deliberate indifference claim against ambani,the district court concluded that the claim arose in and was,therefore,untimely.scott does not challenge the conclusion that whatever events occurred in are barred by the statute of limitations.instead,he challenges the district court conclusion that the complaint did not contain an allegation that ambani denied scott pain medication in.
both parties agree that scott claims are subject to a statute of limitations.see.comp.laws wolfe perry,cir applying michigan statute of limitations to a claim.in actions brought under,the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury that is the basis of the action.kelly burks,cir.a plaintiff has reason to know of his injury when he should have discovered it through the exercise of reasonable diligence.sevier turner,cir.
the district court correctly concluded that scott claim against ambani accrued in,and is therefore untimely.in,ambani refused scott requests for further cancer testing and for therapeutic treatment.according to the complaint,it was this denial which caused scott to experience mental and emotional distress regarding the uncertainty of his diagnosis.this mental and emotional distress forms the basis of scott claim against ambani,and scott was aware of this distress at or very near the time in which ambani refused scott requests.similarly,ambani alleged failure to comply with prison procedures requiring scott to be placed in a chronic care program due to his elevated psa level should reasonably have been known to scott at or near the time of the denial.see hermansen schickel,cir concluding that prisoner cause of action for deliberate indifference accrued on the date that he was denied medical care,even though the full extent of his injury was not known until later.
scott argues that the district court erred when it concluded that the complaint failed to allege that ambani denied scott pain medication in.his argument is without merit.in the section of the complaint entitled facts,scott lays out the events surrounding his encounter with ambani in march.scott alleges that ambani denied his requests for additional cancer testing,refused to place scott in a chronic care program,denied scott request to be placed on a therapeutic diet,and refused to prescribe pain medication for scott lower back and upper thigh pain.
the complaint also states that in january,ambani performed a second biopsy and in february,referred scott to sullivan for treatment.nowhere in the discussion of the second biopsy or in the discussion of the referral does scott mention either requesting pain medication or being refused pain medication by ambani in.
in a section of the complaint titled,cause of action,count i,scott makes his deliberate indifference claim against ambani.scott alleges that ambani was deliberately indifferent to scott medical needs by denying his requests for additional cancer testing and refusing to prescribe pain medication for scott lower back and upper thigh pain.the only allegation made by scott regarding ambani refusal to prescribe pain medication alleges that the refusal occurred in march.therefore,scott deliberate indifference claim,insofar as it is based upon ambani refusal to prescribe pain medication,must be referring to the refusal which allegedly occurred in march.
since scott claim against ambani accrued in,it should have been brought by in order to comply with the statute of limitations.scott filed the complaint in.therefore,the claim is untimely.
the district court granted faghihnia motion to dismiss on the basis that scott failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.scott filed a grievance against faghihnia contending that faghihnia violated the eighth amendment by failing to give scott an annual hea
