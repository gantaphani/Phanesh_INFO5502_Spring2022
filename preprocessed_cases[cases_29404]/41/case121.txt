diclerico,district judge.
following the death of their son at bridgewater state hospital bsh,william and carolyn mosher the moshers brought a civil rights action,with related state law claims,against kenneth nelson,superintendent of bsh kathleen dennehy,commissioner of the department of corrections and elizabeth childs,commissioner of the department of mental health the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.the moshers appeal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
bsh is a facility,operated by the massachusetts department of corrections,that serves as both a prison and a mental hospital.most of the patients at bsh have histories of violence in addition to mental illness.kenneth nelson served as superintendent of bsh from until april of.as commissioner of the department of corrections,kathleen dennehy was the chief executive officer of the department,but she did not have any direct supervisory role at bsh.nelson,instead,reported to an assistant deputy commissioner in the department of corrections.elizabeth childs,who was commissioner of the department of mental health,had no role at bsh except to approve the appointment of a medical director at that facility 
the moshers son,william mosher,was a pretrial detainee at the middlesex county jail in july of,when he was sent to bsh for a observation period.after he assaulted a nurse,mosher was held in the intensive treatment unit at bsh until he was moved to max,one of the maximum security units.his observation period was extended from thirty days to six months.
in,max was located in a secure building that included individual patient rooms and common areas.patients in max were not allowed to stay in their rooms during the day,except during patient count,because the rooms could shield patients from the observation of the staff,leading to a concern about suicide.an exception to that rule was a practice that allowed patients to remain in their rooms and visit in other patients rooms for a short period from the end of the morning count,at approximately,until lunch.on august,during the period between the end of the morning count and lunch,william mosher,went into the room of his neighbor,bradley burns.while mosher was there,burns strangled him to death with a tee shirt.no one previously had been killed at bsh,and no prior violent incidents had been reported to have occurred during the visiting period between the end of morning count and lunch.after mosher death,bsh ended the visiting practice.at the time burns killed mosher,nelson did not know who burns was,although he was aware of mosher because of his prior attack on a nurse.
william and carolyn mosher brought claims under against the defendants in their individual capacities,alleging that the defendants conduct constituted cruel and unusual punishment of their son,resulting in his death,and that the defendants conspired to perpetuate the challenged conditions of confinement.the moshers also alleged conspiracies to deprive their son of constitutional rights under and.they further alleged state law claims for damages against the defendants in their official capacities.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding that the evidence was insufficient to prove the moshers constitutional claims,that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the constitutional claims,and that the state law claims were barred by the eleventh amendment.the moshers appeal the summary judgment decision.
on appeal,the court reviews the district court decision granting summary judgment under the de novo standard.sullivan city of springfield,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the party seeking summary judgment must first demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact in the record.see celotex catrett,d.a party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment must present competent evidence of record that shows a genuine issue for trial.see anderson liberty lobby,d.all reasonable inferences and all credibility issues are resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.see id.at.
the moshers argue that summary judgment was not appropriate because a factual dispute exists as to whether nelson knew of and disregarded the substantial danger to patients in max during the morning visiting period and whether dennehy ignored complaints about insufficient staffing and security at bsh.the moshers also argue that nelson and dennehy were not entitled to qualified immunity and that eleventh amendment immunity does not apply because their state law claims could be construed to arise under title ii of the americans with disabilities act.the defendants argue in support of the district court decision on the civil rights claims and the application of the eleventh amendment to the moshers state law claims.we begin with a consideration of qualified immunity,which resolves the moshers civil rights claims.
qualified immunity 
qualified immunity is a construct that broadly protects public officials from the threat of litigation arising out of their performance of discretionary functions.bergeron cabral,cir.the qualified immunity analysis generally follows a process of deciding whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and if so,whether the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant alleged violation.maldonado fontanes,cir.recently,the supreme court gave courts discretion to address the clearly established step without first determining whether a constitutional right had been violated.pearson callahan,d.in the exercise of our discretion,we will use that procedure in this case.
the clearly established step is itself composed of two parts,which require the court to decide whether the contours of the right were sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right,and whether in the specific context of the case,a reasonable defendant would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights.maldonado,at internal quotation marks omitted.the first part addresses the status of the law at the time of the event in question,focusing on the clarity of the standard with respect to the asserted constitutional right.id.the second part addresses the specific factual context of the case to determine whether a reasonable official in the defendant place would have understood that his conduct violated the asserted constitutional right.id.to be liable,an official must be on notice that his conduct violates established law.hope pelzer,d.
status of the law 
clearly established law does not depend on identical circumstances repeating themselves.instead,notable factual differences may exist between prior cases and the circumstances at hand as long as the state of the law at the time gave the defendant fair warning that his action or inaction was unconstitutional.accord safford unified sch.dist.redding,d.in an area of the law that is continuing to evolve,there will be a range extending from an established core to outer boundaries where there is not clearly established law.see demayo nugent,cir.the law is considered clearly established either if courts have previously ruled that materially similar conduct was unconstitutional,or if a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law applies with obvious clarity to the specific conduct at issue,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has established a general constitutional standard that a prison official deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the eighth amendment.farmer brennan,d accord,cir an inmate may sue a correctional facility under the eighth amendment for failure to afford adequate protection to inmates from attack by other inmates.prison officials have a constitutional duty not to be deliberately indifferent to the ri
