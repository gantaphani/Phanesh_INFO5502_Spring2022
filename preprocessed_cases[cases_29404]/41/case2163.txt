plaintiffs in this antitrust suit are a group of hospitals and other health care providers that purchased pulse oximetry sensors from tyco healthcare group lp after november.they allege that they overpaid for the sensors because tyco used two kinds of marketing agreements to foreclose competition from generic sensor manufacturers in violation of section of the sherman act.they also allege that by introducing oximax,a patented pulse oximetry system that is incompatible with generic sensors,tyco unlawfully maintained its monopoly over the sensor market in violation of section of the sherman act.
the district court denied plaintiffs motion for class certification and later granted tyco motion for summary judgment on the section and claims.we agree with the district court that tyco agreements do not violate section there is no evidence that they foreclosed competition in a substantial share of the sensor market.we also agree that there is no section violation the undisputed evidence shows that the patented oximax design is an improvement over the previous design.innovation does not violate the antitrust laws on its own,and there is no evidence that tyco used its monopoly power to force customers to adopt its new product.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment on the merits and have no need to reach the class certification issue.
background 
the pulse oximetry products at issue in this litigation include sensors and monitors.sensors attach to a patient body.a monitor receives and interprets the signal from a sensor and then displays the patient level of blood oxygenation.monitors measure only blood oxygenation.monitors measure various patient diagnostics in addition to blood oxygenation.monitors are more expensive than sensors on a unit basis,but the volume of sensor sales is much larger than the volume of monitor sales.
tyco was an early entrant in the pulse oximetry market and was able to establish an installed base of monitors greatly exceeding that of its competitors.its technology was initially protected by its patent,which prevented competitors from selling sensors compatible with its installed base of monitors.tyco anticipated that upon expiration of the patent in november,competitors would begin to produce generic sensors compatible with its installed base of monitors.it thus set about creating a new proprietary oximetry technology.
tyco plan matured into what became known as the oximax strategy.tyco created a new patented sensor design that contained a writable memory chip.moving the digital memory chip from the monitor to the sensor allowed tyco to add new features to the oximax sensors,such as the ability to store the patient oxygen saturation history in the sensor itself the sensor event reporting feature and the ability to inform a physician of possible causes of and solutions for signal interruption the sensor messaging feature.
the digital memory chip also allowed tyco to move essential calibration coefficients from the monitors into the sensors themselves.because the new oximax monitors do not contain any calibration coefficients,they are incompatible with generic sensors.however,oximax monitors are compatible with new types of sensors that tyco develops.previously,when tyco introduced a new sensor,customers either had to buy a new monitor or reprogram their entire installed base of and multiparameter monitors with the appropriate calibration coefficients.with the oximax system,customers can adopt new types of sensors without affecting their installed base of monitors because the necessary coefficients are contained in the sensors themselves.this reduces costs for customers and frees sensor designers from having to use the predefined coefficients programmed into the installed base of monitors.moving the calibration coefficients into the sensors therefore facilitates the development and introduction of new types of sensors.
for example,tyco developed the adhesive forehead sensor for use with the oximax system.according to tyco,the sensor has a more efficient and spectrally different light emitting diode than previous versions of the sensor.because the sensor is calibrated specifically for use on the forehead,its calibration differs from the existing rcal curve set,and consequently it can only be used with the new oximax system.
tyco launched oximax in march and notified equipment manufacturers that all remaining boards were being discontinued in february.it used two kinds of marketing agreements to help sell the oximax system discount agreements and agreements.discount agreements allowed customers,typically small hospitals or groups of small hospitals,to purchase tyco products at discounts off list prices if they committed to purchase some minimum percentage of their pulse oximetry product requirements from tyco.the greater the percentage of the customer requirements purchased from tyco,the greater the discount tyco gave.the agreements did not contractually obligate tyco customers to buy anything from tyco.the only consequence of purchasing less than the agreed upon percentage of tyco products was loss of the negotiated discounts.
agreements existed between tyco and group purchasing organizations or gpos.gpos are consortiums of healthcare providers that negotiate purchasing contracts with healthcare equipment vendors,like tyco.members of a gpo may purchase equipment from a vendor at negotiated prices.under tyco agreements,a gpo agreed that it would not enter into a purchasing contract with any other vendor of pulse oximetry products,and tyco in return offered a deeper discount.like tyco discount agreements,the agreements at issue here did not contractually obligate gpo members to purchase anything from tyco.
after expiration of tyco patent in november,a number of companies,including masimo and ge,began manufacturing generic sensors.masimo planned to price its generic sensors between and each.ge priced its sensors at.in contrast,the average price for tyco branded sensors was just over.by march of,tyco estimated that of the installed base of monitors and of the installed base of multiparameter monitors used oximax technology.from to,tyco share of pulse oximetry monitor sales in the was between and.in,its market share dropped to.in october,masimo estimated that its share of new monitor sales in the was roughly to.
plaintiffs brought this suit alleging that tyco introduction of oximax and its use of discount and agreements violate sections and of the sherman act.the district judge granted tyco motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs claims.the court held that tyco discount agreements and agreements did not create an unreasonable restraint on trade under section because hospitals commitments under the agreements were voluntary and could be ended at any time,and hospitals were thus free to switch to more competitively priced generics.it further held that tyco introduction of oximax,both alone and in combination with its other business practices,was not unreasonably restrictive of competition under section.the oximax design was a superior and more sophisticated offering than the previous generation system and tyco did nothing to force oximax monitors on its customers.plaintiffs timely appealed the district court final judgment.we affirm.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.a district court order granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see padfield aig life ins,cir.summary judgment is proper if the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also universal health,thompson,cir.
tyco discount and agreements did not violate section of the sherman act 
section of the sherman act,prohibits e very contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.plaintiffs premise their section claim on just one theory of liability exclusive dealing.as the district court noted,plaintiffs do not include tyco introduction of oximax within their section claim.they have not advanced any legal theory that tyco used its marketing agreements to tie its sensor sales to sales of its oximax monitors.
exclusive dealing involves an agreement between a vendor and a buyer that prevents the buyer from purchasing a given good from any other vendor.there are economic benefits to exclusive dealing arrangements,including the enhancement of interbrand competition.omega,gilbarco,cir.consequently,an arrangement does not constitute a per se violation of section.twin city sportservice,charles finley,cir.under the antitrust rule of reason,an exclusive dealing arrangement violates section only if its effect is to foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected.omega,at quoting tampa nashville coal,
it is significant that the discount and agreements in this case did not contractually obligate tyco customers to purchase anything from tyco.rather,the agreements provided only for substantial discounts to customers that actually purchased a high percentage of their sensor requirements from tyco.plaintiffs expert,professor frech iii,nevertheless testified that tyco agreements foreclosed a substantial share of the sensor market by providing an incentive as opposed to a requirement for exclusivity.
as the district court correctly observed,frech expert report ignored a key fact compatible generic sensors that cost less than tyco sensors entered the market upon the expiration of the patent.frech opinion did not take that into account.he never explained why hospitals would adhere to tyco agreements when they could purchase less expensive generic sensors instead.he postulated that if a hospital chose to purchase a competitor monitor,that hospital could lose tyco discounts on the sensors it continued to need for its installed base of tyco monitors.nonetheless,even such a hospital could simply begin to purchase less expensive generic sensors for its remaining tyco monitors.we thus agree with the district court that on the facts of this case,something more than the discount itself is necessary to prove that tyco discount agreements forced customers to purchase its sensors rather than generics.
any customer subject to one of tyco discount agreements could choose at anytime to forego the discount offered by tyco and purchase from a generic competitor.the easy terminability of an exclusive dealing arrangement negate s substantially its potential to foreclose competition.omega,at citing roland mach.dresser,cir,and other cases see also xi philip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed.discounts conditioned on exclusivity in relatively contracts are rarely problematic.the discount agreements at issue here did not tyco customers from competition because a competing manufacturer need ed only offer a better product or a better deal to acquire their business.omega,at.
the agreements did not foreclose competition for the same reason.at any time,a gpo member could simply forego the negotiated discounts with tyco and purchase less expensive generics instead.tyco agreement with healthtrust is somewhat more problematic than the others because it prevented its members from belonging to any other gpo.this meant that healthtrust members that decided to purchase pulse oximetry products from vendors other than tyco could not access discounts by joining other gpos.there is no evidence,however,that healthtrust members were unable to access less expensive generic senors through other means.if competitors can reach the ultimate consumers of the product by employing existing or potential alternative channels of distribution,it is unclear whether such restrictions foreclose from competition any part of the relevant market.id.at 
plaintiffs did not present evidence that tyco and contracts foreclosed competition in a substantial share of the market for pulse oximetry sensors.vendors of generic sensors remained able to compete for tyco customers by offering their products at better prices.the agreements therefore did not constitute unreasonable restraints on trade under section.
ii.tyco introduction of oximax did not violate section of the sherman act 
there are three essential elements to a successful claim of section monopolization a the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market b the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power and c causal antitrust injury.cal.computer,int l bus.mach,cir calcomp.for purposes of tyco motion and this appeal,the parties agree that tyco is a monopolist in the pulse oximetry sensor market.the focus of the dispute is whether tyco unlawfully maintained its monopoly power in that market by introducing oximax.
plaintiffs contend that tyco maintained its monopoly by designing its new oximax senors to be compatible with its new oximax monitors and the installed base of monitors,but designing its new oximax monitors to be incompatible with the old sensors and allegedly forcing customers and oems to adopt the new oximax monitors by discontinuing its monitors and implementing other exclusionary business practices.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in rejecting these arguments because it did not balance the benefits of tyco alleged product improvement against its anticompetitive effects.they further argue that the district court impermissibly decided disputed issues of material fact regarding the sufficiency of tyco innovation and the competitive effect of its overall oximax strategy.we agree with the district court.
product improvement alone does not violate section 
section of the sherman act proscribes monopolization it does not render unlawful all monopolies.foremost pro color,eastman kodak,cir.a monopolist,no less than any other competitor,is permitted and indeed encouraged to compete aggressively on the merits,and any success it may achieve solely through the process of invention and innovation is necessarily tolerated by the antitrust laws.id.at quoting berkey photo,eastman kodak co,cir.accordingly,a s a general rule,courts are properly very skeptical about claims that competition has been harmed by a dominant firm product design changes.united states microsoft,d.
however,changes in product design are not immune from antitrust scrutiny and in certain cases may constitute an unlawful means of maintaining a monopoly under section.foremost,at.for example,in united states microsoft,the plaintiffs showed that microsoft harmed competition by integrating its web browser,internet explorer,into the windows operating system.at.microsoft provided no procompetitive justification,id.at,for having integrated internet explorer into windows.having failed to show that its conduct serve d a purpose other than protecting its operating system monopoly,the circuit held that microsoft had violated section of the sherman act.id.at.
in contrast,a design change that improves a product by providing a new benefit to consumers does not violate section absent some associated anticompetitive conduct.see calcomp,at holding that a design change must not be unreasonably restrictive of competition.in calcomp,a manufacturer of peripheral computer devices argued that ibm made design changes on certain of its cpus,disk drives and controllers of no technological advantage and solely for the purpose of frustrating competition from peripheral device manufacturers.id.at.however,there was uncontroverted evidence that ibm changes allowed it to reduce manufacturing costs and prices to the consumer and also improved performance of the product.id.at.we thus held 
ibm,assuming it was a monopolist,had the right to redesign its products to make them more attractive to buyers whether by reason of lower manufacturing cost and price or improved performance.it was under no duty to help calcomp or other peripheral equipment manufacturers survive or expand.ibm need not have provided its rivals with disk products to examine and copy,nor have constricted its product development so as to facilitate sales of rival products.the reasonableness of ibm conduct in this regard did not present a jury issue.
