in,before entered the fourth grade,he was first tested for a learning disability.through this lengthy litigation it has been established that has an auditory processing disorder or a central auditory processing disorder.however,in the fall of and the spring of,school district,the pajaro valley unified school district pvusd tested and determined that,despite his learning disability,was not eligible for special education services.subsequently,as a result of further testing procured by parents,pvusd determined in february that did qualify for special education.shortly thereafter,moved to another school district which also recognized that he qualified for special education.
meanwhile,filed an administrative complaint with the special education division of the california office of administrative hearings.when the administrative law judge alj issued a decision in favor of pvusd,through his parents the plaintiffs,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that had been denied a free and appropriate public education as set forth in the individuals with disabilities education improvement act of idea,et.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of pvusd,plaintiffs appealed,and we issued an opinion affirming in part,reversing in part and remanding.pajaro valley unified sch,cir.on remand the district court again denied plaintiffs any relief and further ruled that central auditory processing disorder could not be considered an other health impairment under the applicable federal and state regulations.see c regs.tit,f 
on this appeal we address three primary issues.first,we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to show that pvusd acted unreasonably in determining in that did not qualify for special education services under the specific learning disability category.see a.second,we conclude that the department of education position that a central auditory processing disorder is eligible for consideration for benefits under the other health impairment category merits deference.finally,we determine that plaintiffs have failed to show that pvusd acted unreasonably in not considering for benefits under the other health impairment category in.accordingly,we affirm the denial of relief to plaintiffs.
pvusd initial assessment of 
enrolled in pvusd as a kindergarten student in.plaintiffs assert that struggled at school and that pvusd should have referred him for a special education assessment as early as december,pursuant to its child find obligation.this provision of the idea requires school districts to identify children with disabilities and to ensure that each child is evaluated and provided appropriate special education services 
in the summer of,before entered the fifth grade,plaintiffs had tested by psychologist roz wright,who administered the weschsler intelligence scale for children ed.and the woodcock johnson tests of achievement iii wisc.wright estimated intelligence quotient iq to be,based on the test.plaintiffs then requested that pvusd evaluate and submitted wright assessment.
in october,pvusd convened a meeting of individualized education program iep team.in addition to wright assessment,the iep team considered the results of additional tests administered by leslie viall,pvusd psychologist.
viall,who had more than fifteen years of experience administering educational assessments of children,testified that she thought the wisc score of was a valid measure of intellectual ability.she stated that in october,she had given the kaufman assessment battery for children test k abc test and that had obtained a higher score of.viall explained that she administered the k abc test because the parents assessor,wright,had recently administered the wisc test and that the same test less than four months later would have produced an invalid score.when the k abc test produced a significantly higher score,viall administered a third intelligence test,the test of nonverbal intelligence toni,on which scored a.because toni score was consistent with his performance on the wisc,rather than the higher score on the k abc,viall determined that was the most reliable measure of intellectual ability.
in,to qualify for special education under the specific learning disability sometimes referred to as sld category in california,a child had to meet three requirements there must be a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement in oral expression,listening comprehension,written expression,basic reading skills,reading comprehension,mathematics calculation,or mathematical reasoning the severe discrepancy must be due to a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes and must not be primarily the result of an environmental,cultural,or economic disadvantage and the discrepancy can not be ameliorated through other regular or categorical services offered within the regular education program.cal.
pvusd determined that had not demonstrated the requisite severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement.the applicable california regulations defined a severe discrepancy as a difference of at least points,adjusted by points,between a child ability and performance.faced with three scores,on the k abc,on the wisc,and on the toni,pvusd opted to use the middle score,on the.lowest standard score in any academic area was on listening comprehension.the discrepancy between and was only points,not sufficient to constitute a severe discrepancy.
plaintiffs initial proceedings before the administrative law judge and the district court 
when pvusd denied special education benefits,plaintiffs filed an administrative complaint with the special education division of the california office of administrative hearings.a hearing was held,and on may,the alj issued a final decision denying plaintiffs any relief.
plaintiffs then commenced this action in the united states district court for the northern district of california.in october,the district court denied for summary judgment and remanded the case to the alj.the alj was asked to set forth more completely his reasoning as to why the wisc test was favored over the k abc,as well as his approach to evaluating all of the quantitative test data in light of the mixed results of that data.
meanwhile,plaintiffs had tested by cheryl jacques,who estimated his iq to be.pvusd then retested for eligibility for special education and found iq to be.this led pvusd to determine in february that was eligible for special education benefits.shortly thereafter,moved to the fullerton joint union high school district,which also determined that he was eligible for special education services.
on remand,the alj again determined that plaintiffs were not entitled to any relief.plaintiffs appealed to the district court.
on august,the district court granted pvusd motion for summary judgment.in doing so,the court first agreed with the alj that viall was credible and her reasoning persuasive the court noted the irony that pvusd relied on the diagnostic score provided by plaintiffs,while plaintiffs claimed that pvusd should have used its own kabc scores.the district court further agreed with the alj that pvusd had administered multiple tests to and had used the totality of the results to arrive at its ultimate determination of ineligibility.
the district court further noted that viewed as a whole,the observational and anecdotal evidence describes a student who was distracted easily but who also responded to various forms of classroom intervention.it opined that had been able to complete assignments and homework on a more consistent basis,it seems likely that he would have been a consistently average to performer.
finally,addressing plaintiffs allegation that pvusd failed to perform assessments with respect to auditory processing,hearing and behavior,the district court commented that at least one auditory processing test was administered by viall,and that pvusd resource specialist conducted the brigance test in both spanish and english as part of the initial assessment,and this test arguably addresses auditory processing through a subtest involving sentence repetition.
plaintiffs initial appeal to the ninth circuit 
plaintiffs appealed,and we issued an opinion affirming in part and reversing in part.pajaro valley unified sch,cir.we recognized that school districts have discretion in selecting the diagnostic tests they use to determine special education eligibility.id.at.noting the different tests used to evaluate,we held that a school district,considering all relevant material available on a pupil,must make a reasonable choice between valid but conflicting test results in determining whether a severe discrepancy exists.id.at.
we did not determine whether pvusd choice was reasonable because we determined that the district court had erred in excluding jacques report id.at.accordingly,the district court was instructed on remand to consider whether jacques report,as well as pvusd assessment of,were relevant to the determination whether pvusd met its obligations to id.
we then held,over a dissent,that plaintiffs had not waived their assertion that the district court should have considered whether auditory processing disorder qualified him for special education as a child with an other health impairment.id.at.we remanded the case to the district court for a determination whether,during all relevant times,pvusd met its affirmative obligation to locate,evaluate,and identify as a child with an other health impairment or a specific learning disability related to his auditory processing disorder.id at.
d.the district court opinion on remand 
on remand,the district court read our opinion as holding that had a disorder in a basic psychological process,specifically,an auditory processing disorder.however,the court found that we had not reached the issue of whether pvusd choice among test scores was reasonable rather we remanded the matter for further consideration of that issue.the district court proceeded to determine whether plaintiffs had shown that there was a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and his achievement.
the district court noted that all agree that lowest academic standard score was.the court then reviewed the three test scores,and concluded that the alj use of the wisc score of,and the consequential finding that there was no severe discrepancy only points difference,were thorough and careful and entitled to deference.the court further conducted its own de novo review of the evidence in the administrative record,and concluded that plaintiffs had not met their burden of showing that it was unreasonable for pvusd to use the wisc test score.
the district court agreed with the alj that the school psychologist testimony was more persuasive than wright perspective because of her experience administrating educational assessments to children and her actual knowledge of the court further found that neither jacques report nor the pvusd assessment of altered its determination that pvusd assessment of was not unreasonable.
turning to the issue of whether could qualify for special education on the basis of having an other health impairment,the district court noted that a i listed nine defined categories such as intellectual disabilities,autism,and specific learning disabilities,and a tenth category described broadly as other health impairment.at the time of the pvusd assessment,other health impairment sometimes referred to as ohi was defined as follows 
other health impairment means having limited strength,vitality or alertness to environmental stimuli,that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational environment,that 
i is due to chronic or acute health problems such as asthma,attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,diabetes,epilepsy,a heart condition,hemophilia,lead poisoning,leukemia,nephritis,rheumatic fever,and sickle cell anemia and 
ii adversely affects a child educational performance.
despite plaintiffs contrary assertion,the district court did not find any decisions by courts or hearing officers specifically holding that auditory processing disorders qualify as ohis.accordingly,the court approached the question as a matter of first impression,using canons of construction.the court determined that specific learning disability and other health impairment concerned two different categories of impairment the district court,noting that the statute included a list,employed the dictionary meaning of other as another,and concluded that because a qualifying auditory processing disorder is a specific learning disability,it necessarily follows that an auditory processing disorder can not at the same time be an other health impairment.the court expressed concern that a contrary finding would render superfluous the requirement of showing severe discrepancy to qualify for benefits under the specific learning disability category 
having concluded that pvusd had reasonably determined that plaintiffs had failed to show a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and academic achievement in,and that auditory processing disorder could not be an other health impairment,the district court granted judgment in favor of pvusd.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
a district court compliance with our mandate is reviewed de novo.united states paul,cir united states kellington,cir.we also review de novo the district court decision that the school district complied with the idea.dep t of education,cir hellgate elementary sch,cir.however,we give due weight to judgments of education policy when reviewing state hearings and must take care to not substitute our own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities we review,at internal quotation marks omitted.although t he extent of deference given to the state hearing officer determination is within our discretion,w e give deference to the state hearing officer findings particularly when,as here,they are thorough and careful.see also union sch.dist.smith,cir.
in,we further reiterated that we review the district court factual determinations for clear error,even when based on the administrative record a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the evidence in the record supports the finding but the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed and the party challenging the district court ruling,bears the burden of proof on appeal.at internal quotation marks omitted.
a.the district court complied with our mandate 
initially,we affirm that the district court order is consistent with our mandate.plaintiffs argue that we had found that had a specific learning disability,that we held that the district court should apply more of a de novo standard of review,and that the alj should not have relied on the testimony of pvusd psychologist.we held that had alleged an auditory processing disorder,but we did not reach the question of whether plaintiffs had shown that had qualified for special education benefits under the specific learning disability category.our opinion did not alter the standard of review or make any factual determinations as to any witness credibility.rather,we remanded for a determination whether pvusd met its affirmative obligation to locate,evaluate,and identify as a child with an other health impairment or a specific learning disability related to his auditory processing disorder,at.the district court did this in compliance with our mandate.
plaintiffs have not shown that pvusd unreasonably found that lacked the severe discrepancy between his achievement and academic test scores then required to qualify for benefits under the specific learning disability category 
in schaffer weast,d,the supreme court clarified that under the idea,the burden of persuasion rests with the party seeking relief.here,all appear to agree that achievement score in was,and that then applicable state regulations required a difference of points between achievement and ability scores.thus,to prevail on their claims that was entitled to special education benefits under the specific learning disability category,plaintiffs have to show that it was unreasonable for pvusd to use any test results other than score on the k abc test.this they have failed to do.
in challenging pvusd use of the wisc test,plaintiffs argue that the school psychologist,viall testified that the k abc test was a good cognitive test although viall testified that other colleagues thought the scores on the k abc test can be inflated,she was never able to identify which colleagues and what their credentials were and viall belief that e.score on the k abc test was high was a product of her unreasonably low expectations.plaintiffs assert that at least one authoritative article in a peer reviewed journal identified the k abc test as the best predictor of achievement of all cognitive tests.they also submitted a declaration from kaufman,who authored both portions of the wisc test and the k abc test,favoring the use of the k abc test and noting that it was not appropriate to substitute a brief test such as the toni for comprehensive tests such as the k abc.in addition,wright,who administered the wisc test,testified that had been unusually distracted when he took the test.
plaintiffs also contend that jacques report supports their positions that had a long history of auditory processing disorder symptoms pvusd was on notice that had a learning disability and had a long history of school failures.plaintiffs point to jacques statement that she found it puzzling that the district did not find eligible for special education services in.
plaintiffs have shown that pvusd could have used k abc score,but they have not shown that pvusd acted unreasonably in using his wisc score.the record shows that wright gave the wisc test in the summer of and that scored a on that test.plaintiffs then asked pvusd to test for a learning disability.pvusd did so.the school psychologist administered the k abc test because the wisc test would not have produced a reliable score.scored on the k abc test.viall,noting the disparity between the test scores and having concerns both about kabc test scores in general and score in particular,administered a third test.on the toni test,scored.pvusd considered all three test results and then decided to use the middle score,the one submitted by plaintiffs.this course of action has the indicia of reasonableness.
plaintiffs evidence and arguments do not undermine the reasonableness of pvusd decision.plaintiffs presented evidence such as kaufman declaration praising the kabc test,but not evidence that the other two tests were not tests for cognitive ability or that it was unreasonable to average test scores from different tests.moreover,none of the later developed information jacques report,the assessment,or the later assessments by new school district bear on pvusd determination because they do not undermine test scores on the wisc and toni.the later developed evidence does indicate that e.had a learning disability in,but pvusd did not deny that he had a disability.rather,it denied relief because there was not a point discrepancy between tested ability and performance.subsequently,when was retested and reevaluated,pvusd in determined that he was eligible for special educational benefits 
in schaffer,at,the supreme court held that the party challenging the district court ruling bears the burden of proof on appeal,and in,at,we held that we review the district court factual determinations for clear error.in,we reiterated that school districts have discretion in selecting the diagnostic tests they use to determine special education eligibility.at.applying these standards,we conclude that the record,developed over at least seven years,does not show that pvusd unreasonably denied special education benefits in under the specific learning disability category.accordingly,the district court determination of this issue must be affirmed.
c.we defer to the department of education position that a child with a disability may be eligible for special educational benefits under more than one category 
although we held in,at,that plaintiffs had not waived their contention that auditory processing disorder could qualify him for special education as a child with an other health impairment,the merits of this contention had not been previously addressed.in addressing the contention in the first instance,the district court did not have the benefit of the perspective of the department of education doe.on appeal,the doe has participated as an amicus curiae.thus,in reviewing the district court reading of a i,we have the benefit of the views of the agency charged by congress with administering the idea.see,
in,the doe issued a joint policy memorandum that explained that a child with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might qualify for special education benefits under one of three categories of the idea definition of child with a disability other health impairment,specific learning disability,or serious emotional disturbance.idelr.in,the doe office of special education programs issued a letter explaining that a child with chronic fatigue syndrome could qualify for special education under the other health impairment category or under another category if the child met the criteria for that category.letter to fazio,idelr.the doe asserts that while these documents do not address auditory processing disorders,they reflect the secretary position that a particular condition may qualify for benefits under more than one of the idea categories.
the doe asserts that its interpretation of a child with a disability is consistent with the history and purpose of the idea.congress first enacted the idea in to reverse this history of neglect of disabled children in the united states.schaffer,at.congress subsequently expanded the definition of children with disabilities to include specific learning disabilities autism and traumatic brain injury and children between the ages of three and nine who experienced developmental delays these amendments furthered the idea overarching substantive goal to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs.d a forest grove sch.dist,d noting the idea express purpose as set forth in the statute and holding that a reading of the act that left parents without an adequate remedy when a school district unreasonably failed to identify a child with disabilities would not comport with congress acknowledgment of the paramount importance of properly identifying each child eligible for services.
the doe further claims that its perspective is consistent with a state and local school district duty under the child find provisions of the idea.see a.the doe argues that considering a child condition under only one possible category of disability,when more than one might apply,elevates a myopic concern with the child specific classification over determining the child actual educational needs.see heather wisconsin,cir noting whether heather was described as cognitively disabled,other health impaired,or learning disabled is all beside the point.the idea concerns itself not with labels,but with whether a student is receiving a free and appropriate education.see also a b nothing in this chapter requires that children be classified by their disability so long as each child who has a disability listed in section of this title and who,by reason of that disability,needs special education and related services is regarded as a child with a disability under this subchapter.
where a statute speaks clearly to the precise question at issue,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
the supreme court has noted that deference may be extended to an agency perspective not only when it exercises its rulemaking authority,but also when an agency authorized to administer a statute interprets its own regulation or the statute by other means.in chase bank usa,mccoy,the federal agency presented its position in an amicus brief and the supreme court held we defer
