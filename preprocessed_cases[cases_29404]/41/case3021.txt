the secretary of health and human services government appeals the judgment of the court of federal claims awarding dory zatuchni zatuchni in her capacity as executrix of the estate of barbara snyder snyder under the national vaccine compensation program program.zatuchni sec y of health human.the government concedes that was properly awarded as a death benefit pursuant to a,but asserts that the remaining,representing compensation pursuant to a,and for injuries suffered by snyder prior to her death,may not be awarded because the death benefit is the sole remedy for a petitioner who dies as a result of the administration of a vaccine.we affirm.
background 
snyder received a measles,mumps,and rubella mmr vaccine on february,at the age of.the court of federal claims summarized the events that followed her vaccination 
within two weeks of the vaccination,snyder developed a rash,swollen lymph nodes,a fever,and severe pain throughout her joints and muscles.soon thereafter,snyder experienced other symptoms,which her physicians diagnosed as continuing chronic arthralgia and fibromyalgia syndrome fms attributable to the rubella portion of the mmr vaccination.over the next years,snyder physical condition deteriorated rapidly and significantly she found it impossible to continue working e ventually ambulated only with a walker,and required a nurse aid to assist her with daily living functions.

discussion 
the instant appeal requires us to determine whether the petitioner may receive the compensation for medical expenses,lost wages,and pain and suffering provided for under a,and,in addition to the death benefit provided for under a.the opinion below held that such compensation may be awarded the government contends on appeal that such compensation may not be awarded because the death benefit is the sole remedy for a petitioner who dies as a result of the administration of a vaccine,and that claims for compensation under,and do not survive the death of a person under any circumstances.
the question of whether compensation under these subsections may be paid to the petitioner estate following her death presents a question of statutory interpretation,and requires an analysis of the text and structure of the applicable statute.seymour principi,addressing the survivability of claims for veteran benefits under richard west,claimant statutory argument can not overcome the clear intent expressed by the structure and language of the statutory scheme at a veteran claim to disability benefits terminates at death.we review de novo the judgment of the court below on this question.markovich sec y of health human,see also e b.
the program was established by the national childhood vaccine injury act of,tit.iii,stat,vaccine act.as we have previously noted,
congress instituted this compensatory program because the traditional civil tort actions against vaccine manufacturers were producing undesirable results both with respect to the victims and the vaccine industry.congress found that the traditional tort system was not working for victims because it resulted in lengthy delays,high transaction costs,and sometimes no recovery.similarly,the high cost of litigation and difficulty of obtaining insurance was undermining incentives for vaccine manufacturers to remain in the vaccine market.in sum,congress was concerned with the instability and unpredictability in the childhood vaccine market.

as its structure reflects,the program was intended to be expeditious and fair and to compensate persons with recognized vaccine injuries without requiring the difficult individual determinations of causation of injury and without a demonstration that a manufacturer was negligent or that a vaccine was defective.house report at,reprinted in at see also id.at,reprinted in at.the committee anticipates that the speed of the compensation program,the low transaction costs of the system,the nature of the required findings,and the relative certainty and generosity of the system awards will divert a significant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation.any person who has sustained a injury,the legal representative of such person if such person is a minor or is disabled,or the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the vaccine injury table may file a petition under the program.b a see also id.vaccine injury table causation is presumed where an injury or condition listed in the vaccine injury table begins to manifest itself within the time specified in the table for the vaccine in question.hines sec y of health human,see also c c i,a a b the vaccine act also requires that the procedures established for resolving claims under the program be expeditious and informal,including flexible and informal standards of admissibility of evidence.d a b.

the types of compensation available to a petitioner under the program are listed in.section a addresses petitions,such as the petition at issue here subsection b addresses petitions.subsection a provides,in relevant part 
compensation awarded under the program to a petitioner under section of this title for a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after october,shall include the following 
a actual unreimbursable expenses incurred from the date of the judgment awarding such expenses and reasonable projected unreimbursable expenses which result from the injury for which the petitioner seeks compensation

id.a.subsection b incorporates by reference most of the categories of compensation established in subsection a,but is structured somewhat differently,does not permit recovery of unreimbursable expenses incurred before the date of judgment,and contains a stricter limit on the amount of compensation that may be awarded for several other categories of compensation.it provides 
compensation awarded under the program to a petitioner under section of this title for a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine before october,may include the compensation described in paragraphs a and of subsection a of this section and may also include an amount,not to exceed a combined total of,for 
lost earnings as provided in paragraph of subsection a of this section,
pain and suffering as provided in paragraph of subsection a of this section,and 
reasonable attorneys fees and costs as provided in subsection e of this section.
id.b.the act also provides that compensation will be paid in no more than cases.id.b b.
the question presented here is whether a petitioner who has suffered a injury and dies from causes while her petition for compensation under a is pending may recover,in addition to the death benefit provided under a,compensation under subsections a,and.based on the statutory text and structure outlined above,we answer this question in the affirmative.
most important,the text and structure of a indicate that the death benefit provided by subsection a is not the exclusive remedy where a petitioner has experienced both a injury and a death.first,subsection a is not set off from the subsections dealing with compensation for expenses,lost wages,and pain and suffering to the contrary,it is listed between and alongside those provisions,which supports an interpretation in which the death benefit is simply one of several types of compensation that are available in an appropriate case.second,and perhaps most crucially,the text of subsection a as a whole does not,as the government maintains,provide any indication that the death benefit in a is the only compensation that may be paid in a death case,whereas the compensation provided for in subsections a,and may be paid only in an injury case in which the injured party is still living.subsection a begins with the directive that c ompensation shall include the following,and proceeds to list four categories of available compensation.id.a emphasis added.the government argues,however,that despite this inclusive opening language,subsections a,and state that they provide only compensation for expenses,lost wages,and pain and suffering caused by a injury,whereas subsection a states that it provides to an estate only i n the event of a death,and that this phrasing supports the conclusion that compensation under all four of these provisions is not permitted.
this argument does not withstand scrutiny.put simply,the fact that a death followed a injury in a particular case does not alter the fact that certain expenses were incurred,wages lost,or pain and suffering endured in the interim,and these damages are no less related to or caused by a injury within the meaning of subsections a,and simply because the person in question is no longer living.id.a.thus,it is in no way inconsistent with the text of a to award compensation under subsections a,and for damages that resulted from or were sustained by reason of a injury in addition to the death benefit provided for under subsection a i n the event of a death.id to the contrary,this is the reading of a that most naturally flows from its text and structure.
this interpretation of a is confirmed by an analysis of b.the government conceded in oral argument that these two provisions,while differently structured and addressed to different categories of petitions rather than petitions,should be interpreted consistently with respect to the question of whether compensation for a injury can be awarded after the death of a person,as neither the statute itself nor the legislative history provides any indication that congress intended to reach a different result on this point in and cases we agree,and further find that the text and structure of subsection b make even more explicit that both injury and death compensation may be available in an appropriate case.
section b provides that,in a case,compensation may include the compensation described in paragraphs a and of subsection a of this section and may also include lost earnings and pain and suffering as described in subsections a and.id.b emphasis added.although recovery for lost earnings and pain and suffering along with attorney fees are capped at for a recovery under subsection b,the underscored text establishes beyond cavil that,in a case,the statute provides that the death benefit in paragraph may be paid to an estate alongside compensation for expenses,lost earnings,and pain and suffering.if we are to read subsections a and b in parallel,then,the interpretation of subsection a outlined above must be adopted here moreover,as the government concession underscores,nothing in the language or structure of the vaccine act indicates that congress intended to provide injury compensation in addition to the death benefit in cases but not in cases.
moving beyond itself,the government argues that several other provisions of the statute demonstrate that the vaccine act as a whole draws a distinction between injury claims and death claims that precludes a finding that any petitioner might be awarded the compensation contemplated here.primary reliance is placed on b a,which describes who may file a petition for compensation under the program,and b,which provides that o nly one petition may be filed with respect to each administration of a vaccine the single petition rule.while we are mindful that s tatutes must be read as a whole,united states atlantic research,d internal quotation marks omitted,we do not find the government arguments on these points to be compelling.
based on its reading of b a,the government contends that because the right to file a claim after the death of a person is limited to the the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine,it is apparent that a person who dies before the filing of a petition can not request compensation for a injury.reasoning from this conclusion,the government argues that injury claims thus do not survive the death of the person.the government reading of this provision goes too far.we need not decide whether b a would permit the estate of a person who suffered injuries but died of a cause to file a petition for injury compensation,and thus express no view on that point this provision,however,plainly does not dictate that a properly filed petition by the estate of a person who suffered both injuries and a death and thus had standing to file under b a may not contain a request for any and all of the types of compensation listed in a.similarly,as in this case,if a petition is properly filed by a person who suffered a injury,but that person dies of causes while her claim is pending,b a does not or by legal representative of the estate of such a person from requesting each of the categories of compensation listed in a after they have been properly substituted for the deceased petitioner.
in a related argument,the government contends that the single petition rule of b also supports its view that the vaccine act makes a distinction between injury cases and death cases.the government argues that,as a result of this rule,if a person were to file a petition and receive compensation under a,and during his lifetime,and were subsequently to die as a result of his injuries,a second petition and recovery under a would not be permitted.because it would not be possible to recover both the death benefit and injury compensation under those circumstances,the government contends that the statutory structure contemplates that there are two separate types of vaccine injury petition or a death petition and that the pursuit of the two separate claims in a single petition is precluded.
we,of course,agree that a second petition seeking the death benefit would not be permitted under the circumstances just described that result is clearly dictated by the rule in b.it does not follow,however,that because recovery of both the death benefit and injury compensation is not possible in one scenario that it is not possible under another quite different scenario,such as that presented by the instant appeal.as the description above indicates,the program contains several limitations and that restrict recovery,including the statute of limitations,the filing requirements of,the single petition rule,the limitation on the number of petitions for which compensation may be awarded,and limits on the amount of compensation that may be paid under certain subsections of.many of these limitations appear to be driven by concerns about the difficulty of establishing causation for injuries or deaths after a significant lapse of time,or about the adequacy of the vaccine injury compensation trust fund,see,to cover all petitions that might be filed under the program.whatever their origin,that these limitations prevent certain individuals who have undoubtedly suffered as a result of a vaccine from receiving full or any compensation is beyond question.given,however,what we view as the plain meaning of recovery under a through is permitted where do not believe that these limiting provisions require us to set aside that meaning here and hold that such a recovery is never possible simply because these limiting provisions indicate that it would be unattainable under certain circumstances,nor do we feel that such a result is either absurd or inconsistent with the text,structure,or spirit of the vaccine act as a whole 
moreover,we note that if the government arguments are taken to their logical conclusion,all recovery would be denied here.the government contends that b a and b,read together,indicate that a petition may be filed for either a injury or a death,but not for both,and that the compensation available is determined by the identity of the filer if an estate files,it may only receive a death benefit if an injured person files,she may only receive benefits.in this case,however,snyder filed her claim for injury compensation while she was alive,and the rule bars the filing of any additional petitions related to the administration of her mmr vaccine.in this scenario,the most logical outcome under the government reading of the statute would be to conclude that because snyder estate did not file the claim at issue here within the meaning of b a but rather has been substituted for the deceased snyder in order to continue her original can not recover anything in connection with her petition that this petition should therefore be denied and that because no further petitions may be filed,no recovery is available to the estate.we recognize,of course,that the government has chosen to concede in this appeal that snyder estate is entitled to recover a death benefit,but the result that would follow from an endorsement of the logic of the government result that we do not believe is required under the the imprudence of reading b as controlling the types of compensation available rather than,as its text provides,simply describing who may file a petition for compensation under the program.b a.
given the posture of this case,we also note that there is no procedural difficulty presented by the substitution of a deceased petitioner legal representative following a death that prevents us from reaching the result contemplated here.rcfc a provides that i f a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished,the court may order substitution of the proper parties.the rule also details the procedural requirements for effecting the substitution.rcfc.in this case,substitution was made pursuant to this procedure,and while the government contested whether the petitioner motion for substitution was timely in light of certain delays in the probate process,this procedural question was resolved in favor of the petitioner and is not challenged here.snyder sec y of health human.
finally,we do not find that the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents us from affirming here.as the discussion above indicates,we do not find that the government has offered a plausible reading of the statute,marathon oil united states,as endorsement of its position would require us to ignore what we see as the plain reading of a and b,and to do so in the absence of any statutory guidance supporting that reinterpretation.the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not require such a result 
conclusion 
the judgment of the court of federal claims awarding the petitioner compensation pursuant to a in the amount of is affirmed.
this case presents a simple question whether a claim for compensation for a injury under the national childhood vaccine injury act the vaccine act,to,survives the death of a petitioner.without any basis in the statutory text,the majority holds that the vaccine act provides for survivorship.in my view,the vaccine act is entirely silent as to issues of survivorship.the majority approach is contrary to established authority recognized explicitly in eight circuits,and implicitly by the supreme court,that survivorship is determined as a matter of federal common law when the statute does not explicitly address the question.the majority offers no reason for ignoring this established rule in favor of an untenable construction of the vaccine act.
this issue arises against a background of pervasive concern about the survival of personal injury claims.at common law,personal injury claims,unlike claims for injury to property,did not survive,but abated upon the death of either the plaintiff or the defendant.see,restatement second of torts a cmt.see also wex malone,the genesis of wrongful death,stan.the modern approach,however,has been to reject the common law rule and allow survivorship.see page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts ed.
the majority goes to great lengths to demonstrate that the vaccine act does not preclude survivorship,and i agree however,in my view,the majority entirely fails to explain where or how the vaccine act affirmatively provides for survivorship.it is well established that in construing a statute,a court may not draw on some unexpressed spirit outside the bounds of the normal meaning of the words used in the statute.addison holly hill fruit.see also ernst ernst hochfelder,d rejecting construction of statute that would add a gloss to the operative language of the statute quite different from its commonly accepted meaning the majority opinion does not identify any statutory text that could be read to provide a right of survivorship.
the only statutory text that could possibly be read to provide for survivorship of some vaccine act claims is the act standing provision 
a ny person who has sustained a injury,the legal representative of such person if such person is a minor or is disabled,or the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the vaccine injury table may,if the person meets the requirements of subsection c of this section,file a petition for compensation under the national vaccine injury compensation program.
b a.any construction of section b a to provide affirmatively for survivorship of injury claims,however,would be plainly incorrect.
first,the text of section b a simply does not address whether a claim for a vaccine related injury survives and can be pursued by the estate of the injured person.the standing language provides that the legal representative of a person who has sustained a injury may file a petition for compensation only if the injured person is a minor or is disabled.this language does not address whether a legal representative of a deceased,person may file a petition for compensation.the standing provision also authorizes the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the vaccine injury table to bring a petition for compensation.this provision of section b a clearly refers to a claim for the death benefit provided in section a and does not authorize any action with respect to a person who has suffered a injury before death.in addition,there is not a shred of legislative history that would support a construction of section b a as explicitly providing for survivorship of injury claims,nor does the majority claim that any exists.
second,it is significant that section does not use language similar to that used in other federal or state statutes that do provide for survivorship.those statutes use terminology such as not abate or survive to preserve causes of action after death.for example,congress has explicitly provided that any civil action for damages commenced by or on behalf of the united states or in which it is interested shall not abate on the death of a defendant but shall survive and be enforceable against his estate as well as against surviving defendants.emphases added.similarly,the federal employers liability act,in providing for survivorship,states 
any right of action given by this chapter to a person suffering injury shall survive to his or her personal representative,for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee,and,if none,then of such employee parents and,if none,then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee,but in such cases there shall be only one recovery for the same injury.
emphasis added the vast majority of state statutes also utilize such language.see stuart speiser james rooks,recovery for wrongful death,app.a ed collecting state statutes.the vaccine act contains no similar language addressing the issue of survivorship.
third,and perhaps most significantly,a strained interpretation of section b a to provide for survivorship would create an anomalous,arbitrary,and unfair result that congress can not have intended.the language of the vaccine act authorizes an action only by the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the vaccine injury table.b a.
as the government points out,if this language were construed to provide for survival,a petitioner claim for injury would survive only if the petitioner died from causes,since the language refers only to the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the vaccine injury table.id.if the petitioner died of unrelated causes,section b a could not be read to provide any standing for the petitioner personal representative,and the injury claim would apparently abate.this would leave such a petitioner estate no basis for any compensation at all,even though the petitioner would have suffered injuries and associated costs during his or her life.there is no basis in the policy of the vaccine act to distinguish,in terms of the availability of compensation for injury,between a person who suffers a injury and subsequently dies as a result of the vaccination,and a person who suffers the same injury but dies of unrelated causes congress can not possibly have intended such a result,and nothing in the legislative history suggests that congress intended this result.it would be a further stretch to imagine that congress not only intended such a distinction,but chose to embody it in statutory language that purports only to confer standing on a legal representative to seek the statutory death benefit 
perhaps recognizing that section b a can not be read as providing for survivorship,the majority appears to base its finding of survivorship on a negative inference from another provision of the vaccine act,section b,which governs compensation available for injuries,that is,those arising from vaccinations administered prior to the effective date of the vaccine act op.at.however,the majority plainly misreads this section as providing for survivorship.like section b a,section b does not address the issue of survivorship,and it does not use the language survive or not abate.
the plain language of section b limits the compensation available with respect to vaccinations administered prior to the effective date of the vaccine act by imposing a cap on the total compensation for pain and suffering,lost wages,and attorneys fees,while otherwise making available in act cases all of the same categories of compensation available in act cases under section a medical expenses,lost wages,pain and suffering,and the statutory death benefit in addition to reasonable attorneys fees,as provided in section e.the majority relies heavily on the use of the word and in section b referring to injury compensation and the death benefit to reach the conclusion that the same individual may recover both compensation for injury and a death benefit.it then appears to read the same conjunctive language into section a.op.at.but section b,in describing the types of compensation recoverable,like section a,obviously refers to the various types of compensation recoverable by the class of individuals entitled to sue,not the compensation recoverable by each individual claimant.this is necessarily the case because individuals still alive can not be entitled to the death benefit under section a.moreover,the right of any individual claimant to recover is governed explicitly by section,not by section.
this is made clear by section b itself.that section refers,with respect to eligibility to receive compensation,back to the standing provision of section,specifying the amount of c ompensation awarded under the program to a petitioner under section of this title for a injury or death.b.section governs the right to recovery of the individual claimant.as discussed above,section tells us nothing about survivorship.
because nothing in the vaccine act addresses the issue of survivorship,the issue is properly addressed as a matter of federal common law.t he inevitable incompleteness presented by all legislation means that it is the responsibility of the federal courts to declare rules which may be necessary to fill in interstitially or otherwise effectuate the statutory patterns enacted in the large by congress.united states little lake misere land,d quoting paul mishkin,the variousness of federal law competence and discretion in the choice of national and state rules for decision,see also montana united states,if the relevant federal statutes are silent the federal courts must fill the interstices of federal legislation according to their own standards.therefore,if no federal statute supplies the rule of law,the court must determine whether to create federal common law or to incorporate state law as the rule of decision.internal quotation marks and citation omitted quoting united states kimbell foods,d.
the issue of survivorship is among the background legal principles for which judicial is appropriate.the supreme court has impliedly held and eight circuits have explicitly held that federal common law determines survivorship where the statute is silent as to the issue.commentators agree.in some statutes creating a federal right of action congress provides explicitly that the action will survive the death of a party.in the absence of a provision of this kind the court must look to federal common law.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed footnotes omitted and emphases added.ample authority from the supreme court and eight circuits supports this proposition.
for example,in united states nec,cir,the original plaintiff,williams,had brought a qui tam action against the united states under the false claims act,seeking a portion of the recovery the government obtained from the defendant as a result of information he had provided.id.at.the court first determined that neither the f alse c laims a ct nor its legislative history reveals the drafters intent with respect to survivability.we thus turn to federal common law for guidance.id.the court held,as a matter of federal common law,that the qui tam claim survived williams death.id.at.likewise,courts have applied a similar analysis to conclude that the survival of actions under other federal statutes,for example,the age discrimination in employment act and the truth in lending act,is governed by federal common law.see,smith dep t of human,cir age discrimination in employment act smith galesburg crown fin,cir truth in lending act.
although widely recognizing that federal common law governs,the courts have not clearly articulated the governing rule with respect to survivorship of personal injury claims under the vaccine act or more generally.one option would be to adopt the applicable state law rule.see,robertson wegmann,d.however,that option is not appropriate in this case.although not all c ontroversies directly affecting the operations of federal programs require resort to uniform rules,kimbell foods,at,the creation of a uniform federal rule is particularly appropriate in cases,such as this,that directly concern the duties of the federal government,texas industries,radcliff materials,d.in this context,the need for uniformity in the vaccine compensation program is also demonstrated because congress chose to allow adjudication of claims under the program only in the united states court of federal claims,a single,uniform,national court.resort to state law to determine survival of claims under the vaccine act would be inappropriate.see carlson,at.finding survival of bivens claims governed by a uniform federal rule in favor of survival rather than state law shyface sec y of health human,holding that standard for proof of causation under vaccine act must be determined as a uniform federal rule rather than by adopting state law.
although it is not appropriate to adopt the differing rules of individual states,it is appropriate to follow the approach adopted by the vast majority of states.nearly every state now provides for survivorship of personal injury claims by statute,rejecting the common law rule that personal injury claims do not survive death.see speiser rooks,supra,app.a see also keeton et,supra,v irtually every state today has some form of survival statute,the exact provisions of which vary but the gist of which is to permit a personal injury action to continue after the death of either the plaintiff or defendant.footnote omitted.
in a closely related context,the supreme court has explained that the sweeping rejection by the states of a common law doctrine argues strongly that the common law doctrine should also be rejected as a matter of federal common law.at common law,there was no cause of action for wrongful death.see moragne states marine lines,d.in moragne,the supreme court recognized,as a matter of federal common law,a cause of action for wrongful death in federal admiralty jurisdiction.id.at.the court held that despite the common law refusal to recognize such a claim,the work of the legislatures has made the allowance of recovery for wrongful death the general rule of american law,and its denial the exception.id.at.based in large part on the widespread enactment of state statutes creating a cause of action for wrongful death,creation of a similar federal common law action was appropriate.id.at.it is appropriate to follow a similar approach with respect to survivorship of injury claims,since the states by statute have almost uniformly rejected the common law rule that personal injury claims do not survive death.indeed,it is particularly appropriate to follow the approach of moragne because the common law doctrines rejecting survivorship and wrongful death actions,while distinct,are related both in historical origin and practical consequence.see malone,supra,at.
a rule in favor of survival is also consistent with the objectives of the vaccine act with respect to both compensation of injured individuals and protection of vaccine manufacturers.the vaccine act includes an provision which requires that individuals harmed by a vaccine submit a claim under the vaccine program,but allows a claimant to reject the program award and instead bring a private action under state law against a vaccine manufacturer or administrator a a.a rule in favor of survivorship of injury claims would preserve the vaccine act as an effective substitute for the state tort system.as noted earlier,in all or nearly all states,the state tort system that congress sought to replace with the vaccine compensation program,for claims of injuries and death,provides for survival of personal actions.a rule in favor of survivorship would harmonize the federal scheme with the state alternative.
i would hold that,because the statutory language does not specify whether claims under the vaccine act survive,this issue is properly governed by federal common law,and that claims for injury accruing prior to death survive the death of a claimant.i respectfully dissent from the majority refusal to apply law,but concur in the result that allows the estate of this petitioner to recover

also around this time,in response to the filing of several similar petitions,the special master assigned to snyder petition was directed to conduct a general inquiry into the causal relationship between various conditions and rubella vaccinations.the special master made findings and issued reports in and that were subsequently applied to resolve petitions alleging that rubella vaccinations had caused symptoms,including snyder petition.see snyder,wl,at.see generally snyder sec y of health human,et,wl.

the government also argues that congress intent to lim
