when an employer changes its shift schedule to accommodate its employees scheduling desires,the mere fact that pay rates changed,between the old and new scheduling schemes in an attempt to keep overall pay,does not establish a violation of the fair labor standards act flsa overtime pay requirements.
background 
pomona valley hospital medical center pvhmc is a hospital located in pomona,california that has at all relevant times been an employer subject to the flsa.the flsa requires an employer such as pvhmc to pay its employees at times the employees regular rate for any employment in excess of eight hours in any workday and in excess of eighty hours in a period.j.
prior to or,pvhmc scheduled its nurses to work almost exclusively in shifts.however,many pvhmc nurses preferred working shifts in order to have more days away from the hospital.the nurses,therefore,requested shift schedules.in response to these requests,pvhmc developed and implemented an optional shift schedule and pay plan in.the pay plan provided nurses the option of working a shift schedule in exchange for receiving a lower base hourly salary that at all times exceeded the minimum wage set forth by the flsa and pay for hours worked in excess of eight per day.the result nurses,who volunteered for the shift schedule,would make approximately the same amount of money as they made on the shift schedule while working the same number of hours and performing the same duties.after pvhmc made the shift schedule available,many pvhmc nurses though not all opted to work shifts.
in,louise parth worked as a nurse in pvhmc emergency room er.the nurses in pvhmc er including parth voted to implement shifts.parth favored the shift format,because it provided her more flexibility in her personal schedule,enabling her to care for her mother,pursue a second nursing job at other facilities,and pick up additional shifts at pvhmc.after voting to implement shifts in the er,parth subsequently entered into a voluntary agreement with pvhmc that reduced her base hourly wage rate from to in exchange for the shift schedule.parth has worked the shift schedule without interruption since.
in,the pvhmc nurses voted to unionize.accordingly,pvhmc and the nurses certified bargaining representative,service employees international union,local local,negotiated a collective bargaining agreement cba over a period.parth was a member of local bargaining committee and therefore attended most of the negotiation sessions.the resulting agreement provided that pvhmc would increase all nurse shift employees and shift employees during the cba first year,followed by increase for the second and third years.the cba also reaffirmed pvhmc practice of paying nurses working the shift schedule a lower base hourly rate than nurses working shifts.
the cba set the base hourly rate for parth position at the base rate.when parth works a weekday night,her hourly rate is the weeknight base rate.when she works a weekend night,her hourly rate is the weekend night base rate.anytime parth works more than hours in a shift or hours in a work period,she receives times her regular rate of pay for those hours.if parth works beyond hours in a shift,she is paid double the regular rate of pay.pvhmc calculates the regular rate of pay by multiplying the total number of hours parth works at each of the corresponding base rates base rate weeknight base rate weekend night base rate,adding those numbers together,then dividing the total base rate pay by the total number of base rate hours worked.the regular rate of pay is therefore something more than the base rate of pay and will vary according to the number of hours worked at the various base rates.this method is known as the weighted average method of determining the regular rate.gorman consol.edison,cir.after pvhmc calculates the regular rate of pay,it multiplies that number by to arrive at the overtime rate.
in,all local members employed at pvhmc and in good standing with the union voted on the proposed cba after being advised of its contents and being provided the opportunity to review its provisions.after local ratified the cba,local representatives and pvhmc executed the agreement.parth was a signatory to the agreement.she also testified during her deposition that she was aware the cba continued pvhmc pay rate practices.parth continued to work the shift schedule at pvhmc.
just two years later,parth filed a putative class action complaint against pvhmc.she alleged that pvhmc use of different base hourly rates violates the flsa in that it denies unionized employees overtime pay,to which they are statutorily entitled.the district court found that parth met the requirements for conditional class certification to bring the flsa claim.pvhmc then filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that its pay practices comply with the flsa.the district court found that parth did not adduce evidence or law sufficient to support her claims and therefore granted pvhmc summary judgment.we affirm.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court order granting summary judgment.see,universal health,thompson,cir.on review,we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to parth,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.t he plain language of rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.
iii.discussion 
parth argues that pvhmc violated the flsa by creating a pay plan that pays nurses working shifts a lower base hourly rate than nurses who work shifts.in support of her argument,parth contends that a pvhmc can not reduce the base pay for nurses working the shift,b the base pay rate is an artifice designed to avoid the flsa overtime and maximum hours requirements,and c pvhmc can not justify the base hourly pay rate differences between the and shifts,because nurses working both shifts perform the same job duties.
parth asserts that pvhmc pay plan violates the flsa,because it was designed to make overtime payments cost neutral,and that such a scheme is lawful only when implemented before the employer was subject to the flsa.we disagree.the shift scheduling practice was first initiated at the nurses request.the shift scheduling practice was then memorialized in a collective bargaining agreement as a result of negotiations between local and pvhmc again initiated at the nurses request.the parties do not dispute that the wages paid under the pay plan are more than the minimum wages under federal law.we find no reason to invalidate the agreement between the parties.there is no justification in the law and no public policy rationale for doing so.parth also failed to cite either before the district court or on appeal any authority to suggest that a voluntary base rate wage reduction made in exchange for a shift schedule was unlawful.
the flsa requires employers to pay employees,who work more than hours in a work week,one and a half times the employees regular rate of pay.a.the supreme court interprets regular rate to mean the hourly rate actually paid the employee for the normal,workweek for which he is employed.walling hardwood.congress purpose in enacting the flsa was to protect all covered workers from substandard wages and oppressive working hours.barrentine freight system,d.see also adair city of kirkland,cir.under the flsa,employers and employees are generally free to establish the regular rate at any point and in any manner they see fit,a s long as the minimum hourly rates established by section of the flsa are respected,at.though our circuit has never been asked to determine whether an employer subject to the flsa may alter the regular rate of pay in order to provide employees a schedule they desire,we conclude that such an arrangement does not contravene the flsa purpose.
soon after congress enacted the flsa,but before it became effective,many employers altered their compensat
