appellants oregon health sciences university ohsu and alan seyfer appeal following a jury award of both compensatory and punitive damages in favor of david ostad.we affirm.
ostad,a former ohsu resident who worked under seyfer,alleged that his termination from the residency program was motivated by seyfer retaliation against him for questioning seyfer billing practices.appellants challenge,among other things,the district court denial of their motion for judgment in their favor as a matter of law.they contend that the trial judge misapprehended the law applicable to first amendment employment claims.we affirm the district court determination that entry of judgment as a matter of law would be improper,as well as its formulation of jury instructions.we also affirm the district court decision to admit certain testimony of wheatley,one of seyfer colleagues.
factual background procedural history 
ostad began a residency in the plastic and reconstructive surgery division of oregon health sciences university ohsu on july.he had a contract that was renewable for a second year.
roughly two months into ostad rotation with seyfer,chief of the division,seyfer wrote ostad a letter,dated january,criticizing ostad performance.the letter relayed complaints about ostad from several doctors in ohsu plastic surgery and emergency medicine divisions.seyfer also detailed ostad problematic treatment of several patients,some of whom reportedly asked that ostad no longer be permitted to treat them,and he described technical deficiencies with ostad work that he had observed personally.seyfer warned that if ostad performance did not improve within a month,the resident would find himself on academic probation.
ostad contends he was ordered to sign the letter and get out of the office and that he was not permitted to read the letter or discuss its contents with seyfer.seyfer points to ostad signature on the letter acknowledging,i have read this letter carefully and agree to its contents.i will try to achieve the goals that seyfer has outlined above.
during the same period,ostad had raised questions about seyfer billing practices.ohsu could not legally bill medicare and medicaid for procedures performed by residents unless a teaching staff physician was present for the critical part of the procedure.ostad claimed that seyfer asked to be listed as the attending physician regardless of whether he was present when ostad performed a procedure.ostad testified that seyfer became angry when challenged about the practice.
two weeks after presenting the first letter,seyfer gave ostad a second letter detailing additional disappointment with ostad lack of knowledge and skill.although the original letter had provided for review after a month,seyfer informed ostad that he was placing him on probation from the date of the letter,january,through the end of the following month.
ostad testified at trial that seyfer delivered the letter with a warning this is it you do want to play the game stop meddling in my business we need to be paid for what you do.ostad contends that these statements referred to his complaints about seyfer billing practices.ostad signed the letter,but this time acknowledged its receipt without agreeing to its contents.
on february,week prior to the scheduled termination of ostad academic presented the resident with yet another letter.this time the senior doctor detailed complaints from two other physicians who had observed ostad while seyfer was out of town.one physician alleged that ostad had refused to come promptly to treat a patient with multiple facial fractures.the second recounted another patient complaints about ostad treatment and her request that he not be permitted to participate in her care.seyfer also noted problems with ostad treatment of another patient.seyfer informed ostad that he would be removed from the roster so he would have time to respond to the accusations in writing by the end of the probationary period.
as requested,ostad replied with a letter in which he responded to each of the accusations of seyfer letter of february.ostad letter did not mention seyfer billing practices.
seyfer wrote still another letter on march.in it,he described deficiencies with ostad treatment of several patients.ostad again signed to acknowledge receipt.the next day,seyfer gave ostad a letter placing him on administrative leave through the end of his residency.ostad,who refused to sign his name to the letter,testified that,when handing him the letter,seyfer told him that he had meddled in seyfer business too much.
ostad requested a hearing,as was his right under ohsu regulations.ohsu convened a panel of five of them plastic surgery consider a formal notice of proposed termination compiled from seyfer letters.because of the panel lack of familiarity with plastic surgery,thornburg,the chair of the panel,confirmed at trial that the group depended heavily on seyfer for a description of procedures and an assessment of how a junior resident should perform.
the hearing provided many of the elements of due process that would be afforded a party at trial.ostad was represented by counsel,was permitted discovery,and was allowed to witnesses who testified under oath.ostad was not,however,permitted to subpoena witnesses.he therefore was unable to compel the testimony or participation of two physicians who were seyfer colleagues and had supervised ostad and reviewed him favorably.
seyfer testimony took up pages of the hearing transcript and included hearsay about other doctors assessments of ostad.ostad,who was answering the charges against him put forth by ohsu,presented no evidence about seyfer allegedly improper billing practices.the panel opinion and order made several factual findings and recommended that ostad be terminated.consistent with the panel recommendation,ohsu chief administrative officer roy vinyard terminated ostad residency.
ostad filed suit pursuant to,alleging that seyfer and ohsu had violated his first amendment right to freedom of speech.at trial,ostad was able to present witnesses who complimented his performance as well as witnesses who criticized seyfer billing unavailable to the ohsu panel that recommended his termination.
there was ample evidence to suggest that seyfer was motivated by animus in response to ostad protected speech about his billing practices.ostad testified to to incidents in which he challenged seyfer about his billing practices.jurors also heard ostad recollection of several explosive statements he alleged seyfer made in response to ostad criticisms.
the jury returned a special verdict against both ohsu and seyfer.the jury concluded that ostad proved that the defendants had retaliated against him for exercising his free speech rights.the jury also found that ohsu and seyfer failed to prove that ostad would have been terminated from ohsu plastic surgery program for other reasons even in the absence of his protected speech activity.the jury recommended an award of in past economic damages,in damages,and no future economic damages.the jury determined that seyfer should pay ostad an additional in punitive damages.because the district court had ruled previously that the jury ruling on future economic damages would be advisory only,the court entertained further written argument before issuing an order granting ostad for future economic loss.
pursuant to.b,ohsu and seyfer moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial pursuant to.the district court denied both requests.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
judgment as a matter of law 
ohsu and seyfer contend that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because ostad failed to produce sufficient evidence that the exercise of his right to free speech played a role in his termination.the appellants explain that,although seyfer may have been motivated by animus based on ostad speech,he ultimately did not terminate ostad.that decision was left to the chief administrative officer acting on the recommendation of the hearing committee,which had no knowledge of ostad complaints about billing practices and,thus,could not have been motivated by unconstitutional reasons to make its termination recommendation.therefore,appellants argue,neither seyfer nor ohsu should be liable because the hearing committee unbiased decision cut off the chain of causation between seyfer improper motives and ostad ultimate termination.
we need not consider whether the question of ohsu liability raises distinct issues from the question of seyfer liability.ohsu has never contended that its liability must be considered separately.rather,ohsu expressly disavowed the position at oral argument by insisting that its position and seyfer were identical.accordingly,we deem that ohsu has waived any right to have its liability analyzed separately from that of seyfer 
we review the denial of a motion for a judgment as a matter of law de novo.see monroe city of phoenix,cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving,draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d.judgment as a matter of law is proper when the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion and the conclusion is contrary to that reached by the jury.monroe,at.seyfer and ohsu contend that no reasonable jury could find that seyfer retaliated against ostad for his speech by terminating him because that decision was left to the hearing committee.ostad contends that seyfer and ohsu may be held liable under.
section provides in pertinent part 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law.
the supreme court specified the proper framework for analyzing claims of illegal retaliation for the exercise of protected speech in mount healthy city bd.of educ.doyle,d hereinafter healthy.the court enunciated a burden shifting test in which a plaintiff must show that his conduct is constitutionally protected and that the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to take an adverse action against him.id.at.if a plaintiff meets these burdens,the defendant must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that it would have reached the same decision as to the adverse action even in the absence of the protected conduct.id.
the court explained that it was concerned that an employee be placed in no worse a position than if he had not engaged in the conduct.id.at.but the court also reasoned 
a borderline or marginal candidate should not have the employment question resolved against him because of the constitutionally protected conduct.but that same candidate ought not to be able,by engaging in such conduct to prevent his employer from assessing his performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire him on the basis of that record,simply because the protected conduct makes the employer more certain of the correctness of its decision.
id.at.the court concerns must guide our application of its test.seyfer and ohsu concede that ostad conduct with regard to seyfer billing practices was protected under the first amendment.accordingly we must determine whether the jury properly could have found,on the record before it,that ostad protected conduct played a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to terminate his residency.
for the purposes of determining seyfer liability,the appellants contend that the hearing committee independent decision severed any link between seyfer allegedly improper motives and ostad termination.we disagree.
in gilbrook city of westminster,cir,a case in which the plaintiffs alleged,inter alia,that they were terminated for the exercise of speech protected by the first amendment,we addressed whether the decision by a superior to uphold a discharge automatically immunized a subordinate from liability for retaliatory acts that ultimately led to the discharge.we aligned ourselves with the fifth,sixth,and tenth circuits and held that a subordinate can not use the nonretaliatory motive of a superior as a shield against liability if that superior never would have considered a dismissal but for the subordinate retaliatory conduct.id.at.however,we stressed that the ultimate question of the liability of the subordinate is an intensely factual one,the results of which will vary depending on the circumstances.id.we specified 
we do not hold that a final who lacks any improper motive never can absolve a subordinate of liability for his or her retaliatory acts,any more than we hold that such a always can absolve the subordinate.indeed,we express no opinion as to what the result should be,as a matter of law,if the facts showed that the final made a wholly independent,legitimate decision to discharge the plaintiff,uninfluenced by the retaliatory motives of a subordinate.
id.emphasis in original.
here,the jury had ample evidence of seyfer bias and its role in the process of terminating ostad participation in ohsu residency program the jury heard evidence that indicated that seyfer threatened ostad for challenging improper billing practices that seyfer wrote a number of letters that laid the groundwork for and initiated the discipline hearings that resulted in ostad termination that the hearing board,without any independent experience in plastic surgery,substantially relied on seyfer expertise and testimony to reach the decision to terminate ostad residency and that ostad himself was prevented from adducing evidence to rebut seyfer conclusions about his performance.the jury also specifically found that ohsu and seyfer failed to prove that ostad would have been terminated from ohsu plastic surgery program for other reasons even in the absence of his protected speech activity.on these facts,even assuming,for the sake of argument,that ohsu hearing committee did not share seyfer improper motives in terminating ostad,gilbrook indicates that seyfer properly may be held liable.thus,as to seyfer,the district court denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law was entirely correct.
because ohsu has waived any right to have its liability considered apart from that of seyfer,the finding of liability against the university also was proper.
jury instructions 
substantial or motivating factor instruction 
seyfer and ohsu argue that they are entitled to a new trial because the district court gave the jury an improper instruction on the meaning of substantial or motivating under healthy.we review a decision to deny a rule motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.see silver sage partners city of desert hot springs,cir.likewise,we review a district court formulation of jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.see monroe,at.however,if a party alleges that the trial court misstated the elements that must be proved at trial,we review the issue de novo as a matter of law.see cessna aircraft,cir.
healthy requires that a plaintiff prove that protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the termination decision.healthy,at.the written jury instructions indicated that ostad had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence 
that seyfer was aware,prior to the time that he recommended the plaintiff termination,that ostad had questioned seyfer billing practices.
that this questioning was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to discharge the plaintiff from ohsu program and 
that the defendants acts were the proximate or legal cause of damages sustained by the plaintiff.
the court clearly instructed the jury that it was the defendants burden to show that they would have terminated ostad even in the absence of any protected activity 
if you find in the plaintiff favor on each of the facts that the plaintiff must prove,you must then consider whether the defendants have shown by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff would have been terminated from the program for other reasons even in the absence of plaintiff questions regarding seyfer billing practices.if you find that defendants have proven that plaintiff wou
