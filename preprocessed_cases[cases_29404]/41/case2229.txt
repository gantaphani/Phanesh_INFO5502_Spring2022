marie bernadette mendiondo appeals from the district court order dismissing her complaint.mendiondo worked as a nurse at centinela hospital medical center chmc and alleged that,following her complaints regarding false billing and reimbursement practices and substandard patient care,she was wrongfully terminated in violation of the federal false claims act fca h,the california false claims act cfca california government code b,california health and safety code,and the public policies embodied by these laws.
this appeal requires that we decide whether a claim for wrongful termination under the fca and cfca,brought in federal court,must meet the notice pleading standard in federal rule of civil procedure a or the heightened pleading standard in rule b.we hold that the rule a standard applies.because mendiondo complaint,though inartfully drafted,meets the rule a notice pleading standard with respect to all of her claims,we reverse and remand.
background 
mendiondo began her nursing career in and specialized in critical care.in,she accepted a nursing position in the cardiovascular department at chmc.mendiondo detected certain practices at chmc that were intended to inflate medicare reimbursements and alleges that she was investigating these practices.she alleges,for example,that one of the doctors at chmc ordered and performed numerous unnecessary cardiac catheterizations,including repeat catheterizations on the same patients.additionally,mendiondo claims that the hospital insisted on implanting single ventricular pacemakers,even when patients needed biventricular pacemakers,because the single pacemakers resulted in higher medicare reimbursements.mendiondo asserts that chmc also obtained reimbursement for more catheterization and radiologic procedures than were actually performed by having billing personnel manually change the billing records.further,mendiondo alleges the hospital manipulated the length of time it kept patients on observation status or as inpatients in order to maximize medicare reimbursements,without regard to the medical necessities and in violation of medicare reimbursement guidelines.
mendiondo further alleges that from the time she started working there,chmc pressured her to cut costs and reduce services.for example,she asserts that chmc refused to use the safest drug for heart attacks because of cost reasons and used outdated cardiac equipment.
in,mendiondo informed the chief executive officer ceo of chmc,harry koening,that her supervisors expected her to engage in actions that were below the standard of care,would put her nursing license in jeopardy,and could lead to civil and criminal violations.in november,mendiondo started reporting to a new supervisor,ziporah frankel,who demanded that mendiondo cut costs or be fired.when mendiondo objected that the measures would jeopardize patient care,frankel instructed her to follow the measures regardless.
on august,chmc terminated mendiondo.chmc explained that the termination was the result of mendiondo inadequate job performance.mendiondo believes chmc terminated her because she demanded that minimum state and federal standards of health care be maintained,and because of her investigation into facts relating to chmc submission of false claims and false records to the government.
procedural history 
on august,mendiondo and two colleagues filed this action against chmc,tenet healthcare corporation tenet,and three other associated health care groups the complaint alleged causes of action for violations of the fca and cfca retaliation in violation of the whistleblower provisions in the fca and cfca retaliation in violation of the california health and safety code section and wrongful termination in violation of the public policies embodied in these laws.
pursuant to b,which governs private actions under the fca,plaintiffs filed the complaint under seal and served a copy on the federal government.the government declined to intervene,the court unsealed the complaint,and plaintiffs served chmc and tenet.
plaintiffs stipulated to dismiss with prejudice the fca and cfca violation claims,leaving their retaliation and wrongful termination claims.chmc then moved to dismiss the action under federal rules of civil procedure e,b,b.in their opposition,plaintiffs argued that they had properly pleaded all of their remaining claims,and,in the alternative,requested leave to amend any pleading deficiencies.the district court granted the motion to dismiss without discussion and without indicating whether mendiondo had leave to amend.mendiondo filed a timely notice of appeal from the order.a judgment,however,was never entered.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b and for failure to allege fraud with particularity pursuant to rule b.united states ex rel.lee smithkline beecham,cir.
iii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district court.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,disposing of all the claims in plaintiffs complaint,and did not address plaintiffs request for leave to amend.the court,however,did not enter final judgment.an order dismissing all of the claims in a complaint,but not the action itself,is not a final,appealable order.knevelbaard dairies kraft foods,cir.however,if it appears that the district court intended the dismissal to dispose of the action,it may be considered final and appealable.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we must decide whether the court intended its order to be final.
by not addressing plaintiffs request for leave to amend,the district court order necessarily entailed a denial of the request and a determination that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we infer that the district court intended to make the dismissal final for purposes of.id.
the district court entered the order of dismissal on june,and mendiondo filed a notice of appeal on july,within the period for filing as prescribed by federal rule of appellate procedure a a.accordingly,mendiondo filed a timely notice of appeal.
thus,we conclude that this court has jurisdiction over the appeal.
iv.discussion 
rule a notice pleading applies to fca retaliation 
the parties dispute whether a fca retaliation claim must meet the notice pleading standard in rule a or the heightened pleading standard in rule b.rule a requires that a pleading contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.rule a applies to all civil claims except those containing averments of fraud or mistake,which must be pleaded with particularity under rule b.the supreme court has narrowly construed rule b to apply only to the types of actions enumerated in the alleging fraud or has not extended the heightened pleading standard to other legal theories.see swierkiewicz sorema,d declining to apply rule b to claims for violations of or employment discrimination claims.
because the fca is an statute and requires fraud allegations,complaints alleging a fca violation must fulfill the requirements of rule b.california,cir.in this case,however,we are presented only with mendiondo fca retaliation claim,not a fca violation claim.in the only federal appellate decision addressing the pleading standard for a fca retaliation claim,the first circuit concluded that,unlike a fca violation claim,a fca retaliation claim does not require a showing of fraud and therefore need not meet the heightened pleading requirements of rule b.united states ex rel.karvelas,cir.we agree.
the elements differ for a fca violation claim and a fca retaliation claim.to state a claim for a fca violation,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant actually violated the fca by knowingly submitting a false claim or providing faulty goods to the government.see a describing acts that constitute violations of the fca.in contrast,to state a fca retaliation claim,a plaintiff must show that he or she suspected that the defendant submitted a false that the defendant actually submitted one.see graham county soil water
