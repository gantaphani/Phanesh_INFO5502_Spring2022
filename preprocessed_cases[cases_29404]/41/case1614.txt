william gray alleges that his son,a student with autism,was not provided a free appropriate public education fape by lathrop school district the district as required by the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.he and mother brought a successful challenge through an administrative hearing process.the district reversed the decision of the administrative panel,and gray appeals.we affirm.
in fall transferred to the district from putnam county school district putnam as a fourth grader.he had been educated at putnam under an individualized education plan iep as required by the idea for students with disabilities.d a an evaluation of at putnam in determined that although he could read words comfortably at the third grade level,his comprehension was at a pre first grade level.he did not know the value of coins.last iep from putnam described him as engaging in disruptive behaviors.he did not acknowledge his peers,and his speech was echolalic and robotic.
was among the first students with autism in the district.anticipating his arrival,special services director ken quick and other district employees enrolled in autism training.the district first iep for included occupational and speech language therapies and a full time paraprofessional.was to spend of his day in the special education classroom of cindy nance and some time in regular education classes.
nance,who had over two decades of experience teaching students with disabilities,noticed that exhibited behaviors similar to those described by putnam.for example,would bite his finger when in the regular education classroom,recite from movies,and engage in loud outbursts.according to nance these behaviors were severe and impeded ability to learn.by december also began to exhibit sexual behaviors at school,including touching his penis.
katie alexander,occupational therapist from,attempted to address sexual behaviors,but the district hired marilyn stubbs,an autism and behavioral specialist,in april.she conducted a functional behavior assessment fba of sexual behaviors,collecting eight weeks of daily data from district staff,observing the student,and consulting with gray father.based on her data stubbs developed a behavior plan designed to decrease inappropriate behaviors and increase appropriate behaviors.the district implemented her suggested strategies.
iep team,which included his father,nance,stubbs,alexander,quick,and parent advocate rand hodgson,convened in may to discuss extended school year services esy,a behavior plan,and diagnostic staffing.the team deemed eligible for esy,discussed his behaviors,and agreed to conduct a full reevaluation of in fall.the district hired an outside licensed psychologist to evaluate cognitive and adaptive behavioral abilities.
the iep team met several times later that fall to discuss the reevaluation and prepare iep.gray attended each meeting.iep for the school year iep included a section titled present level of performance describing how his autism impacted his ability to access the general sixth grade curriculum.for example,was challenged to participate in activities which require motor skills such as art and physical education class.
the iep also documented progress on his prior iep goals,incorporated information from the reevaluation,and established a series of goals and objectives.in addition,the iep discussed disruptive behaviors,both sexual and nonsexual,and included a behavior plan with strategies to address problems as well as a sensory diet to curb improper behaviors.
iep for the school year iep similarly described his present level of performance and noted his progress in both academic and non academic areas.for example,while his iep stated that demonstrates a desire for social interaction and a sense of belonging,his iep observed that he has learned to greet people with visual prompts.the iep contained a revised behavior plan with strategies and a modified sensory diet.it set academic goals and objectives but also included a separate list of occupational therapy goals.christi foreman,speech language therapist for the and school years,provided him with daily,thirty minute,one on one sessions.
there is conflicting evidence about whether behaviors improved.between and,spent less time in regular education classes such as physical education.the administrative panel which ultimately ruled against the district nonetheless concluded that made progress on many of the goals in his and ieps.
in january,gray and mother requested a due process hearing from the missouri department of elementary and secondary education.see f.they argued,among other related claims,that the district denied a fape by failing to craft appropriate ieps for the and school years,and failed to provide them adequate prior written notice and excluded and limited their participation during the and school years.see b.the parents sought,among other relief,reimbursement for services they allegedly procured and compensatory education and related services.
in march,parents arranged for a representative from partners in behavioral milestones pbm to observe for a few hours.pbm trains education professionals and parents to manage behaviors in children with autism.it also runs an independent academy,the milestones academy milestones,for such children.at an iep meeting in may,gray requested that the district place d.at milestones for the school year,but the team rejected the proposal in part on the ground that it was not the least restrictive environment as required by the idea.a a.
the three member administrative panel held an eighteen day hearing over the course of several months and rendered its decision in august.a two member majority concluded that the and ieps were deficient because they lacked baseline data.it also concluded that the ieps denied a fape because they inadequately addressed his behaviors and social skills.the panel ruled against the parents on their participation and notice complaints,however,as well as their claim for reimbursement for private education expenses.the panel ordered to be placed in a state approved agency for students with autism.
the district challenged the panel decision in federal court.see i.gray asserted counterclaims,including an argument that the district violated the idea by not immediately complying with the panel order.the district court remanded the case because the panel had incorrectly placed the burden of persuasion on the district.see schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast,burden of proof lies with party challenging the iep.
on remand the panel upheld its original decision in its entirety.the district again filed suit and gray asserted the same counterclaims.the district moved for summary judgment or judgment on the administrative record,asserting that the panel decision was legally erroneous and unsupported by the evidence.it also moved for judgment on the pleadings with regard to gray counterclaims.gray moved for judgment on the administrative record.the court granted the district motions,and denied as moot gray motion.gray appeals.
while the district court must accord due weight to the administrative panel decision,the burden of persuasion remains with gray as the party challenging the iep,see sch.bd.renollett,cir,and the panel decision must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.i c iii.whether a school district has offered a free appropriate public education is a mixed question of fact and law and the district court ultimate determination is reviewed de novo.fort zumwalt sch.dist.clynes,cir.when reviewing a summary judgment we view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non moving party,affirming only where the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ex rel.indep.sch.dist,cir.
the idea entitles students with disabilities to a fape.because each child needs and abilities are unique,however,the law does not mandate the acquisition of specific knowledge or strict equality of opportunity or services.bd.of educ.rowley.t he idea does not require that schools attempt to maximize a child potential,or,as a matter of fact,guarantee that the student actually make any progress at all.cjn minneap
