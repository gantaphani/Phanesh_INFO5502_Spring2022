the family and medical leave act fmla entitles eligible employees to up to twelve weeks of medical leave each year b ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d.the principal issue in this case is the meaning of that phrase,in light of regulations issued by the department of labor.the case also involves supplemental claims under state law for breach of implied promise and promissory estoppel.
background 
mark jones accepted a job as a telecommunications technician with the denver public schools the district on may.although jones was unaware of it,the written job description required that all technicians hold a valid driver license.the month before,jones driver license had been suspended for five years on account of multiple offenses.on his first day of work,the manager of the telecommunications department told jones,i think we can work around that.vol.i.
on may,jones signed an employment agreement that included express language making him an employee 
the school district and the employee recognize that the employee is an at will employee,and that the employee can terminate the employment relationship for any reason at any time,and the school district can also terminate the employment relationship for any reason at any time.
id.at.the district changed jones employment status in august,making him a classified employee rather than an hourly employee.policy,which concerns the dismissal of classified district employees,entitles employees facing discharge to two hearings upon request,one before the human resources administrator and another before an impartial hearing officer,to determine if there is any competent evidence to support the recommended dismissal.id.at.policy also states that those procedures do not change the status of classified employees.id.
until june,jones worked under the supervision of his father.complained that during this period,jones abused the sick leave policy by taking more sick days than he was allotted.some believed he was a hypochondriac or that he called in sick after nights of drinking.also,his lack of a driver license proved inconvenient to,who were required to drive jones to and from work,as well as to and from job sites.jones also reportedly refused to comply with the department break policy,even after receiving a written reprimand.after his father retirement,jones came under the supervision of defendant jerry brinkley.shortly thereafter,brinkley gave jones a formal job evaluation rating his performance fair in fourteen categories and poor in six categories.the evaluation summarized jones deficiencies as follows 
mark needs to work on absenteeism,negativism,anger management,listening skills and guidance acceptance marks sic main strengths are quality and technical knowledge.his weakness lies in his personal judgments,prioritization and absenteeism.
problems came to a head in early october.on monday,october,jones claims that he fell at his home and aggravated a back injury.on monday and tuesday,he called in sick,stayed at home,and took ibuprofin,but did not call a doctor.when he called in sick again on wednesday,his supervisor told him he would need to bring a note from his doctor upon his return to work.on thursday,october,jones visited ryan kramer,who gave him a cortisone shot,indicated in his notes that jones had pain mid butt to mid calf,and wrote him a note that read off work from thru due to wrenched back.id.at.kramer asked jones to schedule a visit for roughly three weeks later.
by sunday morning,october,jones back pain had subsided and he felt well enough to work.that afternoon,however,he became sick with the flu,and he therefore called in sick again on monday and tuesday.
jones was terminated when he returned to work on wednesday.a letter of dismissal,written by brinkley and dated october,stated 
you are being dismissed due to your inability to conform with the job requirements of a telecommunications technician.your unreliable attendance record,as evidenced from the last days sic absence,is counterproductive to the efficient operation of the department of technology services.
id.at.upon learning that jones was entitled to hearings under policy,brinkley sent jones a second letter on october,offering additional reasons for the dismissal.the second letter cited the department shrinking workload,as well as jones unreliable attendance record,violations of the break policy,and lack of a driver license,in support of the decision.
jones visited kramer again on october.the doctor notes from the second visit include a passing reference to jones back pain reviewed.id.at.jones apparently has not sought medical treatment for his back condition since october.
pursuant to policy,jones requested and received a hearing before the human resources director,as well as an appeal before an impartial hearing officer.both proceedings upheld the dismissal,which became effective november.
jones brought this action in september against the district,brinkley,and two other school officials in their individual capacities,raising three claims interference under the fmla breach of implied contract under colorado law and promissory estoppel under colorado law.in an oral ruling,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment as to all claims.the district court granted summary judgment on the fmla claim on the ground that a jury could not reasonably infer that the reason for jones termination was his absence from work on account of his back pain.tr.the court noted that he was also fired because he does have a driver license,which was a job requirement.id.at.the court rejected his common law claims summarily 
i granting the summary judgment.the promissory estoppel does make it.there an express contract,and ca rely on somebody telling you we can work around that to make that an enforceable promise.and,there no implied contract.judgment will enter for the defendants.
on appeal,jones presses all three claims.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,wells.dep t of,cir,and affirm only if the record,considered in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,establishes no genuine issue of material fact,anderson liberty lobby,d.
ii.fmla interference 
the fmla makes it unlawful for any covered employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided in this subchapter.a.to make out a prima facie claim for fmla interference,a plaintiff must establish that he was entitled to fmla leave,that some adverse action by the employer interfered with his right to take fmla leave,and that the employer action was related to the exercise or attempted exercise of his fmla rights.see bones honeywell int l,cir.
the district court granted summary judgment on the basis of the third element whether the district decision to terminate jones was related to his absence from work during that week.the court held that because of the multiple reasons listed by brinkley in his second letter of,his lack of a valid driver licence,which was a requirement of the reasonable jury could infer that he was terminated on account of his absence.plaintiff argues that,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to himself,as the party,there are disputed issues of material fact precluding that holding.specifically,he argues that only the first letter of termination,which focused on his absence,is worthy of credibility,and that a jury could infer that the second letter was pretextual.we need not reach this issue,however,because we conclude that jones absence from work during the week of october was not caused by a serious health condition as defined in the statute and regulations,and thus was not protected by the fmla.
the fmla entitles a qualified employee to up to twelve weeks of leave during any twelve month period b ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d.the statute defines serious health condition to mean an illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.id.under regulations promulgated by the department of labor,continuing treatment by a health care provider includes 
a period of incapacity,inability to work,attend school or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition,treatment therefor,or recovery therefrom of more than three consecutive calendar days,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition,that also involves 
a treatment two or more times by a health care provider or 
b treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider.
a i.for purposes of the regulations,treatment includes both examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition,while a regimen of continuing treatment includes a course of prescription medication,an antibiotic or therapy requiring special equipment,oxygen but excludes regimens that consist solely of medications,bed rest,fluids,or exercise.id.b.neither jones nor the defendants challenge the agency interpretation of the underlying statute.
we assume,for the sake of argument,that jones testimony and kramer notes create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether jones suffered a period of incapacity from october through the morning of october,a period in excess of three consecutive calendar days.the more difficult question is whether jones two visits to kramer,first on october and again on october,satisfy the requirement of t reatment two or more times by a health care provider under a i a.
both visits amount to treatment under the agency definition.however cursory kramer examinations,his actions fit the two descriptions of treatment in b.at the first visit,he examined jones to determine if a serious health condition exist ed,and his note excusing jones from work documents his findings.at the second,he performed an evaluation of the condition,as evidenced by his handwritten note that jones back was improving.
the timing of the two visits,however,presents a separate question under the regulations.continuing treatment requires that a plaintiff experience a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition,that also involves either two or more treatments,or a single treatment followed by a regimen of continuing treatment.a i.several district courts have held that the regulation by its plain language merely requires two or more treatments,without distinguishing between treatments occurring during or after the initial period of incapacity.summerville esco,d,see also jones willow gardens,no,wl,george associated stationers,the regulations do not specify a time period during which the minimum two examinations must take place.because jones second treatment took place more than two weeks after his back pain and period of incapacity subsided,he urges us to adopt an interpretation that indefinitely extends the timeframe for treatment two or more times.
yet this indefinite timeframe reading defies the text,runs contrary to congress intent,and places employers in a position of grave uncertainty in complying with their obligations under the fmla.we disagree that the plain language of the regulation imposes no time limit on the requisite two or more treatments.according to the regulation,a serious health condition that involves continuing treatment includes a period of incapacity,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition,that also involves t reatment two or more times by a health care provider.a i emphasis added.the question is whether the italicized phrase that also involves modifies period of incapacity or whether it modifies the entire phrase period of incapacity,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition.id.if the two or more treatments must take place during the period of incapacity,jones can not prevail under this definition.if the two or more treatments may take place either during the period of incapacity or during any subsequent treatment,however,his second session with kramer would make him qualify.
the grammatical and logical structure of the regulation suggests that the former interpretation is more likely.first,to read the regulation as allowing one or both of the required treatments to take place during any subsequent treatment would eliminate any necessary temporal connection between the period of incapacity and the treatments.if that was congress intention,however,the regulation could have simply required that the underlying medical condition involve both a period of incapacity and two or more treatments,with no connection between them.that the regulation instead frames the definition in terms of a period of incapacity that involves at least two treatments indicates that the timing of the treatments,and not just the need for treatments,is important.indeed,structurally,the regulation consistently frames its alternative definitions as a set of conditions on a period of incapacity.see a ii a ny period of incapacity due to pregnancy,or for prenatal care id.a iii a ny period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition id.a iv a period of incapacity which is permanent or due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective.this emphasis on the period of incapacity reinforces the view that the necessary treatments must be temporally linked to that period.
second,to read the phrase that also involves as modifying the combination of the period of incapacity and any subsequent treatment would collapse the distinction between i a,which provides for t reatment two or more times,and i b,which provides for t reatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider.the latter provision contemplates the situation where the worker obtains only one treatment during the period of incapacity,but where that treatment results in a continuing regimen of treatment which extends beyond the period of incapacity.indefinitely extending the timeframe for the two treatments renders subpart b almost entirely redundant the provisions would retain independent meaning only to the extent a regimen of continuing treatment never involves treatment.it seems odd for the regulation to specify the need for a full regimen of continuing treatment after the period of incapacity if a single subsequent treatment suffices.
third,the verb involves rather than involve indicates that the subject is singular period of incapacity,not plural period of incapacity and any subsequent treatment.to treat the entire phrase a period of incapacity,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition as a conjunctive subject would render it plural,and would necessitate use of the plural verb involve.see id.a i.
we therefore read the statutory phrase as equivalent to the following 
a serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider includes a period of incapacity that also involves t reatment two or more times by a health care provider,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition.
under this definition,to qualify for fmla protection,the health condition must be sufficiently serious that it entails an absence of more than three consecutive calendar days during which the employee obtained treatment by a health care provider at least two times or one time followed by a regimen of continuing treatment.
the function of the phrase,and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition,under this reading,is not to extend the period during which the employee may obtain the two treatments,but to extend the temporal dimension of the serious medical condition so as to require the employer to grant leave for subsequent treatments or periods of impairment even if they would not
