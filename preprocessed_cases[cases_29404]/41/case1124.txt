background 
on august,a jury convicted carolyn sue davis and her husband,otis davis,on twelve counts of aiding and abetting medicare fraud in violation of and,with each of the twelve counts based on claims filed on behalf of particular named patients,and one count of obstruction of a criminal investigation involving federal healthcare offenses,in violation of a.these charges stemmed from the davis orchestration of and participation in a scheme to supply oxygen to coal miners suffering from black lung disease.davis was instrumental in the founding of the kentucky black lung association hereinafter kbla,an organization designed to help miners obtain black lung benefits,as well as other goods and services they might need in order to live with the disease.she would send miners that were associated with the kbla to raghu sundaram,a pulmonary doctor,for the requisite medical testing.sundaram established a special clinic for individuals associated with the kbla,at which davis volunteered.sundaram was also named in the indictment as an aider and abetter but was acquitted at the joint trial.
from sundaram office,the patients were directed to j j medical,a durable medical equipment hereinafter dme company created and owned by davis,a retired coal miner,for their oxygen supplies.a dme company is paid by medicare for supplying equipment by submitting a certificate of medical necessity hereinafter cmn,created electronically from a form and electronically submitted to the insurer,here,medicare contractor palmetto gba,which pays upon its processing of the claim.a cmn contains three sections with instructions as to the party to complete each portion.the middle portion,section b,requires someone from the doctor office to provide the patient levels.the form explicitly stipulates that the supplier of the health care product is not to fill out this medical information.at the bottom of the form,the doctor is to sign and confirm that the medical information is true and accurate.
the investigation of j j medical began in march of,when a health and human services investigator discovered information about questionable practices of the company in relation to sundaram.examination revealed that the vast majority of j j medical clients were referrals from sundaram.it also indicated that davis,as a volunteer at sundaram clinics,had special access to the doctor patients,their files,and their prescriptions.during an interview with the investigator,and later at trial,sundaram unequivocally stated that he had never authorized anyone to sign prescription forms for him,nor had he authorized anyone to sign a cmn for him.
yet at trial,witnesses from the offices of sundaram and j j medical testified that they personally observed davis doctoring prescriptions and forging the doctor signature on them,as well as forging his signatures and including data on cmns without any paperwork to ensure that the data required for medicare reimbursement was accurate.connie webb,who volunteered in sundaram office,testified that davis directed her to go to j j medical on at least four or five occasions to sign the doctor name to cmns.upon completion of the forms,webb would have someone at the j j medical office supply her with copies of the forms,which she could insert into the patient charts upon returning to the doctor office.letha justice,davis son cohabitating girlfriend whom davis paid for her work at sundaram clinic,testified that she went to the davis home,where,at davis direction,she wrote figures in section b of the cmns,though davis did not consult any patient files when dictating the numbers to fill in.justice recounted that she filled in data on more than a hundred cmn forms per davis instructions.phyllis bennett blair,a billing agent for j j medical,recalled witnessing davis herself signing sundaram name to cmn forms,even practicing duplicating his signature.blair and margaret lawson,another billing agent for j j medical,both testified to refusing davis requests that they,too,participate in fraudulent completions of cmns.
multiple witnesses also testified as to the falsification of sheets,forms used in sundaram office,but not legally required,as a measure to ensure patients had a choice of medical suppliers.blair,amanda tibbs,a medical billing agent working in the same building as j j medical,and jennifer akers,davis daughter and an employee of j j medical,recounted at trial that davis directed a group at the j j medical office to fill out sheets,sign them with the patients names,copy them,and put them in patient files.
in addition to recalling instances of fraud that they witnessed in the course of the medicare fraud scheme itself,many testified as to the various ways the davis attempted to cover up their misdeeds when they became aware of the investigation.blair testified that davis offered to give her fifteen dollars to remove all of the prescriptions and anything that would incriminate her.upon her refusal,she stated that davis ultimately removed the items.jennifer akers and her husband both took the stand and testified that and davis together came to their house to request that they hide a garbage bag containing improperly completed cmns and prescriptions at various stages of completion.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found davis and davis guilty on all twelve counts of violating and as well as the single count of obstruction of justice in violation of a.upon conviction for health care fraud and obstruction of justice,davis was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for,and davis received a sentence of imprisonment.both received three years of supervised release,a special assessment of on each count,and direction to make restitution in the amount of,imposed jointly and severally on davis and davis.here,they each appeal their conviction on counts one through twelve,based on various errors allegedly committed by the trial court.
defendant carolyn sue davis 
defendant carolyn sue davis argues on appeal that the trial court erred by excluding evidence that oxygen received by the miners was medically necessary,asserting such evidence to be relevant to whether any alleged misrepresentations were material.in essence,davis posits that those paperwork mistakes,if any,only resulted in payments of claims that were proper rather that any false statements of medical necessity where none existed.four of the miners named in the first twelve counts testified that they did need oxygen and continued to receive oxygen.davis suggests that,during her trial on charges of health care fraud,she should have been permitted to introduce evidence that the eight others also actually had a valid basis for receiving oxygen,in an effort to prove that medicare only paid for treatment that was medically justified,even if the cmns themselves were not completed with perfect accuracy and honesty.the trial court decision to admit or exclude evidence is within the discretion of the trial judge and will be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.in re air crash disaster,cir.
