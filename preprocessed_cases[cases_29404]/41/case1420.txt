denise and jaron chlopek sued breg,incorporated,the manufacturer of the polar care,a device that delivers cooling therapy to postoperative patients.after nearly ten days of continuous use of the device on her right foot,denise experienced decreased blood flow and tissue damage in her right big toe.the chlopeks alleged that the polar care was defective because it contained no warning about the dangers of continuous use.however,a jury found that the device was not defective.the chlopeks appeal,arguing that the district court erroneously denied their motion for a new trial.they assert that errors relating to evidentiary matters,the jury instructions,and the district judge conduct rendered their trial unfair.having determined that none of the alleged errors resulted in an unfair trial,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
after undergoing several surgeries on her right big toe in the late,denise chlopek functioned well for more than a decade.she was mobile,experienced minimal pain,and was able to work as a nurse.but in early,she suddenly began to experience severe pain in her right foot,and she sought treatment from andrew pankratz,a podiatrist at the marshfield clinic in eau claire,wisconsin.pankratz determined that the artificial joint that had been implanted in chlopek toe in had fractured and failed.chlopek toe was significantly deformed.after discussing two treatment options with pankratz,chlopek elected to have fusion surgery,wherein a bone fragment from her hip would be implanted in her big toe to improve stability and capability.
chlopek underwent surgery at the eau claire surgical center on may.pankratz,along with an orthopedic surgeon,performed the surgery,which was uneventful.after the procedure,pankratz prescribed cold therapy for chlopek to prevent swelling and treat pain.toward that end,he prescribed a polar care,which he applied to chlopek foot himself after wrapping the foot in several layers of bandages.
the polar care,manufactured by breg,is a device consisting of a cooler attached by a tube to a pad that is wrapped around the patient affected area.a pump,powered by electricity,circulates ice water from the cooler through the tube and into the pad,allowing for more cold water to cycle into the pad as heat from the body warms it.breg markets the polar care as continuous cooling therapy.the device is a class ii medical device,which,for purposes of this case,means that the food and drug administration must initially approve the device for its intended use and thereafter the manufacturer must report complaints about the device to the agency.the polar care is not marketed to the public rather,breg sells the devices to medical professionals who in turn prescribe it to their patients.in,the polar care had a warning label affixed to its side with the following admonitions 
caution federal law restricts this device for sale by or on the order of a licensed health care practitioner.
warning carefully read use instructions and warnings before operation.
warning always apply a dressing or other moisture barrier between the pad and the patient skin.
warning a licensed health care practitioner must consider each patient sensitivity to cold.a periodic inspection of the patient skin under the pad is recommended.if a noticeable change in skin appearance in the area of the cold application is observed such as burning,itching,blistering,discoloration,or increased swelling more than an hour after use,discontinue use of this product and consult physician immediately.always apply a barrier or dressing between the pad and the patient skin.caution should be taken during prolonged use,for children,diabetics,incapacitated patients,and those with decreased skin sensitivity or poor circulation.
warning carefully read use instructions and warnings provided with the water circulating pad that is to be used with this pump.
chlopek was discharged on may,the day of her surgery.pankratz did not give her any directions with respect to the proper use of the polar care and admittedly did not read the warnings on the unit.however,before chlopek left the clinic,a discharge nurse gave her written instructions to keep her foot elevated,leave the bandage in place at all times,and continue using the cold therapy for two weeks chlopek was due back at the clinic for a appointment on july.
chlopek followed the instructions that the discharge nurse gave her,but she did not read the warning label on the polar care.her husband did read the label,and,concluding the warnings were not inconsistent with the discharge instructions,continued to follow the nurse instructions.accordingly,chlopek used the polar care device continuously,removing the cooling pad only when she went to the bathroom.after nine days,she noticed that her baby,according to chlopek,was then visible only because the dressing applied by pankratz had purple.pankratz maintains that the tips of chlopek toes were always visible.she returned to the clinic the next day.
according to chlopek,when pankratz removed the bandage on her foot,he exclaimed,this looks like frostbite.pankratz instructed chlopek to discontinue use of the polar care,but he advised her to apply ice behind her knee three times per day.his treatment notes for the day of his visit do not say anything about frostbite or thermal injury,but he noted blistering and grayish discoloration characteristic of ischemia decreased blood flow on chlopek toes.over the next month,chlopek returned to the clinic for a series of appointments.the damaged tissue in chlopek toe was beyond repair,and so pankratz waited until a clear demarcation became evident between the damaged and healthy tissue.at that point,on july,he amputated the damaged tissue,which amounted to chlopek entire right big toe.
after the amputation,the chlopeks sued breg and its insurer in the circuit court of eau claire county,wisconsin.they alleged that the polar care was defective because its warning label did not caution consumers that continuous use could lead to thermal injuries.after service the defendants removed the case to federal district court.the chlopeks survived breg motion for summary judgment,and a jury trial was scheduled.over the plaintiffs objection,the district court decided to bifurcate the trial only if the jury found during the first phase that breg product was defective would a trial on the chlopeks damages be held.
before trial,the district court resolved a number of evidentiary motions.as relevant here,the court granted in large part the defendants motion to exclude the form of breg records of customer other thermal injuries potentially caused by the polar care and its sister unit,the polar care the court admitted one of ten incident reports related to the polar care upon concluding that the incident occurred under substantially similar circumstances to those leading to chlopek injury the court further decided that admitting evidence involving the polar care would waste time and confuse the issues.the district court also excluded evidence that breg changed the warnings on the polar care sometime after chlopek injury it determined that the evidence was barred under federal rule of evidence as a later remedial measure.
jury selection began on april.during voir dire,the court asked the potential jurors a number of standard questions relating to their knowledge of the parties,the attorneys,and the facts of the case,and their participation in lawsuits in the past as parties or witnesses.the court inquired generally about the potential jurors attitudes toward the commencement of lawsuits,the administration of justice generally,or jury awards,but the court did not did not ask whether the potential jurors had strong opinions about tort reform or civil damages.after completing its voir dire,the district court asked the parties if they had additional questions for the potential jurors.the court made a few additional inquiries at the defendants behest,and then the parties exercised their challenges.a jury was empaneled.
the trial began with the testimony of denise and jaron chlopek.the plaintiffs also called lee sapetti,a mechanical engineer who testified about the design of the polar care and opined that the product lacked an adequate warning about potential hazards from continuous use.finally,pankratz testified for the plaintiffs,opining that the continuous use of the polar care was one of three possible causes of chlopek injury the others being existing vascular damage from prior surgeries and decreased blood flow caused by cigarette smoking.among breg witnesses were two experts.the first,an engineer with expertise in thermal science,testified that the polar care can not create skin temperatures cold enough to cause frostbite.the second was lance silverman,an orthopedic surgeon,who opined that the use of the polar care was not a cause of the ischemia that led to the amputation of chlopek toe.at one point during the of silverman,the plaintiff attorney,drew ryberg,grew frustrated with the witness for giving answers when no question had been asked,or for giving unresponsive answers to counsel questions.as silverman responded to a question with a narrative,ryberg interjected excuse me,doctor.this is done in a format and please deal with the questions i ask as we proceed.in response,the district judge chastised ryberg and instructed the jury to disregard his comments 
please do not argue to the jury.i wish you would disregard counsel continual testifying and arguing to the jury.there is a simple procedure which you have learned yet.when an answer comes in that nonresponsive,you object thereafter.that the gentlemanly way to do it,that the ethical way to do it,and that the way to do it before this jury.
ryberg returned to his without objecting or asking for a sidebar to protest the judge remarks.
at the close of evidence,breg moved for judgment as a matter of law,and the district court denied the motion.the judge instructed the jury and sent them to deliberate with a special verdict form.the form,which was used over the plaintiffs objection,first asked the jury to decide whether the polar care was defective.if the jury answered the question in the negative,it was to proceed no further.if it concluded that the polar care was defective,it was to go on to determine whether the defect was a cause of chlopek injury.again,if the jurors answered yes,they were to proceed to a series of questions related to the issue of comparative fault on the part of chlopek,her husband,pankratz,and the marshfield clinic.
the jury found at the first step that the polar care was not defective and did not answer the remaining questions.on the basis of the special verdict,the district court entered judgment for the defendants.shortly thereafter the chlopeks filed a motion for a new trial.see.e.they argued that the trial was unfair for several reasons.first,they asserted that they had been prejudiced by the bifurcation of the trial and the district court failure to explain the procedure to the jury.second,they challenged the court exclusion of evidence of other accidents and of the changes to the polar care warning label.third,they argued that they had been prejudiced by the judge rebuke of attorney ryberg during the of silverman.finally,they maintained that the special verdict form confused the issues in the case and unfairly invited the jury to answer the first question in the negative and go home early.the district court,unpersuaded by any of the arguments,denied the motion.
on appeal the chlopeks renew most of the arguments they made in their motion for a new trial,although they address them in a rather cursory manner.we review the denial of the motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.see naeem mckesson drug,cir.we note that,although the substance of this case was governed by wisconsin law,the issues the chlopeks have raised on appeal are all evidentiary or procedural,and we therefore apply federal law.see schindler seiler,cir bevolo carter,cir.
the chlopeks first argue that the district court committed reversible error when it excluded most of their proffered evidence of other injuries involving the polar care and all the evidence they sought to introduce of injuries involving the polar care.in a case,evidence of other accidents is relevant to show the existence of a danger,the defendant notice of the danger,and the cause of the accident.weir crown equip,cir citing nachtsheim beech aircraft,cir.however,before the evidence will be admitted,the proponent must show that the other accidents occurred under substantially similar circumstances.id.as we explained in nachtsheim,this showing is necessary because the probative force of evidence of other accidents decreases a s the circumstances and conditions of the other accidents become less similar to the accident under consideration.nachtsheim,at.at the same time,the risk of unfair prejudice remains,along with potential costs in terms of time and distraction.id.
the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the evidence.first,we note that the court held a hearing at which it individually considered each accident report relating to the polar care that the plaintiffs sought to admit.these ten reports,comprising exhibit,depicted complaints of redness,blistering,burns,nerve damage,frostbite,and other symptoms,on the patients knees,feet,or legs.the district court admitted exhibit,the report of an injury under circumstances the court deemed most similar to chlopek a complaint of frostbite on the foot and ankle area after the patient used the polar care continuously after surgery.the remaining incidents,the court determined,were not similar enough,either because the injury was to another body part,the type of injury was unclear or not of the same nature as chlopek,or the nature of the complaint was different for example,some consumers simply complained of the absence of temperature control.the chlopeks do not address the reports individually they simply state that the district court incorrectly determined that the other accidents were not a of a similar kind and that exhibit should have been admitted in its entirety.such a cursory argument can not support a reversal of the district court decision,particularly where the court discussed each report separately and gave sound reasons for distinguishing the other incidents from the one at issue.moreover,we note that the plaintiffs theory of the case was,but no information was supplied about the warnings given in the other cases a crucial point of comparison was lacking.see weir,at.
as for exhibit,the plaintiffs do not seriously challenge the exclusion of the accident reports related to the polar care they do not explain why any of the reported incidents was substantially similar nor do they respond to the district court reasons for exclusion.they state only that the polar care was equally capable of producing frostbite and was comparable for purposes of the trial.in fact,the district court agreed that the polar care was in many respects similar to the polar care but determined nevertheless that it was inadvisable to try the when the issue of the case was the adequacy of the warnings on the polar care.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court determination.as the court suggested,exploring injuries potentially caused by the polar care could have confused the jury and unnecessarily prolonged the trial.see.guy crown equip,cir.
the final evidentiary decision the plaintiffs challenge is the exclusion of evidence that breg changed the warning label on the polar care some time after chlopek injury the new label cautions against continuous use for more than hours.they seek to sidestep federal rule of evidence by insisting that the change was not a subsequent remedial measure because,according to the affidavit of a breg executive,the change was not prompted by safety concerns.but breg motive for making the change is irrelevant.all the rule requires is that the measure would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur.regardless of breg stated reason for the change,the plaintiffs undoubtedly wanted the jury to conclude that breg added the warning because the product was unsafe without it.that is precisely the type of inference that rule forecloses,in order to avoid discouraging the taking of remedial measures.see pastor sta
