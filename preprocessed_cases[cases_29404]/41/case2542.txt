lanny bart jarvis was terminated from his position at the united states postal service because of concerns about the danger he posed to coworkers.on august,he filed suit in the united states district court for the district of utah against the postal service,contending that it had violated the vocational rehabilitation act of rehabilitation act,et.he contended that it had discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his disability,disorder ptsd and retaliated against him for having engaged in the protected activities of seeking an accommodation and filing a discrimination complaint with the equal employment opportunity eeo office.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the postal service on both claims.it ruled that jarvis was not a qualified individual under the rehabilitation act because he posed a direct threat that could not be reasonably accommodated and he had failed to produce evidence that the postal service reasons for firing him were pretextual.jarvis filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction under.we affirm except for some components of his retaliation claims that were not addressed below we reverse and remand to the district court with respect to those matters.
background 
jarvis is a decorated vietnam war veteran.in he began working for the postal service after a medical examination determined that he was fit for duty despite several war injuries.he first learned that he had ptsd sometime in or,when,on the advice of a coworker and fellow veteran,he went to the veteran affairs hospital,was tested,and received a disability rating for ptsd.the diagnosis did not keep him from continuing to work for the postal service.
after working as a mail handler he applied in for a custodial position at provo east bay facility because the walking requirements of the position aggravated his war injuries.he told his new supervisor that he suffered from ptsd and did not like people coming up behind him and touching him.it does not appear that he requested any accommodation.not long after he began his custodial job,the postal service expanded the facility and the additional walking caused his war injuries to bother him again.a smaller facility,located in spanish fork,had an opening,and he transferred there in.once at spanish fork he started having incidents with coworkers.
cindy frazier 
on two separate occasions jarvis struck his coworker cindy frazier when she startled him.the first incident occurred in late or early while he was waiting to punch in for work at.he was daydreaming near the time clock when he heard footsteps approaching.when he turned he saw out of the corner of his eye something coming at him quickly,so he just put his hand out and cindy frazier run her breast into the palm of his hand.at.the second incident occurred in early while he was buffing the floor.again he saw something coming toward him.he stuck his foot out and kicked frazier just below the knee.frazier did not report either of these incidents to her supervisor.
leslee bishop 
jarvis had a similar incident involving leslee bishop,the of the spanish fork facility.in may he was vacuuming her office before her expected arrival at because the vacuum was loud he did not hear her when she arrived about five minutes early.according to jarvis,bishop came right up behind him and said good morning bart.id.at.startled,jarvis turned around with clenched fists to defend himself.realizing that it was bishop,he relaxed and apologized for his reaction.according to his deposition,he said 
i sorry,leslee.i did mean to startle or scare you,but i real jumpy.i been to vietnam and i got ptsd i might hurt somebody,leslee you ought to tell the rest of the crew that i have ptsd and to leave me alone,do be scaring me.if they want to talk to me or they need me to do something for them,have them come around in front of me or say something in a normal tone of voice before they approach me from the back.
id.at.she was not overly disturbed by the incident she testified at her deposition that his reaction had surprised,rather than frightened,her.she also testified that she did not recall jarvis telling her that he had ptsd,or that he had a startle response,just that he was a little jumpy.id.at.nor did she recall his asking her to tell other employees that he was jumpy or had a startle response.but after that incident she was careful not to startle jarvis,always announcing her presence from a distance when approaching him from behind.
al nielsen 
on june,bishop asked jarvis to fix the lights on larry palmer mail truck.he went to palmer case to get the keys,entered the case,and had a conversation with palmer and another mail carrier.he started to back out of the case but stopped when palmer resumed talking.he then felt two big hands forcefully grab his arms from behind,causing him to lose his balance.he stepped forward,regained his balance,and locked the arm of the attacker,al nielsen.at his deposition he explained what happened next 
a.so i locked his wrist here so the only thing he got to hold me with is his thumb,so his thumb against my deltoids,he ca hold me.i kind of act like i struggling with him,so i actually putting his wrists right there so all he has is his thumb,okay.so when i got his wrist where i want it,then i break it loose and raised my left arm,because when you raise your arm above your shoulder you start losing your strength,so you drop it back down to shoulder height or lower.so he dropped his arm down here,and i put my elbow underneath his arm and it covered up his eyes so he could see,and it left all his vital organs open.
q.so what did you do 
end of story.
no,it not the end of the story,what did you do,did you hit him 
well,did hit him with a fist,i hit him with an open palm and kind of hit him and pushed him.
where did you hit him 
right in the heart.
q.how hard did you hit him 
not hard enough to hurt him.
id.at.jarvis further explained his state of mind at the time 
i was ready to kill the guy.i did know where i was at,i was you train,and,you are a focused person,when you think your life is in danger you are very focused,you do hear nothing so i hit him like that,and he kind of went over like that.and my got to know how fast your brain works,my brain says,okay,now he down a little bit,just push his head down and hit him in the nose four or five times with your knee.and something else told me from my training,it says,your deltoids will probably not have enough power to overpower his back muscles if he tries to resist,so all you have to do is grab his hair and pull forward and he will automatically come down,then you can hit him four or five times in the nose and he will just about be out if not out for sure.then you already got ahold of his hair,all you have to do is reach under,grab his chin,and he gone.
and so i reached up to grab his hair,and i seen the lights.why,i do know,i guess the good lord saved me,i do know.but i reached up to grab the back of his head and his hair,and i seen the lights,and i just kind of glanced around and i seen the cases,and then i seen my shiny floor,and then i seen the office,and then it struck me where i was at.and i just said,no,no,no,no,do do it here.and it scared the hell out of me.and that what i afraid i might do to somebody else.
id.at emphasis added.
palmer,who witnessed the incident,described it less ominously.on july,he gave bishop a written statement that nielsen had goosed or poked jarvis,who then instinctively swung and hit nielsen in the shoulder.id.at.in his later deposition palmer testified that jarvis was in the mail case with his back to the aisle when nielsen walked by and poked him from behind.id.at larry palmer dep.jarvis then swung around and hit him on the high shoulder.id.palmer characterized the event as a so what deal.id.nielsen apparently thought that the incident was more serious and reported it to bishop.her initial assessment was that the situation was probably just due to jarvis jumpiness,id.at,that he needed some help,and that she would deal with it after she returned from a vacation.
on july,shortly after bishop return,postal inspector craig glende investigated the incident.the depth of his investigation is unclear it appears that he did not meet with palmer and had left by the time palmer gave his written statement to bishop,but he did interview jarvis and frazier.in any event,jarvis was handed a letter on july placing him on administrative leave with pay,effective july,and the next day he received a letter dated july informing him that he was being placed in status,effective july.although the second letter contained no explanation for the change in his pay status,it did explain that he was being placed off duty because he had struck and kicked coworkers,and retaining him may be injurious to others.id.at.
jarvis appealed this decision.on july,the postal service held a meeting.jarvis said that if he hit someone in the right place,he could kill him that his ptsd was getting worse that he c ould no longer stop the first blow and that he could not safely return to the workplace.id.at.at the meeting jarvis asked bishop to begin the paperwork for a retirement,so that he could avoid being fired.in addition,he volunteered to request that his practitioner,sonia hales,a registered nurse,send bishop a letter explaining his ptsd symptoms.apparently intended to support his medical retirement rather than his continued employment,the letter,which was faxed to bishop on july,did not minimize the risk that he posed.it said 
it was brought to my attention that jarvis had recently been involved in a physical altercation with another colleague.jarvis who is currently under treatment for post traumatic stress disorder ptsd in the veterans administration health care system vahcs had a scheduled appointment with me today.as i reviewed documentation from the past three years several health care providers have noted the severity of his symptoms.ptsd is a chronic disorder and the accompanying symptoms of this illness are very disruptive to an individual ability to function in every day living and more so in the work place.
the recent event involving jarvis was unfortunate for all involved m any veterans with ptsd,including jarvis,experience on going intense psychological distress from both internal perceived threats and external loud touching cues m any of these cues resemble past trauma,combat situations.physical reactivity when exposed to any type of perceived or real threat often includes behavior that is difficult for the veteran to recognize or manage until after the event has occurred.
due to the chronic nature of ptsd it is not likely jarvis symptoms will dissipate in the near future unfortunately,the unpredictable nature of ptsd symptoms may pose some threat in the work place.jarvis has identified his work at the postal service as a significant stressor in his life a medical retirement may be beneficial for him at this time.
termination 
the postal service sent jarvis a letter dated july,informing him that in no sooner than days he would be removed from the postal service as unfit for duty.the letter cited the following reasons for his removal the two incidents involving frazier,the nielsen incident,the letter from sonia hales about his ptsd,and his statements at the meeting that if he hit someone in the right place he could kill him,that his ptsd was getting worse and that he could no longer stop the first blow,and that he could not safely return to the workplace.the letter quoted sections of the postal service employee and labor relations manual relating to behavior and unacceptable conduct,as well as a postal service district zero tolerance policy,which forbids a ny act of physical violence,and any actual,implied,or veiled threat,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
also on july jarvis met with the eeo office and filed a complaint apparently alleging that the postal service was discriminating against him on the basis of a mental disability.the record contains no eeo complaint by jarvis.shortly thereafter he filed a second eeo complaint alleging retaliation.he then received a letter of decision dated august,informing him that he was being removed from the postal service effective august.he may have filed a third eeo complaint,but that is unclear from the record.
in the meantime,on july,jarvis requested that he be allowed to access his accrued vacation and sick leave while he applied for a disability retirement.in response,the postal service apparently offered jarvis the opportunity to resign rather than be terminated if he would agree to do so before february,regardless of whether his application for a retirement had been granted.perhaps interpreting this offer as retaliation for his having filed eeo complaints,he rejected it.it then appears that jarvis appealed his termination through the merit systems protection board,but the record contains no information on administrative efforts to resolve the dispute.jarvis ultimately received benefits.
proceedings 
on august,jarvis filed his complaint in federal court alleging that the postal service had failed to accommodate his disability,in violation of the rehabilitation act,and had retaliated against him for filing eeo complaints by failing to accommodate him,failing to send him for a examination,suppressing exonerating evidence during the investigation into the nielsen incident,proposing that he be terminated and then terminating him,engineering a constructive discharge,id.at,and otherwise treating him in a harsh and disparate manner,id.at.
more than a year later,on november,the postal service moved for summary judgment,contending that jarvis had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because he was not a qualified individual under the rehabilitation act.because he posed a direct threat to his coworkers,it argued,jarvis was not qualified to perform the essential functions of his job.it also argued that his retaliation claim failed because the evidence showed that he had been terminated for having engaged in violent acts towards his coworkers and posing a threat to them,not for having filed eeo complaints.
on march,the district court granted the postal service motion.it ruled that jarvis posed a direct threat to the health and safety of others because he reacted violently when startled.this risk could not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation,it said,because his requested bishop inform his coworkers of his ptsd and direct them to announce themselves before approaching not eliminate the possibility that he would react violently to being startled accidentally.furthermore,his requested accommodation was not reasonable because it attempted to shift to coworkers the burden of preventing him from engaging in violent conduct.finally,it held that his termination was not retaliation for his having engaged in protected activity because he could not show that the reason offered by the postal service for his termination was pretextual.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards that the district court should have applied.see cisneros aragon,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the purpose of a summary judgment motion is to determine whether there is evidence to support a party factual claim.unsupported conclusory allegations thus do not create a genuine issue of fact.l m,bei sensors,cir.
discrimination claim 
applicable law 
section a of the rehabilitation act,a,states 
no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the united states,as defined in section of this title,shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any executive agency or by the united states postal service.
to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the rehabilitation act,the plaintiff must show that he is disabled under the act that he would be otherwise qualified to participate in the program that the program receives federal financial assistance or is a federal agency or the postal service and that the program has discriminated against the plaintiff.mcgeshick principi,cir.section d further states that t he standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under the americans with disabilities act of ada we therefore look to the ada for guidance in resolving rehabilitation act claims.
the postal service does not dispute on appeal that jarvis is an individual with a disability.see a defining individual with a disability.the issue before us is whether he is otherwise qualified.the ada defines qualified individual with a disability as one who with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position.in other words,one who can not perform the essential functions of the job,even with a reasonable accommodation,is not an otherwise qualified individual.a section of the ada entitled defenses permits employers to use appropriate qualification standards.in pertinent part it states 
it may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this chapter that an alleged application of qualification standards that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be and consistent with business necessity,and such performance can not be accomplished by reasonable accommodation.
a.of particular significance in this case,the following subsection provides that qualification standards may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.id.b internal quotation marks omitted.
the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc is authorized by to promulgate regulations to implement the above provisions of the ada.see.those regulations are entitled to a great deal of deference.smith midland brake,cir citing eeoc commercial office prods,d see also sutton united air lines,cir.the postal service has promulgated regulations under the authority of a that apply the eeoc regulations to the rehabilitation act.see eeoc regulations contained in part apply to employment with the postal service eeoc regulation adopting for rehabilitation act the standards contained in regulations promulgated under the ada at part.
an eeoc regulation defines direct threat as a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that can not be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.r.it further provides 
the determination that an individual poses a direct threat shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job.this assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge on the best available objective evidence.in determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat,the factors to be considered include 
the duration of the risk 
the nature and severity of the potential harm 
the likelihood that the potential harm will occur and 
the imminence of the potential harm.
courts generally have held that the existence of a direct threat is a defense to be proved by the employer.see branham snow,cir burden is on employer to show employee posed a direct threat echazabal chevron,cir burden of establishing direct threat is on employer see also taylor rice,characterizing direct threat as defense mcgeshick,at i t is a defense to claims under the rehabilitation act that an employee may pose a direct threat to the welfare of others.we have recognized an exception to the general rule w here the essential job duties necessarily implicate the safety of others,then the burden may be on the plaintiff to show that she can perform those functions without endangering others.mckenzie benton,cir brackets omitted quoting rizzo children world learning,cir plaintiff was police officer eeoc amego,cir whether employees pose a direct threat is part of the analysis of whether they are otherwise qualified,when essential job functions concern safety of others.that exception is inappropriate in this case because the essential duties of a postal service custodian do not necessarily implicate the safety of others.mckenzie,at.
in evaluating an employer contention,the does not independently assess whether it believes that the employee posed a direct threat.nor must it accept the contention just because the employer acted in good faith in deciding that the employee posed such a threat.as we understand bragdon abbott,d,the role is to determine whether the employer decision was objectively reasonable.in bragdon the defendant refused to provide dental care in his office to an patient.the patient alleged discrimination in violation of the ada.after affirming the circuit court holding that hiv infection is a disability under the ada,the court considered whether the patient was entitled to summary judgment on the dentist contention that her hiv posed a direct threat to his health and safety.see id.at.the court rejected the proposition that the dentist belief that she posed a direct threat relieved him of liability.see id.at.but it also ruled that the circuit court properly refused to consider evidence of safety that was not available to the dentist when he made his decision.see id.at.the court said that the proper test was the objective reasonableness of the views of the dentist.id.we recognize that bragdon was not an employment case.it was decided under b,a provision of the ada.but the court explicitly pointed out that the ada contains parallel language in its employment provisions,id,b see bragdon,at,and we see no reason not to apply bragdon analysis to employment cases.
perhaps a more important difference between bragdon and this case is that the defendant in bragdon was a professional,presumably a person better trained to assess dangerousness than a typical employer.nevertheless,we believe that even nonexpert employers should be protected when they make objectively reasonable assessments,recognizing,of course,that objective reasonableness may well depend on whether professional advice is obtained.see r this assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge on the best available objective evidence.
our decision in den hartog wasatch academy,cir,essentially adopted an test.we upheld the employer assessment because it was eminently reasonable in light of the undisputed objective facts.id.at.we stated that the ada did not require an employer to conduct an independent medical examination when the available objective evidence is clear.id.moreover,the defendants determination had been based on an individualized assessment rather than upon any predetermined or unfounded general stereotypes.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
similarly,in amego,the employee was a nurse who administered medications to severely disabled people in a residential program.the employer dismissed her on the ground that she could not safely perform her duties.there was no dispute that the employee was disabled,presumably from mental disease.the first circuit stated 
it was eminently reasonable for amego to be concerned about whether guglielmi could meet her responsibilities,and also reasonable for it to conclude that the risk was too great to run.the employer judgment here about the risks of future behavior by an employee is based on past behavior and reasonable indicia of future behavior.
id.at.as we did in den hartog,the court also observed that there was no evidence of differential treatment,discrimination,or stereotyping.id.at.
we therefore review whether the postal service determination that jarvis posed a direct threat to others was objectively reasonable.
application to this case 
the postal service does not dispute that jarvis was an individual with a disability.it contends only that he was not a qualified individual with a disability because he posed
