background 
the testimony presented at trial established the following.is a retired marine and veteran of the korean war who has been receiving treatment at the va hospital since.on september,when he was years old,he collapsed at his home due to dizziness and injured his right shoulder in the fall.he went to the va hospital emergency room and was referred for treatment to sylvia rodríguez,his primary physician,complaining of pain and limited range of motion.rodríguez examined his shoulder and ordered of the area.the revealed no damage from the fall but did reveal a mild degenerative bone condition,a precursor to osteoporosis.was offered medication but refused it.rodríguez suggested that he apply ice to the shoulder and told him to return to see her in two weeks if there was no improvement.
did not return to the va hospital with complaints of shoulder pain until.rodríguez examined the shoulder and concluded that its condition had worsened.she offered to refer to a physiatrist,a specialist who could determine if an mri study was indicated,and gave him an emphatic recommendation to undergo physical therapy.he turned down these suggestions and agreed only to undergo a bone densitometry test and to begin a home exercise program.he returned to the va hospital again in december,complaining of shoulder pain and a delay in obtaining an appointment for the bone densitometry test.he refused rodríguez offer to evaluate his shoulder.rodríguez told him that he had an open appointment to come see her in the event he changed his mind and wanted further medical evaluation.
in may,brought a mandamus action in district court against the government,alleging that he had received no treatment and that,despite having sent numerous letters to the veterans administration requesting treatment,he received no response.in august,he had another appointment with rodríguez.he requested to have another doctor assigned as his primary physician and refused further evaluation of his shoulder.rodríguez recommended that he undergo an mri,receive physical therapy,and schedule appointments.underwent an mri for his shoulder a few weeks later.the mri revealed osteoarthritis and tearing of several tendons in the shoulder.the va hospital offered him the option of surgery to implant a prosthetic replacement of the humeral head of his right shoulder.was told that,although the surgery would not necessarily help restore range of motion,it would ease his pain.he declined the surgery.
in october,moved to dismiss his mandamus action without prejudice,stating that he was receiving therapy.the court entered judgment dismissing the action.
filed the present action against the government on february.at the bench trial,he presented the testimony of an expert witness,humberto,a disability specialist and orthopedic surgeon.had examined medical records but had never performed a physical examination of him.the expert testified that,in his opinion,the va hospital breached its duty of care by failing to conduct an orthopedic evaluation shortly after the september,fall and by waiting two years before conducting an mri.he also testified that surgery soon after the accident would have restored range of motion and alleviated pain.
the government presented the testimony of its expert,carlos grovas badrena,an orthopedic surgeon.grovas physically examined and also examined his medical records.he testified that the medical records indicated that,between september,and may,visited the va hospital on nine occasions without complaining of shoulder problems.grovas also testified that,as a result of his physical examination of,he believed severe osteoarthritis was causing the shoulder pain.further,grovas stated that rodríguez recommendation of physical therapy was the proper treatment for loss of motion due to a dislocated shoulder.in addition,grovas testified that,in his opinion,there was no breach of care by the va hospital because it was not standard practice to refer a patient with negative to an orthopedist.rather,rodríguez followed standard procedure by immediately ordering,recommending a course of medication and a appointment.finally,grovas stated that rodríguez recommendations to that he receive evaluation from a would then be in a position to decide whether an mri was that he undergo physical therapy,were proper.
testified,in contradiction of his medical records,that he did not refuse treatment on several occasions.he also testified about the unanswered letters he sent to the veteran administration requesting treatment.
at the conclusion of the bench trial,the district court found no medical malpractice and entered judgment for the government.on appeal,raises several challenges to the district court findings.he claims that the court erred in finding that he refused treatment because he asserts that the va hospital ignored his repeated letters requesting treatment that the court improperly considered his prior lawsuits against the veterans administration and arrests at the hospital that the court erred in finding that his testimony was not credible and that the court findings of fact are deficient because they failed to address,or even mention,the testimony of his expert.these claims can be collapsed into one issue whether the district court clearly erred in finding that rodríguez treatment of plaintiff shoulder did not deviate from the standard practice of care.
discussion 
a district court findings after a bench trial must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility.a.a finding is only clearly erroneous if review of the entire record leads to a definite and firm conviction that an error has been made.see primus united states,cir.when the evidence presented at a bench trial supports plausible but competing inferences,the court decision to favor one inference is not clearly erroneous.see cape fear,martin,cir.
the law of puerto rico,where the alleged malpractice occurred,provides the standard of liability in this ftca action.see b and.to prove medical malpractice under puerto rico law,a plaintiff must establish the duty owed,the minimum standard of professional knowledge and skill required in the relevant circumstances,an act or omission transgressing that duty,and a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and the claimed harm.corporacion insular de seguros,cir.
the district court finding of no medical malpractice was fully supported by the evidence.in its memorandum order,the court accepted grovas conclusion that,on the basis of his examination of plaintiff and his review of the full medical file,the care that plaintiff received for his shoulder was in full compliance with the standards of the medical profession for the type of soft tissue injury suffered by this elderly veteran.the court credited grovas opinion that rodríguez decision not to order mri tests after came back negative was not a deviation from standard medical practice.the court also found,on the basis of the medical records,that plaintiff refused the conservative treatment offered to him,he missed appointments,rejected physical therapy,and refused to cooperate with the staff at the va hospital in assessing and treating his shoulder injury as rodríguez originally intended.having had the benefit of assessing issues of credibility,and having perceived the obsession that this plaintiff has against the va hospital and its medical staff,the district court concluded that plaintiff had failed to prove that the va hospital and its staff committed malpractice.the court further found that the shoulder complications were caused by other
