the mother of lg,a minor,applied for supplemental security income ssi after lg diagnosis with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd.following a hearing,the administrative law judge alj denied benefits.in determining that lg was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act and ineligible for ssi payments,the alj made conclusory statements that contradicted the evidence presented and failed to address portions of medical and school records that were favorable to lg.as a result,we conclude that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence,and we remand for further proceedings.
background 
rhoda hopgood filed an application in june for ssi on behalf of lg,her minor son,alleging disability due to adhd.the ssi application was initially denied,and hopgood sought a hearing.testimony at the august,hearing and other evidence established that lg was born in and was diagnosed in with adhd,which resulted in academic and behavioral problems lg,who was at the time of the hearing,testified that he sometimes forgot to brush his hair and that his mother had to tell him to take a shower and brush his teeth.he also testified that he had difficulties in school and did not understand some of the work despite help from his teacher.lg stated that he sometimes walked out of his classroom,wandered the halls,and received many suspensions and detentions from school for fighting.finally,he mentioned that he fought with his sister,who was at the time,broke drawers and hit doors when he became angry,and explained that the medication he took made him sleepy.
hopgood testified that in the previous school year lg frequently had been suspended or had to serve detention for being disrespectful to teachers,fighting,and walking the halls.she further explained that in addition to having to remind lg daily to bathe and brush his teeth and hair,she also had to tell him to complete his weekly chores and that as a result lg talked back to her.she testified that police were called once when lg and his friends got into a fight with a group of other boys.as a result,lg received community service,and he completed his service by performing maintenance at the salvation army where hopgood worked.she also said that lg failed the fourth grade and that in the previous school year had brought homework home only two or three times.hopgood testified that she always asked him about his homework and that when lg explanations did not pan out,she monitored a progress report system created by his teachers until lg suddenly stopped bringing the reports home.hopgood explained that lg had been taking risperdal for more than a year,but that he remained off task at school until she brought this to the attention of his psychiatrist,who then increased his dosage to twice a day.she further stated that the adderall lg had previously been prescribed made him act like a zombie he would just sit in his room,watch television and sleep.hopgood explained that lg was incapable of riding a city bus or going to the mall by himself.
following the hearing,the alj issued a decision finding that lg suffered from adhd,but was not disabled because his impairments did not meet,or medically or functionally equal,the criteria required under the social security administration listing of impairments.the alj also found the testimony of hopgood to be generally credible,but tending to show that lg was not disabled.the appeals council denied review,leaving the alj decision as the final one of the commissioner of social security.hopgood sought judicial review pursuant to g,and a magistrate judge,presiding by consent,upheld the denial of benefits.this appeal follows.
ii.analysis 
a.the alj determination was not supported by substantial evidence.
we reverse the commissioner final decision only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on a legal error.nelms astrue,cir.an alj findings are supported by substantial evidence if the alj identifies supporting evidence in the record and builds a logical bridge from that evidence to the conclusion.giles ex rel.giles astrue,cir.but if the decision lacks evidentiary support or is so poorly articulated as to prevent meaningful review,a remand is required.steele barnhart,cir.
we begin our discussion with the alj finding that lg impairment is not functionally equivalent to the listing for adhd.see pt,subpt.p,app.a child qualifies as disabled and therefore may be eligible for ssi if he has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,which results in marked and severe functional limitations and the impairment has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.see a c i.whether a child meets this definition requires a analysis.a.first,if the child is engaged in substantial gainful activity,the social security administration ssa will deny the claim.id.second,if the child does not have a severe medical impairment or combination of impairments,then he is not disabled and his claim will be denied.id.third,the child impairments must meet a duration requirement and must meet,medically equal or functionally equal,the severity of any of the listings of impairments contained in pt,subpt.p,app.id.
at issue is whether lg impairments functionally equaled the listings.to determine if an impairment is functionally equivalent to a listing,an alj analyzes the severity of the impairment in six domains acquiring and using information attending and completing tasks interacting and relating with others moving about and manipulating objects caring for oneself and health and physical.a b.to functionally equal the listings,the alj must find an extreme limitation in one category or a marked limitation in two categories.a a.a marked limitation exists when the impairment seriously interferes with the child ability to independently initiate,sustain,or complete activities.a e i.an extreme limitation exists when a child impairment interferes very seriously with his ability to independently initiate,sustain or complete activities.a e i emphasis added.
the alj found that lg established the first two steps of the inquiry because he had not engaged in substantial gainful activity and because he suffers from adhd.the alj then determined that lg had less than marked limitations in acquiring and using information,attending and completing tasks,and interacting and relating with others.the alj found no limitations in the other categories.only the three domains in which the alj found less than marked limitations are at issue in this appeal.
acquiring and using information 
acquiring and using information refers to how well a child acquires or learns information and how well he uses the information he has learned.a g.adolescents between the ages of and should be able to demonstrate what they have learned in academic assignments and be able to use what they have learned in daily living situations without assistance,going to the store and using public transportation.a g v.they should be able to comprehend and express both simple and complex ideas and use complex language in learning and daily living situations.id.they should also learn to apply these skills practically in order to enter the workplace after finishing school.id.
the alj found lg had less than marked limitations in this domain based on statements from his teachers and the conclusions of four of lg doctors,but the alj did not articulate what statements or reports supported this finding.the alj acknowledged lg placement in special education and noted his level of academic knowledge.the alj stated lg grades improved to as,bs,cs and ds in his individualized education program iep.the alj also noted a february,iep report,which stated lg had difficulties beginning and completing assignments,but was capable when he remained focused and on task.finally,the alj mentioned that an eighth grade teacher reported lg required additional explanation and examples to grasp new concepts.
hopgood argues that the alj did not explain what in the teachers reports supported the alj findings and that the alj failed to discuss several portions of the teachers reports that were favorable to lg.specificall
