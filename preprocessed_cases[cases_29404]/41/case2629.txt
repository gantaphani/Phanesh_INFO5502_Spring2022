this case involves plaintiff claims of systemic disease allegedly caused by a silicone gel breast implant plaintiff received in.the implant at issue was manufactured by defendant predecessor.in,plaintiff underwent bilateral breast augmentation surgery and received her first set of silicone gel and saline filled breast implants manufactured by a division of dow corning corporation.four years later,due to problems with her left implant,plaintiff had the left implant removed and replaced with another silicone gel and saline filled breast implant manufactured by defendant predecessor corporation.this implant is the sole focus of this appeal.in,because of a rupture of her right implant,plaintiff had both implants replaced with another set of implants manufactured by dow corning.plaintiff points to no specific evidence in the record that the left implant which was manufactured by defendant had leaked prior to the time of removal.
beginning in,plaintiff began to suffer from a variety of ailments including pain in her right shoulder and foot and pain and swelling in her right knee,hip,and other joints.on october,plaintiff had both implants removed because her doctor believed that she had lupus.the diagnosis was subsequently changed by vasey,one of plaintiff proffered experts,to connective tissue disease caused by silicone which leaked from breast implants.this disease allegedly caused plaintiff to suffer tenderness in the muscles of her mid and low back in addition to joint swelling in her upper extremities.
in,plaintiff filed suit in colorado state court against several defendants,including defendant baxter as the corporate successor to,seeking compensatory and punitive damages based on claims of negligence,strict liability,breach of implied warranties,and breach of express.plaintiff alleged two types of injuries as a result of her silicone breast implants systemic autoimmune disease and local injuries such as pain suffered as a result of scarring and leakage.plaintiff further alleged that defendants knew that there was evidence linking silicone breast implants to various serious diseases.the action was removed to federal court and transferred to the northern district of alabama for consolidated proceedings.dow corning,the manufacturer of all but one of plaintiff breast implants,filed for bankruptcy.plaintiff claims against baxter regarding the left implant were remanded back to the united states district court for the district of colorado.
after remand,baxter moved for summary judgment on plaintiff systemic injury claims.baxter argued that there was no epidemiological evidence showing an association between silicone breast implants and autoimmune disorders therefore,plaintiff could not meet her burden of proof with respect to general causation.baxter further argued that the statute of limitations barred plaintiff local injury claims.in her opposition to baxter motion for summary judgment,plaintiff primarily relied on the expert testimony of two physicians,vasey and espinoza.the district court granted baxter motion for summary judgment on plaintiff systemic and local injury claims.
the issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in granting baxter summary judgment on plaintiff claim of systemic autoimmune disease because she failed to meet her burden of establishing a triable issue of fact that silicone breast implants are capable of causing systemic injuries and plaintiff claims for breach of warranty,negligence,and products liability on the basis that the applicable statute of limitations had expired.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standard employed by the district court,to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact and whether a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.gossett oklahoma ex rel.bd.of regents for langston,cir.plaintiff main assertion on appeal is that the district court erred in finding that she failed to meet her burden of establishing a triable issue of fact that her silicone breast implant was a factor in the development of her alleged systemic injuries.to support her theory of causation,plaintiff presented expert testimony from two doctors.that evidence was excluded by the district court.
before specifically addressing plaintiff proffer of expert testimony relating to her alleged connective tissue disease,it is necessary to highlight the hurdle plaintiff must overcome.we can not consider whether plaintiff silicone breast implants caused her specific autoimmune disease until plaintiff presents reliable evidence that silicone breast implants are capable of causing disease in people in general.
the district court correctly noted that,in silicone breast implant litigation,plaintiffs must show both general and specific causation.see raynor merrell,causation in toxic tort cases is discussed in terms of general causation and specific causation kelley american,see also jones united states,aff,cir hall baxter healthcare.general causation is whether a substance is capable of causing a particular injury or condition in the general population and specific causation is whether a substance caused a particular individual injury.plaintiff must first demonstrate general causation because without general causation,there can be no specific causation.in other words,if silicone breast implants are incapable of causing systemic injuries in anyone,it follows a fortiori that silicone breast implants could not have caused systemic injuries in plaintiff.
addressing the question of general causation,the district court first discussed the necessity of epidemiological evidence.it did not hold that epidemiology is the only admissible evidence on causation.however,the district court did conclude that it needed epidemiological evidence in order for plaintiff to overcome defendant motion for summary judgment in this case.this decision was grounded largely on the fact that many epidemiological studies and other data were available regarding the alleged association between silicone breast implants and immune system diseases.defendant had already proffered a significant body of epidemiology in support of its contention that silicone breast implants do not cause disease in anyone.the volume of epidemiological evidence is reflected in the record and in other court cases dealing with the same subject matter 
one such examination of the alleged link was conducted in when judge pointer,united states district court,northern district of alabama,appointed a rule national science panel to look at available scientific literature to determine whether breast implants might cause connective tissue disease.in november,the panel issued its report,finding that t he most likely conclusion from these several analyses is that there is no meaningful or consistent association between breast implants or silicone implants and any of the conditions studied,vol.ii,at.the panel immunologist,diamond,testified that there is no reproducible,reliable data supporting the theory that silicone gel breast implants cause any immune system dysfunction.id.at.the panel epidemiologist,hulka,stated that she did not find a reliable or consistent association between breast implants and any of the conditions that we studied.id.at.tugwell,the panel rheumatologist,stated that there is no proven association between those diseases and silicone breast implants.id.at.
in,congress instructed the united states department of health and human services to contract with the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence for the association of silicone breast implants with human health conditions id.at.in july,the report concluded that there was no elevated relative risk or odds ratio for an association of implants with disease.id.at.the report further stated that there was not even suggestive evidence that silicone breast implants caused systemic disease.id.at.
we agree with the district court that epidemiology is the best evidence of general causation in a toxic tort case.see in re breast implant,d,linda bailey,et,reference guide on epidemiology,reference manual on scientific evidence at see also wilson merrell dow,cir renaud martin marietta,aff,cir.while the presence of epidemiology does not necessarily end the inquiry,where epidemiology is available,it can not be ignored.as the best evidence of general causation,it must be addressed.
plaintiff disputes the necessity of epidemiological evidence citing glastetter novartis pharm,cir kennedy collagen,cir and benedi,cir.see aplt.br.at.plaintiff asserts that in all of these cases,epidemiological studies were unnecessary to prove general causation.these cases are inapposite.first,none involve breast implants.second,and more importantly,in all three cases,unlike the case at hand,there was no body of epidemiological evidence demonstrating the absence of a causal relationship.in cases where there is no epidemiology challenging causation available,epidemiological evidence would not necessarily be required.
this is not a case where there is no epidemiology.it is a case where the body of epidemiology largely finds no association between silicone breast implants and immune system diseases.we are not holding that epidemiological studies are always necessary in a toxic tort case.we are simply holding that where there is a large body of contrary epidemiological evidence,it is necessary to at least address it with evidence that is based on medically reliable and scientifically valid methodology.
in light of the significant body of epidemiological evidence proffered by defendant,and in attempting to reach the epidemiological evidence proffered by plaintiff,the district court necessarily focused on two expert witnesses,vasey and espinoza,to establish a link.both doctors asserted a belief that silicone breast implants can cause immune system diseases.additionally,the doctors evaluated appellant and concluded that her specific systemic injuries were a result of her silicone breast implants.after conducting a daubert merrell dow,d,inquiry,the district court excluded both experts because they were unreliable.
we review de novo whether the district court applied the proper standard in determining whether to admit or exclude expert testimony.dodge cotter,cir citation omitted.that is,whether the district court properly performed its role as gatekeeper pursuant to federal rule of evidence and daubert.bitler smith,cir.we then review the manner in which the district court exercises its daubert gatekeeping role in making decisions whether to admit or exclude testimony for an abuse of discretion.bitler,at see also dodge,at.w e will not disturb the district court ruling unless it is arbitrary,capricious,whimsical or manifestly unreasonable or when we are convinced that the district court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.dodge,at citation and internal quotations omitted.
in evaluating the district court gatekeeping role,we are not necessarily concerned with its exact conclusions reached to exclude or admit expert testimony.bitler,at.the district court must make some reliability determination on the record however,we recognize the wide latitude a district court has in exercising its discretion to admit or exclude expert testimony.id.citation omitted.the district court has wide discretion both in deciding how to assess an expert reliability and in making a determination of that reliability.id.at citation omitted.
mindful of this deferential standard of review,we begin our discussion of the district court exclusion of plaintiff expert testimony with rule.see id.rule states that 
i f scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise 
rule requires the district court to ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence is not only relevant,but reliable.id.quoting daubert,at.this obligation involves a inquiry.id.a district court must first determine if the expert proffered testimony has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his or her discipline.id.quoting daubert,at.in making this determination,the district court must decide whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid id.quoting daubert,at.second,the district court must further inquire into whether proposed testimony is sufficiently relevant to the task at hand.daubert,at.because plaintiff proffered expert testimony fails the first requirement,we need not specifically address the second 
in determining whether the expert reasoning or methodology is valid,
the supreme court has suggested that a court consider whether a theory has been or can be tested or falsified,whether the theory or technique has been subject to peer review and publication,whether there are known or potential rates of error with regard to specific techniques,and whether the theory or approach has general acceptance.daubert,at.the court has made clear,however,that this list is neither definitive nor exhaustive.
accordingly,a trial court focus generally should not be upon the precise conclusions reached by the expert,but on the methodology employed in reaching those conclusions.daubert,at.
the district court noted that vasey and espinoza have impressive credentials in the field of rheumatology.however,as a basis for their conclusions regarding the connection between silicone breast implants and autoimmune diseases,plaintiff experts completely ignored or discounted without explanation the many epidemiological studies which found no medically reliable link between silicone breast implants and systemic disease.therefore,the district court concluded that the methodology used by plaintiff experts was not medically or scientifically valid.see daubert,at.because of this,the district court determined that plaintiff experts opinions were not reliably grounded in the knowledge and experience of their discipline.
in vasey opinion,silicone gel breast implants cause both local and systemic inflammatory conditions,vol.ii,at.as a basis for this opinion,vasey primarily relied on his own case series with sequential observations in many patients.id.at.he further stated that his opinion is based on the unique and atypical findings in women with silicone gel breast implants and on sequential observations including the beneficial effect of breast implant removal.id.
vasey did not rely on any epidemiological studies or other controlled studies for his opinion that silicone gel breast implants can cause systemic disease.additionally,vasey completely ignored the many epidemiological studies that do not find a link between silicone gel breast implants and any systemic disease.he conclusively,and without support,stated that epidemiological studies relied on by the industry are not definitive.id.at.
in order to escape the volume of contrary opinions,vasey indicated that the comprehensive syndrome he described,atypical fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome,has escaped study.id.at.however,he asserted that plaintiff has silicone associated connective tissue disease.id.it is unclear from vasey opinion how plaintiff disease fits into the category of disease that has allegedly escaped study.additionally,he never discusses why the voluminous other studies on silicone gel breast implants are completely irrelevant to plaintiff stated condition.
like vasey,espinoza relied not on epidemiology but on clinical case studies and differential diagnosis.basing his conclusion on his prior clinical experience in dealing with this unusual association,espinoza stated that i t is my personal opinion that some individuals exposed to silicone breast implants developed systemic illness that mimic idiopathic autoimmune disorders,vol.iii,at.he further said that i t is my feeling that plaintiff arthritis is related to her underlying silicone breast implants.id.at.while stating that his opinion is based on a reasonable degree of medical probability,espinoza agreed that the body of the evidence says that there is no association between silicone breast impla
