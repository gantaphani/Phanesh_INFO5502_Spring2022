this appeal implicates the employee retirement income security act of erisa.it presents two issues of first impression concerning the scope of erisa exemption for deferred compensation plans.see id.after careful consideration,we did the district the plans at issue are valid plans.in the course of our analysis,we reject the appellant claims i that the plans cater to more than a select group of highly compensated employees and ii that the applicability of the exemption hinges on an implicit requirement that affected employees possess individual bargaining power.
background 
we set forth here only those essentially uncontroverted facts that are necessary to place this appeal into perspective we refer readers who hunger for more detail to the district court exegetic opinion.see alexander brigham women physicians,d.
in,eben alexander iii began working for the brigham surgical group foundation bsg,a physicians organization that employed a host of surgeons who,like the appellant,doubled in brass as harvard medical school harvard faculty members.in january of,bsg morphed into a new organizational structure known as brigham women physicians organization.as this corporate shuffle has no bearing on the claims before us,we refer throughout to bsg as the employer of record.
due to their academic affiliation,the members of bsg surgical complement were subject to special salary caps.over time,these caps began to chafe bsg found that they hindered its ability to recruit and retain surgeons who could earn substantially more in private practice.to remove this impediment yet still remain compliant with harvard wishes,bsg created two deferred compensation plans the faculty retirement benefit plan frbp and the unfunded deferred compensation plan udcp.by allocating portions of a surgeon excess earnings to these unfunded accounts,bsg expected that it would make employment at the hospital more attractive to surgeons.
we pause at this juncture to sketch the architecture of the plans.the critical datum under each plan is a given surgeon net practice income npi,that is,the net of payments attributable to the services that he rendered less bsg costs allocable to those services.in any year in which a surgeon does not have npi equal to or greater than his base salary,he incurs an obligation to repay bsg for the deficit either out of future npi or out of pocket.in a rosier and if a surgeon npi exceeds harvard earnings excess up to of the surgeon salary will be credited to his account in the frbp if any surplus npi remains that is,if the excess of npi over the salary cap is greater than the amount consigned to the frbp,of that surplus will be credited to the surgeon account in the udcp and the remainder will escheat to bsg.should a surgeon produce a negative npi in any year,the per annum deficit will be carried forward and debited against positive balances in his frbp and udcp accounts.
at the plans inception,bsg lacked a clear indication as to the number of surgeons who might earn enough to produce contributions to the frbp over time,however,it became evident that only a small fraction of the surgical complement would achieve that distinction.the district court determined that the relevant years for purposes of this case were,and,see id.at,and the parties have acquiesced in that configuration.the figures for those years illustrate the small fraction trend.all surgeons were potentially eligible to contribute to the plans the key was whether a given surgeon generated sufficient npi.the surgeons en masse constituted,and,respectively,of bsg aggregate workforce.however,the roster of surgeons who actually achieved the requisite income level s and thus contributed money into one or both of the plans was significantly smaller.in,of bsg overall employee population contributed to the frbp and to the udcp in,the figures were and,respectively and in,the figures were and,respectively.
a glance at the average income of the plan contributors conveys the magnitude of the pecuniary cleft between them and the employee population as a whole.during the three years in question,bsg employees as a whole averaged annual earnings of,and.meanwhile,the frbp contributors earned on average,and.the udcp contributors were even more richly compensated they earned on average,and.
the record is pellucid that,upon recruiting the appellant,bsg introduced him to a compendium of fringe benefits.this introduction included a review of the documentation describing the frbp and the udcp and an explanation of the system of credits and debits used in connection therewith at that at all times material to this plans covered all bsg surgeons who held harvard faculty appointments.as written,the plans afforded no option for any surgeon to opt out.and because they were already in place when the appellant joined bsg,he had no real opportunity to bargain over their terms.
that is not to say that the terms of the plans were set in cement.of course,the appellant,as an individual employee,was unable to alter those terms.like every other surgeon,however,he was a voting member of bsg.as such,standard corporate governance and decisionmaking mechanisms stood available to him.for example,bsg board,which included surgeons as directors,could amend the plans,subject to the concurrence of the board compensation committee which,under bsg bylaws,has final authority respecting all compensation arrangements between the corporation and its employees.while such corporate structures are not equivalent to direct employee democracy,they are nonetheless meaningful.
here,moreover,the record indicates that the system responded to the surgeons and their wishes.as to plan amendments,the reviews are mixed on one occasion,bsg executive committee rejected a proposal to amend the plans,but on a different occasion in a proposal to revise the terms of the plans so as to make them available to harvard faculty members of all ranks was adopted 
with this backdrop in place,we turn to the genesis of the litigation.in,bsg terminated the appellant employment.simultaneously,it notified him that he was running a cumulative npi deficit and that,therefore,his frbp and udcp accounts would be debited by more than to offset that deficit.the appellant protested,but to no avail.
after his ouster,the appellant sued bsg and related defendants in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,asserting claims under both federal and state law.the district court deemed the claims preempted,and those claims are not before us.we focus,then,on the appellant federal claims.
in brief,those claims allege that bsg sponsorship and administration of the frbp and udcp violated erisa vesting and fiduciary duty requirements.the appellant seeks money damages and ancillary relief including attorneys fees.use this acronym throughout this opinion as a shorthand for all named that the plans,although within the realm of erisa,were plans and thus exempt from the enumerated requirements.
after prolonged discovery and the denial of for summary judgment,the district court conducted a bench trial.it found that the plans were maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation that the surgeons as a group possessed sufficient bargaining power to alter the terms of the plans and that the absence of individual bargaining power was irrelevant.see id.at.having arrived at these findings,the court ruled that the plans came within the exemption and that,therefore,erisa vesting and fiduciary duty requirements were inapposite.see id.at.the court entered judgment accordingly,and this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
bsg crafted the two deferred compensation plans at issue here to take advantage of erisa provision,which applies to any plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.not surprisingly,then,the questions before us revolve around the proper scope of that exemption.
in examining these questions,we begin by memorializing the applicable standard of review.we then orient our inquiry in terms of statutory purpose.finally,we consider the appellant dual assignments of error one by one and explain why we find them unconvincing.
standard of review.
it is common ground that deference is due to findings of fact made by a trial court following a bench trial.see sierra fria donald evans,cir.a.here,however,the appellant does not challenge the district court factual findings rather,he trains his fire on certain of the court legal conclusions.first,he calumnizes the court determination as to which subpopulation of employees should be considered in deciding whether a deferred compensation plan meets the provision select group requirement.second,he argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in failing to recognize that the statute implicitly requires that every individual in the select group possess bargaining power sufficient to negotiate the terms of the plans.because these asseverations demand that we ascertain what the statute requires as a general matter they engender de novo review.see harvey johanns,cir in re main,cir.
statutory purpose.
erisa is a comprehensive statutory scheme enacted in response to escalating concerns about the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.massachusetts morash,d see degnan publicker,cir erisa is a remedial statute designed to fashion anodynes that protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries.erisa substantive protections are designed largely to safeguard the financial integrity of employee benefit funds,to permit employee monitoring of earmarked assets,and to ensure that employers promises are kept.belanger,cir.
the provision cuts a swath through this regulatory thicket,relieving employers of many of erisa more onerous burdens only circumstances exist.to reach that safe harbor,a plan must be unfunded and maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.when those preconditions are satisfied,the plan is exempted from several of erisa stringencies,including rules governing plan participation,vesting,funding,and fiduciary duty.see hampers grace,cir see also cogan phoenix life ins,cir.reporting and disclosure requirements remain applicable.see hampers,at.
the origins of the provision lie in congress insight that employees,unlike their counterparts,are capable of protecting their own pension interests.see gallione flaherty,cir see also dep t of labor op.presuming that employees of this stature can fend for themselves,congress relaxed some of erisa prophylactic obligations.
this congressional purpose is a reliable guidepost for the task of statutory interpretation.see beckley capital.digeronimo,cir.beyond that point,however,we possess few if any interpretive aids in discerning the precise scope of the provision.thus,as a matter of both necessity and preferred practice,see,united states meade,cir,we turn to the statutory text.we add only that neither party has directed us to any useful legislative history.
select group.
as said,the provision applies only if,among other things,a plan is maintained for the primary benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees.the first issue raised by the appellant concerns the methodology used in determining whether a given group is select.he argues that the statute envisions that the entire cohort of employees to whom a plan was,every bsg surgeon who held a harvard faculty the relevant group.taking this approach,he says that the plans here at issue were maintained for roughly of the workforce hardly a select group.
the district court rejected this argument.it held that the relevant inquiry involved only those surgeons who in fact crossed the npi threshold and contributed money to the plans.in so holding,the court concluded that a s a practical matter the plans were maintained for the surgeons who actually contributed and not for the more sizable group of surgeons who nominally were covered by the language of the plan documents.alexander,d at.operating from this coign of vantage,the court found that the frbp never was maintained for more than of the relevant universe and that the udcp never was maintained for more than of the relevant universe.id.so viewed,both groups were select.id.
the lower court rationale fits readily within an unforced reading of the statutory text.after all,a substantial accumulation of npi in excess of the salary be satisfied before any surgeon can squirrel away money in either of the plans.that gets the grease from the goose owing to the height of the threshold that contributors need to surmount,only a relatively small fraction of bsg surgeons contributed to either plan in the relevant years.common sense suggests that it is this small fraction that should be taken into account in determining the composition of the select group for whom the plans were maintained.
we are fortified in this impression about the dimensions of the select group by the flanking statutory phrases maintained and highly compensated.in view of congress linkage of these terms,it would seem very strange to say that the plans were being maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to employees who were not highly compensated,who did not cross the threshold needed to become plan contributors,and who might never be able to do so.
the more natural and sensible reading of the statute is that a plan is maintained for a group of employees only if those employees realistically have the capacity to benefit from it.thus,for the purpose of determining whether a plan services a select group,we find relevant here only those employees who actually earned enough npi to fund plan contributions.they are the employees for whom the money in the plans is being managed and held they are thus the employees whom congress had in mind when it devised the contours of the.
this conclusion is not at odds with the case law.the other courts that have spoken to this issue confronted categorically different situations in which employers or employees retained the discretion to contribute to the deferred compensation plans when and if they chose or situations in which every member of a designated group of employees received plan contributions albeit in differing amounts depending on some variable say,the incidence of commissions.see,demery extebank deferred comp.plan b,cir guiragoss khoury,d,carrabba randalls food,d.thus,unlike this case,either every employee within the designated group received some benefit from the plan or someone possessed the ability to fund the plan as a matter of discretion so that,crucially,the ability to fund the plans was always in existence.
the bsg plans are quite different surgeons have no automatic entitlement to deferred compensation.rather,any particular surgeon can contribute to the plans only or she generates sufficient npi to surpass the salary cap.the surgeons who succeed in that endeavor can and do contribute those who fail have no option to deposit money into the plans.under these circumstances,it would be,ultimately,say that those plans were maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to the latter cadre of surgeons,that is,surgeons incapable of contributing to the plans.
the appellant has a fallback position.he argues,in the alternative,that erisa statutory definition of participant should define the relevant employee universe.under that definition,participants include,inter alia,any employee who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.the appellant contends that,applying this definition,all the bsg surgeons should be included as part of the select group because each one of them signed the same plan documents and therefore might,if his or her earnings soared,become eligible to receive plan benefits.
this contention lacks force because the insertion of the term participant is made of whole cloth.the provision does not refer to the term participant at all,nor does any legislative history suggest that congress intended to import that d
