this case involves the right of an employee to take family and medical leave to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.we hold that under the california family rights act cfra,an employee who leaves work to travel with and care for a family member with a serious health condition is not entitled to leave when the family member decides,in spite of her serious medical condition,to travel away from her home for reasons unrelated to her medical treatment.
factual and procedural background 
arnulfo gradilla worked as a sheet metal assembler at ruskin mira loma plant from august until his termination on october.he was a union member and was covered by a collective bargaining agreement.ruskin had a policy that required employees to call in if they were going to miss work.the policy,referred to by ruskin as the three day show policy,provides that if a worker does not call in or show up for work for three days,he will be dismissed.
gradilla wife had a serious heart condition,so serious that her doctor thought that she might require a heart transplant.gradilla took medication for her heart condition.when she experienced a stressful event,her blood pressure rose,her heart beat fast,and she felt dizzy and faint.at these times,she could not care for herself.she needed gradilla to administer the correct dosage of medication to her,as well as to calm her,so that her heart rate would slow down.only gradilla knew how to take care of her when she had a traumatic episode.gradilla supervisors knew about gradilla heart problem,even though gradilla had never previously asked for leave under the family leave statute.the supervisors never asked gradilla for medical documentation of her condition,and he never provided any.
gradilla was fired after an unfortunate confluence of events that occurred in october.on tuesday,october,gradilla complained at work of pain in his right shoulder and asked to see the doctor.his employer reassigned him to light work but did not send him for medical treatment.the next day,gradilla shoulder still hurt,so he went to his supervisor office to obtain written permission to see the doctor while he was filling out the necessary paperwork,gradilla received a telephone call from his wife.gradilla informed him that her father had died in an automobile accident,and she wanted him to accompany her to mexico for the funeral.gradilla needed her husband to care for her during the trip because her father death and funeral were stressful,emotionally upsetting events that aggravated her heart condition.gradilla told her husband that they needed to leave for mexico that afternoon.
gradilla asked for permission to leave work to accompany his wife to the funeral.his supervisor told him that he did not qualify for bereavement leave under the collective bargaining agreement because his was not a member of his immediate family.gradilla then explained that he was not asking for bereavement leave.he told his supervisors that he needed to accompany his wife because of her heart condition,not because he personally wanted to attend the funeral.his supervisors then gave him permission to leave.neither gradilla nor his supervisors mentioned the leave as a request under the california family rights act.
after the conversation in the office,gradilla left work and headed straight for the airport to meet his wife and several other members of her family,who were also going to mexico for the funeral.gradilla called his employer from the airport and reported that he was about to leave for mexico and would be back in two or three days.later that afternoon,his son telephoned the employer and informed the person with whom he spoke that gradilla would not be in on thursday or friday,but that he would return to work as usual on monday.while the gradillas were in mexico,gradilla experienced problems with her heart condition,and gradilla cared for her by administering her medication and otherwise helping to keep her calm.because he was on a ranch with no telephone,and because he thought he would miss only two days of work,gradilla did not call in again to report his absence.
unbeknownst to gradilla,ruskin had scheduled a mandatory overtime workday on saturday,october because of the mandatory overtime workday,gradilla missed three days of work.when gradilla returned to work on monday,october,ruskin human resources department told him to go home and wait for someone from the company to contact him.three days later,on october,he was fired.the proffered reason for the termination was that gradilla violated ruskin three day policy.
after he was fired,gradilla filed a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing regarding his discharge and subsequently was issued a notice.he also filed a retaliatory discharge claim with the workers compensation board under cal.labor code as well as a workers compensation claim for the shoulder injury.
next,gradilla filed this action in state court.ruskin removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the complaint contained five causes of action violation of cal.california family rights act wrongful termination in violation of cal.labor code retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim breach of employment contract and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
ruskin moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion.the court held that gradilla was not protected by the california family rights act because he failed to provide proper medical certification of his wife illness.the court offered two alternative reasons for dismissing the retaliation claim first,the exclusive forum for a claim is the workers compensation appeals board and second,to the extent that the complaint raised the claim that ruskin retaliated against gradilla in violation of public policy,gradilla failed to establish a prima facie case.finally,the district judge dismissed the breach of contract and tort claims on the grounds that they were preempted by of the labor management relations act lmra.gradilla appealed.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.aguilera pirelli armstrong tire,cir.we will affirm only if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the district court applied the law correctly.id.the district judge decision regarding preemption is reviewed de novo.id.
a.the california family rights act claim 
gradilla asserts that his termination was unlawful because he had a right to family care and medical leave under the california family rights act cfra.the relevant portion of the cfra provides 
a i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for any employer to refuse to grant a request by any employee to take up to a total of in any period for family care and medical leave 
c for purposes of this section 
family care and medical leave means 
b leave to care for a parent or spouse who has a serious health condition.
cal.the cfra was modeled on the federal family and medical leave act fmla,and it incorporates fmla regulations to the extent that they do not conflict with california law.cal.admin.code,tit.cases interpreting the fmla apply equally to cfra claims in the absence of a conflict.mora,d.here,there is no conflict between cfra and fmla law.we therefore apply federal fmla law to gradilla cfra claim.
in order to qualify for cfra leave under the statute,gradilla must prove that he made a request for leave to care for a parent or spouse who has a serious health condition.only the first two elements are at issue in this appeal.
the request for leave,notice,and certification 
in his declaration in support of ruskin motion for summary judgment,plant superintendent john shaver claimed gradilla did not inform me that he needed to go to mexico because of any health condition experienced by his wife.however,gradilla asserted in his deposition that he told shaver t hat it was important for me to go to mexico because my wife felt ill and that it was an emergency.gradilla declaration similarly states that he requested permission from my supervisors to leave to accompany my wife to mexico due to her heart condition.gradilla also testified in his deposition that his supervisors knew about his wife heart condition well before the day he accompanied her to mexico.
the fmla regulations provide that employees need not expressly assert rights under the fmla or even mention the fmla,but may only state that leave is needed for a qualifying reason.c see also bachelder america west airlines,cir the fmla does not require that an employee give notice of a desire to invoke the fmla.rather,it requires that the employee give notice of need for fmla leave.quoting price city of wayne,cir.it is the employer responsibility,not the employee,to determine whether a leave request is likely to be covered by the fmla.bailey southwest gas,cir bachelder,at.if the employer requires more information in order to decide whether the fmla applies to an employee leave request,it is the employer duty to make further inquiries until it obtains enough information to make a determination.bailey,at bachelder at.in this case,gradilla testified that his employers knew about his wife medical condition,and that he mentioned her medical condition as the reason he needed to accompany her to mexico.on this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that gradilla provided sufficient notice to his employer under the cfra.
the district court found that gradilla could not claim cfra protections because he failed to follow cfra notice and certification provisions.this finding was in error.cfra notice provision reads if the employee need for a leave pursuant to this section is foreseeable,the employee shall provide the employer with reasonable advance notice of the need for the leave.cal.gov t code h.cfra text does not specify what an employee should do if his need for leave is not foreseeable.however,fmla regulations state that when the need for leave is unforeseeable,the employee should give notice as soon as is practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.as for certification,the cfra provides that an employer may require that an employee request for leave to care for a child,a spouse,or a parent who has a serious health condition be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of the individual requiring care.cal.gov t code j emphasis added.this provision does not state that an employee must provide certification in order to obtain leave,as the district court held.rather,it provides that an employer may require certification if it so chooses.however,ruskin did not require such certification.rather,its written policy allows it to ask for certification when it believes it advisable to do so.the policy reads ruskin may require that a family leave related to a serious health condition be supported by certification.gradilla testified that,although his supervisors knew about his wife medical condition,none of them ever asked him to provide certification.ruskin offered no evidence to the contrary.the district court erred in its finding that gradilla violated cfra certification requirement.
the district court also erred when it found that gradilla was not protected by the cfra because his wife doctor never requested or required him to accompany her to mexico.neither the cfra nor the fmla regulations provides that a doctor must request or require an employee to provide medical care to a relative who has a serious health condition in order for the employee to qualify for the act protection.rather,an employee is entitled to cfra leave if the purpose of the leave is to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.
leave to care for a family member 
gradilla claim under the cfra nevertheless fails because he has not presented evidence that he left work to care for his spouse within the scope of the cfra.the scope of the cfra does not include a requirement that an employer must accommodate an employee whose spouse decides,in spite of her serious medical condition,to travel away from her home for reasons unrelated to her medical treatment.
in marchisheck san mateo county,cir,an employee left work to move her son to the philippines.this court held that the employee had not created a factual dispute on the question of whether her son had a serious medical condition under the fmla.the court further held that even if the son had a serious medical condition,the employee was not entitled to fmla leave because she was not moving her son so that he could receive medical or psychological treatment.we stated 
plaintiff was not moving shaun so that he could receive or psychological treatment.indeed,plaintiff had no specific plans to seek medical attention for shaun when she reached the philippines,and he did not see a doctor of any kind for more than five months after he moved overseas.further,it is undisputed that there were no psychological services available within a drive of the rural area of the philippines to which plaintiff took shaun.
marchisheck,at.
in marchisheck,the son apparently did not require medical or psychological treatment during his travel,but in this case,gradilla wife needed her husband to provide medical and psychological care during their trip to mexico.however,this is a distinction without a difference under the cfra,because in marchisheck and in this case,the purpose and destination of the travel was to travel away from home for personal,not medical,reasons.in both cases,the person with a serious medical condition was distancing themselves from medical treatment.
the relevant administrative rule,a,b,gives several examples of caring for a family member 
a it includes situations where,for example,because of a serious health condition,the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic medical,hygienic,or nutritional needs or safety,or is unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor.the term also includes providing psychological comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a child,spouse,or parent with a serious health condition who is receiving inpatient or home care.
b the term also includes situations where the employee may be needed to fill in for others who are caring for the family member,or to make arrangements for changes in care,such as transfer to a nursing home.
emphasis added.
these examples suggest that caring for a family member with a serious health condition involves some level of participation in ongoing medical or psychological treatment of that condition,either inpatient or at home.the regulations mention transport which is to the doctor,and transfer which is to a nursing home.accord pang beverly hospital,th,d employee did not leave work to care for her elderly mother with a serious health condition when she helped her mother move from a home to a apartment.
it is undisputed that care includes both physical and psychological care,and that a parent or spouse can provide the care.in scamihorn general truck drivers,cir,we held that the employee had created a triable issue of fact regarding his eligibility for fmla leave when the employee left work to move to his father home because his presence in the home providing psychological support helped in the father recovery from depression.scamihorn,at.scamihorn does not support the proposition that physical or psychological care by a spouse or parent is covered by the fmla whenever the family member with a serious health condition chooses to travel for reasons.
the circumstances of the travel in this case,a funeral in mexico,were sympathetic,unfortunate,and lawful.if we hold that the cfra covered this situation,an employer would be required to grant family and medical leave whenever an employee has a spouse,parent,or child with a serious medical condition,and that family member requested the employee assistance while traveling.the travel could be for unlimited personal reasons,to any destination,for lawful or unlawful purposes,for business or vacation.courts would then have to decide,in each case,the worthiness of the family member travel motives.such a broad scope finds no support in the statute,regulations,or case law.
the judgment of the district court dismissing the claim under the cfra is affirmed.
b.the workers compensation retaliation claim 
gradilla contends,in the alternative,that he was fired in retaliation for filing a fourth workers compensation claim.it is unclear whether gradilla complaint states a claim for violation of cal.labor code,a claim for which the exclusive forum is the workers compensation appeals board,or whether it states a claim for retaliation in violation of the public policy expressed by.see city of moorpark superior court,cal th,d,holding that plaintiff may simultaneously pursue claim before workers compensation appeals board and action in state court for violation of public policy.however,we need not decide this question because we agree with the district court that,even if we construe the complaint to plead a public policy violation,gradilla can not establish a prima facie case of wrongful termination.
to make a prima facie case of wrongful termination,gradilla must show he was engaged in a protected activity he subsequently was subjected to an adverse employment action and there is a nexus,or causal link,between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.see yartzoff thomas,cir flait am.watch,th,d holding that california state law claims of retaliatory discharge are evaluated under the framework used in federal law relating to discrimination and retaliation.gradilla claim fails because he did not establish a nexus between the filing of the claim and his termination.gradilla presented no evidence,either in his deposition or in the form of a declaration,that ruskin knew that he had filed,or was going to file,a workers compensation claim before it made the decision to terminate him.the link is not established simply by evidence that the insurance company notified gradilla of its receipt of the claim rather,there must be some evidence that ruskin was aware that a claim had been filed or that it had participated in the filing process.gradilla offered no evidence on this point.he did present evidence that when his wife called he was obtaining written permission to see the doctor because his shoulder hurt however,the fact that he asked to see a doctor does not warrant a conclusion that ruskin knew that he had suffered an industrial injury and that he intended to file a workers compensation claim.it is possible,as gradilla argues,that the trip from the plant to the doctor is the first step in a chain of events that always and inevitably leads to the filing of a workers compensation claim.if that is true,gradilla request to see the doctor would have put ruskin on notice that he was about to file a fourth claim.however,there is no evidence in the record to support such a theory.accordingly,we affirm summary judgment for ruskin on this claim.
c.the and tort claims 
it is undisputed that gradilla was a member of a union,and that his position was covered by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement cba.the district court found that,because of the existence of the cba,gradilla common law breach of contract and tort claims are preempted by of the labor management relations act lmra.we affirm the district court judgment.
section of the lmra preempts state law claims that are based directly on rights created by a collective bargaining agreement as well as claims that are substantially dependent on an interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.caterpillar,williams,d.the claim that gradilla was contractually afforded protection against discharge is necessarily based on the collective bargaining agreement,therefore gradilla claim is preempted by of the lmra.
gradilla tort claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress are also preempted.section does not preempt claims for state law rights that do not reasonably require the court to interpret an existing provision of a cba to resolve the dispute.see cramer consolidated freightways,cir.however,because gradilla has not established a claim under the cfra or a claim for retaliatory discharge under cal.labor code,his tort claims resulting from the termination of his employment arise out of the same conduct which formed the basis of his breach of contract claim and are also preempted.see chmiel beverly wilshire hotel,cir.
conclusion 
gradilla claim under the cfra fails because the personal travel to mexico for a funeral is not within the scope of the statute.gradilla did not present enough evidence to create a triable issue of fact with respect to his workers compensation retaliation claim,and his breach of contract claim and tort claims are preempted by of the lmra.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
this case exemplifies compassionless conservatism.the majority reads the california family rights act sometimes referred to as the act,a statute designed to afford a minimal amount of humane and decent treatment to working people with families,as if it were a rigid code intended to limit their rights.the majority ignores the plain language of the statute as well as its purpose and instead poses an imaginary chain of horrors,claiming that a plain reading of the statute would cause courts to have to horrors make decisions in each case.on that basis it grants summary judgment to the corporate defendant 
that a poor,hardworking,hispanic man,struggling to support his family by performing manual labor,could be fired by his employer under the circumstances of this case is almost unimaginable.that a court could reach the decision the majority does here is even more incomprehensible.
the facts are simple.arnulfo gradilla,a loyal,employee of a machine shop who had several times been injured on the job but had always returned to work as soon as possible,suffered a comparatively minor fourth industrial accident.while in the company office seeking permission to see the doctor,he received notice that his had died suddenly in mexico and that his wife,who had a serious heart condition,needed him to accompany her on her short trip home for the funeral.the employer had long been aware of his wife serious medical condition.gradilla asked his supervisor for leave on the ground that he needed to leave to accompany my wife to mexico due to her heart condition.he was granted the leave 
when gradilla returned from mexico a few days later and reported for work,he was immediately ordered to go home and was then fired for wholly meritless and possibly pretextual reasons,including his failure to submit a medical certificate that,the majority acknowledges,he had not been asked to file and was not required to furnish failure to attend a mandatory overtime workday on saturday that the company did not announce until after he had left for mexico and failure to call in daily,another requirement which was not applicable in his case.indeed,the majority does not attempt to offer any legitimate reason for the discharge.the company may in truth have had an ulterior motive,as will be discussed below,but that in no way appears to trouble the majority.
the majority simply washes its hands of the employer unconscionable treatment of a worker struggling to take care of his seriously ill the sort of person the california family rights act was designed to creates a wholly baseless limitation on the statute that benefits the undeserving corporate employer and deprives gradilla of the act protection.under the limitation conjured up by the majority,the statute does not apply to gradilla because the funeral his seriously ill spouse had to attend was in her father hometown instead of in the city in which the corporate employer plant is located.there is simply no basis in law or precedent for such an uncharitable reading of the act.
there is another claim that the majority also wrongly bars gradilla from pursuing.gradilla asserts that the real reason he was fired was because on the day he accompanied his wife to mexico he filed a workers compensation claim.the majority ignores the plain evidence of retaliation in the record,concluding contrary to the undisputed facts that his employer did not know about his workers compensation claim when it discharged him.gradilla should be permitted to proceed to trial on both of his claim under the california family rights act,and his claim for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy expressed by of the california labor code.
notwithstanding the majority contention,there is no requirement in the california family rights act,the regulations issued pursuant to the federal family medical leave act,california case law,or our own precedent that,in order to merit protection under the act,care must take place in the home or en route to or from the doctor office.nothing in the language or structure of the act even suggests such a rule,and nothing in its spirit or purpose permits so shallow and callous an interpretation of its provisions.moreover,the cases the majority cites are plainly irrelevant.
it is a venerable principle of statutory interpretation that where the legislature makes a plain provision,without making any exception,the courts can make none.xi united states,quoting french lessee spencer,how.here,the plain text of the california family rights act provides without qualification that an employee is entitled to protection when he takes l eave to care for a parent or spouse who has a serious health condition.cal.a,c b the statute itself places no limits on the location at which care may be long as the employee actually provides care,and the relative actually has a serious medical condition.
the majority ignores the plain text of the statute,relying instead on a strained interpretation of the regulations governing the federal act.as noted by the majority,those regulations give several examples of caring for a family member 
a caring for a family member includes situations where,for example,because of a serious health condition,the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic medical,hygienic,or nutritional needs or safety,or is unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor.the term also includes providing psychological comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a child,spouse,or parent with a serious health condition who is receiving inpatient or home care.
b the term also includes situations where the employee may be needed to fill in for others who are caring for the family member,or to make arrangements for changes in care,such as transfer to a nursing home.
a b.nowhere does the regulation state that the examples are exclusive.nor,even more important,does the regulation anywhere state that in order to qualify for the federal act protection,an employee who actually provides basic medical,hygienic,or nutritional care to a family member who is unable to perform those tasks for himself must do so in the home,or that the statutory protections are forfeited when the family member is required to travel for an essential purpose other than medical necessity.there is no justification for the majority invention of such a needless,unwarranted,and cruel requirement nor for its mindless suggestion that if the act were construed to apply to an employee who accompanied his seriously ill wife to her father funeral,it would necessarily also be applicable when the reason for the seriously ill wife travel was to rob a bank or commit some other crime.
the majority interpretation of the federal regulation contradicts its purpose.the regulation aim is not to limit the kinds of activities that qualify as care,but to demonstrate that some activities that we may not normally think of as care are nevertheless covered by the act,so long as those activities are related to a serious health condition.the vision of care expressed by the regulations is expansive protection is extended not only for basic life support activities like feeding and medication monitoring or administration,but for ancillary support services like the provision of psychological support,transportation to the doctor,and making arrangements for institutional care,services which are not care in the ordinary sense.the regulations seek only to ensure that these indirect forms of care have a clear nexus with a serious health condition.hence,services such as the provision of transportation or psychological reassurance,which may or may not be related to a serious medical condition,are covered,but only if some other element is present to provide the nexus psychological reassurance to someone who is receiving inpatient care,transportation to the doctor,and the is wholly undefined.these phrases seek to ensure that services that would not ordinarily be covered because they do not constitute the ordinary providing of care,but are covered under the statute because of their ancillary status,are in fact related to a serious health condition.the italicized examples are not,however,intended to place geographical or other limitations on the provision of the most basic forms of care or to decree that all medical care must be afforded in the home or while traveling to the doctor.
the regulation recognizes what the majority does not the provision of direct medical,hygienic,or nutritional care to a spouse who can not care for herself is fundamentally different from the provision of ancillary services that may on particular occasions be necessary.in the case of direct assistance with basic needs,there is no necessity for an additional element to ensure the nexus between the care activity and the serious medical condition.there is simply no circumstance in which,for example,a child would need to administer medications to an elderly parent,who can not himself administer them,for some reason apart from the parent serious medical condition.the protections provided by the california family rights act and the federal family and medical leave act for direct forms of care do not depend on whether that care takes place in the home or in a motel room,in california or in mexico.seriously ill persons who need a to accompany them when they leave their homes do not lose their status as seriously ill spouses or parents whenever they venture outdoors or travel to some location or office other than their doctor.that is why the regulations do not place a geographic restriction on coverage for such care,or contain any restriction to the effect that basic care must be provided only in the home.
according to the evidence in the record,the care that gradilla provided during his wife short trip to mexico falls squarely within the first clause of the regulation,which covers situations in which because of a serious health condition,the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic medical,hygienic,or nutritional needs or safety.in addition to her heart condition,gradilla suffered from a nervous condition that would strike suddenly and cause her heart to beat dangerously fast.at these times,gradilla would be unable to measure the correct dosage of medicine for herself,and gradilla presence was necessary to administer her medication and to calm her down.gradilla especially needed her husband when she went home for her father funeral because his sudden death caused her much anxiety and stress,aggravating her heart condition and creating a heightened risk that she would have an episode in which she would need her husband immediate assistance.by accompanying his wife so that he could administer her medication in the event that she could not do so herself,gradilla cared for his seriously ill wife in the most basic way,and he is protected by the california family rights act regardless of where the caretaking activities took place.
the majority position is unsupported by our case law.marchisheck did not hold that accompanying a covered relative on a trip forfeits the protection of the family and medical leave act unless the travel itself is for a medical purpose.rather,it held that marchisheck trip with her son was not covered because he did not have a medical condition that required her presence during the travel or afterwards,and because the effect of the travel was to transfer her son from a place where he had previously received treatment to one where he would receive no treatment for any of his asserted conditions.at.marchisheck is,in short,a case about a covered relative who did not have a serious health condition and a mother who did not provide medical care to him.it is of no relevance here.
unlike in marchisheck,gradilla wife had a serious medical condition,and,by accompanying her on her emergency trip,gradilla provided basic ameliorative and precautionary care for the period of her brief family crisis.accordingly,gradilla was protected by the act throughout his wife brief trip to her father funeral,a trip during which his presence was necessary precisely because his caregiving services might be required at any time.gradilla did present evidence that,while in mexico,gradilla suffered a nervous episode,and that he actually administered her heart medication,a task that she was unable to perform for herself at that time.however,while this evidence adds factual support to his claim,it is by no means necessary in order to establish it.
pang beverly hospital,th,d,also cited by the majority,does not in any way support the majority unprecedented limitation on the california act.pang held only that a plaintiff who took time off to help her mother move was not covered by the act because the presence of an additional person was needed in order to help the movers arrange her mother furniture,not for the purpose of assisting with her mother medical condition.gradilla obviously was not arranging furniture.he was providing the care that was required in order to try to ensure that his wife would survive.
the majority reading of the fmla regulations,and its application of those regulations to this case,run directly counter to the intent of the california legislature in enacting the california family rights act.the act legislative history plainly states the overarching theme of this legislation has been the need to permit workers to take leave to care for their families without fear of job loss,and,except for limitations based on the number of employees or familial relationship,the bill should have the broadest possible implementation.see assembly daily journal,reg.sess,ca.emphasis added.the california legislature did not intend that a worker like gradilla,who took leave in order to care for a wife with a serious medical condition,would lose the act protection and his job simply because the care took place outside the home.i would hold that the california family rights act protects gradilla,just as it protects every worker in california who must take leave from work to care for a seriously ill spouse,parent,or child.
the employer stated below that it fired gradilla because he violated its policy.neither the district court nor the majority discussed this pretextual reason.however,if his employer did apply this rule to gradilla,and it is doubtful on this record that it did,it did so in contravention of the act.the federal regulations state that an employee shall provide the employer with notice of the anticipated timing and duration of the leave.c.gradilla did so.the fmla regulations also allow an employer to require an employee to report periodically on his leave status and intent to return to work.emphasis added.the reporting policy,however,must take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances related to the individual employee leave situation.id.here,the employee unquestionably notified his employer of the facts regarding the emergency leave at the moment he learned of them.in addition,he had his son call in and inform the employer that he was at the airport,ready to leave on his trip,and that he would be back at work on monday.given that gradilla,a sheet metal assembler,went on an emergency trip to mexico that was scheduled to last only three working days if indeed the,mandatory overtime workday on saturday counts as a workday under the circumstances of this case,a requirement that he call in every day would have served no legitimate purpose and in any event would have contravened the fmla regulations.on the record before us,gradilla was entitled to leave under the california family rights act,and summary judgment for his employer was therefore improper.gradilla claim under the act should be remanded for trial.
i disagree with the majority with respect to gradilla other claim,as well.gradilla alleged that he was a good worker who was fired in retaliation for having filed a fourth meritorious worker compensation claim.he alleges that the company explanation that he was fired for violating its policy is simply a pretext.in such case,the discharge would violate the public policy expressed by of the california labor code.given the company complete inability to advance a legitimate explanation for gradilla discharge,this claim should also proceed to trial.
the majority explanation for rejecting gradilla wrongful termination there is no evidence in the record that the employer knew about the workers compensation simply incorrect.the employer must have known about the claim because it sent the claim form to its insurance company before it fired gradilla.in california,an employer is required to provide an injured employee with a claim form within one working day of receiving notice of the injury.cal.labor code a.the claim is filed when the worker fills out the form and gives it to his employer.id.c.the employer is then required to send the form to its insurance agent for processing.id.on tuesday,october,gradilla informed his employer that he had been injured that day.on october,he filled out the paperwork related to the injury.that same day,he left for mexico.when he returned to work on monday,he was told to go home and wait for a call.three days later,on october,he was fired.the same day that he was fired,the company insurance company wrote but apparently did not mail gradilla a letter that said that it was handling his workers compensation claim on behalf of ruskin the letter stated that the injury had occurred on october,and that the claim had already been given a file number.there is simply no way that the employer insurance company could have received notice of the claim unless the employer had mailed it to them.and the employer could not have mailed it to them unless gradilla had completed the claim form when he was in the office on october.thus,the employer had to have known about the claim before it fired gradilla.
to establish a prima facie case of wrongful termination,gradilla must establish that he was engaged in a protected activity he subsequently was subjected to an adverse employment action and there is a nexus,or causal link,between the protected activity and the adverse action.if a prima facie case is established,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a explanation for the firing.however,the plaintiff may then show that the defendant explanation is pretextual.see yartzoff thomas,cir flait north american watch,th,d california state law claims of retaliatory discharge are evaluated under the framework used in federal law relating to discrimination and retaliation.
there is no doubt that gradilla met the first two conditions.he filed a workers compensation claim,and he was fired.the only question with respect to whether he can establish a prima facie case is whether he can show a nexus.in california,it is not difficult to make such a showing.under california law,t he retaliatory motive is proved by showing that plaintiff engaged in protected activities,that his employer was aware of the protected activities,and that the adverse action followed within a relatively short time thereafter.morgan regents of of,th,d.causation can be inferred from timing alone where an adverse employment action follows on the heels of protected activity.villiarimo aloha island air,see also passantino johnson johnson consumer products,cir same,citing cases.in this case,the adverse employment action was taken within a week after gradilla filed his fourth workers compensation claim.this short time frame certainly qualifies as on the heels of protected activity and is enough to create a prima facie case.
once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the defendant to put forth a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the termination.in this case,the employer relies on its contention that gradilla violated several company rules in connection with his trip on which he accompanied his wife to mexico.however,its proffered reasons are not particularly credibl
