linda sims appeals from the district court order upholding the denial of her applications for disability insurance benefits dib and supplemental security income ssi by the social security administration ssa.sims contends that the decision by the administrative law judge alj is not supported by substantial evidence because the alj ignored or misstated significant medical findings in the record.we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
sims was born in and has a high school equivalent education.in the early she worked as a cashier,but stopped working in july,allegedly because of migraine headaches,hypertension,difficulties concentrating,memory problems,anxiety,depression,shortness of breath,and chronic pack pain.despite those problems,sims worked at home in and as a telemarketer.
sims physical impairments 
sims was first diagnosed with hypertension in october after complaining of migraine headaches and blurred vision.a doctor at wishard memorial hospital wishard in indianapolis noted sims elevated blood pressure and prescribed medication.a week later the doctor noted that sims blood pressure had greatly improved,and sims reported a decrease in headaches.sims stopped taking her medication two months later because she allegedly could not afford the cost.in december eugena burrow documented sims elevated blood pressure and encouraged sims to follow up for appropriate treatment of her blood pressure.sims did not receive any treatment until september,when kendrick henderson noted her elevated blood pressure and prescribed medication.in the following months sims blood pressure remained high,and numerous medical reports indicate that sims often did not take her medication as prescribed.
sims went to the emergency room three times in april and once in august,each time due to syncope fainting.sims examination in august for syncope included a computed tomography ct scan of her brain,which,according to stacy greenspan,revealed generalized atrophy and focal areas of decreased attenuation that were consistent with old lacunar infarcts the ct scan,however,revealed no acute abnormalities.her discharge summary opined that the syncope episodes were most likely due to dehydration.
sims kidney problems were first recognized in may when she underwent a renal scan for her elevated level.henderson noted that the scan did not reflect the location of sims right kidney.during sims hospitalization a few months later for syncope,a ct scan revealed a normal left kidney and a small right kidney that appeared to function somewhat symmetrically with the left kidney.the discharge summary concluded that sims small kidney may be contributing to blood pressure problems and even syncope and that her i ncreased renin may be due to possible renal artery stenosis of the right kidney.the following month park concluded that a renal scan revealed a decrease in sims left kidney function from the previous may as well as a nonfunctioning right kidney.in early harold lenett noted that sims right renal arteries were completely occluded and that she had a single left renal artery with mild stenosis,which was probably not clinically significant.despite these kidney problems,sims highest serum creatinine was slightly higher than the normal range of.see the merck manual,supra note at.

sims first argues that she qualifies under listing because of left artery stenosis and right kidney total dysfunction.to qualify under listing,a claimant must have an impairment of renal function that either raises the claimant serum creatinine to or re
