in the four cases giving rise to these eleven consolidated appeals,kathleen sebelius,secretary of the department of health and human services hhs,and toby douglas,director of the california department of health care services dhcs,appeal the district court grant of preliminary injunctions in favor of various providers and beneficiaries of medi cal,california medicaid program plaintiffs.the injunctions prohibit the director and dhcs from implementing reimbursement rate reductions authorized by the california legislature and approved by the secretary.the injunctions also stay the secretary approval.plaintiffs the court modification of its orders to allow the rate reductions as to medi cal services provided before the injunctions took effect.
plaintiffs assert claims against the secretary under the administrative procedures act apa and against the director under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,claiming that the reimbursement rate reductions do not comply with a a hereafter a.in support of their claims,plaintiffs rely primarily on our decision in orthopaedic hospital belshe,cir.in orthopaedic hospital,the federal government was not a party.as such,we did not address whether deference was owed to the secretary interpretation of the statute.instead,we interpreted a as requiring a state seeking to reduce medicaid reimbursement rates first to consider the costs of providing medical services subject to the rate reductions.dhcs did not consider such studies in all of the medicaid services subject to the rate reductions.the secretary points out that congress expressly delegated to her the authority and responsibility to approve state medicaid plans.she argues that her approval of the rate reductions,including her view that a does not necessarily require cost studies or any other particular methodology,is entitled to deference,overrides orthopaedic hospital,and complies with the apa.
in addition to joining the secretary arguments,the director contends that plaintiffs can not maintain a direct cause of action under the supremacy clause for violation of a.although we have previously discussed this issue in a case where the secretary had not acted,independent living center of southern california shewry,cir,the director argues that our holding in that case is not binding in a situation where,as here,the secretary has already exercised her discretion to approve the rate reductions as consistent with federal law.
the district court held that plaintiffs in all four cases were likely to succeed on the merits of their apa and supremacy clause claims,and that the plaintiffs in one case were likely to succeed on their claim under the takings clause of the united states constitution.the court also concluded that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm absent the injunctions and that the injunctions favored the public interest.we have jurisdiction under a,and we conclude that the district court misapplied the applicable legal rules and thus did not appropriately exercise its discretion.
we hold that orthopaedic hospital does not control the outcome in these cases because it did not consider the key issue here the secretary interpretation of a,the secretary approval of california requested reimbursement rates including her permissible view that prior to reducing rates states need not follow any specific procedural steps,such as considering providers costs is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,and the secretary approval complies with the apa.we further hold that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their supremacy clause claims against the director because assuming that the supremacy clause provides a private right of action even where the secretary has acted the secretary has reasonably determined that the state reimbursement rates comply with a.finally,we hold that none of the plaintiffs has a viable takings claim because medicaid,as a voluntary program,does not create property rights.the district court orders concluding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims must be reversed,the preliminary injunctions vacated,and the cases remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we dismiss plaintiffs as moot.

the state of california has tried on several occasions to reduce reimbursement rates to providers of certain medi cal services through the spa process.the rates involved in these appeals were initiated by assembly bill,where the legislature stated,
in order to minimize the need for drastically cutting enrollment standards or benefits during times of economic crisis,it is crucial to find areas within the program where reimbursement levels are higher than required under the standard provided in a and can be reduced in accordance with federal law.
cal.welf.a emphasis added.the statute granted the director the authority to identify where reimbursement rates could be reduced and instructed the director not to implement any reductions unless and until the director determined that the reductions will comply with applicable federal medicaid requirements and obtained federal approval.id.m,o.
pursuant to that authority,dhcs studied the potential impact of rate reductions on many medi cal services,reviewing data collected and analyzed over several years in the process.the director concluded that reimbursement rates could be reduced consistently with federal law for pharmacy services durable medical equipment emergency and nonemergency medical transportation certain physician,clinic,and dental services and services provided by distinct part nursing facilities.are skilled nursing facilities operated by hospitals as distinct parts within those hospitals.rates for most of these services were to be reduced ten percent from current rate levels,though some were to be reduced ten percent from rate levels as they existed in to.
dhcs prepared two spas for submission to cms.federal officials were in frequent contact with the director during this process.spa requested approval of the rate reductions for services spa requested approval of the rate reductions for all of the other services at issue.
in support of spas and,dhcs submitted access studies for each of the affected services.these studies reviewed data focused primarily on enrollee needs,provider availability,and utilization of services the same factors macpac uses in its access analyses.although dhcs included studies of providers costs with respect to some of the services,such as certain pharmacy costs and costs incurred by,it did not review cost data with respect to most of the services subject to the rate reduction.the studies concluded that spas and are unlikely to diminish access.
dhcs also submitted an page monitoring plan,which identified different measures dhcs will study on a recurring basis to ensure the spas do not negatively affect beneficiary access.these measures address the three categories of factors macpac identified as affecting access beneficiary data,provider availability data,and service utilization data.included among the data dhc s will monitor are changes in medi cal and dental enrollment,primary care supply ratios,provider participation rates,bed vacancy rates,visits to emergency rooms,and preventable hospitalization rates.
various providers and provider groups,including some of the plaintiffs,offered extensive input to cms as well.for example,the california hospital association cha wrote to the agency multiple times to express its disapproval of the spas.cms considered a special report commissioned by cha the report concluded most operate at a loss.cha and the california medical association cma submitted a survey purporting to show that the reductions would inhibit access.as cms later noted,there were several shortcomings with this survey,including that it was conducted over nine days and involved only california residents.
cms approved both spas.the approval letters were succinct,but they explained that,i n light of the data cms reviewed,the monitoring plan,and cms consideration of stakeholder input,dhcs had submitted sufficient information to show that its spas complied with a.as part of the analysis of this amendment,the state was able to provide metrics which adequately demonstrated beneficiary access,including the t otal number of providers by type and geographic location and participating medi cal providers by type and geographic area,the t otal number of medi cal beneficiaries by eligibility type,u tilization of services by eligibility type over time,and an a nalysis of benchmark service utilization where available.cms approved the reduced rates retroactively to june.
four groups of plaintiffs filed suit against the secretary and the director in the united states district court for the central district of california.managed pharmacy care sebelius.cv cas man appeal the mpc case,was filed by five pharmacies,a pharmacy organization,an independent living center,a state association of independent living centers,and a medi cal beneficiary.california medical association douglas.cv cas man appeal,the cma case,was filed by professional associations representing the interests of physicians,dentists,pharmacists,suppliers of durable medical equipment,providers of care for aids patients,providers of emergency medical transportation,and a medical beneficiary.california medical transportation association douglas.cv casman appeal,the cmta case,was filed by a provider of medical transportation services,a trade association representing other such providers,and a medi cal beneficiary.california hospital association douglas.cv cas man appeal,the cha case,was filed by five medi cal beneficiaries and a trade association representing the interests of.
the district court declined to defer to the secretary approval of the spas and granted plaintiffs motions for preliminary injunctions.the court determined that our decision in orthopaedic hospital required the state to consider cost data prior to submitting the spas to cms and disagreed with dhcs research methodology with respect to the potential impact of the reductions on beneficiary access.for example,the district court determined that the state participating pharmacy list incorrectly included some pharmacies,that the analysis of improperly considered freestanding nursing facilities,and that dhcs geographic analysis was flawed because it focused on an county model rather than one based on physical location.the court determined also that cms acceptance of the monitoring plan was inappropriate because at best the monitoring plan creates a potential response after a quality deficiency has been identified.thus,the district court held,plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their apa claims that the spas violate a.the court also held that the supremacy clause provides a private right of action to challenge the reimbursement rates as violating a and that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on those claims as well.in the cha case,the district court entered the preliminary injunction on the additional ground that because state law places certain restrictions on how and when may stop treating medicaid patients,cha would likely succeed on its takings claim.
in the mpc,cmta,and cha cases,the injunctions initially prohibited the director from applying the rate reductions to any services rendered after june.in the cma case,however,the court determined that enjoining the reductions as to services rendered before the injunctions took effect would violate the state eleventh amendment sovereign immunity and limited its injunction accordingly.on motions of the director,the district court modified the other injunctions along the same lines.
the secretary and the director appeal.plaintiffs crossappeal the district court decision to allow the new rates with respect to medicaid services rendered before the effective date of the injunctions.
standard of review 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy and is appropriate only when the party seeking the injunction establish es that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council.

apa claims against the secretarya 
we first consider whether our decision in orthopaedic hospital is dispositive of the issues in these appeals.
in orthopaedic hospital,a hospital and hospital association challenged california reduction of reimbursement rates for providers of hospital outpatient services,arguing that dhcs reduced the rates without proper consideration of the effect of hospital costs on the a factors of efficiency,economy,quality of care,and beneficiary access.at.the state did not dispute that it had not considered providers costs of offering medicaid services,but argued that its reductions nonetheless complied with a because the statute did not require it to study such costs.
hhs was not a party in orthopaedic hospital,and we did not have the benefit of the agency position regarding the requirements of a.we owed no deference to the state position that a does not require cost studies because a state agency interpretation of federal statutes is not entitled to the deference afforded a federal agency interpretation of its own statutes.id.at.we thus had to determine the proper interpretation of the statute on our own.id.at.
we interpreted a as requiring the state to consider providers cost of services prior to setting reimbursement rates for those services 
the statute provides that payments for services must be consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,and that those payments must be sufficient to enlist enough providers to provide access to medicaid recipients.dhcs can not know that it is setting rates that are consistent with efficiency,economy,quality of care and access without considering the costs of providing such services.it stands to reason that the payments for hospital outpatient services must bear a reasonable relationship to the costs of providing quality care incurred by efficiently and economically operated hospitals.
plaintiffs contend that a simple application of orthopaedic hospital decides these cases.we disagree,for two reasons.
first,we recognized in orthopaedic hospital that our standard of review might have been different had the agency spoken on the issue.id.at noting the deference afforded a federal agency interpretation of its own statutes under chevron.this is because chevron policy underpinnings emphasize the expertise and familiarity of the federal agency with the subject matter of its mandate and the need for coherent and uniform construction of federal law nationwide.id.internal quotation marks omitted.because the agency was not a party to the litigation and had not yet set forth its position on the requirements of a,there was no issue of whether we should defer to the agency.these appeals,however,present just that question.
second,the secretary has now set forth her interpretation,through her approvals of the spas,that a does not prescribe any particular methodology a state must follow before its proposed rates may be approved.cms explicitly approved california spas as consistent with the requirements of a even though cost data was not available with respect to all of the services,thereby determining that the lack of cost studies did not preclude california from reducing medi cal reimbursement rates.a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.cable telecomm.ass brand x internet servs.brand x,garfias rodriguez holder,slip,wl,cir,en banc concluding that,pursuant to brand x,our prior construction of two provisions of the immigration and nationality act did not survive a contrary reading by the board of immigration appeals.although orthopaedic hospital was grounded in the language of the statute as are all of our statutory interpretation cases we did not hold that our view of a represented the only reasonable interpretation of that statute.we read the statute in the absence of an authoritative agency construction and decided the case accordingly.and although we cited orthopaedic hospital with approval in alaska dhss,there was no brand x issue to consider in that case.see alaska dhss,at.
for these reasons,orthopaedic hospital does not automatically render the spa approvals arbitrary and capricious.
we now consider whether the secretary approval based on her view that a does not impose a particular process on the states is entitled to chevron deference.this familiar standard requires a court to abide by an agency interpretation or implementation of a statute it administers if congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue and if the agency answer is permissible under the statute.chevron,at.
but not every administrative act is entitled to chevron deference.united states mead.in reviewing an administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision,we defer to the agency decision when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.id.at.
arguably,the supreme court has already concluded that spa approvals meet the chevron mead standard by stating that t he medicaid act commits to the federal agency the power to administer a federal program.and here the agency has acted under this grant of authority by approving a spa.that decision carries weight.douglas indep.living ctr.of.because the douglas court also recognized that the deference question had not been fully argued,id.at,we proceed with our own analysis.we keep in mind,however,that we afford considered dicta from the supreme court a weight that is greater than ordinary judicial dicta as prophecy of what that court might hold.united states montero camargo,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.
the first prong of the mead standard is easily satisfied in these cases the secretary shall approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in the statute.b.congress expressly delegated to the secretary the authority to interpret a and to determine whether a state medicaid program conforms to federal requirements.
the second mead prong whether the secretary interpreted a and approved california spas within the exercise of her delegated authority depends on the form and context of the approvals.price stevedoring servs.of,cir en banc.delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways,as by an agency power to engage in adjudication or rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.mead,at.
we have already considered the application of chevron to the spa process.in alaska dhss,the secretary disapproved a spa,concluding that alaska proposal to raise reimbursement rates was inconsistent with a standards of efficiency and economy.at.in doing so,cms exercised its authority,delegated by congress,to review medicaid plans.thus,we deferred to the agency disapproval,holding that the statutory terms efficiency and economy left a gap that cms permissibly filled via adjudication.id.
there does not appear to be any logical reason why congress would delegate to the secretary the discretion to decide that a proposed spa violates a,but choose to withhold from her that same discretion if she decides the spa complies with a.the nature of her authority is the same in both instances.nonetheless,the district court distinguished alaska dhss because that case relied in part on the formal administrative process afforded the state in the case of a spa disapproval.alaska dhss,at.
when the secretary disapproves a proposed plan amendment,a state has the opportunities to petition for reconsideration,brief its arguments,be heard at a formal hearing,receive reasoned decisions at multiple levels of review,and submit exceptions to those decisions.id.in the case of an approval,however,the medicaid program does not provide interested parties with similar opportunities although they may certainly avail themselves of the formal process provided in a suit under the apa.this difference,argue the plaintiffs,shows that chevron deference is not appropriate to cms spa approvals.
it is true that alaska dhss relied on the formal petition process afforded the state in the case of a disapproval.but that was not the only reason we deferred to the agency decision.section a undefined terms efficiency and economy leave a gap that cms permissibly filled,and the agency appropriately elucidate d the meaning of the statute via adjudication.id.at.cms did the same thing here.
importantly,we recognized in alaska dhss that the formal process afforded the state was clear evidence that congress intended the agency final determination to carry the force of law.id.at emphasis added internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.but formal process is not the only evidence of such congressional intent.in the absence of formal procedures,courts must determine whether there are any other circumstances reasonably suggesting that congress intended deference to an agency decision.mead,at emphasis added.there are many such circumstances to consider.for example,the interstitial nature of the legal question,the related expertise of the a gency,the importance of the question to administration of the statute,the complexity of that administration,and the careful consideration the a gency has given the question over a long period of time are all factors favoring chevron deference.barnhart walton.
considering all the evidence of chevron delegation in these cases,we hold that the balance tips to the side of deference.the language of a is broad and diffuse.sanchez johnson,cir.the statute uses words like consistent,sufficient,efficiency,and economy,without describing any specific steps a state must take in order to meet those standards.the statute amorphous language suggest s that the agency expertise is relevant in determining its application.douglas.at.
medicaid administration is nothing if not complex.determining a plan compliance with a,as well as its compliance with a host of other federal laws,is central to the program because a state can not participate in medicaid without a plan approved by the secretary as consistent with those laws.the executive branch has been giving careful consideration to the ins and outs of the program since its inception,and the agency is the expert in all things medicaid.and let us not forget that a very good indicator of delegation meriting chevron treatment is an express congressional authorization to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.mead,at.that express delegation is precisely what we have here.therefore,despite the lack of formal procedures available for interested parties,the secretary exercise of discretion in the form and context of a spa approval deserves chevron deference.price,at 
in holding that chevron applies to spa approvals,we reach a conclusion similar to that reached by the circuit.in pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america thompson,then secretary thompson of hhs approved a michigan spa designed to implement a state prescription drug coverage program for beneficiaries of medicaid.the plaintiffs there,as here,argued that spa approvals are not the result of a formal administrative process and are therefore akin to interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,which are beyond the chevron pale.id.at quoting mead,at.
the circuit rejected this argument because it 
overlooks the nature of the secretary authority.this is not a case of implicit delegation of authority through the grant of general implementation authority.in the case of the medicaid payment statute,the congress expressly conferred on the secretary authority to review and approve state medicaid plans as a condition to disbursing federal medicaid payments in carrying out this duty,the secretary is charged with ensuring that each state plan complies with a vast network of specific statutory requirements through this express delegation of specific interpretive authority,mead,at.at,the congress manifested its intent that the secretary determinations,based on interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions,should have the force of law.
id.at emphasis added.therefore,the court deferred to the agency approval of the michigan spa and also determined that the agency did not violate the apa.id.at.
we agree with the circuit reasoning.see alaska dhss,at citing pharm.research mfrs.of am.with approval.the medicaid program is a colossal undertaking,jointly funded by the federal government and the states.congress explicitly granted the secretary authority to determine whether a state medicaid plan complies with federal law.the secretary understands the act and is especially cognizant of the yet sometimes competing interests of efficiency,economy,quality of care,and beneficiary access.it is well within the secretary mandate to interpret the statute via spa adjudication.
because congress intended spa approvals to have the force of law,we now ask whether the secretary interpretation that a requires a result,not a particular methodology such as cost studies,is based on a permissible reading of a.chevron,at.we have no doubt that it is.
the statute says nothing about cost studies.it says nothing about any particular methodology.see holder martinez gutierrez,deferring to the board of immigration appeals reading of a because the statute does not mention imputation of a parent years of residence to a child,much less require it.rather,by its terms a requires a substantive result reimbursement rates must be consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality care,and sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure adequate beneficiary access.congress did not purport to instruct the secretary how to accomplish these substantive goals.that decision is left to the agency.
the idea that a state should consider providers costs prior to reducing reimbursement rates seems at first blush to be logical.as we stated in orthopaedic hospital,costs are an integral part of the consideration.at.but even then,we acknowledged that beneficiary access to medicaid services appears to be driven to a degree by factors independent of costs of the services.id.at.an agency interpretation prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute,whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best.martinez gutierrez.at.the position that costs might or might not be one appropriate measure by which to study beneficiary access,depending on the circumstances of each state plan,is entirely reasonable.each state participating in medicaid has unique,local interests that come to bear.the secretary must be free to consider,for each state,the most appropriate way for that state to demonstrate compliance with a.
moreover,the term cost is not as free from ambiguity as the plaintiffs would have us believe.when one shops at a retail outlet and sees a price on an item,the cost to the consumer is that price,period.but when one attempts to determine how the price or cost to the consumer has been calculated,a whole host of intangibles come into play,such as cost of goods,depreciation,profit,overhead,deferred compensation,advertising.the term cost may also include items such as contract prices to suppliers and service providers,which may themselves be negotiated and reduced if reimbursement rates are reduced.nowhere in this record have we been able to find a description by the plaintiffs of a useful definition of costs and that term is anything but a talisman solving all problems or providing answers
