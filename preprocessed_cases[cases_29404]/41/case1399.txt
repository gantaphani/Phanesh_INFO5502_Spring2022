karen shipman filed suit pursuant to against deputy eric hamilton of the randolph county sheriff department.in her complaint,shipman asserted that hamilton had violated her rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments when he arrested her while she was on duty as a nurse at the sparta community hospital the hospital in sparta,illinois.hamilton filed a motion for summary judgment.in that motion,he argued that he had probable cause to arrest shipman.in the alternative,hamilton asserted that he was entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied hamilton motion,and he filed this interlocutory appeal.we affirm.
we begin by setting forth the facts as the district court found them,that is,in the light most favorable to shipman.see johnson jones,d.on the night of april,shipman,a registered nurse,was on duty at the floor of the hospital.while shipman had worked a few shifts in the hospital emergency room,that night was shipman first night on duty on the floor.
around midnight,hamilton and deputy rod queen entered the hospital to serve an emergency order of protection on roscoe handsbury,a patient at the hospital who was in an environment.at the time the officers arrived,shipman was the nurse,and the only registered nurse,on the floor.the officers announced that they had papers to serve handsbury and asked to speak to handsbury nurse.in response,shipman told the officers that she was handsbury nurse.
what happened next is disputed.while hamilton testified at his deposition that shipman would not give the officers handsbury location,shipman testified at her deposition that she pointed out to the officers the room where handsbury was located.shipman testimony is confirmed by queen,who testified at his deposition that shipman told them where handsbury was and that they could see handsbury through the window in his room.according to shipman,after she gave the officers handsbury location,hamilton inquired about handsbury condition.shipman responded that,although she was not sure of his exact condition,she thought she needed to call the doctor because the report on handsbury stated that he had been extremely upset and crying throughout the day.shipman then told the officers that,given his condition,she thought they should wait for the doctor to be present before serving handsbury.shipman was concerned about a stroke or other potential medical complication if the officers woke up handsbury in the middle of the night to serve him.she also feared violating her obligations under the health insurance portability and accounting act if she let the officers into handsbury room.
at that point,hamilton suggested that shipman call her supervisors.shipman first called the doctor,elvira salarda.salarda told shipman that handsbury was not going anywhere and that the officers should come back in the morning when she was present.salarda also suggested that shipman call her supervisor kathy lehr.at her deposition,shipman testified that,while she was on the phone with the doctor,hamilton started to become aggravated.after getting off the phone with salarda,shipman called lehr and explained to her what salarda had said.shipman then gave the phone to hamilton who,shipman testified,was at this point very aggravated.lehr told hamilton that he ought to return to the hospital at the next morning so he could serve handsbury while a doctor was present.
meanwhile,after handing the phone to hamilton,matters would be taken care to her nursing duties.as soon as hamilton got off the phone,however,he approached shipman,who was preparing an iv,told her she had blocked his service of process by calling the doctor,stated that he was going to arrest her,and demanded her name.according to shipman,she did not respond to hamilton because she was stunned.hamilton then grabbed shipman by the arms,cuffed her,and forced her down the hallway,out of the hospital.the charges filed against shipman list obstructing service of process in violation of ilcs and obstructing a peace officer in violation of ilcs as the grounds for the arrest 
on march,shipman filed this action against hamilton.she alleged that hamilton violated her rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments by arresting her without probable cause.hamilton moved for summary judgment.he argued that he had probable cause to arrest shipman.in the alternative,he asserted that he was entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion on both grounds,and hamilton appeals.
the only question before us on this appeal is whether,taking the facts as the district court presented them,the district court erred in finding that hamilton was not entitled to qualified immunity for his arrest of shipman.we have jurisdiction to consider this purely legal question.via lagrand,cir citing johnson,at.see also sallenger oakes,cir recognizing the urgency of denials of qualified immunity,a denial of summary judgment on these grounds is deemed a final judgment under and is immediately appealable.we review a district court denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds de novo.washington haupert,cir.
qualified immunity shields governmental actors performing discretionary functions from suit insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity in any particular case is a inquiry.saucier katz,d.first,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,we must consider whether the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.id.if no constitutional right would have been violated were the plaintiff allegations established,our inquiry is at an end and summary judgment should be entered in favor of the officer.id.on the other hand,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.id.f or a constitutional right to be clearly established,its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right in other words,in the light of preexisting law the unlawfulness must be apparent.white city of markham,cir internal quotations omitted.if the right was clearly established,the officer is not entitled to qualified immunity.washington,at emphasis in original.
in this case,the constitutional right shipman alleges that hamilton violated when he arrested her without a warrant was her right to be free from an unreasonable seizure under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.the fourth amendment permits warrantless arrests only if the arresting officer has probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed.id.citing thompson wagner,cir.probable cause exists where an officer reasonably believes,in light of the facts and circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest,that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.payne pauley,cir.the test is an objective one and evaluates whether probable cause existed on the facts as they appeared to a reasonable police officer,even if the reasonable belief of that officer is ultimately found to be incorrect.id.citing kelley myler,cir.according to the charges filed against shipman,hamilton arrested shipman for obstructing service of process in violation of ilcs and obstructing a peace officer in violation of ilcs.the question,then,is whether hamilton had probable cause to arrest shipman for either of those offenses.
we can immediately rule out probable cause for an arrest of shipman for obstruction of a peace officer.under illinois law,the offense of obstructing a police officer requires some sort of physical resistance on the part of the suspect.payne,at it is well settled under illinois law that the resistance ilcs requires must be physical.here,taking the facts as we have them,shipman did not physically resist hamilton.
that leaves the offense of obstructing service of process as the only ground upon which hamilton can justify his arrest of shipman.obstructing service of process is defined as knowingly resist ing or obstruct ing the
