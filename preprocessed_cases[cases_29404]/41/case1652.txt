veales davidson appeals the judgment of the district court upholding the social security commissioner decision to deny his application for supplemental security income ssi under title xvi of the social security act.we affirm.
veales davidson was born in.he completed the ninth grade and obtained a general education diploma.from to,he worked in seasonal agricultural jobs,and in,he worked as a janitor operating a fork lift in a factory.in,the last year he was employed,he worked briefly assembling electrical conduits on an assembly line and shoveling rice at a rice mill.since,he has been treated for major depression and hospitalized in mental health care facilities on several occasions.since,he has suffered from chronic hepatitis c,a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver.he also has a history of drug and alcohol abuse ending around.
in february,davidson filed an application for ssi under title xvi of the social security act,alleging disability since december.the social security administration ssa denied his application initially and upon reconsideration.davidson then requested and received an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge alj,who denied the application on the ground that davidson was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.see id.a a,b.davidson sought review of that decision by the ssa appeals council.the appeals council vacated the alj decision and remanded the case for further evaluation of davidson depression.in august,following a second hearing,the alj denied davidson application,and the appeals council denied davidson request for review.
in april,davidson brought a civil action in district court.see g,c.the commissioner filed a motion to remand the case for further development of the record,including evaluation by an alj of additional evidence submitted to the appeals council.the district court granted the commissioner motion and dismissed the case without prejudice.in december,following a third hearing,the alj denied davidson application once again.
the alj used the familiar sequential evaluation process to determine whether davidson was disabled.see bowen yuckert,d.at steps one through three,the alj found that davidson had not performed substantial gainful activity since december that he suffered from several severe impairments,including chronic hepatitis c,recurrent major depression,and a remote history of drug and alcohol abuse and that his impairments did not meet or equal an impairment listed in the regulations.at step four,the alj found that davidson was unable to perform his past relevant work as a janitor operating a forklift,but that he retained the residual functional capacity rfc to perform unskilled light work with certain restrictions.in assessing davidson physical limitations,the alj did not give significant weight to the opinions of two of davidson treating.michael hightower,a gastroenterologist who treated davidson hepatitis c,and mark hahn,a physician at a family practice clinic who saw davidson periodically and monitored his overall physical and mental condition.the alj relied on the opinion of a designated medical expert,john murray,who reviewed the medical evidence and concluded that davidson had no functional limitations for basic activities resulting from his chronic hepatitis,and that he could perform light exertional work from july through february.
at step five,after considering davidson age,education,work experience,and rfc,the alj found that there was a significant number of jobs in the national economy that davidson could perform,including work as a cleaner,assembler,or hand or machine packager.this finding was based on the testimony of a vocational expert who responded to a hypothetical question posed by the alj.because the ability to perform jobs in the national economy precludes a finding of disability,g,the alj concluded that davidson was not entitled to ssi payments.
the appeals council denied review of the alj decision,resulting in a final decision of the commissioner.van vickle astrue,cir.davidson again brought suit in the district court,and in september,the court upheld the commissioner decision.davidson appeals.
we review de novo a district court decision affirming the denial of social security benefits.england astrue,cir.we will affirm if the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.see g,c.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d internal quotation omitted.we consider both evidence that supports and evidence that detracts from the commissioner decision.england,at.if substantial evidence supports the decision,we may not reverse,even if inconsistent conclusions may be drawn from the evidence,and even if we would have decided the case differently.id.
davidson contends that the alj determination that davidson is not disabled is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.in particular,davidson contends that the alj committed two errors that require reversal,each of which we address in turn.
davidson first argues that the alj improperly disregarded the opinions of two of his treating physicians,hightower and hahn,when assessing his physical rfc.hightower,a gastroenterologist,treated davidson for hepatitis c from may to november,administering two rounds of injections of interferon,a common drug to reduce the hepatitis virus.hahn,a family physician,saw davidson periodically at a family practice clinic from june to december,monitoring his overall mental and physical condition,but generally deferring to hightower regarding the hepatitis treatment.
under the ssa regulations,an alj must give a treating physician medical opinion controlling weight if it is well supported by medically acceptable diagnostic testing and not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.d hacker barnhart,cir.if the opinion fails to meet these criteria,however,the alj need not accept it.hacker,at.w hile entitled to special weight,a treating physician opinion does not automatically control,particularly if the treating physician evidence is itself inconsistent.house astrue,cir internal quotation omitted.moreover,a treating physician opinion that a claimant is disabled or unable to work,does not carry any special significance,e,because it invades the province of the commissioner to make the ultimate determination of disability.house,at.
the opinions at issue are embodied in two letters addressed to whom it may concern,the first written by hightower on october,and the second written by hahn on december.hightower letter states 
davidson is a year old white male that i am following and treating for chronic hepatitis c.davidson has early cirrhosis on liver biopsy.he continues on interferon therapy to help halt progression of the fibrosis and scarring.he remains symptomatic with marked fatigue,joint aches and pains.we are continuing him on pegylated interferon therapy.at this time i do think he is able to sustain gainful employment.he continues to need very close,careful in the clinic.
hahn letter states,in pertinent part 
davidson is a year old male that we are currently seeing at the ahec area health education center clinic for chronic hepatitis c.he remains symptomatic with marked fatigue,joint aches and pains.we do not believe that he is currently able to sustain gainful employment as he continues to need close follow up appointments in this clinic as well as others.your concern in this matter is very much appreciated.
the alj did not give significant weight to either opinion.after noting the common language between the two letters,the alj determined that hightower opinion was inconsistent with his own treatment records,and that hahn appeared to rely on hightower assessment as opposed to his own objective findings.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the alj refusal to give these opinions controlling weight.
it is permissible for an alj to discount an opinion of a treating physician that is inconsistent with the physician clinical treatment notes.juszczyk astrue,cir house,at.hightower let
