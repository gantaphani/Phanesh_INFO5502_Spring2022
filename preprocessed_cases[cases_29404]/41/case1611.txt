the kneibert clinic,llc kneibert filed suit against richard smith and weatherby locums tenens,weatherby,alleging a claim of indemnification from smith and weatherby for a judgment incurred by kneibert in a separate lawsuit brought by a patient allegedly harmed by the negligence of kneibert and smith.a jury rendered a verdict in favor of smith and weatherby.kneibert appeals,asserting five reversible errors on the part of the district court we affirm.
background 
kneibert is a physicians group that provides multiple medical services,including radiology.in,kneibert contracted with weatherby to obtain an interim radiologist for its group.the contract obligated weatherby to present qualified physician candidates for kneibert approval pay all fees to the physician directly provide malpractice insurance with limits of one million to three million dollars for each physician placed with kneibert allow kneibert to retain any and all revenue that the physician generated and provide administrative assistance to obtain hospital privileges for the physician,if required.pursuant to the contract,smith was chosen as the new radiologist.
in july,marilyn and walter cravens filed a medical malpractice action in butler county,missouri,against kneibert and robert young,a partner in the kneibert clinic butler county action.the cravens alleged that kneibert,through its agent,young,was negligent in failing to diagnose cravens breast cancer,ascertain the significance of the lump found in her breast,and remove the lump.the petition did not mention weatherby.
the cravens filed an amended petition in august in that petition,they referenced smith but did not name him or weatherby as defendants.the amended petition alleged that smith,as kneibert agent,performed radiological services in august by reading mammogram and ultrasound films.
to assist in prosecuting their claim,the cravens retained howard ozer,an oncologist,as an expert witness.ozer criticized young treatment,testifying that young should have performed a biopsy despite receiving negative ultrasound and mammogram test results.he opined that a biopsy of a clinically suspicious palpable mass,like that detected by young in cravens,should not have been delayed on the basis of a normal mammogram and ultrasound.initially,ozer was not asked to offer any opinions concerning the radiologist standard of care.however,ozer expressed his view that smith ultrasound report should not have been relied upon to forego a biopsy.
kneibert tendered the defense of the claims related to smith medical service to weatherby insurance carrier,paul fire and marine insurance company paul declined to provide a defense for kneibert because kneibert had exposure to liability based on the acts of young and the radiology technician,who paul did not insure.paul did agree to defend any claims brought against weatherby or smith via a petition.
during the course of the litigation,kneibert lost its insurance coverage for the claim because its insurance carrier went into receivership.following the loss of coverage,kneibert counsel suggested a proposed settlement to the cravens counsel under of the missouri revised statutes.the december,letter addressed to the cravens counsel stated 
you have amended your petition in this matter to include a claim that the mammogram and mri w ere misinterpreted.at the time the mammographer,richard smith,was furnished by weatherby locums,under contract to the kneibert clinic.
under these circumstances we would like to suggest to our client,kneibert clinic,that it enter into an agreement with you whereby you would a dismiss your claim for respondeat superior liability against the clinic as relates to young and b enter into an agreement under section to limit your recovery against kneibert to the insurance provided to smith and weatherby locums by paul fire and marine.
the weatherby contract is attached you will note that they are required to provide malpractice insurance for smith,which they did through paul.we have requested that paul provide a defense and indemnification they have refused.
to my knowledge they have no policy defenses whatsoever and the apparent reason for refusal is the statement,it would be unclear as to what portion of the verdict was apportioned to the alleged acts of smith.
i propose to,by the above method,make that clear and give you free access to summary judgment against weatherby and richard smith such sum as you would care to prove up to the judge.you might look at my disaster in the southern district,a copy of which opinion is attached,to see how easy it is when somebody is not paying attention as is the case with paul subsidiary american continental insurance company.
based on the proposed settlement,kneibert agreed not to defend the claims against it due to the alleged negligence of smith and weatherby.kneibert further agreed not to contest any evidence that the cravens chose to submit to the court on the issue of damages.
on january,kneibert counsel wrote a letter to confirm kneibert oral agreement with the cravens counsel,stating 
this will confirm our oral agreement.
a dismiss the case as against robert young,
b we will enter into an agreement under in the form as delivered by me to you 
c we will at the first available opportunity put on evidence in front of judge richardson which will through the testimony of dr.yuri parisky establish that richard smith was solely at fault in that he i misinterpreted the mammogram ii misinterpreted the ultrasound iii improperly either conducted the ultrasound or failed to cause the ultrasound to be repeated iv that such failure was the direct and proximate cause of young failure to follow up in that young called smith,assuming that to be true young deposition.young having been orally assured that the finding was indeed birad and therefore benign was justified in not further following up with a biopsy.
we will further establish through parisky and ozer that given the cystic and heterogeneously dense nature of cravens breast,it would not have been negligent for either young or cravens not to detect from their respective perspectives any change in condition,she would have thought that her condition was the same and not called him and he would have thought that her condition was the same not having been called.
that no matter what occurred when she had the hysterectomy,diagnosis at that time would not have matter ed,that the only diagnosis that mattered was the missed opportunity of august.that the august,missed opportunity is the responsibility of richard smith.
the next thing that needs to be established is a reasonable agency or apparent agency.we would offer the deposition of bob christian and the locums agreement and cravens will need to testify that she allowed the mammography to be done at kneibert clinic,relying on the fact that a kneibert clinic employee or partner would be the one to interpret it we need to have both scott elements and some element of apparent authority to be really safe.
we then offer those portions of the deposition of howard ozer that establish the lost chance john the cravens attorney it will be important to leave out of evidence the deposition portions that relate to his criticisms of young,we do want to get caught up in an allocation battle with paul,i mean we do want them coming back and saying that i t was all young fault,so we need to leave out ozer criticism of young.
next we will give you a supplemental agreement supported by resolution of kneibert clinic,llc.
this agreement will provide that kneibert clinic llc will pay,at your option,in the event that there is no recovery possible against richard smith,paul,or weatherby locum s,or the lawsuit as it exists on this date prior to the dismissal can be reinstated at the status quo and which will also provide that the kneibert clinic will pay me to do the legal work in the direct action against smith and paul on indemnity.we do have to decide whether we are going to sue smith and weatherby or paul or need to discuss this.paul would probably get ted osburn,and jeff probably can figure out what the defenses are,whereas if we do do that and we stick with suing smith and weatherby we will get spain,who has already advised paul and at least in part put them in the position they find themselves.
i trust this fully sets forth our agreement and understanding.please concur.
on february,the cravens and kneibert entered into a settlement agreement.in the agreement,the cravens agreed to dismiss all portions of their claim against kneibert except those directly related to the negligence of richard smith.in return,kneibert agreed to waive a jury and the cravens may present such evidence as is necessary to make their case against kneibert through the negligent acts of richard smith the parties determined that the cravens would collect any judgment only against smith,weatherby,or paul and would release kneibert of all liability.
kneibert represented in the agreement that it had made a demand upon weatherby to undertake kneibert defense for smith negligent acts and that it had directly tendered the defense of the action against it as it pertains to the negligent actions of richard smith directly to the paul and paul attorney and that paul has declined and refused to undertake the defense kneibert acknowledged the likelihood that if this case were tried to the jury the cravens would prevail and a verdict would be entered against kneibert as a result of the negligent acts of richard smith.
also on february,the cravens and kneibert supplemented their settlement and agreed that following the trial court entry of judgment against kneibert,the cravens and kneibert will cooperate and file a suit against weatherby locums tenens,richard smith and the paul insurance company or subsidiary as provides professional liability coverage through weatherby locums tenens 
on february,the cravens and kneibert appeared before the butler county circuit court for a bench trial.at that time,the cravens dismissed young from the case and proceeded to trial on their claims against kneibert based on smith conduct.as they agreed,kneibert offered no expert testimony to defend smith or weatherby.the trial court entered judgment in favor of the cravens and against kneibert in the aggregate amount of for the negligence of agent at the time of the negligence butler county judgment.to date,kneibert has paid no money to the cravens.
on april,the cravens and kneibert filed the instant action for indemnification in the circuit court of cape girardeau county,missouri,against weatherby,smith,and paul.weatherby removed the action to federal district court with paul and smith consent.following removal,the district court dismissed all claims against paul for failure to state a claim.the court also eliminated the cravens as parties because their sole claim for relief was against paul.as a result,only kneibert indemnification claim remained before the court.
smith and weatherby moved for summary judgment,raising the affirmative defense that kneibert settlement agreement with the cravens increased their risk or prejudiced their rights to such an extent that kneibert entitlement to indemnity for the cravens judgment had been discharged.the district court denied the motion,finding that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether kneibert settlement conduct with the cravens increased the risk to,or prejudiced the rights of,smith and weatherby.
kneibert later moved for summary judgment,arguing that no genuine issues of material fact existed and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claims that smith and weatherby owed a duty to indemnify it on the underlying judgment.the district court denied the motion,concluding that kneibert presented nothing to the court to dissuade it from the previous finding that genuine issues of material fact exist as to the extent of the duty owed by the defendants to indemnify plaintiff on the butler county judgment.in its order,the district court rejected the argument that the butler county judgment collaterally estopped smith and weatherby from relitigating the underlying claims relating to smith negligence,finding that kneibert could not offensively use collateral estoppel to prevent relitigation of the negligence issue because neither smith nor weatherby were parties in the butler county action and thus did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of negligence in the prior action.
after a pretrial conference,the court bifurcated the trial.the initial issue to be tried was smith and weatherby affirmative defense whether kneibert conduct in securing the settlement agreement and in obtaining judgment against itself materially increased the risk to,or prejudiced the rights of,defendants smith and weatherby as indemnitors such that defendants were relieved of any duty to indemnify kneibert.according to the court,a verdict in favor of smith and weatherby would end the case.but if the jury found that kneibert conduct was not sufficiently prejudicial,the trial would then proceed to the second phase that is,to determine the underlying medical malpractice action against smith and weatherby.the court explained that a trial on the merits of the underlying action was necessary because missouri law prohibited plaintiff from offensively using the butler county judgment to collaterally estop the relitigation of the underlying negligence action.
at the conclusion of the first phase of the bifurcated trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of smith and weatherby,specifically finding that kneibert conduct in entering into the settlement agreement with the cravens materially increased the risk to,and prejudiced the rights of,smith and weatherby as indemnitors.thereafter,the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict in favor of smith and weatherby and dismissed kneibert complaint with prejudice.
kneibert filed a motion for new trial,which the district court denied.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,kneibert argues that the district court erroneously denied its motion for summary judgment based on the court improper conclusion that kneibert owed a duty not to materially increase the risk to,or prejudice the rights of,smith and weatherby in settling the butler county action improperly instructed the jury that kneibert owed a duty not to materially increase the risk to,or prejudice the rights of,smith and weatherby in settling the butler county action erroneously denied kneibert motion for summary judgment because smith and weatherby are bound by the butler county judgment,as they were given notice of and an opportunity to control the underlying litigation regarding smith negligence erroneously declined to take judicial notice of its prior order denying kneibert motion for summary judgment that smith and weatherby were not bound by the butler county judgment and in not permitting kneibert to argue this fact to the jury and erred in striking two venirepersons for cause.

accordingly,we decline to review kneibert first and third arguments on appeal that the district court erroneously denied its motion for summary judgment.instead,we limit our review to issues two,four,and five listed that kneibert raised in its motion for new trial.

jury instruction 
first,kneibert argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that kneibert owed a duty to smith and weatherby not to materially increase the risk to,or prejudice the rights of,smith and weatherby,the indemnitors,in settling the butler county action.additionally,kneibert asserts that the district court also erred in refusing to give rejected jury instruction,which read 
once a demand is made on the indemnitor to defend the litigation against the indemnitee and the demand is refused,the indemnitee may settle the claim in good faith and proceed against the indemnitor.the indemnitee must show that its settlement was reasonable and made in good faith.

kneibert contends that it suffered prejudice because the district court failed to properly instruct the jury.kneibert believed that it was free to settle the butler county action in its own best interests without regard to smith and weatherby because of their refusal to defend kneibert for smith alleged negligence.kneibert,however,conflates the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify.the two duties are not coextensive.the former is broader than the latter but nonetheless must arise from a contractual obligation discernible in the parties agreement.
kneibert has failed to identify any contractual language between itself and smith or weatherby specifying that either smith or weatherby have a duty to defend kneibert in a lawsuit arising out of smith alleged negligence see crown,at.therefore,rejected jury instruction would have been erroneous,as it assumed that smith and weatherby did have a contractual obligation to defend kneibert.
furthermore,smith and weatherby did have a duty to indemnify kneibert,missouri courts have recognized and applied a general rule of law that any act s on the part of any indemnitee which materially increases the risk,or prejudices the rights,of the indemnitor,will discharge the indemnitor under the contract of indemnity.holiday inns,inv,quoting hiern indemnity,cir.
accordingly,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury,in accordance with holiday inns,that kneibert owed a duty not to materially increase the risk to,or prejudice the rights of,smith and weatherby.
judicial notice 
second,kneibert asserts that the district court erred in refusing to take judicial notice of its prior ruling that smith and weatherby were not bound by the butler county judgment and in not permitting kneibert to argue this fact to the jury.according to kneibert,it could not have increased any risk to smith and weatherby or prejudiced their rights if they were not bound by the butler county judgment.

here,the district court informed the parties during the pretrial conference that,if the first phase of the trial resulted in a favorable verdict for kneibert,the case would proceed to the second phase of the trial on the merits of the underlying medical malpractice action.on the first day of trial,kneibert asked the district court to take judicial notice of its prior determination that smith and weatherby were not bound by the butler county judgment.kneibert also requested that the court permit it to present this evidence to the jury that there is going to be a trial to determine whether they are bound by the judgment.the district court denied kneibert request,stating 
no,we not going to get into that about what going to happen,because i think we might as well have tried those cases together then,okay.that was the reason that i chose to do it this way.and i did believe me,i gave a lot of thought to this.
in its motion for a new trial,kneibert argued that any increased risk or prejudice to smith and weatherby caused by kneibert would be affected by their not being bound by the underlying butler county judgment.kneibert asserted that any purported risk or prejudice to smith and weatherby effectively evaporated with the district court pretrial ruling that kneibert could not offensively use collateral estoppel in the circumstances of the case.in response to that argument,the district court amply explained that it prohibited the introduction of such evidence b ecause of the increased danger of jury confusion and speculation had such evidence been introduced at the first phase of the trial 
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to take judicial notice.in addition to potential jury confusion,the district court ruling is supported by two other considerations.first,any decision not to admit evidence of whether smith and weatherby were bound by the judgment was harmless,as the record contains other evidence of prejudice.for instance,the record reflects that kneibert,through its agents,was contributorily negligent,meaning that kneibert would be jointly liable for the al
