on february,beverly stevenson had an extreme emotional and physical response to a stray dog entering her workspace at hyre electric company.she left work soon after and for the most part stayed home for the next several days.the few times she tried to return to work,she felt unable to function and demonstrated erratic and emotional behavior.her coworkers were so concerned that they eventually locked her out of the building.then on march,stevenson was informed by letter that she had been terminated effective february.
stevenson claims that hyre had notice that she was suffering from a serious health condition and thus violated her rights under the family and medical leave act fmla,et,when it fired her.despite the unprecedented nature of stevenson troublesome behavior following the dog incident,hyre claims it was unaware that she might be suffering from a serious mental health condition.the district court agreed with hyre and granted its motion for summary judgment.we see some genuine issues of material fact lurking in this case,and we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,and we construe all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.vallone cna fin,cir.our account of the facts reflects that perspective.
prior to february,stevenson had no documented history of misconduct or health problems at hyre.all that changed at approximately am on february,when a stray dog climbed through the window of the hyre warehouse where stevenson worked and approached her.she immediately felt physical symptoms,including a headache,a rush of blood to her head,and a tightening of her neck and back.stevenson supervisor mary cicchetti recounted that immediately after the dog incident,she entered the office area where stevenson worked and found stevenson very agitated and spraying glade,a room deodorizer.upon seeing cicchetti,stevenson began yelling and cursing,screaming that f king animals should be in the workplace.cicchetti said that stevenson was very intimidating and belligerent,and that her agitated behavior lasted three or four minutes.
two hours after the dog incident,stevenson informed hay lee yuen,the accounting manager,that she was ill and needed to go home.she left and went home immediately she did not go to a doctor office or hospital that day.the next morning,stevenson left a voicemail for cicchetti and said that she was feeling well and would be in today.at that point she went to the hospital for an unrelated medical test.
hyre president,charles guest,testified in his deposition that he knew the individual employees who work at hyre and that prior to february,stevenson behavior had been satisfactory and that he could not recall any verbal or written warnings.on february,stevenson went to her workplace at approximately am to speak with guest.it was an explosive encounter.guest testified that stevenson charged into my office yelling and in a very aggressive manner.he continued,she said it was wrong for her to be subjected to this kind of thing in the office,to have f king dogs running by her desk and threatening her,and that management needs to do something about this.he tried unsuccessfully to calm her down,but she continued to scream at him.he also assured her that every effort would be made to prevent anything similar from happening in the future.the conversation lasted eight to ten minutes.guest testified that after the incident,other employees came up to him and made statements such as what was that all about and boy,that was something.
the accounting manager,yuen,overheard part of the february meeting between stevenson and guest.she reported that she could not make out the entire conversation but stevenson voice was loud and sounded like screaming at the president.she acknowledged that stevenson sounded very upset.after the meeting with guest,stevenson told cicchetti that she could not work and left the premises.
later that day,stevenson filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration regarding stray animals at hyre workplace.stevenson also went to the emergency room.she was examined by a doctor after complaining of three days of headaches,insomnia,anxiety,and loss of appetite following an emotionally stressful incident at work.an ekg test and cat scan both came back normal.stevenson was discharged with a diagnosis of anxiety and stress and was prescribed ativan.
the next day,february,stevenson left a message for cicchetti stating that she was ill and would not be coming to work.later that day she met with a union representative,richard sipple,to discuss the dog incident.during the meeting,stevenson mentioned that she was off sick but did not elaborate.on friday,february,and monday,february,stevenson again called in sick but gave no additional details about her condition.
on february,stevenson went to work at am.cicchetti had boxed up the contents of stevenson desk and moved them to another room.cicchetti claimed that she did so to accommodate stevenson fear of stray animals.stevenson stayed at work for a few hours,but she was still agitated,completed little or no work,and ultimately called the police because she believed that she was somehow being harassed.at approximately am,she told cicchetti that she was not feeling well and left work.before leaving,stevenson left the hospital report of her february emergency room visit on yuen desk.after stevenson left,guest gave cicchetti permission to change the locks on the doors of hyre office.guest then sent a letter by overnight mail to stevenson that stated in part 
you no longer have any accrued vacation or sick leave available.therefore,any additional leave must be governed by hyre family and medical leave policy.under the provisions of hyre employment manual,you are required to obtain a medical certification from your physician or other health care provider for a serious health condition fmla leave.if you do not do so within fifteen days from the commencement of your leave or by tuesday,february,your absences will be deemed unexcused and you will be terminated from hyre employ.
on february,stevenson again called in sick.she went to a doctor appointment that she had scheduled on february or.there she met with mary jo liszek,her primary care physician,and told liszek about her medical concerns.liszek prescribed a sleep aid for stevenson and scheduled a visit for february.stevenson claims that liszek told her to stay home for the next two days.
on february,stevenson again met with union representatives and recounted her story once more.she also gave the representatives the documentation from her er visit.then stevenson went to her appointment with liszek.she was seen first by mahan,an associate of liszek,to whom she reported that her anxiety,sleeping difficulties,and headaches had improved.she told mahan that she wanted to return to work,but that she needed a doctor note to do so.liszek then saw stevenson briefly and wrote a note excusing her absence from february through february.the parties agree that this note does not establish that stevenson had been instructed by liszek not to work for those days.
on monday,february,stevenson did not return to work.she claims that her union representatives told her that the union did not want her to return.sipple recalled telling stevenson that she could not return to work until she had a doctor release.that day,sipple and another union representative met with guest and hyre employee jim palm to discuss stevenson situation.also that day,stevenson faxed to the union a copy of the note from liszek the union passed the note along to hyre.
the next morning,stevenson called cicchetti and said that,in keeping with the union instructions,she was not coming to work that day.later,she changed her mind and arrived at hyre at approximately am.she discovered that the locks had been changed,and so she knocked on the door until guest answered it.guest refused to accept her note from liszek instead,guest gave her a box containing her personal belongings because she was coming back into the office.later,the union called guest,and he told them that the note from liszek was not sufficient.this information was relayed to stevenson,and the union advised her to get another doctor note.stevenson returned to liszek and asked for a note certifying that she could return to work she did not,however,mention the fmla specifically.liszek obliged with a second note purporting to excuse her through february.stevenson faxed this note to the union that evening with a cover letter explaining that liszek was willing to answer questions and complete additional forms if needed.the union then asked guest in writing to k indly put forth in writing your reasons why this first release was not enough and let us know what is needed to return beverly to work.guest never responded.
on february,the union faxed the second doctor note to hyre.it is unclear whether the cover letter from stevenson was faxed as well.from that point until march,stevenson heard nothing from hyre and did not contact anyone at hyre herself.on march,hyre sent a letter to stevenson stating that she had been terminated effective february.
we begin our inquiry with the question whether stevenson gave hyre notice of her need for fmla leave.if she did not,then hyre had no duty to give her this leave.aubuchon knauf fiberglass,gmbh,cir.typically,an employee must inform her employer days in advance that she will need fmla leave.when the need for fmla leave is not known in advance,however,an employee should give notice to the employer of the need for fmla leave as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.a.in such a case,i t is expected that an employee will give notice to the employer within no more than one or two working days of learning of the need for leave,except in extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not feasible.id.
aubuchon explained that the fmla places the burden of giving notice on the employee as the quid pro quo for the employer partial surrender of control over his work force.at.on the other hand,the notice requirement is not demanding 
the employee duty is merely to place the employer on notice of a probable basis for fmla leave.he does have to write a brief demonstrating a legal entitlement.he just has to give the employer enough information to establish probable cause,as it were,to believe that he is entitled to fmla leave.
id.at.once that is done,then it becomes the employer duty to request such additional information from the employee doctor or some other reputable source as may be necessary to confirm the employee entitlement.id.
although the notice requirement is not overly formalized,the notice must succeed in alerting the employer to the seriousness of the health condition.so,for example,in aubuchon it was not enough for an employee to inform his employer that he needed leave because his wife was pregnant.id.had the employee added that his wife was having complications,that would have sufficed.id.likewise,a reference to being sick is insufficient because not only did it withh o ld important information from the employer but likely threw it off the scent because c ertainly it did not suggest to the employer that the medical condition might be serious.collins,cir.this is because fmla leave is available only for a serious health condition affecting an employee or one of her family members.
in this case,taking the facts in the light most favorable to stevenson,it is possible that she herself was unaware that she was suffering from a serious medical condition until she went to the emergency room on february.even though she left work feeling ill on february and called in sick on february,she might have thought that the illness would soon lift.once she went to the emergency room,however,she was given a diagnosis of anxiety along with a prescription for medication,ativan.at this point,her obligations under were triggered.yet stevenson did not give hyre any explicit notice of her need for leave within one or two working days of february which was a wednesday.instead,she again called in sick on february,february,and monday february.each time,she said only that she was ill and would be in today.it was not until february that she left a copy of her er discharge with someone at hyre assuming for now that this might have been adequate notice.
we can find no meaningful difference between the facts of this case and those of aubuchon,discussed above.just as the plaintiff in aubuchon had an obligation to tell his employer that his wife was having pregnancy complications in order to make his employer aware that he needed fmla leave,stevenson had an obligation to tell hyre something more than that she was out sick for a that might have been explained by a mundane upset stomach.see burnett lfw,cir holding that calling in sick while providing no additional information is insufficient for the fmla.
stevenson contends that hyre letter to stevenson on february constitutes an admission that it was aware of an alleged illness and was therefore taking the next logical step of requesting some kind of certification,but we do not see it this way.first,the letter came after the time period in which stevenson should have given hyre notice of her need for fmla leave.a.second,if notice could be presumed whenever an employer asks an employee if she needs fmla leave,then the fmla notice requirement would be rendered meaningless.stevenson does not make the argument that hyre insistence that she provide certification demonstrates that hyre recognized her need for fmla leave,and so we do not consider that interpretation of hyre actions.at best,hyre letter gave stevenson more time to give notice than the statute does,but it still required that documentation be provided within days of the onset of her leave.therefore,although stevenson did tell hyre that she was missing work because of illness,she did not,within the period required by a,verbally or in writing make hyre aware that her illness might trigger its fmla responsibilities.
direct notice from the employee to the employer is not,however,always necessary.stevenson case may go forward if hyre had constructive notice of her need for fmla leave.in byrne avon products,cir,this court held that either an employee inability to communicate his illness to his employer or clear abnormalities in the employee behavior may constitute constructive notice of a serious health condition.id.at.it is enough under the fmla if the employer knows of the employee need for leave the employee need not mention the statute or demand its benefits.id.at.
in byrne,we found such notice when an employee with four years of highly regarded service started to sleep on the job for time periods approaching half of his shift.the employer also learned from a family member that the employee was very sick.when a company representative finally contacted him directly,the employee could only mumble several odd phrases.the day after speaking to the employee sister,the company learned that he had been hospitalized.under these circumstances,the court in byrne concluded that unusual behavior alone can be enough to notify a reasonable employer that an employee suffered from a serious health condition.id.at.
in stevenson case,the district court appears to have merged the two allowable means of constructive notice inability to communicate and clear abnormalities.it must have thought that stevenson had to satisfy both,since it concluded that the byrne exception could not apply because stevenson maintained an ability to relate her symptoms and feelings at length.byrne,however,held that a sudden change may supply notice even if the employee is lucid,giving the example of an employer seeing an employee break her arm and concluding that this observation would give the employer sufficient notice of a need for fmla leave without the employee saying a word.at.the district court therefore erred as a matter of law by not considering stevenson claims of unusual behavior as constructive notice regardless of her ability to communicate.
if the record shows that there are disputed issues of material fact,once we apply the correct legal standard,the summary judgment for hyre must be reversed.in stevenson case,only one of the two
