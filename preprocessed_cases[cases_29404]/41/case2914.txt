background 
this case concerns pharmaceutical formulations and dosing regimens for combined oral contraceptive coc products.first introduced in,cocs,better known as birth control pills,deliver synthetic hormones that regulate the natural ovarian cycle and prevent pregnancy.specifically,cocs comprise a progestin and an estrogen that together inhibit folliculogenesis a stepwise,process in which an ovarian follicle containing an immature oocyte,an egg cell grows and develops for approximately the first two weeks of an ovarian cycle,culminating in the release of a fertile oocyte at ovulation.the synthetic progestin and estrogen provided in a coc suppress production of the natural hormones that drive folliculogenesis,thus inhibiting ovulation and reducing the incidence of pregnancy in coc users.the contraceptive effects depend on the continued presence of the inhibitory synthetic hormones folliculogenesis will commence if the synthetic progestin and estrogen are withdrawn but can be abrogated if the hormones are reintroduced before ovulation occurs.
to maintain synthetic hormone concentrations sufficient for sustained follicular suppression,cocs are typically taken once daily,and since their introduction,most cocs have been provided in day,pill packs that align with the approximate length of a natural ovarian cycle.early cocs relied on a dosing regimen in which each monthly pill pack would include active pills containing synthetic progestin and estrogen followed by seven placebo pills containing no hormones.the placebo period,also known as the interval,was originally included because it i triggered a withdrawal bleed that mimicked natural menstrual bleeding and was presumed to improve acceptance among coc users,and ii provided a regular break from synthetic hormone exposure that was thought to mitigate potential side effects.the regimen persists in most cocs on the market today.
in addition to maintaining a interval,another strategy to reduce side effects has been to reduce the hormone dose provided in each pill.for example,the first cocs provided relatively high daily doses of synthetic estrogen,up to approximately μg per active pill.deleterious side effects of coc use,including thromboembolism,nausea,and bloating,have been most strongly associated with synthetic estrogen exposure,so the estrogen dose in particular has been progressively reduced over time.the first coc containing the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol ee at only μg per pill was approved for sale in the united states in.
in the early,bayer began developing a coc containing μg ee and the synthetic progestin drospirenone drsp to be administered with a reduced interval.lowering ee dosage to μg per pill limits undesirable side effects,but it also results in weaker ovarian suppression compared to cocs.as such,some ovarian activity and follicular maturation can persist in users of cocs,and any intake errors,missed pills,especially those that effectively lengthen the unregulated interval,could result in escape ovulation and unintended pregnancy.patent.to address the risk of escape ovulation for users of cocs,bayer implemented and dosing regimens,reducing the interval to five or four days,respectively,and increasing the number of active pills per cycle accordingly.bayer demonstrated that shortening the interval to four or five days improved the contraceptive efficacy of coc formulations.accordingly,bayer filed its first patent application directed to such,cocs on december,and that application eventually led to the patent the patent includes claims reciting various coc preparations claims and read as follows 
a combination product for oral contraception,comprising 
a or daily dosage units,each containing mg of ethinylestradiol,and to mg of drospirenone,and 
b or,respectively,active placebo pills or other indications to show that the daily administration of the or dosage units,respectively,is to be followed by or,respectively,or placebo pill days,
wherein each of the dosage units containing drospirenone contains the same amount of drospirenone.
a combination preparation of claim,which comprises dosage units and placebo pills or other indications to show that no dosage unit or placebo pill is administered during the last days of the menstrual cycle.

the sole issue before us is whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of bayer and holding that asserted claims and of the patent are not invalid for obviousness in light of the presented prior art.
the defendants rely on six prior art references australian patent application,published november,au european patent application publication,published april,ep molloy et,missed pill conception fact or fiction,brit.med.molloy john guillebaud,the forgotten pill and the paramount importance of the week,brit.fam.plan.guillebaud b landgren diczfalusy,hormonal consequences of missing the pill during the first two days of three consecutive artificial cycles,contraception landgren and goldstuck et,use and misuse of oral contraceptives by adolescents attending a clinic,advances in contraception goldstuck.according to the defendants,the combination of au with any of ep,molloy,guillebaud,landgren,or goldstuck would have rendered the asserted claims of the patent obvious at the time of invention.in particular,the defendants argue that au discloses a coc combining μg ee and mg drsp per active pill dosage ranges that encompass those recited in claims and of the patent.the defendants further contend that ep,molloy,guillebaud,landgren,and goldstuck each disclose dosing regimens and that those references provided motivation to combine such regimens with the cocs disclosed in au by identifying the problem of conceptions and suggesting a shortened interval as a solution.finally,the defendants contend that the district court erred by misapplying and misinterpreting the cited references and by crediting legally insufficient evidence as secondary indicia of nonobviousness.
in response,bayer argues that au and ep were directed to narrow subpopulations of patients primarily in need of therapy,so those references would not have been combined by a person of ordinary skill seeking to develop a coc in.furthermore,according to bayer,the prior art as a whole taught away from the claimed coc preparations at that time in view of the entrenched use of traditional dosing and the perceived risks from increasing total synthetic hormone administration by shortening the pillfree interval.finally,bayer defends the district court reliance on its evidence of unexpected results,expert skepticism,industry praise,and copying as secondary indicia of nonobviousness.
we agree with the defendants that the district court erred in holding the claims not invalid.a claim is invalid for obviousness if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.a.in this case,the cited prior art references set forth every limitation required by the asserted claims and provide express motivation to combine those teachings to derive the claimed coc products.accordingly,the asserted claims are invalid under.
there is no dispute that claims and of the patent require a coc product defined by the following limitations μg ee per active pill,mg drsp per active pill,and a or dosing regimen.patent.nor is it disputed that the cited prior art references disclose each of those limitations.for example,ep discloses a combination dosage form that can provide hormonal replacement therapy and contraceptive protection,using a preferred administration cycle of days of the combination dosage form and days of no dosage form.ep ll.see also id.ll.describing and dosage regimens as preferred.in addition,the disclosed active dosage form includes an estrogen and a progestin ep lists ee μg per dose among three estrogen choices and describes several suitable progestins,but drsp is not disclosed.id.au,however,discloses drsp as an additional progestin suitable for use alone or in combination with estrogens in contraceptive preparations.au at.furthermore,au indicates that ee is a preferred estrogen complement to drsp for coc use and suggests using daily doses of μg ee with mg drsp.id.at.au even refers expressly to ep,stating that the disclosed preparations can be used analogously to the ep combinations and expressly incorporating the disclosure of ep by reference.id.at.in sum,ep and au disclose all three limitations required by the asserted claims.au discloses coc preparations that encompass the claimed doses of ee and drsp,and ep discloses similar cocs,also comprising the claimed dose of ee,administered via the claimed and regimens.
with every limitation of the asserted claims thus disclosed in the cited references,the question,as the district court recognized,becomes whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine those teachings to derive the claimed subject matter with a reasonable expectation of success.see,unigene,apotex,obviousness requires more than a mere showing that the prior art includes separate references covering each separate limitation in a claim under examination.rather,obviousness requires the additional showing that a person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention would have selected and combined those prior art elements citing ksr,at,see also watson summary judgment order,wl,at what was not known based on the prior art was the desirability of using the claimed drospirenone and ee doses together with the claimed monthly regimen.
the prior art before us provides that motivation.in addition to au express reference to ep,several of the cited references highlight evidence that the unregulated ovarian activity that occurs during a pillfree interval can achieve significant follicular development,and those references also express concern that inadvertently extending the traditional interval via one or more missed pills could lead to escape ovulation and unintended pregnancy.see,molloy at the demonstration of ovarian folliculogenesis on the seventh pill free day,means that during the early days of the subsequent pill cycle,some women harbour significantly developed follicles,ready to ovulate if oestrogen suppression were to fail because of a missed pill.guillebaud at stating that it is precisely because of this seven day break that most pregnancies occur,and that the pill omissions of greatest concern are those that lead to a lengthening of the interval quotation omitted landgren at these data seem to suggest that ovulation is more likely to occur when the pill is omitted during the first days of the artificial cycle.hence,the prolongation of the week by two or more days is likely to increase the risk of escape ovulation.in addition,bayer expert acknowledged that one of skill in the art at the time of the invention would have expected an even greater risk of such missed pill ovulation for users of cocs,those containing μg ee per active pill.
the evidence thus demonstrates that ovulation was a recognized concern with traditional cocs,particularly for those on the market by that like the claimed coc preparations relied on ee.as the supreme court has stated,any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed.ksr,at.furthermore,the references in this case go beyond just illuminating a known problem they also expressly propose the claimed solution to reduce the risk of missed pill conception a day pack containing pills and blanks could be substituted for the current day pack.this would still permit a withdrawal bleed without the risk of significant follicular development.molloy at see also goldstuck at the suggestion for dosing is of considerable merit.this would both maintain a day regimen and help reduce the interval in those women who inadvertently miss a pill.guillebaud at i t is preferable to shorten the interval,usually to four days,in women where there is a suspicion of an increased risk of breakthrough ovulation.accordingly,the prior art direct recommendations to use and dosing regimens to minimize the risks of escape ovulation would have motivated one of ordinary skill in the art to implement such a shortened interval for use with known cocs,as recited in the asserted claims.
bayer arguments do not support a contrary conclusion.bayer contends that ep and au are primarily directed to older women who have reached premenopause and are in need of hormone replacement therapy,and that therefore a skilled person setting out to design an oral contraceptive using ee and drsp would not have used the regimen intended to achieve effective therapy.appellees br.but those references plainly disclose preparations with hormone replacement and contraceptive applications,and the product claims at issue do not distinguish between target patient populations,whether by age or otherwise.
