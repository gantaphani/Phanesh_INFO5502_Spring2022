floyd lytes sued his former employer,the district of columbia water and sewer authority,wasa,alleging it refused to accommodate his disability and then terminated his employment,in violation of the americans with disabilities act of ada.the district court granted summary judgment to the authority because it concluded no reasonable jury could find lytes was disabled when the alleged discrimination occurred.while lytes appeal was pending,the ada amendments act of became law.we hold the amendments do not apply retroactively and,applying the ada,affirm the judgment of the district court because,based upon record evidence,no reasonable jury could find lytes was disabled when he was refused accommodation and discharged.
background 
the ada protected a qualified individual with a disability from discrimination in the terms,conditions,and privileges of employment,a,including an employer refusal to mak e reasonable accommodations for an individual disability,id.b a.as relevant here,an individual was disabled if he had a physical or mental impairment that substantially limit ed him in one or more major life activities mlas,was actually disabled,or if he was regarded as having such an impairment.id.a c.
in may,lytes,a plant operator,injured his back while at work.he was diagnosed with chronic degenerative disc disease and underwent corrective surgery.lytes stopped working around december,at which time he began receiving workers compensation.two months later he had a heart attack and underwent angioplasty,followed in june by spinal fusion surgery designed to relieve pain in his back and legs.
a physician who twice examined lytes at the request of the authority workers compensation insurance carrier disagreed with lytes orthopedic surgeon,james tozzi,regarding lytes physical capabilities.accordingly,the wasa asked tozzi to authorize a functional capacity evaluation fce.the fce was done in february and indicated lytes had mild restricted standing and walking tolerances and limitations in squatting,bending,ladder climbing,and overhead reaching.these functional deficits placed lytes at the physical demand level with a workplace tolerance of hours.
tozzi noted progressive improvement in lytes condition after the fce.in september he upgraded lytes to light duty with limitations imposed primarily to avoid recurrent injury to lytes spine.the next day lytes met with the authority risk manager,who told him light duty was unavailable and encouraged him to continue to collect workers compensation,which he did.
in a december letter the wasa informed lytes he was medically disqualified from returning as a plant operator and had days to find a suitable position at the authority.when lytes was unable to do so,the wasa terminated his employment in a march letter.lytes filed a charge of disability discrimination,which the equal employment opportunity commission dismissed.thereafter lytes,who was then represented by counsel,sued the authority,claiming violations of the ada,several other statutes,and the wasa collective bargaining agreement,and requested retrospective relief,including compensatory damages and back pay.
only lytes ada claim is at issue in this appeal.in the district court the authority moved for summary judgment on that claim,arguing no reasonable jury could find lytes was disabled when he was refused accommodation and discharged.lytes focused his response upon the argument that the authority risk manager perceived him to be disabled,but also alleged,without pointing to any evidence in the record,he was actually disabled because of restrictions on bending,carry ing heavy weights,reaching and twisting,and mowing the lawn for long periods.the district court rejected lytes perceived disability theory and held the work restriction and limitations on household chores could not support a finding that lytes was actually disabled.see d.
lytes appealed pro se.this court appointed steven goldblatt,director of the appellate litigation program at georgetown university law center,as amicus curiae to support his position,and lytes filed a letter stating he would rely upon the submissions of the amicus.
on september,the congress enacted the ada amendments act of adaa in order to reinstat e a broad scope of protection under the ada and to reject the holdings in toyota motor,williams,d,and sutton united air lines,d.adaa b,stat.the congress delayed the effective date of the adaa to january.id,stat.at.
ii.analysis 
citing the adaa,the amicus challenges only the district court holding lytes was not actually disabled.we review the judgment of the district court de novo,see taylor small,but consider first whether,as the amicus maintains,the adaa applies retroactively.
retroactivity 
in landgraf usi film products,d,the supreme court reaffirmed the judicial presumption against applying a statute that would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to completed transactions.landgraf and its sequelae prescribe a process for determining whether a statute applies to past conduct.we first look for an express command regarding the temporal reach of the statute,or,in the absence of language as helpful as that,determine whether a comparably firm conclusion can be reached upon the basis of the normal rules of statutory construction.gonzales,d quoting lindh murphy,d.if we can not reach a firm conclusion,then we turn to judicial default rules,asking whether applying the statute would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights,liabilities,or duties on the basis of conduct arising before its enactment.id.quoting landgraf,at.if applying the statute would have such a disfavored effect,then we do not apply it absent clear evidence in the legislative history that the congress intended retroactive application.see landgraf,at.summers dep t of justice,koch sec,cir.
the amicus does not argue the congress clearly answered the retroactivity question.instead,he contends the congress left to the courts the task of distinguishing between provisions of the adaa that alter settled law,and therefore are subject to the presumption against retroactivity,and those that merely clarify the law and therefore guide our interpretation of the ada.see cookeville reg l med.ctr.leavitt,see also red lion broad.fcc,d.chief among the clarifying provisions,he argues,is of the adaa,which newly designates lifting,bending,and working as mlas and directs us to construe the ada in favor of broad coverage of individuals.stat.at major life activities include,but are not limited to,lifting,bending,and working.
the authority argues the congress,by delaying the effective date of the statute,mandated purely prospective application of the adaa.see id,stat.at this act and the amendments made by this act shall become effective on january.in the alternative the authority argues the presumption against retroactivity applies because the adaa changed settled law by repudiating what the supreme court described in toyota as the demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.at.see adaa b,stat.at stating one purpose of adaa is to overrule toyota id.a,stat.at directing courts to interpret the phrase substantially limits consistently with the findings and purposes of the adaa.
we agree with the authority principal point by delaying the effective date of the adaa,the congress clearly indicated the statute would apply only from january,forward.if the congress intended merely to clarify the ada,then its decision to delay the effective date would make no sense it would needlessly have left the ada unclear for the more than three months between enactment of the adaa on september,and its going into effect on january.nothing on the face of the statute indicates the congress intended this peculiar scenario.if,in contrast,the congress intended the amendments to have a purely prospective effect,then its decision to delay the effective date of the adaa makes sense.indeed,we can imagine no reason for the congress to have delayed the effective date other than to give fair warning of the amendments to affected parties and to protect
