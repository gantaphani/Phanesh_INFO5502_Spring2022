background 
more than ten years ago,the prudential insurance company of america and other health insurers obtained a judgment in the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas declaring that the arkansas patient protection act of the arkansas ppa was partially preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa prudential ins.of am.park med.in the same action,prudential and its obtained an injunction barring the enforcement of the arkansas ppa against the types of employee benefit plans described in a.id.on appeal,we held that the offending provisions of the arkansas ppa were not severable and that the statute was,therefore,preempted in its entirety.prudential ins.of am.park med,prudential i,cir.the district court entered an amended order stating that the arkansas patient protection act is preempted in its entirety and the defendants are enjoined from enforcing the arkansas patient protection act in its entirety.prudential ins.of am.park med.
the prudential i injunction was undisturbed for nearly five years.on april,however,the united states supreme court handed down its decision in kentucky association of health plans,miller,d.in miller,the court clarified its precedents concerning the scope of erisa saving clause,which exempts from preemption law s which regulat e insurance.id.at.quoting b a.applying its newly announced test,the court held that kentucky any willing provider prohibited health insurers from discriminating against health care providers that were willing to meet the conditions for participation in an insurer health benefit exempt from preemption under erisa saving clause.id.at.
although the court did not refer to prudential i or the arkansas ppa,interested parties soon came forward to argue that the any willing provider provisions of the preempted arkansas ppa were materially indistinguishable from the kentucky statutes saved from preemption in miller.little rock cardiology clinic and little rock hma under the name southwest regional medical center sent separate letters to blue cross requesting admittance to its provider network in light of the supreme court decision in miller.blue cross and usable responded to the health care providers requests by filing suit in the eastern district of arkansas blue cross i.blue cross and usable sought,among other things,a declaratory judgment stating that the prudential i injunction remained valid after miller.the health care providers counterclaimed,seeking admittance to blue cross and usable provider networks as well as damages for blue cross and usable alleged violation of the any willing provider provisions of the arkansas ppa.
soon thereafter,the state of arkansas and two of the original defendants in prudential i filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b to dissolve the prudential i injunction based on the supreme court decision in miller.on february,the district court granted the motion and dissolved the prudential i injunction in its entirety.prudential ins.of am.park med,wl,at.on appeal,we affirmed the court dissolution of the prudential i injunction,except as it related to erisa plans and claims that could have been brought under,erisa civil enforcement provision.prudential ins.of am.park med,prudential ii,cir.the district court entered an amended order stating that this court does hereby lift the injunction against the arkansas patient protection act of,except with regard to direct or indirect application to erisa plans and the civil penalties provisions in ann.as far as any cause of action that could have been brought under.prudential ins.of am.park med.
meanwhile,the district court had stayed blue cross i pending the outcome of prudential ii.once the court lifted its stay,the parties filed for judgment on the pleadings.on march,the district court dismissed with prejudice blue cross and usable declaratory judgment claim,finding that this court decision in prudential ii disposed of all or nearly all of the claims asserted in the complaint.blue cross blue shield vincent infirmary med.ctr.blue cross i,wl,at.turning to the health care providers counterclaims,the district court noted that the equitable relief the health care providers sought was no longer needed because blue cross and usable admitted little rock cardiology clinic and little rock hma into their provider networks after prudential ii.id.at.the court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the health care providers damages claims and dismissed them without prejudice,holding that the claims raised novel or complex issues of arkansas law and involve d significant issues of arkansas public policy.id.at.
less than one month later,the health care providers filed suit against blue cross and usable in the circuit court of pulaski county,arkansas blue cross ii,again seeking damages for blue cross and usable alleged violation of the any willing provider provisions of the arkansas ppa.while the parties disagree over how far blue cross ii has progressed,by all accounts the litigation is ongoing.
not willing merely to defend against the health care providers claims in state court,blue cross and usable brought this action in federal court blue cross iii,seeking to enjoin the health care providers from proceeding in blue cross ii.blue cross blue shield vincent infirmary med.ctr.blue cross iii,wl,at.the health care providers moved to dismiss under rules b and b,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction or,alternatively,that the action was barred by claim and issue preclusion arising from the district court dismissal with prejudice of blue cross and usable declaratory judgment claim in blue cross blue cross iii,wl,at.the district court rejected the health care providers preclusion arguments but granted their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.both parties appeal.
ii.discussion 
it is a verity that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.parties may not enlarge that jurisdiction by waiver or consent.commc ns,paradigm,cir.likewise,a court may not assume hypothetical jurisdiction to decide contested questions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt.steel citizens for a better env t,d.
we review de novo the district court grant of the health care providers motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.hastings wilson,cir.the burden of establishing that a cause of action lies within the limited jurisdiction of the federal courts is on the party asserting jurisdiction here,blue cross and usable.see kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.
from the outset,federal subject matter jurisdiction is plainly in doubt because blue cross and usable have not shown any basis for federal question jurisdiction under,or diversity jurisdiction under.ordinarily,that would end the inquiry.in this case,however,blue cross and usable assert that the district court had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the injunction that it entered more than a decade ago in prudential alternatively,blue cross and usable assert that the district court inherent power under the all writs act,was sufficient to establish jurisdiction over this action.we disagree with both assertions.
to decide the jurisdictional question we must disentangle two distinct issues first,whether the district court had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the original terms of the injunction that it entered in prudential i and second,whether the all writs act supplied the district court with an independent source of subject matter jurisdiction.
ancillary jurisdiction is not a wellspring of new jurisdiction.ancillary jurisdiction is instead derived from some preexisting source of jurisdiction.as the supreme court has described it,the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction recognizes federal courts jurisdiction over some matters otherwise beyond their competence that are incidental to other matters properly before them.kokkonen,at.specifically,the court has acknowledged two purposes for which a federal court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are,in varying respects and degrees,factually interdependent and to enable a court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.id.at.internal citations omitted.
blue cross and usable invoke only the second head of ancillary jurisdiction,sometimes called ancillary enforcement jurisdiction,see myers richland county,cir.the supreme court has approved the exercise of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction over a broad range of supplementary proceedings involving third parties to assist in the protection and enforcement of federal attachment,mandamus,garnishment,and the prejudgment avoidance of fraudulent conveyances.peacock thomas,d.at the same time,the court has cautioned against exercising ancillary enforcement jurisdiction over proceedings that are entirely new and original.id.at.quoting krippendorf hyde.
we accept,as a general proposition,that a federal court may exercise ancillary enforcement jurisdiction to prevent a state court action from contravening a decree that the federal court has previously issued.see,berman denver tramway,cir a federal court has jurisdiction through means of a supplemental proceeding to enjoin the relitigation in a state court of a matter litigated,determined,and adjudicated by its valid decree regularly entered,if the result of the relitigation would be to destroy the effect of the decree rendered in the united states court.see generally charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.supp id.west.the dispositive question here is whether there is an extant decree for the district court to effectuate,protect or enforce.
blue cross and usable argued before the district court that it had ancillary enforcement jurisdiction to prevent the health care providers from contravening the prudential i injunction in blue cross ii.the district court analysis of blue cross and usable asserted basis of jurisdiction turned on its interpretation of the act,which provides that a court of the united states may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.according to blue cross and usable,this action fell within the last of the enumerated exceptions to the act,commonly known as the relitigation exception,because the court in prudential i determined that health insurers could not be held liable under the arkansas ppa for excluding health care providers from their networks.the district court held that the relitigation exception did not apply because the court had not decided the instant issue in prudential i or,for that matter,in blue cross and usable abortive declaratory judgment action,blue cross see chick kam choo exxon,d a n essential prerequisite for applying the relitigation exception is that the claims or issues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation in state proceedings actually have been decided by the federal court.therefore,the court granted the health care providers motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
before considering blue cross and usable argument on appeal,we must first decide whether the district court approach is inconsistent with our holding in airlines reporting barry,cir,that t he act is not jurisdictional,id.at citing smith apple.where it applies,the act does not withdraw subject matter jurisdiction from the federal courts.rather,as its name suggests,the act merely restricts federal courts authority to issue a particular type of equitable relief.gloucester marine rys.charles parisi,cir mooney aircraft foster in re mooney aircraft,cir.since a court need not consider the limits of its remedial authority unless it has jurisdiction to reach the merits of an action,it is generally inappropriate to apply the act before resolving all jurisdictional questions 
we find that the district court did not treat the act as a jurisdictional statute.instead,the court used the relitigation exception to the act as the touchstone for its analysis of blue cross and usable asserted basis of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction.this was not necessarily improper,insofar as the standard governing the application of the relitigation exception is similar,and perhaps functionally equivalent,to the standard governing the exercise of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction to prevent the contravention of a federal decree.nonetheless,we are concerned that the district court approach increases the risk of confusion in future cases where the governing standards do not overlap accordingly,we limit our analysis to the doctrine of ancillary enforcement jurisdiction.
here again,the crux of blue cross and usable argument is that the district court had ancillary enforcement jurisdiction to prevent the health care providers from contravening the prudential i injunction in blue cross ii although blue cross and usable concede that the prudential i injunction has been partially dissolved and that neither of its two remaining provisions applies to this case,they contend that the prudential i injunction was not nullified,ab initio,because relief under rule b is inherently prospective.blue cross and usable reason that the prudential i injunction must,therefore,remain enforceable as to all actions taken between january,when the injunction was first entered,and august,when the pertinent provisions of the injunction were dissolved.carrying this syllogism to its logical conclusion,blue cross and usable argue that the district court should have exercised ancillary jurisdiction over this action to enjoin blue cross ii,in which the health care providers seek to thwart the original terms of the prudential i injunction by obtaining damages for blue cross and usable alleged violation of the any willing provider provisions of the arkansas ppa during the period.
blue cross and usable argument rests on an untenable premise namely,that prudential i decided,once and for all,the availability of damages for violations of the any willing provider provisions of the arkansas ppa that occurred between january,and august.even assuming that the original terms of the prudential i injunction were broad enough to preclude any action for damages under the arkansas ppa,the rationale for the prudential i injunction was discredited by the supreme court decision in miller,and the injunction pertinent provisions were dissolved in accordance with this court decision in prudential ii.simply put,there is nothing left of the prudential i injunction to prevent the health care providers from litigating their action for damages in blue cross ii.
blue cross and usable attempt to overcome this inconvenient fact by focusing on the period from january,to august,when the prudential i injunction was still in force.if the health care providers could not have prevailed in an action for damages under the arkansas ppa before august,so the argument goes,then they can not prevail in blue cross ii,which seeks damages for conduct occurring between january,and august.the central flaw in this line of reasoning is that it fails to account for the later developments in miller and prudential ii.the district court that issued the prudential i injunction did not contemplate the hypothetical availability of damages if the injunction was eventually dissolved indeed,such an attempt to anticipate miller and prudential ii so as to foreclose future cases along the lines of blue cross ii would have veere
