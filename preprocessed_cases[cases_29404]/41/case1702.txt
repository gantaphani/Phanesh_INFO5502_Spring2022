background 
for purposes of summary judgment,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to brown,the party.ngo storlie,cir.
fortner and scott were part of an mdoc transportation team transferring brown and other inmates from one mdoc facility to another in a convoy.fortner drove the second vehicle in the convoy,a van carrying brown and nine other inmates.scott drove the third vehicle,a van carrying one inmate.
brown was fully shackled with belly chains,handcuffs,leg chains,and a black box covering the handcuffs as officers loaded him into the van.the other inmates were similarly restrained.these restraints prevented brown and the other inmates from securing their seatbelts without assistance.the restraints also would prevent the inmates from bracing themselves in the event of a crash.
as correction officers loaded brown into the van,brown asked the officers to fasten his seatbelt.the officers refused to secure brown seatbelt and instead replied with taunts.other inmates also requested seatbelts and were rebuffed.brown reports hearing transportation officers say,ah,hell,you all will be all right,you all do think we gon na wreck,do you,and what,you all do trust our driving brown is unable to identify personally the officers who made the taunting comments and has presented no evidence identifying either fortner or scott as one of the officers who taunted the inmates.
fortner denies being present when brown was loaded into the van and denies making any of the taunting comments recounted above.however,fortner admits he failed to fasten brown seatbelt.when seatbelts are available,transporting inmates without securing their seatbelts violates mdoc policy.scott claims he was not present when brown was loaded into the van,explaining he was fifty feet away,calling the names of the prisoners as they were loaded into the vans.scott did not fasten the seatbelt of the prisoner riding in his van there is no evidence as to whether the prisoner requested a seatbelt.
after the officers placed the inmates in the vans,the convoy departed.both fortner and scott put on their own seatbelts.while driving in a convoy formation,the convoy drivers purposely followed closely to prevent other cars from getting between the convoy vehicles.the convoy passed other vehicles at inappropriate times.the convoy traveled in excess of the speed limit miles per hour,going up to miles per hour.inmates in fortner van repeatedly asked fortner to slow down,but he did not respond nor adjust his driving.after one request,fortner turned up the radio.
at one point,fortner slammed on his brakes and swerved to avoid hitting the convoy lead vehicle,which had slowed suddenly due to the actions of another car.scott,who was looking down at his speedometer,looked up and saw fortner brake lights.scott slammed on the brakes and swerved.scott vehicle skidded and collided with the back of fortner van while going approximately miles per hour.brown suffered injuries as a result of the collision.
the police investigation after the collision listed scott inattentive driving as causing the accident.mdoc also investigated the incident and concluded there was insufficient spacing between the vehicles.
brown filed suit against multiple mdoc defendants pursuant to.brown alleged the acts described above constituted a violation of his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss,and brown appealed.on appeal,this court upheld the dismissal of brown claims against a number of defendants,but reversed the district court as to the correction officers involved in brown transportation.this court concluded that brown stated a claim against the five correction officers involved in transporting the inmates,as he alleged he asked them all to fasten his seatbelt,but they refused.brown,at citing fruit norris,cir prison officials violate the eighth amendment when they intentionally place prisoners in dangerous situations or manifest deliberate indifference for their safety and brown morgan,wl,cir unpublished per curiam hereinafter morgan sheriff refusal to let prisoner wear seatbelt,driving at high rate of speed in bad weather,and smiling when he saw that prisoner was frightened was sufficient to support conclusion that sheriff manifested deliberate indifference for prisoner safety.
on remand,all of the remaining defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all the defendants except fortner and scott.the district court found that brown presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that fortner and scott violated brown eighth amendment rights.the court further held that the right fortner and scott allegedly violated was clearly established and therefore concluded that fortner and scott were not entitled to qualified immunity.fortner and scott appeal the denial of summary judgment and the district court conclusion that they are not entitled to qualified immunity.brown argues that this court lacks interlocutory appellate jurisdiction to hear fortner and scott claims.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
we first address whether we have interlocutory appellate jurisdiction.while a denial of summary judgment is not generally reviewable on immediate appeal,we may review a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity on immediate appeal,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.powell johnson,cir quoting mitchell forsyth,d.i f the issues relate to whether the actor actually committed the act of which he is accused or other similar matters that the plaintiff must prove,we have no jurisdiction to review them in an interlocutory appeal of a denial of a motion based on qualified immunity.henderson munn,cir alteration in original quoting miller schoenen,cir.thus,in an interlocutory appeal,we may not review a district court finding of facts,but it is within our jurisdiction to determine whether all of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment violated the plaintiff clearly established federal rights.lockridge bd.of trs.of the of,cir en banc quotation and citation omitted.
in this appeal,fortner and scott question whether the uncontested evidence demonstrates that they violated a clearly established constitutional right,thereby foreclosing the protection of qualified immunity.we conclude this is a legal issue falling squarely within our limited interlocutory appellate jurisdiction.however,in making their argument,fortner and scott contest some facts brown asserts.such factual disputes are not properly before the court.craighead lee,cir.this does not strip us of jurisdiction.we conduct our review by accepting as true the facts that the district court specifically found were adequately supported,along with those facts that the district court likely assumed.lockridge,at quotation and citation omitted.where there are questions of fact the district court did not resolve,we determine the facts that it likely assumed by viewing the record favorably to the plaintiff as in any other summary judgment motion.id.citation and quotation omitted.
