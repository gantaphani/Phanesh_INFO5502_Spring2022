detroit general retirement system and stanley kurzweil collectively referred to as dgrs,investor class representatives,appeal the district court dismissal of their claims against medtronic,and three of its officers,art collins,william hawkins,and gary ellis,for failure to plead fraud with particularity as required by law.dgrs appeals the dismissal,along with a denial of its motion for leave to amend the complaint and its motion for reconsideration.we affirm.
medtronic,designed,manufactured,marketed,and sold the fidelis lead,a food and drug administration fda approved medical device wire that connects an internally implanted defibrillator to a patient heart and delivers electricity if a shock is needed.fidelis was thinner and more flexible than earlier defibrillator leads,and therefore tolerated by a range of patients who did not do well with bulkier traditional leads.the fidelis was considered an improvement on medtronic existing quattro lead,and clinical studies in humans were not required for its approval.the fidelis quickly became the most popular defibrillator lead on the market and by the devices had been implanted in more than patients.
on february,doctor robert hauser met with a vice president at medtronic and informed the company he was concerned about the failure rate of the fidelis leads at his heart clinic and he would no longer implant the device in his patients.on february,hauser provided medtronic with a study he and his colleagues had completed at the clinic,which he planned to publish in a prominent medical journal.the study found fidelis leads had higher failure rates than the quattro leads,concluded fidelis leads were prone to early failure because of a tendency to fracture,and recommended against use of the device.
on march,medtronic sent a letter to physicians informing them some clinics had reported higher than normal failure rates and fracturing in the fidelis leads and informing the doctors that medtronic was investigating the reports.the company disclosed the types of fractures reported,offered suggestions for how to prevent the fractures,and requested feedback from the doctors regarding problems with implanting the devices according to recommendation.medtronic stated that the performance of fidelis was in line with other medtronic leads and the company investigation suggests that variables within the implant procedure may contribute significantly to these fractures.the letter cited a medtronic clinical surveillance study the longevity study and medtronic analysis of returned fidelis leads.medtronic continued to promote and sell the fidelis leads,and company reports indicated the market for the device was strong.
on may,medtronic filed an application with the fda to modify the design of the fidelis lead.at a meeting with doctors at the heart institute on july,medtronic representatives stated the company had identified a problem and was working on a possible remedy but was not going to pull the product from the market.on july,the minneapolis star tribune published a story on the hauser study,which was published the same month,in which a medtronic spokesman,rob clark,said the study must be taken in context as it hails from one center and does not represent the total performance experience of the fidelis lead.
on october,medtronic announced it was suspending sales of the fidelis lead because of the potential for fractures.the company recommended that physicians stop implanting existing fidelis leads.the press release stated the failure rate for the fidelis lead was greater than the failure rate for the quattro leads and while the difference was not statistically significant,it had the potential to become significant over time and the company believed pulling the leads from the market was in the best interest of patients.the release mentioned that the company had identified five deaths in which fidelis fracture may have been a contributing factor.
medtronic held a press conference at which representatives explained the sequence of events,starting with fracture reports early in the year which prompted the march letter,followed by a six month period of investigation into reports of device failure,and culminating with the company decision to recall the device.medtronic again stated the difference in the failure rate for the fidelis compared to other models was not statistically significant but would become significant over time if it continued.representatives disclosed the predicted impact of the recall on the business of the company,expressing particular concern for the japanese market because fidelis was the only approved medtronic lead in that market.at a subsequent conference,medtronic representatives detailed the time line for the decision,starting with the reports of excessive fractures early in the year which prompted the march letter and caused medtronic to examine the following six months of data from the lead analysis studies as well as data on patients from medtronic carelink database.
medtronic stock price dropped just over from its price of in the days following the recall,falling to a low of on november.on october,a products liability class action was filed against medtronic,alleging the company knew about the failures as early as march of and failed to pull the device from the market in a timely manner.dgrs filed the instant suit,alleging medtronic had engaged in securities fraud by misleading investors as to the seriousness of the problem with the fidelis leads.medtronic responded with a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state with particularity a legitimate basis for the claims of fraud.the district court dismissed the case and this appeal followed.

false or materially misleading statements 
in order to satisfy the reform act falsity pleading standard,a complaint may not rest on mere allegations that fraud has occurred.instead the complaint must indicate why the alleged misstatements would have been false or misleading at the several points in time in which it is alleged they were made.in other words,the complaint facts must necessarily show that the defendant statements were misleading.
t o fulfill the materiality requirement there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,internal quotation marks omitted.
