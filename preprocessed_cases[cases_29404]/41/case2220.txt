order and opinion 
the petition for panel rehearing is granted.the opinion filed on february,and appearing at cir is withdrawn.the superseding opinion will be filed concurrently with this order.
we are called upon to decide whether a physician who asserts that he was discriminated against based on his race,sexual orientation,and perceived disability by doctors and nurses at the hospital where he treated patients can establish civil rights claims under federal and state law.
christopher lynn johnson worked as a physician at the riverside community hospital riverside and as a member of the medical staff of riverside community hospital medical staff from october until february.johnson responsibilities included performing plastic surgeries and providing trauma consultations in riverside emergency room.johnson identifies himself as african american and bisexual.soon after he began his tenure at riverside,johnson alleges that several physicians regularly harassed him because of his sexual orientation and their mistaken belief that he suffered from.he alleges that several nurses harassed him and refused to participate in surgeries with him for the same reasons.in addition,johnson points to several incidents of racial discrimination during his time at riverside.the first was particularly serious.according to johnson,a colleague,vlasak,admonished him by using a racial slur after johnson performed surgery on one of vlasak patients.as the facts are set forth in johnson complaint,vlasak failed to review the patient ct scan and consequently failed to realize that the patient was suffering from a skull fracture with an underlying brain contusion.upon discovering the problem,johnson admitted the patient for surgery and performed the necessary procedure.when vlasak learned that johnson had corrected and therefore exposed his oversight,vlasak moved as if to strike johnson,charged into the room where johnson was standing and screamed you fucking did you do that to me 
second,johnson alleges that the medical staff residency selection committee refused to consider a residency candidate because he was and,after rejecting the application,the chairman and other members of the committee stated in the presence of other physicians that they would not rank the applicant because of his race and sexual orientation.finally,johnson states that a certain nurse consistently refused to provide him with necessary equipment during surgical procedures and repeatedly asked him to remove trash from the operating room,acting as if these requests were funny.he further alleges that these remarks were racially motivated,as they reflected the nurse view that he was required to act as a maintenance man simply because he was.johnson alleges that riverside and the medical staff,of which defendant robert duncanson was the chief,were aware of all of these incidents and made no effort to address them.
johnson worked at riverside under the terms of a professional services agreement.the contract explicitly designated johnson as a contractor,rather than an employee.the contract also required johnson to retain his membership and privileges with the medical staff.failure to do so was a cause for termination.
in february,johnson medical staff privileges were revoked after he failed to pay his membership dues by a deadline johnson claims the medical staff imposed arbitrarily and without warning while he was traveling out of the country.because full membership on the medical staff was a condition of his contract,riverside terminated johnson soon afterwards.johnson immediately applied to the medical staff for reinstatement,but was informed that he could only regain his status by reapplying to the staff as a new applicant,which would require him to submit to a hearing before the medical staff credentials committee.johnson obliged,and was confronted at the hearing with numerous complaints about his behavior filed by,all of which he contends were fabricated.after the hearing,the committee voted to uphold the denial of johnson medical staff membership.prior to the completion of the hearing,riverside filed a report describing the complaints against johnson with the california medical board pursuant to california business and professions code.johnson argues that the filing of this report was premature and cost him future opportunities for employment.
on september,johnson filed a complaint against duncanson with the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh alleging that he had been harassed,denied employment,and denied privileges to admit patients to riverside on account of his race and sexual orientation.on september,dfeh issued johnson right notices for duncanson and several other individuals on the medical staff and nursing staff.
on september,johnson filed a complaint in california state court against riverside and several other defendants setting forth multiple civil rights claims under federal and state law.he voluntarily dismissed that action,however,on october.later,on december,johnson filed a complaint in the district court for the central district of california against riverside,the medical staff,duncanson,and other individuals alleging the same causes of action,including three relevant to this appeal racial discrimination in violation of racial and sexual orientation discrimination in violation of california civil code the unruh civil rights act claim and and racial and sexual orientation discrimination in violation of california fair employment and housing act feha,cal.gov et.
the defendants moved to dismiss all claims under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the district court dismissed johnson claims under california civil code and with prejudice,finding that johnson had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because neither provision creates a cause of action for employment discrimination.the district court did not specifically address johnson claims,but dismissed his remaining claims,including his feha claims,without prejudice,granting him leave to amend.
johnson timely filed a first amended complaint which omitted,and thereby waived,all other claims except those mentioned here thereafter,he reached a settlement with several defendants,leaving only riverside,duncanson,and the medical staff as defendants in this action.the district court then dismissed each of johnson remaining claims under rule b for failure to state a claim.
johnson appeals.first,he argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against duncanson and riverside,contending that he has sufficiently alleged that the defendants created a racially hostile work environment in violation of that provision.second,johnson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his and claims against all three defendants because both statutes recognize a cause of action for the type of workplace discrimination johnson alleges here.finally,johnson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his feha claims against all three defendants even though the statute of limitations expired,suggesting that he was entitled to equitable tolling.we consider each argument in turn.
we begin with johnson claim against duncanson and riverside.the district court dismissed such claim without discussion.nevertheless,we may affirm based on any ground supported by the record.papa united states,cir.a rule b dismissal may be based on either a lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.balistreri pacifica police dep t,cir.in other words,johnson complaint must provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing that he is entitled to relief.a.this is not an onerous burden.specific facts are not necessary the statement need only give the defendant s fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.erickson pardus,d internal quotation marks omitted.still,johnson complaint must,at a minimum,plead enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.finally,in reviewing the district court decision,we view johnson complaint in the light most favorable to him,accepting all factual allegations as true,as well as any reasonable inferences drawn from them.broam bogan,cir.
among other things,guarantees all persons the right to make and enforce contracts.a.this right includes the right to the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship,including the relationship between employer and employee.id.b.johnson contends that duncanson and riverside were aware of the harassment he faced from his and failed to take steps to address it,thereby creating a hostile work environment.in this circuit,such claims are cognizable under.manatt bank of,cir.a hostile work environment,by its very nature involves repeated conduct.passenger morgan,d.to state a hostile work environment claim here,johnson must allege that he was subjected to verbal or physical conduct because of his race,the conduct was unwelcome,and the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive work environment.manatt,at internal quotation marks omitted in considering whether the discriminatory conduct was severe or pervasive,we look to all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.kortan cal.youth,cir quoting faragher city of boca raton,d.
at the motion to dismiss stage,johnson need not support his allegations with evidence,but his complaint must allege sufficient facts to state the elements of a hostile work environment claim.see twombly.at see also williams boeing,cir even though heightened pleading is not required in discrimination cases,the complaint must still give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.quoting swierkiewicz sorema,d.
johnson complaint is rife with allegations that his coworkers harassed him because of his sexual orientation.nevertheless,because creates a cause of action only for those discriminated against on account of their race or ethnicity,such allegations are irrelevant to his claim.see jones bechtel,cir holding that a plaintiff could not assert a claim based on gender discrimination.still,johnson complaint includes at least three allegations that are relevant to his claim that he was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his race.
first,johnson encounter with vlasak,in which vlasak uttered a racial epithet and moved as if to strike him,was a serious act of discrimination.while an isolated incident of harassment by a will rarely if ever give rise to a reasonable fear that such harassment has become a permanent feature of the employment relationship,brooks city of san mateo,cir,johnson complaint contains other relevant allegations.while the complaint does not allege that johnson was present at the time when the residency candidate application was rejected or when the members of the residency selection committee offensive remarks were made,discriminatory conduct directed at an individual other than the plaintiff may be relevant to a hostile work environment claim.see,monteiro tempe union high sch,cir.finally,the allegations of the nurse repeated requests that johnson remove trash from the operating room,which she viewed as funny,are also relevant to his claim.we have previously held that a coworker use of a code word or phrase can,under certain circumstances,contribute to a hostile work environment.mcginest gte serv,cir see also bjy,cir same.while we are not obligated to accept every conclusory allegation as true,see,sanders brown,cir,we believe the inference that racial animus motivated the nurse frequent requests that johnson perform the tasks of a maintenance man is a reasonable one that we must construe in his favor at the motion to dismiss stage 
johnson complaint provides duncanson and riverside with fair notice of what his claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.swierkiewicz,at.and,viewing the totality of the alleged circumstances in the light most favorable to him,the complaint puts forth enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.twombly.at.our notice pleading requirements do not require more.indeed,it may appear on the face of the pleadings that recovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not the test.swierkiewicz,at.quoting scheuer rhodes,d.accordingly,we conclude that johnson claim must survive duncanson and riverside motion to dismiss.
our next task is to determine whether the district court erred in dismissing johnson claims under california civil code and.
california civil code codifies the unruh civil rights act and provides that all persons within the state of california are free and equal and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.cal.b.california courts have interpreted the term business establishment in the broadest sense reasonably possible,see burks poppy constr,cal d,and hospitals such as riverside meet the definition.vill.green owners ass n,cal d.nevertheless,the california supreme court has expressly held that employment discrimination claims are excluded from protection.alcorn anbro eng g,cal d,rojo kliger,cal d.the court has explained this exclusion by noting that the unruh act was designed to prohibit discrimination by business establishments in the course of furnishing goods,services,or facilities to its clients,patrons,or customers,but does not extend to claims for employment discrimination because other california statutes are specifically tailored to provide relief for such conduct,most notably the feha,which was passed by the california legislature in the very same session as the unruh act.alcorn,cal d at.
years later in strother southern california permanente medical group,cir,we interpreted the scope of liability available under in light of alcorn and subsequent california cases and concluded that those precedents established the rule that relief under was available when the plaintiff was in a relationship with the offending business establishment similar to that of the customer in the relationship which the act and its predecessors have most commonly covered.id.at.
applying these precedents,the district court dismissed johnson claims against the defendants,reasoning that his allegations amounted to employment discrimination claims excluded from the unruh act protection.one month later,however,the california court of appeal decision in payne anaheim memorial hospital,th,d,became final.in that case,the third division of the court of appeal held that a physician could assert a claim against the hospital where he treated patients because that physician did not have the type of employment relationship with the hospital which foreclosed relief.id.at,d.johnson argues that payne has changed the applicable state law and requires us to reverse the district court dismissal of his claims.
in reviewing the district court judgment,we must apply state law as it is presently defined,even if state law has been altered subsequent to the district court decision.vandenbark glass.nelson brunswick,cir.in interpreting state law,we are bound to follow the decisions of the state highest court.hewitt joyner,cir.when the state highest court has not spoken on an issue,we must determine what result the court would reach if we were standing in its shoes by examining state appellate court opinions,statutes and treatises.id.in undertaking this task,the california court of appeal announcement of a rule of law is a datum for ascertaining state law which we may not omit unless we are convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.hangarter provident life accident ins,cir quoting hicks feiock,d internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we must first determine whether payne holding applies to the facts of this case.if we answer that question in th
