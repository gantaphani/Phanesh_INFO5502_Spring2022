kent sommer and his wife,andrea sommer,brought suit against two doctors,william davis and charles norton,alleging that they had negligently performed surgery on sommer.because the district court concluded that the sommers had failed to introduce any competent evidence that either defendant had breached the requisite standard of care,it granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.the sommers appeal,arguing that the district court erred in determining that their expert witnesses were not competent to testify under tennessee law.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
in july of,kent sommer traveled from his home in carbondale,illinois to nashville,tennessee to see william davis,an orthopedic surgeon.sommer was suffering from back pain,which was eventually attributed to degenerative changes in a disk in the lower part of his spine.after conservative treatment failed to alleviate the pain,davis performed surgery on sommer back on july,in a nashville hospital.the procedure involved the excision of the problematic disk and the implantation of artificial devices to stabilize sommer spine and thereby allow it to fuse.
on january,sommer returned to the same nashville hospital so that the stabilizing devices could be removed.this time the procedure was performed by charles norton,an associate of davis.he removed the artificial devices and verified that sommer spine had fused.
sommer condition deteriorated shortly after leaving the care of his nashville physicians.he subsequently sought treatment from matthew gornet,at a clinic in louis,missouri in august of.his treatment in missouri convinced sommer that his nashville doctors had negligently caused him injury.
procedural background 
sommer and his wife brought suit against davis on december,in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee.nearly eight months later,the sommers amended their complaint to add norton as a defendant.the magistrate judge entered a stipulated case management order on march.among the dates included in the order was a june,deadline for the sommers to provide disclosures of any expert witnesses in accordance with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.this was already the second scheduling order in the case to include a date for expert witnesses.the initial deadline was august.toward the end of may,the sommers filed an unopposed motion to extend the existing deadlines by days.july,was then set as the new date.
norton moved for summary judgment on october.after the sommers sought additional time to respond to the motion,the district court extended the time to november.the sommers filed their opposition on november,and then filed additional papers in opposition the following day.an affidavit by gornet and an unsworn letter dated november,from gregory loomis,a physician practicing in evansville,indiana,were attached to the sommers papers in opposition to the motion.
on february,the defendants jointly moved to exclude gornet from testifying at trial unless he made himself available for a deposition.they also expressed concern over the possibility that the sommers might seek to offer loomis as a testifying expert,even though he had not been disclosed as one.on february,the sommers filed a response in opposition to the defendants motion.the primary ground of their opposition was that gornet,first,is not a retained expert.gornet is a treating doctor.they specifically denied that gornet was an expert witness within the purview of rule.
five days later the sommers moved for leave to file a supplemental rule opinion witness disclosure containing the identification of gregory loomis.the defendants argued that the district court should deny this motion because the sommers had not identified any reason for their failure to identify loomis by july,and because trial was scheduled for may.davis subsequently moved for an order in limine to exclude loomis as an expert witness on the ground that loomis was not competent under tennessee law to testify on any issue in the case.he also filed a similar motion that sought to exclude gornet as an expert witness,but this motion alternatively requested a hearing to determine the admissibility of gornet testimony pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence.
on april,the district court denied the sommers motion to disclose loomis as an expert witness,warned the sommers that gornet would not be permitted to testify at trial unless he made himself reasonably available for a deposition,and granted norton motion for summary judgment.the sommers moved for reconsideration.
after conducting the requested rule hearing,the district court ruled that gornet was not competent under tennessee law to testify about the standard of medical care in nashville or in a community similar to nashville.it therefore granted davis motion to exclude gornet from testifying.because this rendered the sommers unable to carry their burden of proof,the district court on its own initiative dismissed the action with prejudice.finally,the district court denied the sommers motion to reconsider the award of summary judgment to norton.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to norton 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.sperle michigan dep t of,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering such a motion,the court construes all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
in the case before us,the sommers argue that summary judgment for norton was improper because genuine issues of material fact remained in dispute regarding their claim against him.the sommers alleged that on or about january,norton undertook to perform an orthopaedic surgical procedure on the plaintiff in which certain hardware referred to as the system was removed and t hat charles norton negligently performed said procedure to include but not limited to adequately exploring sommer fusion.to prevail on this medical malpractice claim against norton,they had to prove the following 
the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice in the profession and the specialty thereof,if any,that the defendant practices in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community at the time the alleged injury or wrongful action occurred 
that the defendant acted with less than or failed to act with ordinary and reasonable care in accordance with such standard and 
as a proximate result of the defendant negligent act or omission,the plaintiff suffered injuries which would not otherwise have occurred.
none of the evidence produced by the sommers in their response to norton motion for summary judgment even mentioned norton,let alone identified facts from which a jury could conclude that he had been negligent.as noted in part above,the sommers filed an affidavit by gornet and an unsworn letter dated november,from loomis.gornet affidavit mentions several alleged deficiencies in davis work,but it does not refer to norton at all.loomis similarly opined in his letter on davis alleged shortcomings,but he too failed to mention norton.
parties opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon the mere allegations of their pleadings,but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.because the sommers failed to set forth any facts,material or otherwise,relevant to their claim against norton,the district court properly granted his motion for summary judgment.
b.the district court did not err in denying the sommers motion to reconsider 
in their notice of appeal,the sommers stated that they were appealing the denial of their motion to reconsider the award of summary judgment to norton.they have not,howeve
