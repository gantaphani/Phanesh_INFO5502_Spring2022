this is a retiree health benefits case,in which the court is asked to determine whether the parties to various labor agreements intended for retiree health benefits to vest such that any termination of those benefits constitutes a violation of of the labor management relations act lmra.the district court granted summary judgment for polyone after concluding that the labor agreements in question were unambiguous and established no intent to vest retiree health benefits.having conducted a thorough review of the record and the applicable law,we arrive at a different conclusion and vacate the district court judgment.
background 
russell bowman,william duncan,nancy hood,julius noe,ray reynolds,and anna may wilder,plaintiffs are all retirees or the surviving spouse of a retiree from goodrich geon vinyl division bfg,which through a series of transactions became polyone,the defendant in this case polyone.plaintiffs or their deceased spouses all retired between and from bfg louisville,kentucky,facility.while employed with bfg,plaintiffs were represented in the collective bargaining process primarily by the distillery,rectifying,wine and allied workers international union of america,local union.during this time period,the union and bfg entered into various collective bargaining agreements,none of which specifically addressed the issue of health benefits.also during this period,bfg negotiated a series of agreements with other unions that represented employees working at facilities outside of kentucky.these other agreements,which were entitled agreements on employee benefit programs ebas,provided employee and retiree health benefits to the applicable group of employees.per the terms of the ebas,retirees were not required to contribute to their health insurance premiums,they were reimbursed for medicare part b,and they paid for each prescription medication.
plaintiffs maintain that the health benefits provided by the ebas were extended to them via a memorandum of agreement moa entered into by plaintiffs union and bfg.effective in,bfg replaced the ebas with a flexible benefit program flex program.the flex program slightly changed the health care coverage available for active employees and those who retired after august.it is undisputed that plaintiffs received the health benefits described in the ebas or the flex program until march,when polyone ceased reimbursing plaintiffs medicare part b premiums,began requiring plaintiffs to contribute towards their insurance premiums,and instituted much higher prescription drug.believing that polyone conduct violated the ebas and the flex program,plaintiffs filed the instant action under of the lmra.finding that the ebas and the flex program did not manifest an intent to vest retiree health benefits,the district court granted summary judgment for polyone.plaintiffs timely appealed.

with the exception of plaintiff hood,all of the retirees involved in this case received the health benefits provided by the various ebas.although plaintiffs retired under several different ebas,we refer to the ebas collectively because each agreement contains the same language regarding the issues involved in this appeal.as for plaintiff hood,the merits of her claim will be discussed separately because the flex program governs her retiree health benefits.
incorporation of the ebas by the moa 
as a threshold matter,it is necessary to determine if the moa incorporates the health benefits provisions of the ebas to plaintiffs.in the absence of incorporation,plaintiffs claim fails because the collective bargaining agreements negotiated between plaintiffs and bfg are silent as to health benefits.the moa states in pertinent part 
the following article is hereby included in the current collective bargaining agreement 
the pension plan,including the requirement for compulsory retirement at age seventy,the hospitalization,surgical and medical expense insurance program,and the prescription drug program presently in effect for the majority of the bfgoodrich company production and maintenance employees shall be in effect for the life of this agreement.
ja at.according to the district court,while the moa is far from clear,the parties appear to have intended that this general reference incorporate the eba health benefit provisions.noe polyone,wl,at.disagreeing with the district court determination on this issue,polyone argues that plaintiffs have failed to offer any from anecdotes and that the moa incorporated the ebas to plaintiffs.in response,plaintiffs argue that the parties course of conduct illustrates that they intended for the moa to provide employees and retirees of bfg louisville facility with the health benefits found in the ebas.
based on our review of the moa and the conduct of the parties,the district court correctly held that the moa incorporated the ebas to plaintiffs.because the moa itself is unclear on this issue,the district court properly looked to extrinsic evidence and the course of performance between the parties in determining that the moa incorporated the ebas.as the district court recognized,the most telling of this extrinsic evidence is the fact that e veryone agrees that plaintiffs actually received the benefits described in the ebas and continued to receive them after retirement.id.at.although the terms of the moa undoubtedly could have been more precise,the evidence establishes that it was intended by the parties to apply the ebas to plaintiffs.therefore,we proceed to analyze the eba provisions themselves to determine whether the district court properly found that plaintiffs retiree health benefits have not vested.
c.the vesting determination 
the district court held that the retiree health benefits provisions in the ebas clearly and unambiguously established that the parties did not intend for plaintiffs health benefits to vest.having examined the language of the moa and the ebas,this court finds that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of polyone for numerous reasons.first,polyone argument that the moa language indicates that plaintiffs health benefits were not intended to vest fails.second,the durational provisions relied on by polyone and the district court are general in nature and do not preclude a finding that the parties intended plaintiffs benefits to vest.third,provisions in the ebas expressly tie eligibility for retiree health benefits to eligibility for a pension,which we have repeatedly held evinces an intent to vest.fourth,adopting the interpretation urged by polyone and accepted by the district court would render several promises made in the ebas illusory,a result in violation of our precedent.fifth,the presence of specific vesting language in the pension benefits portion of the ebas does not lead to the conclusion that plaintiffs health benefits have not vested.
the moa language does not preclude a finding that plaintiffs health benefits were intended to vest 
polyone argues that the moa itself establishes that the parties never intended for plaintiffs health benefits to vest.polyone believes that the moa negates any intent to vest because it limits benefits to the duration of the agreement and provides that the agreement may be changed by subsequent negotiations.
the moa states in pertinent part 
the pension plan,including the requirement for compulsory retirement at age seventy,the hospitalization,surgical and medical expense insurance program,and the prescription drug program presently in effect for the majority of the bfgoodrich company production and maintenance employees shall be in effect for the life of this agreement provided that if during the term of this agreement the plan or programs are changed for such majority,such changes shall be made effective on the same date they are made effective for the majority of the bfgoodrich production and maintenance employees and remain in effect for the life of this agreement.
ja at emphasis added.polyone first asserts that the italicized phrase shall be in effect for the life of this agreement is a specific durational clause that precludes a finding that plaintiffs health benefits have vested.plaintiffs counter by arguing that the provision is a general durational clause and is insufficient to demonstrate that retiree health benefits have not vested.with regard to this issue,the district court agreed with plaintiffs that the moa durational clause was general in nature.see noe,wl,at.
as explained in yolton,a bsent specific durational language referring to retiree benefits themselves,courts have held that the general durational language says nothing about those retiree benefits.yolton,at.in yolton,the court concluded that a provision stating that the group insurance plan will run concurrently with this agreement was a general durational clause and did not preclude a finding that retiree health benefits had vested.id.like the agreement in yolton,there is no language in the moa specifically stating that retiree health benefits expire upon the termination of the agreement.it speaks generically of all benefits for all employees language that does not constitute a specific durational clause under our precedent.see see also maurer,at finding that a cba termination clause was not a specific durational clause because it did not specifically reference retiree benefits.
polyone reliance on linville teamsters misc.indus.workers union,local,cir,for the proposition that the moa language is a specific durational clause is misplaced.in linville,the clause at issue expressly stated that health insurance under the company plan ceases when the individual reaches age.linville,at.no such language is present in this case,and there is no discussion in linville regarding whether a clause such as that contained in the moa is a general or specific durational provision.linville is also distinguishable because the agreement there stated that no individuals were to receive health benefits after attaining age.id.instead,as in and maurer,the opposite is true in this case the ebas actually contain language indicating that certain health benefits start at age and last until death.see h,ja at.because the moa language is analogous to that used in yolton,and linville does not apply,we reject polyone argument and find that the moa provision is a general durational clause that does not preclude a finding that plaintiffs health benefits have vested.
polyone next argues that the moa statement that if during the term of this agreement the plan or programs are changed for such majority,such changes shall be made effective on the same date they are made effective for the majority of bfgoodrich employees at other facilities,precludes a finding that plaintiffs health benefits have vested.according to polyone,this language authorizes it to alter plaintiffs health benefits at any time therefore,such benefits have not vested.
while construing the moa in this manner has some merit on the surface,a close examination of the entirety of the moa highlights the error in such an interpretation.the moa provision at issue begins with the words t he pension plan,including the hospitalization,surgical and medical expense insurance program,and the prescription drug program.ja at emphasis added.looking to the specific language relied on by polyone,the moa states provided that if during the term of this agreement the plan or programs are changed for such majority,such changes shall be made effective for plaintiffs.it is apparent that the use of the word plan in the latter sentence refers back to the phrase pension plan in the former sentence,while the word program in the latter sentence refers back to the former phrase hospitalization,surgical and medical expense insurance program and the prescription drug program.adopting polyone construction that by permitting the company to make changes to the agreements,the moa language negates any intent to vest retiree health benefits,would necessarily lead to the conclusion that the benefits provided by the pension plan are subject to change and not vested.
according to yolton,such an argument fails because the same language was used regarding pensions and health benefits g iven the defendant logic,because its pension plan was incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement,its obligation to provide pensions ended with the expiration of the agreement.yolton,at quoting to the district court opinion in golden.as yolton seems to have implicitly recognized,such a result is forbidden by erisa,which requires that pension benefits automatically vest.see yolton,at see also maurer,at stating that pension plans are subject to mandatory vesting under erisa.given that pension benefit plans can not be changed in the manner polyone interpretation would suggest,it follows that the moa language at issue does not establish that plaintiffs health benefits under the program were not intended to vest.
sections and of the ebas are general durational clauses 
similar to its moa arguments,polyone primary assertion as it relates to the ebas is that language found in and of the ebas specifically limits the availability of retiree health benefits to the duration of the ebas.unlike the district adopted this line of are not persuaded.as previously explained with regard to the moa durational clause,a bsent specific durational language referring to retiree benefits themselves a general durational clause says nothing about the vesting of retiree benefits.yolton,at.according to our opinion in yolton,such general 
durational language only affects future is,someone who retired after the expiration of a particular cba would not be entitled to the previous benefits,but is rather entitled only to those benefits newly negotiated under a new cba.thus,the retirement package available to someone contemplating retirement will change with the expiration and adoption of cbas,but someone already retired under a particular cba continues to receive the benefits provided therein despite the expiration of the agreement itself.
id.at see also maurer,at explaining that general durational provisions are not clearly meant to include retiree benefits.
in an unpublished case involving language virtually identical to that found in of the ebas,we concluded that the provision was general in nature and did not preclude a finding that retiree benefits had vested.see int l union,united,aerospace agric.implement workers of am.loral,wl,at cir unpublished table decision.the cba at issue in loral contained an introductory clause in the benefits portion of the agreement,which stated effective august,and for the duration of this agreement thereafter,the employer will provide the following program of hospital benefits,benefits,surgical benefits and prescription drug benefits.id.there,as here,the employer argued that the introductory clause limited its obligation to provide retiree benefits to the duration of the cba.id.and there,as here,we were not persuaded.according to the loral court,the introductory clause was a general durational provision that did not limit retiree health benefits to the duration of the cba.see id.at.
similarly,in weimer,cir,this court analyzed a durational provision stating that this agreement and all terms and conditions hereof shall terminate as of the end of the term.the weimer court held that the quoted language constituted a general termination clause that does not support a finding that retiree benefits ended when the agreements expired.id.at see also bvr liquidating,at finding that retiree health benefits vested notwithstanding an introductory clause stating that benefits would be provided at no cost to the employees or retirees for the term of this agreement.
in this case,of the ebas states effective as of april,and for the duration of this agreement,the company will provide the following plan of hospital expense benefits,benefits,surgical benefits,prescription drug benefits,dental benefits and major medical benefits ja at.according to polyone,this language specifically limit s the duration of retiree health benefits to the term of the ebas.polyone argument fails,however,because language is indistinguishable from the language we held to be a general durational provision in loral and is analogous to that involved in weimer.as with the durational clauses held to be general in yolton,loral,bvr,and weimer,the language in does not specifically refer to retiree benefits rather,it refers generically to the benefits available for all employees as well as retirees.hence,the district court incorrectly held that indicates an intent not to vest retiree health benefits.
aside from the language found in,polyone also asserts that the introductory statement in article and the durational language in foreclose plaintiffs claim.for largely the same reasons as those set forth above,we disagree.section states in pertinent part upon termination,this agreement shall terminate in all respects except that the benefits provided by it shall be extended for ninety days following such termination.ja at.as with,nothing in specifically refers to retiree benefits the clauses held to be general in the cases previously refers to all benefits available for all employees,active and retired.given the lack of any specific reference to retiree benefits themselves,yolton,at,is a general durational clause and does not support the district court finding in favor of polyone see maurer,at finding a cba clause providing that benefits shall remain in effect until midnight on the cba expiration date to be a general durational provision because it was not clearly meant to include retiree benefits.see also united rubber,cork,linoleum plastic workers of,pirelli armstrong tire,holding that a clause identical in all respects to was a general durational provision and did not establish that retiree health benefits terminate after the expiration of the cba.
looking to the introductory language of article,it is also a general durational clause.article states in pertinent part this agreement constitutes a settlement for the duration of this agreement of all retirement,pension,insurance,survivor income benefits,supplemental workers compensation,drugs and severance pay demands ja at.this language from article refers to all benefits it does not specifically limit the duration of retiree health benefits as required by yolton and its progeny.polyone argument that this general language indicates that plaintiffs health benefits were not intended to vest fails.
the dissent erroneously suggests that by deeming the durational provisions to be general in nature,we have in some way turned the inference into a presumption of vesting that may only be overcome by a clear statement that retiree benefits were not intended to vest.dis.op.at.such is not the case.the dissent also fails to recognize that requiring specific language referring to retiree health benefits in order for a durational clause to be characterized as specific is not the same thing as requiring specific language in a cba rather,it simply means that the entire case can not be resolved on the basis of a durational clause that fails to reference retiree health benefits as is required by our case law.see yolton at.as this court has held time and time again when confronted with similar provisions,general durational clauses of the sort found in the ebas do not resolve the vesting issue,and it is necessary to determine if any provisions in the agreements shed light on whether the parties intended for plaintiffs health benefits to vest.see,maurer,at weimer,at loral,wl,at.it is to that question that we now turn our attention.
the ebas indicate an intent to vest plaintiffs health benefits 
because the durational clauses relied on by polyone do not preclude a finding that plaintiffs health benefits have vested,we look to other provisions of the ebas to determine whether the parties intended plaintiffs health benefits to vest.contrary to the district court holding,several provisions in the ebas and decisions of this court support plaintiffs argument that their health benefits have vested.
tying eligibility for retiree health benefits to eligibility for a pension 
according to this court,language in an agreement that ties eligibility for retiree health benefits to eligibility for a pension indicates an intent to vest the health benefits.see mccoy meridian auto,cir see also golden,cir in mccoy,the agreement between the parties stated the company shall contribute the full premium or subscription charge for health care for i a retired employee including any eligible dependents provided such retired employee is eligible for benefits under article ii of the company employees pension plan.mccoy,at.after outlining the applicable law under and its progeny,the mccoy court held that because the cba provision ties eligibility for benefits to eligibility for a pension there is little room for debate that retirees health benefits vested upon retirement.id.at.likewise,the golden court found an intent to vest retiree health benefits because there were provisions in each of the cbas which tie retiree and surviving spouse eligibility for health insurance coverage to eligibility for vested pension benefits.golden,at see also yolton,at citing golden for the proposition that tying eligibility for retiree health benefits to eligibility for pension benefits indicates an intent to vest.
applying the teaching of mccoy and golden in the present case leads inescapably to the conclusion that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for polyone.looking to the ebas,several provisions tie eligibility for retiree health benefits directly to eligibility for pension benefits by using language that is indistinguishable from that involved in mccoy.section of the ebas provides in pertinent part employees who retire and who are eligible under the employee benefit agreement for a pension other than a deferred vested pension,shall receive the benefits described in this article.ja at emphasis added.another section of the ebas also ties eligibility for retiree health benefits to eligibility for a pension.in k,the ebas state 
employees who retire and who are eligible under this agreement for a pension other than a deferred vested pension,shall receive the major medical benefits described in this paragraph ja at emphasis added.lending even more support to the argument that the ebas tie retiree health benefits to pension benefits is the fact that a key retiree health provision refers to retirees covered by the provision as pensioners.see h,ja at.
without citing any authority,the district court disregarded the significance of this tying language because it focuses upon an employee eligibility for benefits rather than upon the duration of those benefits.noe,wl,at.such a statement contradicts mccoy and golden,both of which found vesting based on provisions that used the word eligibility.see mccoy,at explaining that there was evidence of an intent to vest b ecause the supplemental agreement ties eligibility for benefits to eligibility for a pension.emphasis added see also golden,at explaining that provisions in each of the cbas at issue tie retiree and surviving spouse eligibility for health insurance cover to eligibility for vested pension benefits.emphasis added.it is evident that the district court failed to appreciate that by tying the eligibility for retiree health benefits to the eligibility for a pension,the ebas were actually speaking to the duration of the benefits.as we explained in golden,s ince retirees are eligible to receive pension benefits for life,the act of tying retiree health benefits to pension eligibility indicates that the parties intended that the company provide lifetime health benefits as well.golden,at explaining why the district court in golden correctly focused on the presence of tying language.here,the ebas undoubtedly tie eligibility for retiree health coverage to eligibility for a pension,which is evidence of an intent to vest.
b.the ebas promise of a lifetime special medicare benefit 
aside from tying eligibility for retiree health benefits to eligibility for a pension,which in and of itself suggests an intent to vest,there are other provisions in the ebas that indicate under our case law that plaintiffs health benefits were intended to vest.section h of the eba states 
subject to the provisions of this paragraph h,a special medicare benefit will be paid to ii a pensioner who retires on or after april,or iii such pensioner or employee surviving spouse,if such employee,pensioner or surviving spouse is covered for medical benefits under this article.
the special medicare benefit will be equal to the standard monthly premium for part b of medicare 
the special medicare benefit will be payable when an individual attains age or,for an individual less than age,when he enrolls for part b of medicare 
payment shall commence on the first day of the month following i the month during which the individual attains age the payment of such benefit shall continue until the individual death 
upon the death of a pensioner or employee,the special medicare benefit will be paid to his surviving spouse if such spouse is eligible to receive medical benefits under this article.such surviving spouse shall continue to receive the special medicare benefit until such spouse remarries,dies or is no longer eligible for part b of medicare.
ja at emphasis added.as the italicized language makes clear,h promises that once a retiree reaches age he or she will receive the special medicare benefit until death.and upon death,the retiree surviving spouse will continue to receive the special medicare benefit until his or her death or remarriage.
when confronted with similar language in the past,we have held that it establishes an intent to vest retiree health benefits.see policy powell pressed steel,cir in policy,the cba provided when said pensioner reaches age,the company will provide such pensioner,at the company expense,supplemental medicare and major medical benefits.the company will continue to provide at its expense,supplemental medicare and major medical benefits for pensioners aged and over.id.reversing the district court conclusion that the retirees benefits were not vested,policy explained that the language of the supplemental medicare provision unambiguously confers the stated health insurance benefits for the duration of the retiree life.id.emphasis added.the policy court determination finds support in the seventh circuit decision in bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc,where judge posner,writing for the en banc court,explained that a similar provision could reasonably be thought a promise to retired employees that they and their spouses will be covered for the rest of their lives.for the provision does not say when they die or the collective bargaining agreement expires,whichever occurs first,but simply when they die.
as with the provision involved in policy,h promises to provide a special medicare benefit from age until the individual death.we are in agreement with policy,that promising to provide a benefit until a person dies undoubtedly means that the benefit lasts for the person life.it is likewise clear to us that h promise to provide the surviving spouse of a retiree with a medicare supplement until he or she remarries or dies is a promise that the spouse of a retiree is entitled to lifetime benefits unless he or she remarries.see generally loral,wl,at concluding that language providing the spouse of a deceased retiree with benefits until death or remarriage indicates that such benefits have vested.
furthermore,adopting polyone argument that plaintiffs retiree benefits have not vested would render portions of h nugatory,and the promises contained therein illusory,in violation of and its progeny.see,at explaining that courts must construe cba provisions so as to render none nugatory and avoid illusory promises.with regard to the analogous provision in policy,this court explained that to interpret such a benefits provision as terminating at the end of the relevant cba would create an illusory promise to those retirees who would not reach age before the cba expiration.policy,at.according to policy,the promise would be illusory because 
if a year old employee with twenty years service retired on january,eight months before the collective bargaining agreement expired,and if the company were correct in contending that the retiree health insurance benefits ceased with the august,expiration of such agreement,then the company promise to provide supplemental medicare to the retiree when he reached age would be of no value.
see also bailey ak steel,wl,at,examining a similar medicare supplement provision for retirees and concluding that the promise establishes an intent to vest because otherwise it would be illusory for many individuals who retired as young as age.the same conclusion was reached in,where the cba promised to provide certain benefits to retirees when they reached age,at explaining that if retiree benefits expired at the end of the cba then the promise to provide certain benefits at age is completely illusory for many early retirees under age see also maurer,at explaining that,b ecause the cbas permit retirement at age and promise insurance at age,the promise is meaningless if it could be terminated in three years.
similar to the provisions in policy,and maurer,h promises that upon the attainment of age the company will begin to provide the special medicare benefit to retirees.however,as in maurer,employees of bfg could retire as early as age under the company early retirement plan.see,ja at.for such early retirees,the promise of the special medicare benefit is rendered illusory under the interpretation urged by polyone.see ja at.likewise,h promise to provide the spouse of a deceased retiree with the special medicare benefit until his or her death or remarriage would be rendered illusory were this court to agree with the district court and polyone.under polyone interpretation,the spouse of an individual who retired early at age and passed away at age would never receive the promised special medicare benefit even though he or she remained alive and never remarried.
looking to another provision of the ebas,also promises health benefits to the surviving spouse of a retiree until the spouse death or remarriage.according to 
the surviving spouse of an employee who is retired by the company on or after the effective date of this agreement shall continue to be eligible to receive such benefits to the earlier of the date of death or remarriage,provided such spouse,as of the date of death of such retired former employee,was covered for these benefits as an eligible dependent 
ja at emphasis added.accepting polyone interpretation would require this court to rewrite to say that the spouse of a deceased retiree shall continue to be eligible to receive such benefits to the earlier of the date of death or remarriage,or the expiration of this agreement.no such limiting language is found in,and courts should not add words to a contract under the guise of construing it.see richard lord,williston on contracts ed see also bidlack,at explaining that such a provision does not say retiree benefits will be provided to surviving spouses when they die or the collective bargaining agreement expires,whichever occurs first but simply when they die.as with the promises made in h,holding that plaintiffs health benefits have not vested would render promise of health benefits until death or remarriage illusory for the spouses of deceased retirees in violation of precedent.
presence of specific vesting language in pension provision 
next,polyone argues that the fact that the ebas used explicit vesting language with regard to pension benefits leads to the conclusion that the absence of such explicit vesting language in the retiree health benefits provisions indicates that they have not vested.the district court was persuaded by this argument,noting that article of the eba contains strong language stating that pension payments shall be payable monthly during the life of such employee,the last payment thereof being payable for the month in which he dies.noe,wl,at quoting a of the eba,ja at.according to the district court,the absence of such language in the retiree health benefits portion of the ebas suggests that the parties did not intend for them to vest.
however,the district court neglected to notice the similarity between a language and that found in h,which provides that the special medicare benefit will commence when the retiree reaches age and t he payment of such benefit shall continue until the individual death.ja at.in our opinion,a promise to pay a monthly pension during the life of such employee is indistinguishable from h promise to pay the special medicare benefit until the individual death.it is axiomatic that promising to provide a benefit for an individual life a is the functional equivalent of promising to provide a benefit until an individual death h.any argument to the contrary is mere semantics and defies common sense.
in the same vein,polyone asserts that the presence in of language specifically indicating that pension benefits survive the expiration of the ebas,and the absence of such language with regard to retiree health benefits demonstrates that plaintiffs health benefits have not vested.section states no pension or other benefit granted prior to the time of such termination shall be reduced,suspended or discontinued except as specifically provided in this pension plan.ja at.the force of this argument is blunted first by the provisions discussed above that under our precedent do indicate an intent to vest,and second by the existence of various provisions in the ebas that have specific termination language,whereas the retiree health benefits provisions have none.
the presence of specific durational language in other provisions and its absence in the retiree health benefits provisions suggests an intent to vest under our case law.see,at.here,there are several provisions that contain the specific durational provisions referred to by.first,explains that in the event of a layoff an employee shall receive health coverage for three months following the date of.ja at.second,specifies that an employee who is terminated because of a plant closure is entitled to medical benefits under the ebas for a month period.id.third,states that an employee on an authorized leave of absence shall receive health coverage for a period not to exceed three months.id.the inclusion of specific durational language in other provisions of the current collective bargaining agreement suggests that retiree benefits,not so specifically limited,were intended to survive the expiration of successive agreements,at see also yolton,at discussing,with approval,the district court citation of specific durational provisions in the cbas for employees and those on maternity leave as evidence that retiree benefits vested under.
thus,these arguments,essentially predicated on the expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon of interpretation,work to the benefit and detriment of each party.accordingly,the language in offers little support for polyone argument that plaintiffs health benefits were not intended to vest.this is especially true given the various provisions discussed above that indicate an intent to vest plaintiffs health benefits 
as the foregoing analysis makes clear,there is nothing about our holding in this case it is merely the straightforward application of this circuit case law the dissent contention that we have turned into some sort of a presumption in favor of vesting is premised on a misreading of the court opinion.one can search this opinion in vain for any even a we presume retiree health benefits were intended to vest absent a clear statement to the contrary.all we have done today is follow the instructions of and its progeny by examining the provisions of the ebas and applying traditional principles of contract interpretation to ascertain whether the parties intended to vest retiree health benefits.see,at.while the dissent is correct with court has approached the vesting issue differently than have many of our sister circuits,this panel is not at liberty to cast aside nearly years of precedent in order to charter a new course,no matter how desirable that new course may be.
having addressed the ebas and explained why the district court erred in granting summary judgment for polyone,we proceed now to analyze whether plaintiff hood health benefits under the flex program have vested.
d.the flex program 
unlike the other plaintiffs,plaintiff hood health benefits are governed by the flex program because her husband retired from bfg in,two years after the flex program replaced the ebas.although it is clear from our review of the record that the provisions of the flex program differ from those in the ebas,the district court opinion failed to address whether plaintiff hood benefits have vested under the flex program.in all likelihood,the district court failure to address this issue resulted from the parties failure to explain to the court how plaintiff hood claim differed from that of the other plaintiffs.from polyone brief mention of a reservation of rights clause found in the flex program summary plan party has provided this court with any analysis of the flex program language or argument as to whether it evinces an intent to vest retiree benefits.accordingly,whether plaintiff hood benefits have vested under the flex program is an issue that the district court must consider on remand.
iii.conclusion 
we are cognizant of the overall climate in which this case reaches the court rising healthcare costs and foreign competition have certainly placed corporations such as polyone in a difficult economic position.however,in the absence of impossibility of performance,it is not the prerogative of the judiciary to rewrite contracts in order to rescue parties from their improvident commitments.bidlack,at.because the district court erred in concluding that the ebas do not indicate an intent to vest plaintiffs health benefits,we vacate the district court decision granting summary judgment for polyone and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
applying the line of cases to these agreements,the district court concluded as a matter of law that the claimants healthcare benefits do not vest upon retirement.applying the same cases to these agreements,the majority concludes as a matter of law that the claimants healthcare benefits do vest upon retirement.they are both partly right,which is why i would not rule as a matter of law for either party and which is why i respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.
my first objection to the majority approach is its treatment of the claimants as if the agreements covered them directly.that is not the case.the agreements bear on this case only because a separate memorandum of understanding incorporates them.and that memorandum independently limits any expectations claimants otherwise might have about their future healthcare benefits.as agreed to by the claimants,the memorandum says that,if certain other unions representing other bfgoodrich workers change their members retiree health negotiations not involving the claimants union,no changes immediately will alter the benefits of the retirees of the claimants union.see ja i f during the term of this agreement the plan or programs are changed for the majority of bfgoodrich other production and maintenance employees,such changes shall be made effective on the same date they are made effective for that majority and remain in effect for the life of this agreement.that means that,if these other unions and bfgoodrich amend their plans and eliminate or curtail retiree health benefits,the of the claimants union,even someone who planned to retire the next day and anticipated receiving health benefits for life,will be stuck with the least until the next round of negotiations.that is not the kind of provision that naturally inspires a worker to believe his benefits are fixed for life.
the durational language in of the agreements likewise undercuts the claimants argument that their benefits are immutable for life as a matter of law.it says that,u pon termination,this agreement shall terminate in all respects except that the benefits provided by it shall be extended for ninety days following such termination.on its face,the agreement undermines any expectation that the healthcare benefits a worker happens to receive at retirement are the benefits he will receive throughout retirement.
our cases,it is true,appear not to give any weight to general durational clauses in collective bargaining agreements when those clauses do not specifically refer to the duration of benefits.uaw,cir.in,we gave no weight to a durational clause providing that the cba should remain in effect until a particular date because the clause did not specifically refer to the duration of benefits.id.similarly,in maurer joy technologies,cir,we concluded that provisions indicating that the cba and certain other agreements shall terminate on a particular date were general in nature because they only refer red to agreements between the parties,not to benefits created by the agreements.id.at emphasis added.but of the agreement does specifically refer to the duration of benefits.indeed,this language satisfies even the suggestion in yolton that the durational clause must refer to the retiree benefits themselves.yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.surely one type of benefits to which the clause could be referring is retiree benefits.if the majority means to say that a durational clause means nothing unless it says that retiree health benefits terminate or may be terminated at a given point,then it must be saying what our cases including yolton itself have long disclaimed the inference creates a presumption in favor of vesting that may be countered only by a clear statement.see id.at.more on that later.
nor do i believe that the tying language in k of the says that e mployees who retire and who are eligible under this agreement for a pension shall receive the major medical benefits described in this paragraph compels the view that claimants have unalterable benefits for life.mccoy and golden are not the holy grails claimants say they are because those cases like yolton reviewed preliminary injunctions granted by the district court,not a district court resolution of motions.see mccoy meridian auto,cir golden,cir.at issue there was the question whether the district court properly assessed plaintiffs likelihood of success and the balancing of equities caused by an immediate termination of healthcare benefits,not the question whether the plaintiffs should prevail as a matter of law.nor do those cases indicate whether the agreements contained durational language,as in this case,or whether a memorandum of understanding between the union and company limited any expectations otherwise created by the agreements.while i agree with the majority that the district court should not have disregarded the tying language,i respectfully disagree with the majority that this language leads inescapably to the conclusion that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for polyone.no case,to my knowledge,holds that tying language alone suffices to permit retirees to fend off summary less to mandate that the benefits vested as a matter of law.
that is particularly so here in view of the conspicuous inclusion of vesting language in the pension benefits section of the agreement and its conspicuous omission in the healthcare benefits section of the agreement.the pension section of the agreement says no pension or other benefit granted prior to the time of the termination of the pension plan shall be reduced,suspended or discontinued except as specifically provided in this pension plan.in the event of termination or partial termination of this pension plan,the rights of the employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination,to the extent then funded,shall be nonforfeitable now that is vesting language.yet nothing like it appears in the healthcare benefits section of the agreement.if our cases are going to rely on similarities between pension benefits and healthcare benefits such as similar eligibility dates in determining what has vested,they should not ignore marked differences such as different language about vesting in making the same inquiry.either they both are relevant to the vesting question,or neither is.
although h and of the agreement provide some support for the retirees claim,they too do not establish unalterable benefits for life.section h,as the retirees emphasize,says that a special medicare benefit will be paid to certain employees,pensioners and surviving spouses.but the retirees overlook the first sentence of that provision,which adds that those individuals will be provided with a special medicare benefit only if such employee,pensioner or surviving spouse is covered for medical benefits under this article.emphasis added.read together with the introductory language to article says that the company will provide the benefits discussed in article for the duration of this agreement this provision does not unambiguously vest the retirees health benefits.the claimants reliance on suffers from a similar problem.
even if i were to ignore all of this,i still do not know what has vested as a matter of law.is it all retiree health benefits or just certain stated benefits see policy powell pressed steel,cir the court finds that this section unambiguously confers the stated health insurance benefits for the duration of the retiree life.emphasis added.and if it is all retiree benefits,are there any limitations what if the employer reduces health benefits for active employees or increases the cost of those benefits to active employees what if the employer increases some health benefits for active employees but reduces others must the retiree take the bitter with the sweet or is it a ratchet with only the improvements in health benefits available to the retiree but with no compulsion to take any reduction prater ohio educ.ass n,cir.what happens if the medical insurance provider no longer offers the same medical benefits it offered for the term of the prior colle
