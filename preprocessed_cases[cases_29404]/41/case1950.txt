paul anderson,appeals the decision of the district court affirming the administrative law judge alj denial of his application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits.because this decision is supported by substantial evidence,we affirm.
anderson was years old at the time of the alj decision and had completed two years of community college.anderson is tall and weighs pounds.he has previously been employed as a warehouse worker,child care worker,pattern cutter,upholsterer,home health aid,and baker,but he has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the fall of.anderson has degenerative disc disease and suffers severe impairment in his right shoulder.he has also been diagnosed for mild depression and morbid obesity.on september,anderson filed his applications for benefits,alleging that he has been unable to work since march,because of back problems,a shoulder injury,a hand injury,aches and pains,and depression.his applications were denied initially and on reconsideration.subsequently,he requested a hearing before an alj at which he testified about his impairments.a vocational expert also testified during the hearing and responded to the alj hypothetical questions about a person with anderson profile and whether a person with such impairments could perform other work in the national economy.following the hearing,the alj denied anderson request for benefits,concluding that although anderson had severe degenerative disc disease and was unable to perform his past relevant work,he was not disabled and retained the residual functional capacity to perform other work.social security administration ssa decision at.the appeals council of the social security administration and the district court affirmed the alj decision.on appeal,anderson argues that the alj improperly discounted his treating physicians opinions and his complaints of pain and functional limitations.
we must affirm the alj decision if the record contains substantial evidence to support it.edwards barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance but enough so that a reasonable mind could find it adequate to support the decision.id.we consider evidence that both supports and detracts from the alj decision,but we can not reverse the decision merely because there exists substantial evidence supporting a different outcome.id.rather,if,after reviewing the record,we find that it is possible to draw two inconsistent positions from the evidence and one of those positions represents the alj findings,we must affirm the decision of the alj.young apfel,cir citations and quotations omitted.
to receive disability benefits,anderson must demonstrate that he has a physical or mental disability that has lasted at least one year and that prevents him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity.see d a,a a.in making this determination,the alj employs the familiar sequential test laid out in the social security regulations whether anderson has engaged in substantial gainful activity since filing his claim whether his physical mental impairments are severe whether his impairments are of severity whether his impairments prevent him from doing past relevant work and whether anderson is able to perform other work in the national economy given his age,education,and experience.see a f.both sides agree that the key issue in this appeal concerns the alj analysis in the fifth step,whether the alj erred in determining that anderson,despite his impairments,could perform other work in the national economy and was therefore not legally disabled.
as noted,the alj found that anderson had severe degenerative disc disease and impairment of his right shoulder but concluded that he still retained the residual functional capacity to perform other work.the alj did not find anderson testimony regarding the intensity and severity of his impairments to be credible.further,the alj found that anderson had the residual functional capacity to lift twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently and that he could do work at shoulder or chest level but could not perform overhead work with his right arm.in addition,the alj determined that there were no restrictions on anderson lower extremities and that he could sit,stand,or walk for eight hours a day with normal breaks.in light of those restrictions,the alj concluded that although anderson could not perform his past relevant work,he could still perform other jobs in the national economy,including telephone solicitor,gate tender,and general clerk as well as other unskilled light and sedentary positions.ssa decision at.
anderson first argues that the alj improperly discounted the statements of his treating physicians.in particular,he argues the alj gave controlling weight to the one time examining opinion of james brokke,a consulting physician,instead of garber,his family doctor and brokke associate,and kirk green,a specialist in orthopedic surgery.br.of appellant at.as we have observed,the opinion of a consulting physician who examines a claimant once does not generally constitute substantial evidence.kelley callahan,cir.nonetheless,there are two exceptions to this general rule.cantrell apfel,cir.specifically,we will uphold the alj decision to credit a consultant and discount a treating physician opinion where the medical assessments are supported by better or more thorough medical evidence,or where a treating physician renders inconsistent opinions that undermine the credibility of such opinions.id.internal citations and quotations omitted.
here,the alj gave little weight to garber opinion because of its internal inconsistencies.ssa decision at.in support of this conclusion,the alj noted that garber statement concerning anderson need to take a break every minutes was inconsistent with his statement that anderson had an unimpaired ability to walk.see residual functional capacity questionnaire from garber at undated record at.in addition,the alj did not credit garber opinion because garber stated anderson had physical impairments but failed to note any limitations regarding anderson ability to lift and carry and to stand and walk.see id.record at.finally,the alj stated that garber modified his answers concerning anderson restrictions after a discussion with anderson attorney.ssa decision at.anderson disputes these findings.he contends that there was nothing inconsistent about garber statement that he had an unimpaired ability to walk because that opinion was unrelated to anderson need to take minute breaks.in addition,anderson disputes the alj finding that garber altered his opinion at the request of anderson counsel,claiming that garber merely provided a correction letter concerning his earlier assessment of no limitation on anderson ability to lift and carry.see letter from garber to richard sturgeon at the carter law firm,record at.notably,garber also provided no explanation for his assessment that anderson,in addition to needing to take minute breaks,would need to be absent more than three times per month.see at.record at.
based on our review of the record,we conclude that the alj properly credited brokke opinion over garber assessment of anderson.after examining anderson at the request of iowa disability determination services bureau,brokke opined that anderson was limited to lifting twenty pounds,that he could lift ten pounds repetitively,and that anderson was not limited in standing,moving,walking,or sitting in an work day.letter from brokke to jill hunt,record at.while brokke did not have the same treating relationship that garber had with anderson,his opinion was not tainted with the apparent inconsistencies of garber assessment.see cruze chater,cir noting alj did not err in failing to credit treating physician opinion because those opinions were inconsistent and not fully supported by medical evidence 
anderson also argues that the alj improperly discounted the opinions of green and robert jones.beginning in may,green began to treat anderson for pain in his right shoulder.the treatment culminated in february when anderson chose not to receive further treatment for his shoulder pain and when green concluded that anderson had reached maximum medical improvement.see report of green,record at.green noted that anderson sustained a permanent impairment to his right shoulder,see,and that he was limited to lifting ten pounds or less with his right arm.see ssa decision at.in june,jones,a neurological surgeon,gave a similar assessment of anderson condition.see independent medical evaluation of jones june,record at.in her decision,the alj credited brokke opinion over green because it was rendered at a later point in time,when anderson had more fully recovered,and considered not only the shoulder injury,but the back problems of anderson.ssa decision at.leaving aside the merits of this conclusion,we think it is ultimately of no consequence because the opinions of brokke and anderson treating physicians are not inconsistent concerning anderson ability to lift and carry.brokke assessment was that anderson was limited to lifting twenty pounds.jones and green both stated that anderson was limited to lifting ten pounds with his right arm.we agree with the appellee that anderson ability to lift ten pounds with his right arm is not inconsistent with the alj finding that anderson has the residual functional capacity to lift twenty pounds occasionally.see ssa decision at.consistent with this view,the alj specifically found that anderson could do no overhead work with his right arm.id.moreover,contrary to anderson claim,nowhere in her opinion does the alj state that anderson had recovered.see br.of appellant at.in short,we conclude the alj properly evaluated the various medical opinions in this case.
anderson next argues that the alj improperly evaluated the credibility of his subjective complaints of pain and functional limitations.specifically,he contends the alj discounted his obesity as a medically determinable impairment and his symptoms of pain and fatigue.here,the alj was required to consider all the evidence relating to anderson subjective complaints including evidence presented by third parties that relates to anderson daily activities the duration,frequency,and intensity of his pain precipitating and aggravating factors dosage,effectiveness,and side effects of his medication and functional restrictions.see polaski heckler,cir.while an alj may not discount a claimant subjective complaints solely because the medical evidence fails to support them,an alj may discount those complaints where inconsistencies appear in the record as a whole.id.as we recently observed,our touchstone is that a claimant credibility is primarily a matter for the alj to decide.edwards,at.
with this in mind,we turn to anderson claim that the alj failed to consider his morbid obesity as an impairment.this claim is without merit.although the alj noted anderson obesity in its decision,ssa decision at,anderson never alleged any limitation in function as a result of his obesity in his application for benefits or during the hearing.accordingly,this claim was waived from being raised on appeal.see pena chater,cir noting that the alj is under no obligation to investigate a claim not presented at the time of the application for benefits and not offered at the hearing as a basis for disability quoting brockman sullivan,cir.
anderson other contention that the alj improperly discounted his subjective claims of pain and fatigue is similarly of no avail.in support of this argument,anderson contends the alj improperly evaluated his use of narcotic pain medications,improperly stated that he was manipulative in trying to convince richard martin,a psychologist,that he was experiencing physical pain,and erroneously found that he was attending school.br.of appellant at.the alj credibility determinations did not rest on these findings alone and included determinations that anderson was capable of performing significant daily activities and that his allegations of pain were inconsistent with other medical evidence in the record.because the alj findings are well supported in the record,we see no reason to disturb the alj credibility findings that anderson challenges.
for instance,the record supports the alj finding concerning anderson possible overuse of narcotic pain medications.martin noted that there is a significant possibility of problems with substance abuse and anderson extensive present use of prescribed pain medications.evaluation of richard martin at,record at.while we appreciate anderson need for prescribed medications to treat the severe pain caused by his shoulder impairment,we do not think that undercuts the alj finding on anderson overuse of medications.see ssa decision at.a claimant misuse of medications is a valid factor in an alj credibility determinations.see anderson shalala,cir observing that claimant behavior further discredits her allegations of disabling pain.relatedly,we find nothing improper in the alj reference to martin observation that anderson was somewhat manipulative in his efforts to convince him of his pain.see evaluation at record at.as a treating psychologist,martin was within his field of expertise in making such an observation,and the alj properly considered this evidence in making a credibility determination.see jones callahan,cir noting that alj may consider evidence that a claimant has exaggerated his symptoms when evaluating claimant subjective complaints of pain.finally,we do not think the alj credibility determination hinged on whether anderson was attending school during the relevant period of his disability even if,as he maintains,he was only taking correspondence courses.based on the record as a whole,we conclude the alj determination that anderson complaints of pain were not fully credible is supported by substantial evidence.
for the reasons stated,we hold that the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record,and we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
i respectfully dissent.the alj in this case failed to adequately consider the medical opinion of paul anderson treating doctor improperly ignored anderson undisputed account of his own pain and abilities and,as a result,posed the wrong question to the vocational expert regarding anderson future in the competitive job market.for these reasons,i would reverse and remand to the commissioner.
paul anderson,a dominant person,injured his right shoulder at his place of employment in march of.he required surgery on august,and has been unable to obtain steady work since his injury.he has been diagnosed with severe degenerative disc disease and an impaired right shoulder.no one disputes the existence of anderson injury the alj,however,concluded that despite his injury,anderson can find other work in a full time competitive economy.
in making this determination,the alj improperly disregarded the opinion of anderson treating physician,garber.she discounted garber residual functional capacity questionnaire because of perceived internal inconsistencies in his report.most of the inconsistencies the alj describes,however,are not inconsistencies at all,but rather lingering questions she had about the medical reasons for anderson limitations.the alj contends that there are several points in the report where garber indicated a restriction on anderson ability to work,but did not provide an explanation for the restriction.garber answered each question on the residual functional capacity questionnaire as it was framed.he indicated that anderson would need to take a break every minutes and would need frequent rests on the job.the alj takes issue with this assessment because garber did not explain why such breaks would be necessary,but the undisputed record reflects that there is no space on the form to provide such an explanation.rather than summarily dismissing garber assessment for this reason,the alj should have contacted garber to obtain further explanation.see cox apfel,cir noting that an alj has an independent duty to fully and fairly develop the facts of the case.just because the alj determined garber assessment was incomplete,does not mean the doctor assessment was inconsistent.
it is clear on the record as it stands that anderson would need to take frequent breaks on a job due to his sh
