attorney tom foulds appeals the district court denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction and for an equitable lien for attorney fees,which he based on the common fund doctrine.foulds had brought an administrative petition before the department of labor dol and the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh on behalf of several individuals of a purported class of roughly.foulds sought respective lump sum payments under the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act,which entitles certain department of energy doe workers to compensation for illnesses suffered due to their exposure to radiation and other toxic substances while working at doe facilities.niosh denied the administrative petition and foulds subsequently filed a petition for review in the district court.while the district court action was pending,the government vacated the denials of the administrative claims and subsequently authorized the award of benefits to qualifying claimants.before the dispersal of the funds,foulds filed the motions at issue seeking to collect a percentage fee from each lump sum payment to be made.
the district court denied the motions on the grounds that the united states government had not waived its sovereign immunity and that,even if it had,the district court could not fashion a common fund attorney fee award because it lacked control over the government funds at issue.we affirm the district court decision on the ground that the government has not waived its sovereign immunity.as a result,we do not address whether the common fund doctrine is applicable in this case.
in,congress passed the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act,eeoicpa,which established a program to compensate individuals with illnesses,cancer,beryllium poisoning attributable to their exposure to radiation and other toxic substances,beryllium,silica while working for doe.see,hayward dep t of labor,cir per curiam under part b of eeoicpa,covered employees or their eligible survivors may receive compensation in a lump sum payment of plus medical benefits for covered individuals see generally id.
in most exposure cases,an individual or survivor must file a claim with the dol office of workers compensation programs owcp,which forwards the claim package to niosh for a reconstruction or estimation of the amount of radiation exposure during employment,dose reconstruction.see.after niosh completes a dose reconstruction,owcp resumes adjudicative authority over the claim for a final causation determination.b see also stating causation standards.
certain employees with specified cancers,however,are members of a special exposure cohort cohort for whom eeoicpa provides a statutory presumption of causation.see.the president,on advice of the advisory board on radiation and worker health board,may designate new classes of workers for addition to the cohort.these additions cover classes of doe employees for whom it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose that the class received and where there is a reasonable likelihood that such radiation dose may have endangered the health of members of the class.b see exec.order,delegating president authority to the secretary of hhs.
an individual may also petition to add a class of employees to the cohort by submitting a petition to niosh,which evaluates the petition and presents findings to the board.the board then makes a recommendation to the secretary of hhs regarding designation of the new class as part of the cohort.id.if the secretary of hhs designates the new class,he will transmit a report to congress defining the new covered class.id.this designation takes effect days after submission of the report unless congress expedites or reverses the designation.id.c.a claimant may seek administrative review of a final decision denying a petition for addition to the cohort.id.
eeoicpa limits the attorney fees recoverable for assisting a claimant in recovering a part b payment to a percentage of the payment received either percent for the filing of an initial claim for payment of compensation or percent with respect to objections to a recommended decision denying payment of compensation.a b.

while the review petition was pending in the district court,owcp director of energy employees occupational illness compensation vacated all of the final decisions that denied the plaintiffs respective administrative claims.on the government motion,the district court stayed each claim pending the issuance of new final decisions on each administrative claim.subsequently,the secretary of hhs designated the proposed class of du pont workers as part of the cohort,effective october,see.the parties estimate that this class covers approximately to workers survivors.
foulds thereafter filed a motion in the district court for a preliminary injunction to prevent dol from distributing funds for payment of any eeocipa lump sum payments to the new members of the cohort and an equitable lien for attorney fees on every dol payment,under a common fund theory,related to his work on the administrative petition the district court denied both motions.it held that foulds claims for attorney fees based on the common fund doctrine failed because a sovereign immunity,which the government had not waived,bars creditors from enforcing a lien on government property and b the common fund doctrine did not apply to the legislative actions that added the claimants to the cohort,as opposed to judicial actions,because the district court did not have control over the funds at issue,a prerequisite to application of the common fund doctrine.foulds filed a timely notice of appeal.
