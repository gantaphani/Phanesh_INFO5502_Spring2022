healthcare employees union local the union petitions this court to review a final order of the national labor relations board the board or nlrb.the board order dismissed the union unfair labor practice charge against vincent medical center.
in its unfair labor practice charge,the union alleged that vincent subcontracted out the work of the hospital respiratory care department on the eve of a union election to prevent employees in that department from voting in the election,in violation of sections a and a of the national labor relations act nlra,a,a.
after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj ruled that the union failed to carry its burden of persuasion that animus was a motivating factor in vincent subcontracting decision and dismissed the complaint.that ruling was affirmed by the board.in addition,the board ruled that even if the union had carried its burden of persuasion,vincent demonstrated that it would have subcontracted out the work of the department in the absence of union organizing activity.
we have jurisdiction under f.for the reasons stated below,we grant the union petition for review and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
vincent medical center is an acute care hospital located in los angeles,california.before subcontracting out the work of the respiratory care rc department in february,vincent employed respiratory care therapists.rc therapists are responsible for administering respiratory care treatment,administering intubations,ventilators,or life support systems throughout the hospital.in addition to providing respiratory care treatment,rc therapists are responsible for assessing each patient health and reporting each patient status to shift employees and doctors.
management problems in the respiratory care department 
vincent contends that it outsourced the work of its rc department in february because it was unable to find and train suitable managers.vincent difficulty with management of the rc department had existed for a long time before the work of that department was actually subcontracted out.in fact,while the rc department problems became more evident in the three years before the outsourcing decision,the hospital had comparable problems with its rc department for nearly thirteen years.
despite the replacement of the rc department manager in early,the department productivity standards continued to remain lower than those of other departments.several rc employees testified that during they encountered problems that hindered them from accomplishing their assigned tasks.during that time they complained regularly to management about a lack of proper billing codes,lack of proper respiratory equipment,and general staffing problems.
the ongoing problems in the rc department did not go unnoticed by management in the summer and fall of ray hancock and ramon suarez,both rc department managers,met regularly with zita uy,assistant administrator for the rc department,to discuss the problems in the rc department.
b.the union campaign 
the union began its campaign to organize the hospital technical staff in july,when it assigned between three and four organizers to vincent union organizers,easily identified by their distinctive,spoke openly to employees at the hospital and passed out fliers several times a week.in early july,the union picketed in front of the hospital as hospital managers stood by watching union organizers also stationed themselves in the hospital cafeteria between ten and twenty times a month and spoke to employees about the union.as the campaign progressed,union organizers made regular home visits to hospital staff to discuss the benefits of joining the union.the union efforts proved successful,as the alj found that most of the union success in securing union authorization cards from employees occurred after 
the alj concluded that vincent admittedly made a studied effort to keep track of the union.mary hill,director of human resources for the hospital,testified that she asked her supervisors and managers to let her know of any union activity,whether that be leafletting or if employees are informing them of home visits,presence in the cafeteria,that sort of thing.several rc department managers and one union organizer testified about their open encounters with each other in and around the hospital another rc employee testified that during a meeting in,hancock,an rc department manager,stated that the union only wanted money from the rc employees 
the rc department,which made up percent of the technical staff at the hospital,overwhelmingly supported the union.the alj found that 
vincent could not have failed to have identified the rc employees as the core of the union supporters among the hospital employees,and that vincent may well have deduced,and probably did deduce,from such intelligence that the rc employees were the most likely proselytes of the union cause in other departments.
a lead organizer for the union,roberto de la cruz,testified that the rc department was one of the strongest units and that rc employees were instrumental in pushing the organizing drive.de la cruz testified that the rc employees comprised a majority of the organizing committee,which helped the union staff strategize as to how to proceed in the campaign and identify other workers.between nine and twelve rc employees were openly.they discussed the union with at work,openly talked to union organizers,and passed out fliers in front of the hospital.de la cruz testified that union organizers held the rc department out to other departments in the technical staff as a strong department.about percent of the rc employees ultimately signed union authorization cards.
in a flier dated november,and distributed throughout the hospital technical staff,the union announced that it was a few weeks away from filing an election petition with the board.the flier also announced that once the election petition was filed,the board would set an election within to sixty days 
on january,the union filed a petition for an election with the board for the bargaining unit of technical staff employees,which included the rc therapists.on january,the parties stipulated to an election to be conducted by the board on february.
subcontracting discussions 
in july,the same month that the union began its campaign to organize the technical staff,uy met with eleanor ramirez,the senior assistant administrator in charge of patient services.during that meeting uy and ramirez first discussed subcontracting out the work of the rc department.uy testified that she and ramirez briefly discussed the successful use of subcontracting to alleviate quality issues in other departments at vincent.she further testified that she and ramirez agreed to reassess the situation later on that year.they did not,however,speak to bill parente,the hospital president,or other vincent managers about subcontracting out the work of the rc department.
on november,eight days after the union announced it was close to filing an election petition with the board,uy met with rc department managers suarez and hancock to discuss the rc department.at that meeting,both hancock and suarez raised the option of subcontracting out the work of the rc department.suarez stated that he was unable to manage the department.he also stated that both he and hancock agreed that someone more experienced would be a better department manager.the next day,ramirez authorized uy to investigate potential subcontracting vendors.
on december,uy and ramirez met again to discuss subcontracting uy testified that she and ramirez recognized that subcontracting would be very expensive and financially infeasible.but she testified that neither she nor ramirez wanted to simply change managers.uy stated that she had tried unsuccessfully to replace managers before and wanted to try a different approach.both uy and ramirez testified that they believed one of the primary benefits to outsourcing was that the burden of finding good managers for the department would fall on the subcontractor,not on vincent.while ramirez testified that she knew that the rc employees would be disenfranchised by outsourcing the work of the department,she also testified that this was not what she would call a big player role in our discussions.
on december,uy,ramirez,hill,and parente met by phone to discuss subcontracting.uy testified that no one mentioned the union during the conversation.parente,the ultimate decision maker,approved moving forward with finding a subcontractor.
five days later,uy announced to rc employees management intent to investigate outsourcing the work of the rc department.uy told employees that it would take between thirty and sixty days to investigate possible subcontractors.according to uy,she explained to the rc employees that the decision was a business decision motivated by concerns about quality issues and the various complaints received concerning the department.
implementing and february 
on or around january,uy contacted total rehab care and interstate rehab care and solicited proposals for taking over the rc department.uy stated that the successful bidder must provide an experienced respiratory manager and agree to hire all current employees at similar wages and benefits.theodore weiner,the president and ceo of total rehab care,testified that his company was too small to handle a subcontracting arrangement involving employees before february,the date required by vincent.february,was three days before the scheduled union election.
the two companies ultimately contacted each other and submitted a combined proposal,which vincent received on january.the proposal was submitted under the name of california respiratory services,a subsidiary of interstate rehab care.under the proposal,weiner would work for total rehab care,which contracted with california respiratory services to provide management services.though the proposal was open until march,vincent agreed to the proposal on or about january,same day it was received.
on february,about three weeks after the union filed its election petition with the board,vincent management informed the rc department of the outsourcing decision.ramirez announced that california respiratory services would take over the rc department,and that,effective february,california respiratory services would directly employ the rc employees.
parente,the hospital president,testified that he did not decide to subcontract the work of the rc department to prevent the rc therapists from voting in the upcoming union election.he did admit,however,that he was aware of the union election scheduled for february,when he made his final decision to subcontract a little over two weeks earlier.when pressed by the alj to explain the timing of the subcontracting decision,parente responded that it was not precipitated by any emergency in patient care rather,parente explained that it was a reasonable management decision within our prerogative at the time and we made the decision and that there was a strong possibility that a serious error could occur in a treatment of a patient.
parente further testified that he did not want to outsource the work of rc department managers while continuing to directly employ rc therapists.he explained that such an arrangement would create a divided accountability problem.parente stated that in his opinion,the rc employees and the manager of the rc department belong in the same organization.he also explained that the subcontracting arrangement in another department of the hospital was a workable model that would have achieved vincent goals.contrary to parente goal of preventing divided accountability,weiner,the new rc manager,and the rc employees were not employed by the same employer because the rc employees worked directly for california respiratory services while weiner and the department managers worked for total rehab care.this arrangement clearly resulted in divided accountability because the rc therapists were accountable to california respiratory services while the managers were accountable to total rehab care.
the alj found that a fter the subcontracting took effect,the same employees continued to do largely the same work in the same place,and that the same supervisors were also hired by the subcontractor.nevertheless,weiner testified that the rc department improved somewhat after the subcontracting.fewer physicians complained about rc department services and some hospital staff members even commented on the improvement of the rc department.
e.the present unfair labor practice charges and the nlrb decision 
on february,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against vincent.the union charged that vincent subcontracted out the work of the rc department to prevent rc department employees from voting in the union election,in violation of sections a and a of the nlra.
on march,the board general counsel issued a complaint against vincent and a notice of hearing.in its answer to the complaint,vincent denied the allegations and alleged as an affirmative defense that its subcontracting decision was based on valid business reasons unrelated to the union organizing activities of the rc department.
the matter was heard before an alj.see vincent med,nlrb,wl.the alj analyzed the general counsel case under wright line,enforced,cir,cert.denied,d.the alj credited the general counsel clear evidence that vincent knew that the rc department was the core of the union organizing drive,and that the union organizing campaign burgeoned in july.the alj also concluded that the timing of the terminations militated in favor of the general counsel case 
announcing the change in the status of the employees,and subcontracting out their work,only about weeks after the filing of the petition for an election seems on its face so suspicious that if there were any evidence of animus or direct intent to discriminate that one would not hesitate to find the subcontracting to have been violative of the nlra 
in further support of the general counsel case,the alj found that the alleged motivation behind vincent subcontracting decision seem ed to lack plausibility and noted the seeming lack of a clear rationale for the way in which the subcontracting decision was carried out.the alj noted that vincent asserted business justification was almost too much to believe and that o n its surface it appear ed to be a fabrication,and not a very good one at that.
notwithstanding these findings,the alj found that there was no reason to ignore or disbelieve the testimony of vincent witnesses to the effect that since the subcontracting the problems have largely vanished.after crediting vincent on this point,the alj concluded that the general counsel failed to carry its burden of persuasion under wright line.the alj stated that no matter how improbable vincent action,or its timing,in subcontracting may seem on the surface,there is no reasonable basis on this record causing me to doubt or challenge the very fact of its success in,at long last,remedying the rc department longstanding,seemingly intractable,problems.after finding that changing managers is a time honored and frequently used solution to management problems,the alj concluded,no matter how reluctantly,that vincent decision passe d muster.
the union and the general counsel appealed the alj decision to the board.in its brief boilerplate decision,the board affirmed the alj rulings and findings.furthermore,the board concluded that 
a ssuming arguendo that the general counsel satisfied his initial burden under wright line,we find that vincent has proven its affirmative defense under wright line of demonstrating that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the employees protected activities.specifically,vincent has established that it implemented its subcontracting decision within the day it announced prior to the filing of the petition for a representation election.
vincent med,wl,at internal citation omitted.
the union filed this petition for review pursuant to section f of the nlra,f.the union challenges both the board conclusion that the general counsel failed to carry its burden of persuasion,and its conclusion that vincent established its affirmative defense under wright line.the union argues that neither conclusion is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.
standard of review 
courts of appeals may overturn board decisions only if the board findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence,or if the board has incorrectly applied the law.cal.pac.med.ctr.nlrb,cir see also nlrb nevis,cir the board findings must be enforced if supported by substantial evidence,even if this court might reach a different conclusion based on the same evidence.however,t he substantial evidence test requires a analysis and a review of the whole record,cal.pac.med,at,and requires a reviewing court to take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the board conclusions,universal camera nlrb.
similarly,while we should be mindful that the determination of motive is particularly within the purview of the nlrb,lippincott,nlrb,cir,we may set aside the board determination of motive if we find that it is not supported by substantial evidence,dash nlrb,cir.
section a of the nlra prohibits an employer from discriminating against employees in regard to hire or tenure of employment to discourage membership in any labor organization.a.
subcontracting decisions are not immune from the reach of the nlra.thus,it is that an employer violates section a of the nlra where it close s a part of its operations,discharge s the employees involved,and subcontract s the work for purposes.great chinese am.sewing nlrb,cir see also textile workers union of am.darlington,d reno hilton resorts nlrb,nlrb joy recovery tech,cir.
in a section a case such as this,the board uses the scheme set forth in wright line to determine whether an employer was motivated by animus.see at nlrb transp.mgmt,d upholding wright line burden shifting scheme under the nlra,overruled on other grounds by office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,d see also dash,at.under wright line,the board requires that 
the general counsel make a prima facie showing sufficient to support the inference that protected conduct was a motivating factor in the employer decision.once this is established,the burden will shift to the employer to demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of protected conduct.
at.while the general counsel retains the ultimate burden of persuasion,once the general counsel establishes that animus was a motivating factor,the employer bears the burden of establishing any affirmative defense such as the inevitability of termination.schaeff nlrb.
a.the general counsel case 
the union challenges the board conclusion that the general counsel failed to present sufficient evidence of animus to sustain its burden of persuasion.an employer will seldom admit that it was motivated by animus when it made its adverse employment decision.see shattuck denn mining nlrb,cir actual motive,a state of mind,being the question,it is seldom that direct evidence will be available that is not also.for that reason,circumstantial evidence is sufficient to establish motive.see new breed leasing nlrb,cir see also folkins nlrb,cir per curiam.
motive is a question of fact,and the nlrb may rely on both direct and circumstantial evidence to establish an employer motive,considering such factors as the employer knowledge of the employee union activities,the employer hostility toward the union,and the timing of the employer action.power,nlrb,see also waste,nlrb,cir to determine motive,the board may rely on indirect evidence and inferences reasonably drawn from the totality of the circumstances.
evidence of vincent motive 
after carefully reviewing the record as a whole,we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the board finding that the general counsel failed to show that animus was a motivating factor in vincent decision to subcontract out the rc department.as discussed below,in the face of strong circumstantial evidence of animus,the alj improperly credited evidence of improvements in the rc department as a basis for dismissing the general counsel case.
circumstantial evidence of animus is compelling in this case.first,there is ample evidence that vincent knew about the union activity in the hospital in general,and in the rc department in particular.the head of human resources for the hospital specifically directed hospital managers to monitor all union activity.several rc department managers also testified that they identified themselves to union organizers on various occasions during the second half of and asked to see union fliers.finally,several hospital managers,including the hospital president,testified that they were aware of the impending union election when the subcontracting decision was made.the testimony of vincent managers regarding their awareness of the union campaign is consistent with the clear evidence that the union was openly and actively soliciting support in the hospital throughout the second half of.
second,the inference of animus raised by the timing of vincent decision to subcontract is stunningly obvious.see nlrb rubin,cir.as the alj found,f rom vincent standpoint the timing of the action could scarcely be imagined as worse.
vincent subcontracted out the department on february,less than a month after the union filed its petition for an election with the board,and less than two weeks before the scheduled election.the effect of vincent decision to outsource operation of the rc department,of course,was the disenfranchisement of percent of the employees percent of whom had already expressed their desire to join the union who were otherwise eligible to vote in the representation election.
courts have consistently treated an employer adverse employment action occurring between the filing of a petition for a representation election with the board and the ensuing election as raising a powerful inference of animus.see,waste,at t he probative value of the timing of the company an employee in the critical interval between the time that the union filed its petition for recognition and the planned representation obvious.joy recovery tech,at concluding that i n this case,timing is everything,where t he closing of the department comes on the heels of the union organizational activity,including filing a petition for a representation election power,at the timing of the layoff,just two weeks before the scheduled union election,gives further credence to the charge of animus.nlrb,cir concluding that t he timing of the layoffs and warehouse closing provides the strongest support for connecting sentiment with the layoffs,where the layoffs and warehouse closing closely followed a demand for union recognition.because vincent subcontracted out its entire rc department less than two weeks before the scheduled union election,the timing of its decision raises an unmistakable inference of animus.
the timing of the decision to subcontract out the work of the rc department is also suspicious because the management problems in the rc department existed for more than a decade before vincent decided to subcontract out the work of the department.see reno hilton resorts,at concluding that t he timing of the decision to contract out is suspect where it came on the heels of heavy union activity and the employer knew of the purported rationale for its subcontracting decision long before it implemented that decision see also joy recovery tech,at concluding that the timing of the employer subcontracting decision based on financial concerns was suspicious where it came on the heels of the union organizational activity and employer had maintained the department unprofitably for a significant period of time.even in,only a few months before the union announced that it was close to seeking a representation election,the alj found that vincent was in no hurry to remedy the rc department management problems.indeed,parente testified that the decision to subcontract was not caused by an emergency in patient care in the rc department.thus,there was no obvious precipitating event for the subcontracting decision other than the looming union election.in essence,vincent appears to have tolerated its management problems up until the very moment that the union sought to represent the technical staff at the hospital.
the board attempts to diminish the strong inference of animus raised by the timing of vincent actions.it notes that vincent managers mentioned subcontracting out the work of the rc department in a july meeting,months before the union election was scheduled even so,this is the same month that the union began its organizing drive at the hospital,thereby creating the inference that union activity triggered the subcontracting discussion.as discussed earlier,it is undisputed that vincent managers were aware of the union activities and that those activities were markedly heightened in july.thus,the mere fact that vincent managers mentioned subcontracting in july does little to defeat the inference of animus.moreover,the issue was not brought up again until november,eight days after the union circulated its november,flier announcing the imminent union election.this sequence of events strengthens,rather than diminishes,the inference of animus.
after making substantial findings in support of the general counsel,the alj focused part of his analysis on the testimony of vincent witnesses establishing that after the subcontracting took effect,productivity in the rc department generally improved.having credited this testimony,the alj concluded that the general counsel failed to carry its burden of persuasion under wright line.
whether an employer decision was ultimately good or bad,however,has no relevance in a section a case such as this,where the critical issue is the employer motive.in determining whether an employment decision violates section a,the crucial factor is not whether the business reasons cited by the employer were good or bad,but whether they were honestly invoked and were,in fact,the cause of the change.nlrb savoy laundry,cir.the alj therefore erred in relying on evidence of the rc department improved conditions to conclude that vincent was not motivated by animus in its decision to subcontract out the department.
in short,the highly suspect timing of vincent decision to subcontract out the rc department,when coupled with vincent knowledge of union activity,strongly favored the general counsel case.contrary to the alj,we conclude that the probative value of this evidence is not diminished in any way by the evidence of improved conditions in the rc department after the subcontracting took effect.
however,we turn to the remaining evidence in the record to determine whether the board conclusions were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.
evidence of pretext 
the alj found that vincent reasons for proceeding as it did seem ed to lack plausibility and that there was a seeming lack of a clear rationale for the way in which subcontracting was carried out.furthermore,the alj found that vincent asserted reason for subcontracting o n its surface appear ed to be a fabrication,and not a very good one at that.
these findings,which we may weigh along with other evidence opposing the board ruling,further undermine the board conclusion that animus was not a motivating factor in the subcontracting decision.see dash,at see also nlrb searle auto glass,cir.where the employer asserted justification is shifting and unreliable,its case is weakened,and the conclusion that the true reason was for union activity is correspondingly strengthened.nevis,at see also nlrb dillon stores,cir a flimsy or unsupported explanation may affirmatively suggest that the employer has seized upon a pretext to mask an motivation.
vincent asserted that it subcontracted out the work of its rc department to remedy longstanding management problems.as both uy and ramirez testified,they wanted to subcontract out the work of the department to rid themselves of the burden of finding reliable managers.they wanted that burden to fall on an independent contractor.nevertheless,ramirez,hancock,and weiner each testified that subcontracting out the work of the rc therapists was not needed to achieve this result.ramirez testified that t he transfer of the employees had nothing to do with california respiratory services getting us a new manager.weiner also testified that he could have achieved the same results in the rc department without requiring california respiratory services to employ the rc employees directly.hancock,too,testified that he was not aware of any reason requiring vincent to outsource the rc employees in order to get a new manager for the department.as each of these witnesses explained,they were unaware of any reason why subcontracting out the rc therapists would ameliorate the rc department longstanding management problems.thus,even if there was such a reason,the management of the rc department failed to proffer one.
several of vincent witnesses testified that subcontracting out other departments in the hospital had proved successful in the past.on appeal,the board contends that this evidence of past practice helps to defeat any inference of animus.nonetheless,vincent failed to demonstrate why those departments were subcontracted,other than vague assertions about quality issues.without evidence that the past subcontracting decisions were prompted by the same type of management concerns faced by the rc department,there is no basis to conclude that vincent acted consistently with past practice when it outsourced the work of its rc department.
as explained earlier,parente,the hospital president,testified that outsourcing the rc management while continuing to directly employ the rc employees would create a divided accountability problem.but the divided accountability problem was not alleviated by the ultimate subcontracting arrangement.contrary to parente justification,rc department managers and employees were not directly employed by the same employer.total rehab care,weiner company,hired all the former vincent managers.it then contracted with california respiratory services to provide management services to the rc department.the rc therapists,on the other hand,worked directly for california respiratory services.this arrangement did not place the rc therapists and the rc department managers in the same organization.actually,the rc department arrangement would have been identical had vincent simply contracted out its management services to total rehab care.in either case,rc managers and the rc therapists would not have been employed directly by the same employer.because the divided accountability problem was not addressed by the subcontracting arrangement,parente testimony on this point raises the inference that this reason was really a pretext for animus.
conclusion 
we conclude that substantial evidence in the record as a whole does not support the board ruling that the general counsel failed to meet its burden of persuasion under wright line.we reach this conclusion because the general counsel presented unrebutted evidence concerning vincent knowledge of union activity,the timing of vincent decision to subcontract raised a compelling inference of animus,the alj mistakenly relied on evidence to establish the cause of the subcontracting decision,and vincent business justification was unreliable,therefore raising the inference that its justification was merely a pretext for animus.
we therefore examine vincent affirmative defense to determine if the board ultimate decision in favor of vincent is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.
