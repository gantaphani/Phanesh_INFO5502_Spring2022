there is no dispute that minors,like adult women,have a constitutional right to an abortion that may not be blocked by significant obstacles from the state.nor is there any doubt that the state has an important interest in the welfare of its children that justifies regulation of the abortion of minors that would not be upheld if applied to adult women.
this case is merely the latest in a string of facial challenges to one such regulation,the illinois parental notice of abortion act of.because we believe that this iteration of the notice statute,and the illinois supreme court rule adopted to implement it,respect the supreme court precedent regarding parental involvement laws,we uphold the illinois notice act as constitutional on its face.
the question presented here is a narrow one whether the illinois parental notice of abortion act of,ilcs et,is facially invalid because its judicial bypass provisions lack language authorizing a state court judge to issue an order allowing an immature minor to consent to an abortion without notifying her parents,where an abortion without notice would be in her best interests.this question requires unpacking.we start with the language of the statute.
the relevant sections of the notice act are set forth in full in the appendix.the act requires the physician or his or her agent to provide at least hours actual notice to an adult family member of the pregnant minor or incompetent person of his or her intention to perform the abortion,unless the physician or agent has received a certified written statement from a referring physician that such notice has been provided,or notice is not possible after reasonable effort,in which case hours constructive notice defined as notice by certified mail to the last known address of the person entitled to notice is sufficient.
the act provides that parental notice shall be waived in a number of circumstances,including,as relevant here,if the minor participates in a judicial bypass procedure as outlined in of the act to obtain a waiver of the notice requirement.a woman seeking a judicial bypass from notice may petition any circuit court for a waiver of the notice requirement and may participate in proceedings on her own behalf.b.in addition,the bypass court is required to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor,to advise her that she has a right to counsel and to provide her with counsel upon her request.id.court proceedings under the act shall be confidential and shall ensure the anonymity of the minor.c.the minor shall have the right to file her petition using a pseudonym or using solely her initials.id.the act further provides that judicial bypass proceedings shall be given precedence over other pending matters to the extent necessary to ensure that the court reaches a decision promptly.id.the court shall rule and shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law within hours of the time the petition is filed,unless the minor requests additional time.id.if the court fails to rule within the period,the petition shall be deemed to have been granted and the notice requirement shall be waived.id.
the heart of the act bypass procedure is d,which provides 
notice shall be waived if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence either 
that the minor or incompetent person is sufficiently mature and well enough informed to decide intelligently whether to have an abortion,or 
that notification under section of this act would not be in the best interests of the minor or incompetent person.
the judicial bypass court shall issue written and specific factual findings and legal conclusions supporting its decision and shall order that a confidential record of the evidence and the judge findings and conclusions be maintained.e.the act requires that an expedited confidential appeal be available,as the illinois supreme court provides by rule,to any minor to whom the circuit court has denied a waiver of notice.f.however,a n order authorizing an abortion without notice shall not be subject to appeal.id.finally,the act respectfully request s the illinois supreme court to promulgate any rules and regulations necessary to ensure that proceedings under the act be handled in an expeditious and confidential matter.g.
a physician who violates the notice act is to be referred to the illinois state medical disciplinary board,ilcs a which may recommend suspension or revocation of the physician medical license,ilcs a,or imposition of civil penalties of up to per violation,ilcs c.
the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the district court in,claiming that an earlier iteration of the notice act,the parental notice of abortion act of,was constitutionally deficient on its face.the district court certified a plaintiff class of physicians and a defendant class of state attorneys but ultimately held that the act was unconstitutional because it failed to ensure a minor anonymity or to provide for an expedited appeal.zbaraz hartigan.we affirmed and continued the injunction so that the illinois supreme court could promulgate rules implementing the act judicial bypass procedure in a way that would ensure expedited appeals and anonymity.zbaraz hartigan,cir.the illinois supreme court later promulgated such a rule,but the district court held that it was insufficient and continued the permanent injunction.zbaraz hartigan.the illinois general assembly then repealed the act and replaced it with the act now before us.
on or about june,the plaintiffs amended their complaint to challenge the constitutionality of the act.the parties agreed to an injunction barring enforcement of the act until the illinois supreme court promulgated new rules to implement the new act judicial bypass.then in february,the district court entered a permanent injunction because the illinois supreme court announced that it would not promulgate any such rules.the permanent injunction order expressly deferred the plaintiffs constitutional challenges until such time as the illinois supreme court promulgated rules.
ten years later,in september,the illinois supreme court adopted rule,entitled expedited and confidential proceedings under the parental notification of abortion act.rule purports to provide the necessary appeals procedures to implement the judicial bypass,as called for by g of the notice act.the rule,set forth in its entirety in the appendix,reiterates that the circuit court shall endeavor to rule at the close of any hearing,but must rule and issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law within hours of the time that the petition is filed,weekends and holidays excluded,except at the minor request for more time.the rule prescribes the content of a petition for appeal and supporting brief,and requires that they be filed within two days weekends and holidays again excluded of a circuit court decision denying relief,except that,again,the minor may request more time.after receiving the petition,brief and record on appeal,the appellate court has three work days to issue a confidential written order.rule g.the appellate court shall appoint counsel for the petitioner at her request,and all proceedings under the rule are to be confidential.rule d,f.the petitioner is to be identified in the petition and in any supporting brief only by her first name and last initial,or by initials only,or by pseudonym.all documents relating to the proceedings shall be sealed,and all notifications of court rulings under the rule may be informal and shall be confidential.rule f.
in light of rule,the defendants filed a motion to dissolve the permanent injunction under.b and.the district court denied that motion,as well as a renewed motion,and continued the permanent injunction.the district court found that even with rule,the notice act was unconstitutional because it lacked language authorizing bypass courts to issue orders allowing immature minors to consent to abortions without parental notice where an abortion without notice would be in their best interests.the district court explained 
the act authorizes the court to waive parental notification when it is in the best interest of the child,but does not authorize a method of consent for the abortion.thus,under the statute,a best interest minor who has waived parental notification is left without a mechanism to obtain consent for the abortion,and thus is in legal limbo.
zbaraz madigan,c,wl,at.though it is not explicit in the district court opinion,it is clear from the plaintiffs briefs below and on appeal that this conclusion is predicated on the following chain of argument a bypass court will necessarily consider a minor maturity first and only reach the best interests question if it concludes that a minor is too immature to make the abortion decision on her own.such a finding of immaturity will necessarily be included in the bypass court decision waiving parental notice because the bypass court is required to issue written and specific factual findings and legal conclusions supporting its decision.e.once a minor has been adjudicated to be immature,she will be unable to consent to an abortion on her own,because of illinois common law rule requiring informed consent to all medical procedures.according to the plaintiffs,an immature minor can not give informed consent.as will appear,we reject each tenet of this line of argument,as well as the district court holding that the bypass court lacks the authority to issue an order necessary to enforce its judgment that an abortion without parental notice is in a minor best interests.
the defendants brought this appeal.hours after the defendants filed their notice of appeal,illinois state attorneys edward deters and stewart umholtz,represented by the thomas more society pro life law center,filed in the district court a motion to intervene in the case and a motion to reconsider the judgment.the district court denied both motions,and the proposed intervenors filed a notice of appeal from that order and from the district court earlier order denying the defendants renewed motion to dissolve the permanent injunction.we consolidated the appeals of the defendants and the proposed intervenors.
the proposed intervenors argue that we lack jurisdiction over this case because of their timely filed motion to alter or amend the judgment under fed civ,which they argue suspended the defendants notice to appeal filed earlier on the same day.the proposed intervenors ignore the effect of fed.a b i,which provides 
if a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment but before it disposes of any motion listed in rule a a including rule motions the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order,in whole or in part,when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.
this rule means that the defendants notice of appeal,even if it was properly suspended pending the lower court disposition of the proposed intervenors rule motion,takes immediate effect upon that disposition and has transferred jurisdiction to us.
in any event,the district court properly ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the rule motion,because the proposed intervenors were not before the court when they filed it.rule requires that the person or entity filing the motion to alter the judgment be a party before the court.the proposed intervenors make two arguments that they are parties for rule purposes.both arguments fail.
first,they argue that they should have been allowed to intervene under.rule provides that a district court must allow a nonparty to intervene as of right upon the filing of a timely motion wherein the nonparty claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action,and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant ability to protect its interest,unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.rule a.the district court decision that the proposed intervenors motion to intervene was not timely is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.larson jpmorgan chase,cir.here,the proposed intervenors waited to file their motion to intervene until after the district court had denied two motions to reconsider the ruling continuing the permanent injunction,and until after the defendants had filed their notice of appeal,all of which occurred eleven months after the defendants filed their rule b motion,and nearly years after the initiation of the litigation.it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find that this filing was untimely.moreover,it would also have been proper to deny the motion to intervene because the existing parties adequately represent the interests of the proposed intervenors.the proposed intervenors are members of the defendant class of illinois state attorneys,and they do not argue that there are any factual or legal distinctions that make their interests in this case divergent from the interests of the named class representatives.the proposed intervenors raise the same objection to the district court denial of the defendants rule b motion and,in fact,they join in most of the defendants brief on appeal.we see no reason why illinois attorney general lisa madigan and cook county state attorney anita alvarez can not adequately represent the proposed intervenors interests.
second,the proposed intervenors argue that even if their motion to intervene is properly denied,they should be allowed to bring their rule motion without formal intervention as unnamed class members,citing devlin scardelletti,d holding that unnamed class members who are bound by the terms of a settlement and have objected to the settlement at a fairness hearing have a right to appeal the settlement without formal intervention.but again,the purpose of allowing nonparties to appeal without formal intervention under devlin is to grant those nonparties a forum to assert interests that diverge from those of the named class representative.see gautreaux chi.hous,cir devlin reflects a concern that,without an opportunity to appeal,unnamed class members will have no other recourse than to accept the terms of a settlement and to forfeit further pursuit of their claim.no such purpose would be vindicated here.again,the proposed intervenors have not raised divergent interests that only they can adequately represent.their interests,from all that appears,are in line with those of the illinois attorney general and the illinois state attorney.we therefore affirm the district court order denying the proposed intervenors motions.
this case comes to us from the district court denial of the defendants motion to dissolve the permanent injunction barring enforcement of the statute.federal rule of civil procedure b provides that the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding if the judgment has been satisfied,released or discharged it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable or any other reason that justifies relief.the district court denial of the rule b motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion to determine whether a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the judgment,rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d see united states krilich,cir,but the constitutional questions decided by that court are reviewed de novo,gonzalez,cir citations omitted.
the district court february,permanent injunction order,entered by judge plunkett,found that section of the notice act requested the illinois supreme court to promulgate appellate rules to ensure that judicial bypass proceedings under the act would be handled in an expeditious and competent manner.judge plunkett order reiterated findings made by judge will in support of the earlier preliminary injunction.in particular,judge plunkett reiterated judge will finding that the act was incomplete and could not be adjudicated or implemented until the illinois supreme court promulgated appellate rules.in the preliminary injunction order,judge will deferred any adjudication as to the constitutionality of the act until the illinois supreme court promulgated such rules.following judge will order,the illinois supreme court advised the district court,without explanation,that no additional rules will be promulgated under the act.judge plunkett therefore concluded that the act remains incomplete and can not be implemented,and he permanently enjoined the act.
it is clear from judge plunkett order that the permanent injunction was meant to be in place only until such time as the illinois supreme court promulgated appellate rules governing judicial bypass proceedings under the act.now that the illinois high court has adopted rule,it is appropriate to address the constitutional questions deferred in the permanent injunction order.because we find that rule completes the act,and that the notice statute is otherwise constitutional on its face,applying the injunction prospectively is no longer equitable.rule b.in other words,a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the judgment,rufo,at,and the time has come to lift the permanent injunction.
the constitutional framework governing this appeal is not materially in dispute.c onstitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the age of majority.planned parenthood of cent.danforth,d.minors,like adult women,have a constitutional right to an abortion,and the state does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute,and possibly arbitrary,veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient pregnancy,regardless of the reason for withholding the consent.id.indeed,an unwanted pregnancy may be more of a crisis for a minor than for an adult,not least because she can not postpone the abortion decision until her majority,and therefore there are few situations in which denying a minor the right to make an important decision will have consequences so grave and indelible.matheson,d marshall,dissenting quoting bellotti baird,d plurality opinion of powell,bellotti ii.
however,the supreme court has long upheld regulations on the abortion of minors that would be unconstitutional if applied to adult women,including laws fostering parental involvement in a minor decision to have an abortion.ayotte planned parenthood of new england,d noting that the supreme court has upheld such laws and listing parental consent and notification statutes in states.such regulations are said to be justified by the state important interest in the welfare of its children.planned parenthood ass of kansas city,ashcroft,d matheson,at.as applied to immature and dependent minors,a notice law plainly serves the important considerations of family integrity and protecting adolescents.footnotes omitted.nonetheless,consistent with the holding that states may not impose an arbitrary veto on a minor abortion right,the supreme court has required parental consent laws to include an alternative to parental consent for mature minors and those whose best interests are served thereby 
e very minor must have the opportunity if she so desires to go directly to a court without first consulting or notifying her parents.if she satisfies the court that she is mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own,the court must authorize her to act without parental consultation or consent.if she fails to satisfy the court that she is competent to make this decision independently,she must be permitted to show that an abortion nevertheless would be in her best interests.if the court is persuaded that it is,the court must authorize the abortion.if,however,the court is not persuaded by the minor that she is mature or that the abortion would be in her best interests,it may decline to sanction the operation.
bellotti ii,at.
the plaintiffs argue,and we have previously held,see zbaraz hartigan,cir zbaraz i.planned parenthood affiliates ass n,pearson,cir,that the bellotti ii standard also applies to notice statutes.we need not revisit this question here,because we find that the illinois notice statute is constitutional under bellotti ii criteria for consent statutes and therefore that a fortiori it satisfies any criteria that might be required for bypass provisions in notice statutes.see ohio akron ctr.for reprod.health,d akron ii.however,we note that subsequent supreme court case law conflicts with the conclusions in zbaraz i and pearson,both of which rest on language in opinions addressed only to the constitutional requirements of requiring parental consent in contrast to requiring merely notification.see pearson,at citing bellotti ii,at,and city of akron akron ctr.for reprod.health,d akron i zbaraz i,at citing bellotti ii,at,and pearson,at.in the decades since our decisions in pearson and zbaraz i,the supreme court has repeatedly stated that it has declined to decide whether a parental notification statute must include some sort of bypass provision to be constitutional.lambert wicklund,d per curiam discussing akron ii,at.see also akron ii,at.we leave the question open,because,whether or not the fourteenth amendment requires notice statutes to contain bypass procedures,bypass procedure meets the requirements identified for parental consent statutes in danforth,bellotti ii,ashcroft,and akron i.like the court in akron ii,we do not reach out to decide whether,if we were faced with a notice statute that did not include a bypass procedure such as the procedure at issue here,such a statute would be valid 
with these principles in mind,we address the constitutionality of the bypass provision in illinois notice statute.
this is a facial challenge.under the supreme court precedent governing facial challenges to abortion laws,a law enacted to promote a legitimate state interest will be deemed valid unless in a large fraction of the cases in which the law is relevant,it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo abortion.planned parenthood of se.casey,d because l egislation is measured for consistency with the constitution by its impact on those whose conduct it affects,when analyzing abortion restrictions t he proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction,not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.id.at.see also a woman choice side women clinic newman,cir wood,dissenting discussing casey large fraction test,under which t he analysis does not end with the one percent of women upon whom the statute operates it begins there quoting casey,at.
here,the group for whom the law is a restriction consists of minors who prefer not to notify their parents of their decision to have an abortion.the law provides an exception to notice for such minors,if they establish that they are mature enough to make the decision on their own or that notice is not in their best interests.the plaintiffs focus on a subset of minors in the latter group minors who are immature and for whom an abortion without parental notice would be in their best interests.they argue that the statute lacks language that would allow a bypass judge to authorize such minors to consent to an abortion notwithstanding their immaturity.
we have previously rejected a facial challenge to an indiana law requiring a woman to make two visits to an abortion clinic so that information about the abortion can be provided to her,rather than by telephone or website,before she obtains an abortion.newman,at.we upheld the law despite the district court findings that similar laws in mississippi and utah had led to a decline in abortions in those states.id.at if indiana procedure fails to protect indiana women from risks of physical or mental harm,it will be a failure in operation it is not possible to predict failure before the whole statute goes into force.the indiana law was upheld over judge wood dissent,which argued that the majority disregarded the standards established by casey,and brush ed aside the district court findings of fact.id.at wood,dissenting.
although,like the indiana statute in newman,the illinois statute here is almost identical to statutes that have been upheld by the supreme court,this case differs markedly from newman because the district court here did not rely on factual findings to distinguish this statute from others that have been found to be facially valid.the record on appeal does contain four affidavits of directors and other employees of planned parenthood offices across illinois,describing their unsuccessful attempts to get information from various circuit clerk offices about how the notice statute bypass procedures would operate in practice.see zbaraz madigan,c,doc.exs.to pls.mem.in opp to defs.mot.to dissolve the permanent inj.with these affidavits,the plaintiffs sought to establish that the bypass itself erects an undue barrier to a minor woman right to an abortion.but these affidavits do little to establish that the bypass procedure would not operate as intended the process is nascent clerks understandably lack familiarity with it.moreover,the record also contains a letter from the illinois supreme court stating that our state courts are prepared to proceed to apply the law as enacted.on this record,the district court wisely declined to question the state ability to implement its own laws and presumed that the state courts would be able to carry out rule procedures properly and adequately.the district court holding that the notice statute is nonetheless unconstitutional on its face was based not on findings related to how the statute would operate in practice,but rather on the court interpretation of the statute language as a matter of law.
in particular,and dispositively,the district court held that t he act authorizes the court to waive parental notification when it is in the best interest of the child,but does not authorize a method of consent for the abortion.zbaraz,wl,at emphasis supplied.citing the language from three other notice statutes those of montana,ohio,and massachusetts all of which contain provisions instructing that bypass courts shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to consent to an abortion the district court concluded that t he illinois statute lacks the language that permits a state court to authorize the consent for an abortion.id.the district court held that 
t his court can not presume that the statute authorizes something that it does not state.as such,the minor is left without recourse,except to obtain consent from her parents,which the court,under these circumstances,has deemed not in her best interest.the statute is contradictory and incomplete on its face without an authorization of consent provision,and this court declines to lift the permanent injunction under these circumstances 
the district court ruling that the notice act does not authorize a method of consent for best interest minors appears to rely on the following chain of argument raised by the plaintiffs both below and on appeal.in what may be an excess of ingenuity,the plaintiffs argue that,without an express authorization of consent provision,any order issued by a bypass court waiving parental notice for best interest minors will be ineffective to authorize consent because the court will necessarily consider a minor maturity first and only reach the best interests question if it concludes that a minor is too immature to make the abortion decision on her own such a finding of immaturity will necessarily be included in the bypass court decision waiving parental notice because the notice act requires the bypass court to issue written and specific factual findings and legal conclusions supporting its decision,e and once a minor has been adjudicated to be immature,she will be unable to consent to an abortion on her own,because of illinois common law rule requiring informed consent to all medical procedures an immature minor can not give informed consent.each link in this chain of argument misinterprets the language of the statute and ignores its purpose.we therefore reject the plaintiffs interpretation.
first,we find that the initial premise that the statute lacks an provision misses the mark.the language and structure of the notice act do enable bypass courts to issue orders authorizing consent to an abortion without notice.section,the portion of the act that addresses the judicial bypass procedures,provides that n otice shall be waived if the court finds that the minor is either sufficiently mature and well enough informed to decide intelligently whether to have an abortion,or that notification would not be in the best interests of the minor.d.section f,which addresses appeals,states that a n order authorizing an abortion without notice shall not be subject to appeal.this language plainly contemplates the court power to issue such an order.what type of order an order authorizing an abortion without notice.f.this sentence would be meaningless if the bypass provisions in section d did not provide for an order authorizing an abortion without notice.any argument to the contrary distorts the language and ignores entirely this sentence in section f,all to reach for an unconstitutional meaning.this is not permissible.where fairly possible,courts should construe a statute to avoid a danger of unconstitutionality.akron ii,at.quoting ashcroft,at.
second,the language of the notice act does not require maturity to be considered before best interests.to be sure,there is language in the relevant case law suggesting that maturity is generally considered first.see bellotti ii,at.if she fails to satisfy the court that she is competent to make this decision independently,she must be permitted to show that an abortion nevertheless would be in her best interests.zbaraz i,at referring repeatedly to mature minors and immature minors whose best interests require an abortion.but nothing in the statute or the case law requires this order of decision.the supreme court has rejected the notion that legal tests must be performed in a particular order simply because a statute or case articulates the test in that order.pearson callahan,d.to the contrary,it is well settled that u nless its jurisdiction is at stake,a court may take up issues in whatever sequence seems best,given the nature of the parties arguments and the interest in avoiding unnecessary constitutional decisions.aleman sternes,cir.there may be circumstances where it makes more sense for a court to consider best interests first,or to consider only best interests,whether based on judicial economy,or the petitioner chosen method of presenting her case,or some other reason.the act does not foreclose this flexibility.
third,and relatedly,the statutory language does not require bypass courts to make findings on grounds both of maturity and of best interests.section d requires that notice shall be waived if the minor establishes either that she is mature or that an abortion without notice is in her best interests.section c requires the court to issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law,and section e requires that the court shall issue written and specific factual findings and legal conclusions supporting its decision nowhere does the act provide more specificity regarding what the court must include in its findings.a bypass court,then,is free to base its decision on findings directed solely to the minor best interests.this conclusion serves judicial economy because it may streamline the proceedings by narrowing the issues.moreover,even immature minors have a right to an abortion without parental consent when such an abortion is in their best interest.if a bypass court were to make findings regarding a best interests minor immaturity,those findings would not deprive the court of power to authorize consent to an abortion indeed,the court in such a circumstance would be compelled to authorize the minor consent to an abortion.finally,the supreme court has upheld the ohio notice statute bypass procedure which contains a substantively indistinguishable provision for establishing maturity or best interests,under which the ohio courts have promulgated three separate pleading forms one for petitioners seeking to prove maturity,one for best interests,and one for petitioners arguing both maturity and best interests.akron ii,at.the supreme court upheld the use of these forms,which clearly contemplate bypass proceedings that are addressed only to best interests.if a petitioner chooses to establish only that an abortion without notification is in her best interests,a bypass court in illinois,as in ohio,will be free to make findings with respect to her best interests only.in fact,such a court likely will be unable to make findings with respect to maturity because a minor choosing to establish only best interests may decide not to present any evidence regarding her maturity.in any event,the bypass court is not required to make findings on maturity where the minor focuses the hearing on the best interests prong and chooses not to present evidence on other issues.
fourth,even setting aside all of the above and assuming the truth of the assertion in the third link in the plaintiffs chain of reasoning that an immature minor can not give informed consent to her own abortion the argument still fails.the minor will not need to consent on her own.even without statutory authorization,the court may issue an order authorizing consent.the district court held to the contrary that the statute bypass provision forecloses this option and that bypass judges would be hamstrung in their attempts to authorize consent for immature minors when an abortion without parental notice is in the minors best interests.but this is unreasonable.courts do not need explicit legislative authorization to issue orders in aid of their judgments.that authority inheres in the judicial power.virginia west virginia.that judicial power essentially involves the right to enforce the results of its exertion is elementary.fid.title ins.intercounty title ins,cir a judge power includes not only what he is expressly empowered to do but also such ancillary powers as are necessary and proper to his exercise of the explicitly conferred ones.leathe thomas,cir the rule is universal that,if the power is conferred to render the judgment or enter the decree,it also includes the power to issue proper process to enforce such judgment or decree.this basic principle of common law is well established in illinois jurisprudence and does not depend on express statutory authorization.see sandburg papineau,there is no principle of law better recognized than that which gives to courts of record power over the process of their courts.it is essential to the administration of justice,and it by no means depends upon statutory enactment.health maint.org.guar.ass shapo,d,t he trial court has the inherent authority to enforce its judgments.quoting in re marriage of ward,d.see also vill.of gilberts holiday park,d,adam martin constr.brandon,d.
applicable to this case,if a state bypass court determines that a minor has established one of the exceptions to the act notice requirements,that she is either mature or that an abortion without notice is in her best interests,the act requires the court to waive parental notice,see ilcs d providing that n otice shall be waived if the minor establishes either of the two exceptions to notice by a preponderance of the evidence,so that the minor may obtain an abortion without telling her parents.that the act lacks a provision expressly instructing the court to issue an order giving effect to its decision does not impair its plain power of enforcement.what would be the point of providing for a waiver of notice if there were no way to implement it the act clearly contemplates the court ability to follow through on this score,which is well supported by the common law governing courts inherent authority.
an order conferring consent may be practically necessary for the court to carry out its determination that notice shall be waived.for example,the physician to whom the notice act is directed,see ilcs no person shall knowingly perform an abortion upon a minor unless the physician or his or her agent has given at least hours actual notice to an adult family member,may not know whether the court has waived the notice requirement unless the minor presents an order from the court.and,in response to the plaintiffs own concerns,such physicians may be legitimately worried about the legality of performing an abortion without notice on a minor who appears to be immature or uninformed.to enforce a judgment that an abortion without notice is in such a minor best interests,then,a state bypass judge will likely need to issue an order authorizing the minor consent.any argument that bypass courts will not issue such orders assumes that such courts will act in a way that is unconstitutional.it assumes that bypass judges will find that it is in a minor best interests to have an abortion without notice but then not issue an order authorizing such an abortion,potentially leaving such minors with an unconstitutional choice forgo the abortion or obtain the consent of a parent.and even though we do not revisit today whether minors have a constitutional right to a judicial bypass alternative to notifying their parents,it is beyond dispute that mature minors and immature best interest minors have a right to bypass parental consent.bellotti ii,at.the plaintiffs argument depends on the speculative assertion that bypass courts will ignore supreme court precedent and deny best interest minors this right.again,we will not assume that state courts will act in this way on a facial challenge to the act.akron ii,at.stevens,concurring.
fifth and finally,the district court interpretation of the statute ignores its purpose,which is to require notice to parents,unless a bypass court waives notification because the minor is mature or notification is not in her best interests,d.the plaintiffs interpretation of the bypass provisions would disallow best interest abortions.this squarely contradicts the purpose of the second half the judicial bypass provision,which is to allow abortions without notification whenever doing so would be in the minor best interests.just as we will not reach for an unconstitutional interpretation of statutory language,neither will we construe a statute in a way that leads to absurd results.it is an elementary rule of construction that the act can not be held to destroy itself.citizens bank of maryland strumpf,d citation omitted.see treadway gateway chevrolet oldsmobile,cir nonsensical interpretations of contracts,as of statutes,are disfavored n ot because of a judicial aversion to nonsense as such,but because people are unlikely to make contracts,or legislators statutes,that they believe will have absurd consequences.quoting futuresource reuters,cir.an interpretation that flies in the face of a statute purpose,like that advanced by the plaintiffs here,leads to an absurd result.the plaintiffs may seek to draw a distinction between an order waiving notice and an order authorizing consent to an abortion without notice.we find that such a distinction is not compelled by the statute language and,in fact,nonsensical in the context of the act bypass provisions.again,the sole purpose of the bypass provisions is to allow the minor to obtain an abortion without notice thus,the same court order that waives notice also should authorize consent to an abortion without notice.
before concluding,we emphasize again how narrow is the argument the plaintiffs raise here.many,if not all,of the concerns first raised against parental involvement laws in the and early have been addressed in later versions of such laws and in this law in particular.whereas the early parental consent laws were struck down because they lacked a bypass procedure and therefore gave parents an absolute,and possibly arbitrary,veto power over the child abortion decision,danforth,supra,later laws have heeded bellotti ii instruction to provide such a bypass and to guarantee that it include expeditious and confidential appeals,ashcroft,supra.notice laws,too,tend to include judicial bypass procedures,showing that state legislatures in enacting such laws have gone beyond what appears to be strictly necessary under the supreme court current jurisprudence.see akron ii,supra.thus,by encouraging parental involvement,without requiring it where the minor is mature or such involvement will do more harm than good,laws such as the notice statute before us are,at least facially,closely tailored to serve the state important interest in making sure minor women make informed decisions about whether to have an abortion.matheson,at.marshall,dissenting.
we acknowledge that there may be practical problems with the procedure at issue here it may be intimidating for a minor to navigate the process of presenting her case to a judge,for instance.see hodgson minnesota,d marshall,dissenting ashcroft,at.blackmun,dissenting bellotti ii,at.stevens,concurring.but we fail to see a better alternative.abortion,no matter how it is confronted,may present intimidating choices to the minor woman who faces it.there is perhaps no way around that fact,even without state regulation impinging on the choice.what is more,notice statutes substantively identical to that enacted by the illinois general assembly have been upheld as facially valid on the basis of the state important interest in the welfare of its minors,matheson,at.stevens,concurring describing this interest as fundamental and substantial nothing we say here treads new ground in that regard,as these difficult issues have been,and will continue to be,debated at length elsewhere.we need not add much more to the debate,and we express no view as to whether the illinois notice act would withstand an challenge by individual women who have attempted to participate in bypass proceedings and found them wanting.it suffices to hold that the statute as written is a permissible attempt to help a young woman make an informed choice about whether to have an abortion,and therefore that the order of the district court is reversed and the permanent injunction barring enforcement of the act is dissolved.
