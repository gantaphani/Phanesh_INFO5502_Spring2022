in the early,the epidemic burst onto the scene.its seriousness could not be overstated aids ravaged the immune systems of its victims and seemed to be inevitably fatal.although initially the disease seemed to target gay men,it soon became apparent that it could strike anyone who was exposed to it.according to a history of aids prepared by the national institutes of health,by the summer of,scientists had convincing evidence that aids must be caused by a and sexually transmitted virus.see in their own words nih researchers recall the early years of aids,visited april.one group that proved to be especially vulnerable was hemophiliacs,who need frequent transfusions of blood factors that cause clotting.before,when it became possible to test donated blood to ensure that it was free of the aids virus,close to half of all hemophiliacs became infected with the virus.see gina kolata,hemophilia and aids silent suffering,times,may.
the appeals now before us are the fourth in a series that has arisen from litigation brought by hemophilic individuals who were infected with hiv or hepatitis c virus hcv by contaminated blood products known as factor viii and factor ix factor concentrates.see also in re factor viii or ix concentrate blood prods,cir enforcing a settlement in matter of rorer,cir denying a petition for a writ of mandamus relating to the designation of expert witnesses for trial in matter of rorer,cir reversing a partial class certification.turning to many federal courts around the united states,the plaintiffs sued a number of major drug companies the drug companies.these suits,which were consolidated by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in the northern district of illinois under the docket number,claimed that the defendant companies had intentionally recruited urban homosexuals,prisoners,and intravenous drug users to serve as blood donors,even though they knew that these donors were at high risk of carrying diseases including the viruses that cause aids and hepatitis c.the drug companies allegedly also failed to disclose the known risks of their products failed to use available screening tests failed to use available treatments for killing the viruses in the plasma and continued to export factor concentrates overseas after adopting safer methods for products sold in the united states.
the cases brought by many of the plaintiffs are still pending before the district court.gullone bayer,however,was brought by a group from the united kingdom,italy,germany,israel,argentina,and the state of nebraska.finding that the united kingdom would be a more appropriate forum in which to handle the claims of the plaintiffs,the district court granted a motion by the drug companies to dismiss those claims on the ground of forum non conveniens it certified that ruling as final and ready for appeal under.b.although we find it a close call,largely because the district court placed surprisingly little weight on the interest of california the original forum in this litigation and it may have the administrative difficulties in keeping the case in the united states,we conclude in the end that the court acted within its discretion when it dismissed the case.we therefore affirm.
as we noted earlier,litigation about factor concentrate has been going on for some time this case,along with its companions in the mdl,belongs to the second generation group.the district court described the earlier,first generation cases,in its opinion in order to provide the background for its ruling in the gullone litigation.we include the highlights of that discussion here.
the preferred treatment for hemophilia,a hereditary disease in which the protein that causes blood clotting is missing,is intravenous injection of the necessary protein.the protein used in these treatments is derived from the plasma of donated blood.using a process called fractionating,the manufacturer can derive factor concentrates from the plasma the factor concentrates are then sold for use by hemophiliacs.the principal four defendants throughout these proceedings have been baxter healthcare corporation,bayer corporation,alpha therapeutic corporation,and armour pharmaceutical company together,they produce practically all of the factor concentrates used in the united states.if the donated blood from which the factor concentrate is derived is contaminated with hiv or hcv,then the resulting concentrate may also be contaminated,unless it is subjected to a heat treatment or other method of viral inactivation.it is undisputed that some contaminated factor concentrates were sold,and that this was the way in which many hemophiliacs contracted aids or hepatitis 
the first generation lawsuits were brought against the drug companies by hemophiliacs who had contracted aids,their family members,and their personal representatives.the basic legal theory underlying these suits was negligence.see in re rorer,at.most of those claims were resolved in through a settlement.see in re factor viii or ix concentrate blood prods,at approving the settlement.the second generation claims arose from allegations of knowing misconduct directed specifically toward victims outside the united states.the gullone case was filed in the northern district of california on june,many other suits on behalf of other foreign victims,from many other countries,followed in the courts of california,florida,illinois,and texas.all of these cases were collected in the same litigation proceeding,that existed for the cases.
at this point,the only forum non conveniens ruling before us is the district court decision to sever the claims of the plaintiffs and to dismiss those claims so that they may be pursued in the courts of the united kingdom.the fact that the united kingdom may an adequate alternative forum obviously says nothing about the adequacy of any other proposed country.indeed,because we review the district court forum non conveniens determination for abuse of discretion,see piper aircraft reyno,d,and the relevant inquiry depends heavily on the particular facts of the case,our discussion is not meant to suggest anything about other such motions that may be brought in these cases.
the supreme court recently revisited the topic of forum non conveniens in sinochem international malaysia international shipping,d,which dealt with the question whether a district court may dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens without first assuring that it has jurisdiction over the suit.in the course of deciding that it is permissible to take up the issue about the forum first,the court reviewed the basic contours of forum non conveniens 
a federal court has discretion to dismiss a case on the ground of forum non conveniens when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear the case,and trial in the chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to plaintiff convenience,or the chosen forum is inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court own administrative and legal problems.dismissal for forum non conveniens reflects a court assessment of a range of considerations,most notably the convenience to the parties and the practical difficulties that can attend the adjudication of a dispute in a certain locality.we have characterized forum non conveniens as,essentially,a supervening venue provision,permitting displacement of the ordinary rules of venue when,in light of certain conditions,the trial court thinks that jurisdiction ought to be declined.

the court continues to recognize gulf oil gilbert,as the leading case recognizing and delineating the doctrine of forum non conveniens.see quackenbush allstate ins,d american dredging miller,d.in american dredging,the court described the scope of the doctrine and repeated the passage from gulf oil that describes what ought to inform a district court decision 
an interest to be considered,and the one likely to be most pressed,is the private interest of the litigant.important considerations are the relative ease of access to sources of proof availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling,and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,witness
