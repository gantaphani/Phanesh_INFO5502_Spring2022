after usa,terminated barbara berry employment,she filed an action claiming the termination violated the americans with disabilities act ada,title vii of the civil rights act sex discrimination,and the age discrimination in employment act adea.she also alleged breach of implied contract and promissory estoppel.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of concluding berry was an employee.the court also determined berry was not disabled under the ada because she had not shown her disability severely impacted a major life activity,and she failed to establish pretext in relation to her gender and age discrimination claims.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm.
background 
berry began as an employee with predecessor,voicestream,in october,working in the colorado springs,colorado,office as a customer care supervisor for an annual salary of.she was hired just before her birthday.she received an employee handbook and signed the page which stated i understand that my employment is at will to the fullest extent allowed by law and is entered into voluntarily and may be terminated by me or the company at any time,with or without cause or notice.appellant app.vol.i at.in addition,page three of the handbook contained a paragraph which reiterated her status.it provided in relevant part 
nothing contained in this agreement shall alter the status of employee employment with employer,which is at will.employee acknowledges and understands that employee employment is of no specific duration and can be terminated at any time by either employee or employer with or without cause,for any reason or no reason,at any time.employee acknowledges and agrees that any representations to the contrary are unauthorized and void,unless contained in a formal written employment contract signed by both an executive officer of employer and employee.
on january,berry accepted a promotion to customer care team manager at an annual salary of with a possible bonus as a team manager,berry supervised six team coaches.each team coach led a team of twelve to fifteen customer care representatives who received and handled calls from customers seeking assistance with their telephone services.shortly after her promotion,she received a favorable final performance review for her former position.
later that year,voicestream became.the new general manager of the colorado springs care center,kevin kavanah,assumed his duties in december.he was charged with evaluating the senior leadership team to improve the call center poor performance.as part of the shift in management,made clear it valued teamwork and expected its team managers to practice various strategies to promote this overall vision.
in,in addition to her salary and bonus,berry was identified as a key employee and was invited to participate in a cash incentive plan id.at.in september,she received a raise based upon market and job performance.however,berry had difficulty with requirement that she use the proper coaching methods to improve her teams performance.the endorsed methods included employing a positive personal style,forming a detailed plan and strategy for improving the performance of teams and individuals,establishing timelines,reviewing progress,and holding others accountable for implementing the plan.id.at.according to,barry did not employ the proper coaching methods,hold her team members accountable,or interact well with the other managers.at one point she allegedly made a verbal attack on stephanie brickel,the training manager.kavanah repeatedly counseled berry on this aspect of her performance.
in late october or early november,william grier was promoted to senior manager,supervising the team managers and reporting to kavanah after grier became senior manager,berry reported to him.on october,berry approached kavanah to discuss her not feeling valued as a team manager and she fe lt any day she may be terminated.id.at.kavanah,having become aware of a recent breakthrough in berry coaching and reports of her improvements,assured her things were fine and she had nothing to worry about.id.at.he also called her that day to repeat his assurances.he documented the conversation in a memorandum stating her teamwork had obviously improved,she was valued highly,and she would clearly know if her job was in jeopardy,and that any leader would know that before the ultimate in disciplinary action takes place.id.at.
contends that kavanah belief berry had made a breakthrough was based on one successful coaching session in late summer.unfortunately,his belief was.kavanah later sat in on a meeting in which berry did not coach well and two weeks later reminded her she needed improvement.shortly before being fired,she prepared an unsatisfactory action plan to address specific needs for her teams and coaches to improve.at the same time,grier reported to kavanah that berry again was failing to hold her teams accountable and refusing to work as a team member with her peers.
in october or november of,berry spoke with kavanah about needing a rest at work due to extreme fatigue caused by multiple sclerosis ms.berry had been diagnosed with ms twelve years earlier and kavanah was aware she was receiving treatment for her condition.her primary treating physician was elliott frohman located in dallas,texas,whom she saw annually.kavanah responded she would need to apply for leave under the family medical leave act fmla in order to take time off.she filed her application,which was granted the day before terminated her employment.
according to,the decision to terminate berry employment had already been made when she made her request for fmla leave.kavanah had been engaged in discussions with the human resources manager,cassandra shepard,regarding the call center poor performance.some time in november the discussions culminated in a decision in which kavanah,after consulting with kavanah supervisor,shepard,shepard supervisor and grier,decided to terminate the three female team managers berry,bannister and olson,and a team coach,david mcmilleon.
terminated berry employment on november.the reason given on her termination form was a reduction in force.however,it is undisputed that was not undergoing a reduction in force at the time and asserts the written justification was a clerical error.as indicated on the other employees termination papers,these employees,including berry,were fired for poor performance.specifically,berry was repeatedly counseled regarding her failure to employ proper coaching methods and her inability to get along with others.berry was replaced on an interim basis by jeff edmonds,a younger male,and eventually her position was filled by karen willis.
on january,berry filed a charge of discrimination claiming she was fired due to her disability,age and gender.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of.addressing the ada claim,the court found berry ms was an impairment,but she failed to show the ms substantially affected her major life activities.in the alternative,berry contended that even if her major life activities were not severely restricted,regarded her disabled as evidenced by its approval of her fmla request.the district court ruled approval,in itself,was insufficient to establish that her employer regarded her as disabled.the court concluded berry failed to establish she was disabled under the ada.
as to her gender and age discrimination claims,the district court determined berry established her prima facie case,but failed to rebut proffered reasons for terminating her employment.because berry did not dispute she had been advised about the stated deficiencies in her performance and that teamwork and accountability were priorities for,her proffered evidence of pretext was insufficient to survive summary judgment.
finally,the court rejected berry breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims,noting berry signed employment agreement specified her employment status and there was no evidence of mandatory progressive discipline policies,written or unwritten.thus,there was no breach of contract and no reasonable reliance on the impact of unwritten policies contradicting the written employment agreement.berry filed a timely appeal challenging each aspect of the district court decision.we address each in turn.
discussion 
the purpose of a summary judgment motion is to assess whether a trial is necessary.white york int l,cir.in other words,there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.panis mission hills bank,cir.a court grants summary judgment for the moving party only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact in the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions,and affidavits.c.when applying this standard,a court must view the factual record in the light most favorable to the.applied genetics int,first affiliated,cir.s ummary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is genuine,that is,if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
whether berry is disabled or regarded as disabled under the ada.
to establish a valid claim under the ada,a plaintiff must first prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she has a disability to satisfy the ada definition of disability,a plaintiff must have a recognized impairment,identify one or more appropriate major life activities,and show the impairment substantially limits one or more of those activities.holt grand lake mental health,cir citations omitted.whether the plaintiff has an impairment within the meaning of the ada and whether the conduct affected is a major life activity for purposes of the ada are questions of law for the court to decide.ascertaining whether the impairment substantially limits the major life activity is a question of fact for the jury,although a court is not precluded from deciding the issue on a motion for summary judgment.id.at citation omitted.
substantial limitation 
the united states supreme court defines a substantial impairment as one that prevents or severely restricts an individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people daily lives and that is permanent or long term.toyota motor.williams,d citation omitted.we must strictly interpret the term substantial to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.id.at.the ada regulations describe substantially limited as u nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.j i ii.factors to be considered are t he nature and severity of the impairment t he duration or expected duration of the impairment and t he permanent or long term impact,or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.j i iii an impairment effects are assessed on a basis.holt,at.on summary judgment,the ultimate question is whether the evidence presented could allow a jury to conclude the limitations amount to such severe restrictions in the activities that are of central importance to most people daily lives that they establish a manual task disability.toyota,at.
berry contends she is substantially limited in the life activities of caring for herself,walking and performance of manual tasks.specifically,berry alleges she has to rest before showering,can not do household chores that are handled by others in the family,and essentially has to plan when things can be accomplished.she also is limited in duration in the amount of time available to her.appellant br.at.she maintains the district court erred in considering only whether the impairment severely restricted berry from performing the affected major life activities.berry contends the district court failed to consider t he duration or expected duration of the impairment and t he permanent or long term impact,or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.j ii iii.while berry correctly cites the federal regulation,we need not parse the relevant considerations here.under any of them,berry is not currently disabled.
the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to berry,reveals at the time of her discharge,berry suffered from extreme fatigue which would cause cognitive difficulties,temporary postponement of activities and,on occasion,result in a fall.however,the medical records submitted by her physician demonstrate her activities were not substantially limited and many of her symptoms could be addressed through medication.when berry first began treatment with frohman she would see him every six months,but eventually her appointments were extended to annual visits.in may,frohman proscribed provigil for berry fatigue,an ongoing problem which was exacerbated by changes in her work schedule.during the same visit,frohman reported barry was doing remarkably well in her daily activities.appellant app.vol.i at.she was advised,however,to use a straight cane later in the day to prevent fatigue induced falling.id.in frohman report,he stated berry had not fallen within the last six months and had benefitted from the provigil,but still experienced cognitive dysfunction such as memory problems when fatigued.overall,the doctor reported her daily living activities remain unchanged.frohman report states berry received excellent benefit from her medication regarding fatigue.id.at.her condition apparently remained stable in,when the doctor noted she was doing remarkably well with no evidence of significant change in her daily activities.id.at.indeed,berry admitted her fatigue level depended on whether she was taking her medication.if she takes the proscribed provigil,she has a greater ability to do everything.id.at.even in the event the medication did not provide complete relief,her strategy for dealing with her fatigue was to postpone her chores or allow her husband and daughter to complete them.
compare these facts to those in our recent case,holt grand lake mental health center,cir.there,the plaintiff had cerebral palsy.in determining whether she had a substantial disability,we observed 
while holt needs help when chopping,cutting,and slicing food,the evidence is insufficient to allow a factfinder to conclude she is severely restricted in her ability to cook.it is undisputed that holt occasionally must ask others for assistance when buttoning her clothing holt has introduced no evidence,however,that would permit a factfinder to conclude she is severely restricted in dressing herself.
holt also claims the limitations caused by her cerebral palsy substantially impair her ability to perform the major life activity of caring for herself.caring for one self encompasses normal activities of daily living including feeding oneself,driving,grooming,and cleaning home.as discussed above,the relevant evidence shows holt has difficulty with,or is prevented from performing,a limited number of manual tasks.it also indicates holt sometimes has difficulty chewing and swallowing her food.these specific limitations,however,do not permit a rational factfinder to conclude holt is prevented from caring for herself or is severely restricted in her ability to care for herself.
holt,at internal citation and quotation omitted unlike holt,berry does not dispute she can perform all daily life activities given sufficient rest,walk with the aid of a cane,can treat her symptoms with medication,and her cognitive difficulty does not prevent her from learning and working.the district court did not err in considering her family assistance with the household chores,as that is part of daily living in most families.berry condition has not significantly degenerated over the last several years,and according to her physician,she has stabilized.thus,while berry may have to make some adjustments in her daily routine,the district court did not err in finding berry was not disabled as a matter of law 
regarded as disabled 
in the alternative,berry asserts the district court erred in concluding there was no issue of fact as to whether considered her disabled.berry contends grant of her fmla leave request is sufficient to raise a question of fact.we disagree.
equal employment opportunity commission regulations presents three different ways in which an individual may satisfy the meaning of regarded as having a disability the individual may have an impairment that is not substantially limiting but is perceived by the defendant as constituting a substantially limiting impairment the individual may have an impairment that is substantially limiting only because of the attitudes of others toward the impairment or the individual may have no impairment at all but is regarded by the defendant as having a substantially limiting impairment.l.in addition,a claimant may be deemed to have a record of disability either by having a history of substantial limitation of a major life activity or by having been misclassified as having such an impairment.k.
because knew berry had ms and knew of her fatigue and resulting cognitive challenges,berry argues kavanah suggestion she apply for fmla leave and the approval of her application is evidence that considered her disabled.although we have found no precedent directly on point in this circuit or others,we agree with the district court conclusion that approval of berry fmla request does not establish a question of fact an employer knowledge of an impairment alone is insufficient to establish the employer regarded the employee as disabled.steele thiokol,cir.
we have often stated d isability is a term of art under the ada.doyal.heart,cir poindexter atchison,topeka santa fe rwy,cir.in contrast,the leave provisions of the fmla are wholly distinct from the statutory definition of disability and an employer reasonable accommodation obligations covered under the ada as courts have recognized in various contexts,there may be some parallels between the ada and fmla,but applicable regulations explicitly state that ada disability and the fmla serious health condition are different concepts,and must be analyzed separately.hurlbert mary health care,cir quoting stekloff john mercy health,cir see also hoge honda of am,cir unlike the fmla,the finding of a disability is the key that unlocks the storehouse of statutory protections under the ada.given the very different focus of the two statutory protections,kavanah suggestion to apply for fmla leave and approval of berry application does not demonstrate an issue of fact as to whether berry was considered disabled under the ada.consequently,berry failed to present a case of discrimination under the ada.
berry claims unlawfully discriminated against her based on her gender and age.because she presented circumstantial evidence to support her claims,we apply the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas corporation green,d.plotke white,cir.the employee must first establish a prima facie case of a prohibited employment action and if she does,the burden shifts to the employer to state a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action.if the employer meets this burden,then summary judgment is warranted unless the employee can show there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proffered reasons are pretextual.id.a pretext argument requires the court to examine the facts as they appear to the person making the decision,to determine whether the employer honestly believed those reasons and acted in good faith upon those beliefs.rivera city county of denver,cir internal quotations omitted.our inquiry does not review the wisdom or fairness of the employer proffered reasons.id.a t issue is whether the evidence of plaintiff misconduct presented to the decisionmakers was so weak that a rational factfinder could infer that the expressed reason for terminating plaintiff must have been pretextual.id.at.
the district court determined berry presented a prima facie case of discrimination on both her claims but failed to demonstrate proffered basis for its decision,her performance,was pretextual.berry contends the district court erroneously resolved issues of fact in reaching its conclusion.
berry claims pretext is shown by a series of events in context.first,she points to evidence of her satisfactory performance,her raise in september and kavanah october oral assurances and memo approving her performance,and insists any earlier performance difficulties were rendered by her improvement.she then points to the timing kavanah approval was given only three weeks before her termination,which itself occurred just days after she requested accommodation for her fatigue.in addition,she finds it suspicious that kavanah original assessment was based on his own observation and that of others,yet his alleged turnaround was based solely on grier comments.consequently,she concludes the district court made a factual determination in favor of when it discounted this evidence solely because there was no evidence rebutting kavanah testimony as to his motivation in terminating her employment.
berry rendition of the record,however,is incomplete.she fails to mention presented uncontested evidence that her raise in was an payment adjustment made at all call centers and therefore is not evidence of kavanah assessment of her performance.further,berry does not deny she was repeatedly counseled regarding her failure to improve her interactions.nor does she deny grier criticism of her performance to kavanah after october.she does not argue the action plan she submitted for her teams and coaches was adequate.most importantly,berry misapprehends the tenor of kavanah october memo.it does not exonerate all past performance issues.rather,it affirms her improvement with cautionary advice.two weeks prior to october,kavanah recorded the substance of another meeting he had with berry and one of her team coaches.the team coach was called to kavanah office,with berry present,to discuss coaching effectiveness.kavanah noted that during the meeting berry did not offer any response,but rather sat silently and this concerned me about her interaction and coaching appellant app.vol.i at the memo continues 
after team coach left the office i asked berry why she did not know about his shortcomings in advance of this meeting.she stated she had not looked in the blue books this is my concern of her other coaches too i directed berry to ensure all her team members blue books are reviewed by october,and that effective success plans are documented by each coach showing the steps that will be taken to help ensure the success and the time frames to achieve such activities.
berry accurately states the october memo records kavanah telling berry she was highly valued but it also included 
with barb related to her not feeling valued as a tm she indicated that she feels that sue nichols and cassandra shepard are spies and looking for questionable behavior of hers.
barb became as she spoke of this.
i let her know that cassandra and sue are clearly not spies,but rather enablers for us to have a strong leadership team,and their role is to observe and give feedback on the those behaviors.i cited several instances in which barb behaviors were conflicting to our direction,and that she was given very valuable,actionable feedback to help her become more effective.i cited several situations where she took that feedback and indeed acted upon it.
i let barb know that her continued area of improvement is inspecting the coaching ability of her coaches and the documentation in coaches sic blue books she agreed and committed to this.
discussed her high focus on caring for the individual and continually seeing the bright side of things in to a fault.her trust in her coach sic words is causing serious lapses in their performance due to lack of followup on barb part.
she indicated she had a come to jesus meeting with her team and told them they were no longer going to be able to skate by,and not do what was directed by her finally,a right step by barb.discussed ensuring she follows up on deadlines given,and force the accuracy of reports they generate for her.she is giving direction little.is this a respect issue do her coaches feel she will not or follow through with them this stems back to the holding people accountable
