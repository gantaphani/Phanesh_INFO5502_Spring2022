we must determine the circumstances under which the social security administration can find that a claimant for disability insurance benefits is not disabled despite a contrary finding by the department of veterans affairs.
jerry valentine filed an application with the social security administration ssa for social security disability insurance benefits in march.he alleged disability beginning the previous year.a former member of the navy,valentine suffered a combat head injury in vietnam in.since then,he has held several jobs,most recently as a parts man for a diesel engine distributor called cummins northwest incorporated.in march,he retired from cummins.
valentine complains of stress disorder ptsd,a combination of depression and sleep deprivation sometimes referred to in the record as cognitive disorder secondary sleep deprivation,and degenerative joint disease in his right shoulder and left knee.the ptsd resulted from valentine head injury in vietnam,but it appears to have worsened significantly in the wake of the death of his brother from a head injury in the summer of.valentine received treatment for the ptsd and for sleep disturbance and persistent nightmares at the veterans administration medical center in portland,oregon,from september of through the date of the hearing before the administrative law judge alj.
while undergoing sleep therapy in,valentine began treatment with lynn van male.at the time,valentine reported that he got a good night sleep about three days out of each week.valentine performance at work was erratic he received several marginal performance ratings on his annual job review in february.
van male referred valentine to daniel storzbach for a neuropsychological assessment.the results suggested average baseline cognitive ability performance on some of the specific tests indicated normal limits or better.however,other tests indicated impaired performance with respect to attention,working memory,and complex pyschomotor function.storzbach seemed to attribute these difficulties to the exacerbation of valentine ptsd symptoms following his brother death.he recommended several ways to cope and noted that valentine would probably have less difficulty with highly routinized,tasks with low cognitive demand.
meanwhile,valentine,with van male help,tried to increase his disability rating,which then stood at percent,from the department of veterans affairs va.in a letter to the va written in may,van male stated that valentine had tried to hold down his job at significant cost to himself,but that she worried about his ability to maintain employment given his current rate of functional decline.at the time,valentine was reporting increased mental stability at work and at home for example,he was able to garden with his wife,despite his sleeping problems.the va raised his disability rating to percent.
though difficulties persisted during,valentine managed them reasonably well.he continued to work and paid off credit card and truck loan debts.his performance review in january was positive,his ratings being in the acceptable to commendable range.whether because his fatigue and associated ailments became too much for him or because he became eligible to receive his employee pension,valentine planned to retire in march.
things improved as valentine planned retirement date approached.he received positive reviews in february from his supervisor,lane anthony.anthony praised valentine attitude as outstanding,called him a wonderful asset to the company front counter,and noted improvement in his work product valentine assured company executives that he was ready and willing to retire,despite their offers of a shortened or split shift,because he believed it was in his best interests.after his retirement,valentine condition continued to improve as he exercised and took up projects to keep busy.he even stopped regular visits with van male in november.
valentine requested another increase in his disability rating from the.leslie carter interviewed him in october and found valentine assertion that his nightmares and sleep deprivation were extremely disabling.carter,however,was under the impression that valentine had quit working at cummins because he was about to be fired.initially the va did not act,despite carter report.but after van male sent further letters in and,the va ultimately raised valentine disability rating to percent.
in addition to his ptsd,valentine sustained two physical injuries in.he tore some cartilage in his shoulder and damaged his left knee.he underwent surgery for both injuries.in september,two months before surgery on his knee,valentine took a physical examination,which did not suggest any significant physical impairment.
several psychologists,including a peter lebray,reviewed valentine medical record on behalf of the ssa.the alj considered this evidence,along with the rest of valentine file,at a hearing in march of.ultimately,the alj decided that valentine was not disabled and denied him benefits.the appeals council declined review,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.valentine filed a civil action in the district court to obtain judicial review of the agency decision.the district court affirmed the denial of benefits,and valentine now appeals.
to establish eligibility for social security disability benefits,a claimant has the burden to prove he is disabled.see roberts shalala,cir.
like most social security cases,this case involves the agency procedure for determining disability.see a i v see also bustamante massanari,cir.the alj decision turned on her conclusion at step five.while the claimant has the burden of proof at steps one through four,the burden of proof shifts to the commissioner at step five to show that the claimant can do other kinds of work.embrey bowen,cir.to direct this inquiry,the commissioner,through the alj,must determine the claimant residual functional capacity,a summary of what the claimant is capable of doing for example,how much weight he can lift.the alj may,and did here,pose to a vocational expert a hypothetical incorporating the residual functional capacity determination rfc the expert then opines on what kind of work someone with the limitations of the claimant could hypothetically do.see roberts,at.the alj must then determine whether,given the claimant rfc,age,education,and work experience,he actually can find some work in the national economy.see tackett apfel,cir a v.
we review the district court order affirming the commissioner denial of benefits de novo to ensure that the commissioner decision was supported by substantial evidence and a correct application of the law.roberts,at internal citation omitted.this is a highly deferential standard of review substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla,but less than a preponderance.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.desrosiers sec y of health human,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
before reviewing the details of the alj decision,we must dispose of a threshold issue.valentine alleges that the alj denied him due process because of the alj attitude and demeanor.he claims that several of the alj pointed questions and expressions of disbelief made the administrative hearing less than full and fair.
valentine does not allege that the alj was biased against him.instead,he merely suggests that the alj had prejudged his case in some way.we can find no legal authority for the proposition that general preconceptions that do not amount to bias violate the due process clause.
even if we construe valentine complaint to allege actual bias,he has mustered no evidence that comes close to the required showing.aljs are presumed to be unbiased.rollins massanari,cir.such presumption can be rebutted by a showing of conflict of interest or some other specific reason for disqualification.but expressions of impatience,dissatisfaction,annoyance,and even anger,that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women sometimes display,do not establish bias.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.that the alj questioned some of valentine arguments and the perspective of some of those who treated him plainly does not show bias in this sense.
we proceed to valentine more specific objections,the first of which concerns the rfc.valentine contends that the alj did not take account of all his limitations in fashioning the rfc.the hypothetical an alj poses to a vocational expert,which derives from the rfc,must set out all the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant.embrey,at.thus,an rfc that fails to take into account a claimant limitations is defective.
valentine objections to the rfc can be divided into two categories.he argues that the alj ignored some and improperly rejected other evidence of the extent of his impairments.
the alj concluded that valentine has the residual functional capacity to perform a limited range of medium exertion work.specifically,the rfc reads 
valentine is able to lift up to pounds.he is able to sit at least six hours out of an eight hour workday.he is able to stand at least six hours out of an eight hour workday.he is able to perform postural activities frequently.he has moderate restrictions of his capacity to concentrate,interact with the public,and carry out detailed work instructions.moderate is defined as limited but satisfactory.
we first consider whether this evaluation ignored three pieces of medical evidence.
first,valentine points to the report of lebray,one of the psychologists who reviewed valentine medical record on behalf of the ssa.lebray stated that valentine needed simple,paced unrushed without close public interaction.valentine claims that this limits him to simple work,whereas the rfc limits him to medium exertion work.
however,lebray submitted a more mental residual functional capacity assessment,which makes it clear that he did not intend to limit valentine strictly to simple work,as that term is understood in the parlance of the ssa.the assessment describes valentine as m oderately l imited in four of twenty categories of mental activity and n ot s ignificantly l imited in the other sixteen.the four categories of moderate limitation were ability to carry out detailed instructions ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods ability to interact appropriately with the general public and ability to set realistic goals or make plans independently.the first three limitations apply to functional capacity they appear almost verbatim in the rfc.
thus,we can not conclude that the rfc ignores lebray medical evaluation.
valentine also claims the alj ignored or contradicted storzbach neuropsychological assessment.
storzbach summarized his assessment in several distinct sections.one section,titled impression,states that the n europsychological assessment suggested average baseline cognitive ability.performance on many tests was within normal limits or better results of some tests indicated variably impaired performance on measures of attention,working memory,and complex psychomotor function.there is also a more detailed summary of the test results,which notes that the patient pattern of moderately impaired initial presentation performance on verbal memory tests suggested deficient attention.with respect to d urability of memory for newly learned information during distraction,multiple measures derived from this test rang ed from normal to impaired.these findings suggest some moderate neuropsychological impairments.as such,they are consistent with the rfc,which included moderate meaning limited but satisfactory restrictions of valentine capacity to concentrate,interact appropriately with the public,and carry out detailed instructions.once again,the rfc actually incorporated the evidence that valentine argues it ignored.
valentine asserts,however,that storzbach also limited him to highly routinized,overlearned tasks with low cognitive demand.to be sure,the doctor noted that valentine is less likely to have difficulty with such tasks.but this notation appeared in a section of storzbach report entitled recommendations.nowhere in this section does storzbach indicate that valentine is incapable of working except under the recommended conditions.indeed,he pointed out that valentine mostly normal test performance with multiple cognitive strengths suggests that he is capable of at least partially compensating for his deficits.thus,we agree with the ssa that storzbach observation about highly routinized,overlearned tasks with low cognitive demand is neither a diagnosis nor statement of valentine functional capacity.it is rather a recommended way for valentine to cope with his ptsd symptoms.the alj therefore did not err by excluding it from the rfc.
in sum,we can not say that the alj ignored evidence of valentine impairments when she fashioned his rfc 
valentine also argues that the alj improperly rejected other evidence regarding the extent of his ailments van male testimony,his own testimony,and his wife testimony.
our social security precedents have developed a highly articulated set of standards for reviewing an alj decision to reject different types of testimony.we take each piece of testimony separately,as each invokes a different standard.
there are three types of medical opinions in social security cases those from treating physicians,examining physicians,and physicians.lester chater,cir.where a treating or examining physician opinion is contradicted by another doctor,the commissioner must determine credibility and resolve the conflict.thomas barnhart,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,to reject the opinion of a treating physician in favor of a conflicting opinion of an examining physician,an alj still must make findings setting forth specific,legitimate reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
valentine objects to the alj rejection of the opinion of van male,who was valentine treating psychologist.the alj gave more weight to storzbach neuropsychological evaluation,as well as to the functional capacity evaluation of lebray.indeed,as we explain above,supra at,the rfc clearly reflects the influence of storzbach and lebray,who both concluded that valentine had various moderate limitations.furnished with the contradictory opinion of an examining psychologist storzbach,the alj must have provided specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record,for rejecting van male opinion.lester,at.
we believe the alj met this standard.she identified a contradiction in van male opinion,in that the doctor repeatedly reported valentine was unemployable while acknowledging he was continuing to work.the alj also noted evidence in the record,including van male own treatment progress reports that showed valentine improved functioning at work and encouraging comments he received from company officials.this record evidence was consistent with the opinions of storzbach and lebray.thus,the alj rejected van male opinion for specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence.
valentine makes a brief argument that the alj improperly rejected his own testimony about his pain and fatigue.he states that the alj reasons for rejection are based largely on factual inaccuracies and that his statements are consistent and corroborated by lay witness testimony.
under our case law,
w ithout affirmative evidence showing that the claimant is malingering,the commissioner reasons for rejecting the claimant testimony must be clear and convincing.if an alj finds that a claimant testimony relating to the intensity of his pain and other limitations is unreliable,the alj must make a credibility determination citing the reasons why the testimony is unpersuasive.the alj must specifically identify what testimony is credible and what testimony undermines the claimant complaints.in this regard,questions of credibility and resolutions of conflicts in the testimony are functions solely of the secretary.

as there was no evidence of malingering,the alj had to explain why she did not find valentine subjective contentions about his limitations to be persuasive.the alj determined that valentine dem
