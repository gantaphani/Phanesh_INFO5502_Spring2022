the department of health and human services,the agency that administers medicare,denied medicare coverage for the bio,a piece of durable medical equipment used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee.in four decisions,the medicare appeals council,which is the highest level of agency adjudication,ruled that the bio had not been shown to be reasonable and necessary for the treatment at issue.the supplier of the device challenges those decisions as arbitrary,capricious,and not supported by substantial evidence.
today we join the fourth circuit in holding that the medicare appeals council coverage denials for the bio were not arbitrary,capricious,or unsupported by substantial evidence.see almy sebelius,cir.
we hold that,although various aljs in other cases had granted coverage for the bio,those cases were at low levels of the agency adjudication process and thus were not binding on the medicare appeals council.the medicare appeals council adequately explained its reasons for denying coverage here.
furthermore,the coverage denials were supported by substantial evidence.after reviewing the scientific studies submitted by the bio supplier,the medicare appeals council reasonably concluded that those studies failed to show the device was more effective at alleviating knee pain the device primary asserted purpose than a tens device costing less.and the medicare appeals council reasonably concluded that the studies failed to show that the device was effective at regenerating cartilage its secondary asserted purpose in humans.
we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for the bio supplier and remand the case to the district court to determine in the first instance whether the supplier of the device is entitled to the benefit of any of medicare limited liability provisions.
the medicare statutory and administrative regime 
medicare is the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.part b the part of the medicare program at issue here is voluntary supplemental medical insurance covering doctors services,outpatient care,and durable medical equipment,a.it operates much like private medical insurance medicare beneficiaries receive medical treatment and the providers submit claims for government reimbursement.
the government controls medicare costs,among other ways,by denying coverage claims for items or services that are not reasonable and necessary for treatment.a a.a device is not reasonable and necessary and thus is not eligible for medicare coverage if it is 
not safe and effective that is,if the device has not been proven safe and effective based on authoritative evidence or is not generally accepted in the medical community as safe and effective for the condition for which it is used 
e xperimental that is,investigational 
not a ppropriate for the individual beneficiary needs or 
s ubstantially more costly than a medically appropriate and realistically feasible alternative pattern of care.

the burden is on the claimant to show that the device is reasonable and necessary.see,almy sebelius,cir friedman sec y of dep t of health human,cir.
medicare contracts with private insurance carriers to determine coverage claims in the first instance.a.if a contractor denies a claim,the supplier may have another contractor redetermine the claim.u.a a b.if the supplier is dissatisfied with the redetermination,it may have a qualified independent contractor reconsider the claim.b a,c b.if the supplier is dissatisfied with the qualified independent contractor reconsideration decision,it may have its claim heard before an alj.d a.if the supplier is dissatisfied with the alj decision,it may appeal the decision to the medicare appeals council,a division of the department of health and human services.d.alternatively,the medicare appeals council may on its own motion review the alj decision.each of these administrative appeals applies de novo review.d c.the medicare appeals council decision is the agency final decision.
if the supplier is dissatisfied with the medicare appeals council decision,it may challenge that decision in federal court.b a.
even if a coverage claim is denied on the ground that the items or services were not reasonable or necessary,medicare will nevertheless pay for the items or services if the supplier and the beneficiary did not know,and could not reasonably have been expected to know,that payment would not be made for such items or services.a.however,once medicare indemnifies a supplier for an unforseen claim denial under this limited liability provision,the supplier is deemed to know that medicare will not pay any future claims for the same or similar items or services.b.
a supplier can shift the risk of coverage denial to the medicare beneficiary by notifying the beneficiary in writing that medicare will likely deny coverage.these advance beneficiary notices allow beneficiaries to make an informed consumer decision about receiving items or services for which they may have to pay.medicare benefit policy manual,ch,c.
however,for the supplier to shift liability to the beneficiary,the supplier notice must be sufficiently specific in explaining why medicare will likely deny the claim.centers for medicare medicaid,dep t of health human,medicare claims processing manual,ch.the supplier notice must also explain that denial is probable,not merely possible.id.
facts and procedural history 
plaintiff international rehabilitative sciences,doing business under the name rs medical,supplies the bio,a piece of medical equipment that delivers electrical impulses to the knee to treat osteoarthritis of the knee.
rs medical charges more than for a bio and more than for a bio.by comparison,similar devices called transcutaneous electric nerve stimulators,also known as tens units,cost less than.see centers for medicare medicaid services durable medical equipment fee schedule,available at.
rs medical began filing medicare coverage claims for the bio in.at first,those claims were largely denied.over the next few years,rs medical started to receive more coverage approvals from initial contractors,qualified independent contractors,and aljs.in fact,coverage of the device was approved many times at these lower levels of the process.however,none of those coverage decisions reached the medicare appeals council until now.
this case arises from more than separate claims for medicare coverage of the bio made by rs medical on behalf of more than individual beneficiaries.each claim was denied by a medicare contractor upon the initial determination and redetermination,then by a qualified independent contractor,then by an alj,and finally,when the claims were consolidated,by the medicare appeals council in four separate decisions.
in each of the four decisions,the medicare appeals council concluded that rs medical had not met its burden of establishing that the bio was reasonable and necessary for treatment.rs medical had claimed the bio was reasonable and necessary for two purposes to alleviate pain from osteoarthritis of the knee and to regenerate knee cartilage.with respect to the first purpose,the medicare appeals council found that rs medical had not offered reliable evidence to establish that the bio was more effective at alleviating pain than tens units costing less than the bio.although rs medical submitted several studies purporting to show the bio effectiveness at alleviating pain,the medicare appeals council discounted those studies because,among other methodological flaws,they had been authored or sponsored by the bio manufacturer.and with respect to the second purpose,the medicare appeals council found that although some evidence showed that the bio could regenerate cartilage in rabbits and cows,no evidence showed that it was effective at regenerating cartilage in humans.in sum,the medicare appeals council concluded that the medical literature did not show that the bio was generally accepted by the medical community.it denied medicare coverage for the bio.
further,with respect to the limited liability provisions,the medicare appeals council declined to indemnify rs medical for the coverage denials.it found that rs medical knew or had reason to know that medicare would not cover the device because its efficacy had not been established in the requisite literature and because the record does not indicate general acceptance of the device by the medical community.
finally,the medicare appeals council declined to shift liability from rs medical to most of the individual medicare beneficiaries,with some exceptions.it found that most of the advance beneficiary notices provided by rs medical were generic and thus insufficient to shift liability to the beneficiaries.
after the medicare appeals council denied its coverage claims,rs medical filed this action challenging the denials as arbitrary,capricious,and not supported by substantial evidence.see.
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted rs medical motion and denied the secretary motion.int l rehabilitative,sebelius,d.it first concluded that the medicare appeals council decisions were not entitled to deference because they were inconsistent with many alj decisions in individual cases granting medicare coverage for the bio even though those grants were at lower levels of the adjudication process,not by the medicare appeals council.id.at.
the district court,explicitly proceeding de novo and without any deference to the agency,compared the strength of the evidence supporting the medicare appeals council four coverage denials with the strength of the evidence supporting a number of alj coverage grants not at issue in this case.first,the district court concluded that the medicare appeals council coverage denials gave no weight to the fact that the fda had cleared the bio as safe and effective.id.at.second,in the district court view,the evidence as a whole showed the medical community widespread acceptance of the bio for alleviating pain.id.at.the district court held that the alj coverage grants not at issue here were more based on substantial evidence than the medicare appeals council denials at issue here.id.at.
having reversed the medicare appeals council coverage denials,the district court did not reach the limited liability issues of whether medicare should indemnify rs medical on the ground that the coverage denials were unforeseeable and whether rs medical advance beneficiary notices were sufficiently specific to shift liability for the bio cost to the individual medicare beneficiaries.id.at.the district court remanded the claims to the medicare appeals council to determine the appropriate payment amounts.id.at.
the secretary moved to amend the district court judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e.she argued that the district court opinion was wrong and that newly discovered evidence showed that the medicare appeals council coverage denials were consistent with coverage decisions at other levels of agency adjudication.in support of her motion,the secretary submitted bio coverage decisions from lower levels of agency adjudication over the past three years consistently denying coverage for the bio including by some of the same aljs who had granted coverage for the bio in its early years.
the district court denied the secretary motion to amend the judgment.it again found that the agency coverage decisions were inconsistent,and thus the medicare appeals council coverage denials were arbitrary.
the agency appeals.
while this appeal was pending,the fourth circuit decided an almost identical case,almy sebelius,cir,involving the exact same device,brought by the device manufacturer.bionicare,the bio manufacturer,brought a district court action challenging a number of medicare appeals council decisions denying coverage for the bio including some of the same medicare appeals council decisions at issue here as arbitrary,capricious,and not supported by substantial evidence.
in almy,the fourth circuit upheld the coverage denials.it held that substantial evidence supported the coverage denials because,as the medicare appeals council explained,the studies submitted by the bio manufacturer suffered from methodological flaws that weakened their persuasiveness,objectivity,and relevance.at.the fourth circuit further held that the medicare appeals council coverage denials were not impermissibly arbitrary,even though the agency had previously granted some coverage claims for the bio at lower levels in the agency adjudication process,because the medicare appeals council had consistently denied coverage.id.at.

i.the agency coverage denials for the bio 
the district court reversed the medicare appeals council coverage denials on two independent grounds.we disagree on both.
first,the district court held that the thousands of coverage grants by initial contractors,qualified independent contractors,and aljs rendered the medicare appeals council coverage denials here arbitrary and capricious under of the administrative procedure act.but not all agency inconsistency is impermissibly arbitrary only u nexplained inconsistency.marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc alteration in original emphasis added.agency inconsistency provides a basis for rejecting an agency interpretation only in rare instances,such as when an agency provides no explanation at all for a change in policy,or when its explanation is so unclear or contradictory that we are left in doubt as to the reason for the change in direction.id.emphasis added citation omitted.here,the medicare appeals council explained why it disagreed with the lower agency adjudicatory decisions granting coverage the studies that those decisions relied on purporting to show the bio effectiveness at alleviating pain had been authored or sponsored by the bio manufacturer,and the studies purporting to show the bio effectiveness at regenerating cartilage had been conducted on animals,not humans.because they explained the reasons for their disagreement,the medicare appeals council coverage denials were not impermissibly arbitrary.
moreover,the district court incorrectly measured agency inconsistency across different levels of agency adjudication.no medicare appeals council decision has granted coverage for the bio the only coverage grants were by contractors,qualified independent contractors,and aljs.as the fourth circuit held in this exact situation,e ven if these decisions from lower levels of agency adjudication were found to evince internal inconsistency at a subordinate level,the agency itself would not be acting inconsistently.almy sebelius,cir third alteration in original quoting cmty.care found.thompson,holding that secretary denial of medicare part a payments was not arbitrary and capricious even though it was inconsistent with prior agency adjudicatory decisions.the fourth circuit illustrated the district court error by analogy the decisions of local contractors can not deprive the secretary of that discretion to determine when a device is reasonable and necessary,any more than the diverse decisions of district courts or courts of appeals throughout the country could bind the supreme court.id.at.
rs medical argues that the agency has regulatory tools that could remedy these inconsistencies in particular,it can issue local or national coverage determinations,rules about whether a particular item is covered.see f b,b.but while the agency may make coverage determinations via rules,it is not required to do so rather,the agency h
