linda brumbalough brumbalough,was employed as the state clinical director by camelot care centers,camelot.when she was terminated from her employment after taking a leave under the family and medical leave act fmla,brumbalough filed this action against camelot claiming that her termination was in violation of the fmla.
on the parties for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to camelot,finding that brumbalough was not on fmla leave at the time she was terminated and that brumbalough had failed to submit a proper certification,which was needed before she could return to work.the district court alternatively concluded that even if brumbalough had submitted a proper certification,camelot had no obligation under the fmla to reinstate her because she was unable to perform the essential functions of the state clinical director position.later,brumbalough also attempted to amend her complaint to add emotional distress damages.the district court denied brumbalough motion to amend.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court denial of brumbalough motion for partial summary judgment and reverse grant of summary judgment to camelot.we affirm the district court denial of brumbalough motion to amend and remand the case for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
camelot provides treatment,care,and placement for abused and neglected children in the custody of state department of children services.it also provides counseling to children and to troubled families.camelot has five local offices in tennessee and also operated one residential treatment center during brumbalough employment.each local office has a clinical director,who is responsible for the treatment needs of the children assigned to the office.
brumbalough was hired as a clinical director in october and was assigned to the local office in oak ridge,tennessee.her responsibilities included admission of children into the program,treatment evaluations,recruiting and training of foster parents,monitoring the movement of children in the program,supervision of staff and the clinical program,chart auditing,and event planning.
in july,brumbalough was promoted to the position of state clinical director.as the state clinical director,brumbalough supervised clinical directors of the five tennessee offices and the residential treatment center.this entailed answering questions from the local clinical directors regarding admissions,evaluations,and placement of children.brumbalough also filled in as the clinical director for the local offices during temporary vacancies.in,brumbalough was traveling almost every day and worked on paperwork on the weekends.consequently,brumbalough worked over sixty hours a week.as the state clinical director,brumbalough was responsible for training new employees and was also responsible for handling emergencies involving children under camelot care.because of such responsibilities,brumbalough was required to be on call hours a day,seven days a week.
on june,brumbalough sent an email to julie tesore,the program director of the brentwood office,informing her that she was having some health problems and she needed to cut back on her hours down to hours per week.following her appointment with her doctor,ted stallings,brumbalough told camelot that she was recommended to take the rest of the week off.on june,brumbalough informed camelot of her intent to have her doctor sign the fmla certification forms,since she was having more health problems and would need to take more time off.gretchen jolly,director of human resources,sent an fmla certification form to brumbalough.the certification from stallings provided that brumbalough was presently incapacitated and that she would need about two to three months to recover.brumbalough fmla leave was approved as of june.the period of fmla leave,if taken in full,was to expire on september.
camelot sent brumbalough an employer response form for fmla leave after her leave request,which stated that brumbalough was to inform camelot of her status every thirty days,that brumbalough was required to present a duty certification prior to being restored to employment and that she would need recertification from her physician after two months in order to get approval for further fmla leave because her doctor was vague on her return to work date.
on july,brumbalough sent an email to michele disorbo,camelot national clinical director,informing her that she felt ready to come back to work in the next week or so.jolly sent brumbalough a letter on july,acknowledging brumbalough request to return to work and requesting that she provide a certification no later than august.the letter said,we required that you provide us with a date certain for your return.we also require a certification letter from your physician that you are indeed fit for duty to return to your old job.i have enclosed a letter for your doctor to review and sign so that we can adequately assess your planned return to employment.at.the letter also included a copy of brumbalough job description and procedures.stallings was asked to read the statement contained in the letter,put a date that brumbalough could return to work,sign it and send it back to camelot.brumbalough received the letter on august.
on august,brumbalough had an appointment with stallings and he provided her with a handwritten note on a prescription pad stating,she may return to work on.she should only work a hour week and limit her travel to day per week.at.brumbalough claims that she faxed this note to camelot camelot denies receiving it.
on august,jolly mailed another letter stating that camelot had not received a response to its request for a.the letter set a new deadline of august,and stated that if camelot did not get the certification by august,it would consider brumbalough employment with camelot terminated and would proceed to fill her position.this letter was delivered on august.
brumbalough sought the assistance of attorney kevin shepherd in an attempt to get an extension of time for submitting the paperwork from stallings.upon shepherd request,jolly extended the deadline for brumbalough to august.on august,brumbalough received another overnight letter from jolly,which confirmed the extended deadline of august,and stated if brumbalough was unable to report for duty on or before wednesday,august,with the certification,camelot would consider her employment terminated.brumbalough failed to submit the certification by this new deadline and was informed of her termination by a letter dated august.
on august,stallings prepared a letter which stated that brumbalough may now return to work with certain modifications such as limiting her travel to once a week and not working more than hours a week.the letter indicated that the restrictions were expected to last for the next two months,at which time she would be reevaluated.brumbalough was provided with this letter on august.jolly testified that camelot never received it and brumbalough testified that she could not say for sure if anyone sent the letter to camelot.
on june,which was during brumbalough absence,camelot placed an ad for the clinical director position for the brentwood office in the tennessean,a local newspaper.kristi buckley,the tennessee state director of programs,testified that the advertisement in the paper was for a local clinical director position but camelot kept in mind the prospect that brumbalough might not be able to return as state clinical director as applicants were interviewed.donna fisher was interviewed for the local clinical director position and was ultimately offered the dual position of clinical director for the brentwood office and state clinical director on august.buckley testified that due to an upcoming corporate merger,fisher was hired to fill both positions until camelot new corporate structure was settled.fisher started at camelot on september.
buckley testified that camelot classified the state clinical director as salaried exempt because that person must be on call and usually the position required a workweek of hours.buckley also confirmed that the same is true for the clinical director position because they are also on call,subject to call out and are expected to be in the office during the day to handle the functions.jolly did state,however,that the state clinical director would not need to work sixty plus hour workweeks on a regular basis if camelot was staffed properly and did not have the vacancies in the clinical director positions for the local offices.however,she testified that she could not guarantee that brumbalough was not going to work over hours a week due to camelot staffing problems.at the time brumbalough was terminated,there were vacant clinical director positions in a couple of local camelot offices.
on april,brumbalough filed suit against camelot,alleging that camelot had interfered with her rights under the fmla by terminating her while she was on fmla leave and refusing to reinstate her.on december,camelot filed a motion for summary judgment and,on december,brumbalough filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.on january,brumbalough filed a motion to amend her complaint to add a claim for emotional distress under the fmla.the district court denied brumbalough summary judgment motion,granted camelot motion and subsequently denied brumbalough motion to amend her complaint dismissing this action.this timely appeal on the district court decision on all motions ensued.
ii.standard of review 
motion for summary judgment 
we review a district court order granting summary judgment de novo.smith ameritech,cir.
summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
however,the nonmoving party is not entitled to a trial merely on the basis of allegations.celotex catrett,d.the nonmoving party must come forward with some significant probative evidence to support its claim.id.if the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an essential element,which it has the burden of proof,the moving party is entitled to summary judgment.id.at.
after reviewing the evidence,the court must determine whether sufficient evidence has been presented to make the issue of fact a proper jury question.anderson liberty lobby,d.the facts must be such that if they were proven at trial,a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.id.at.if the court concludes that a reasonable jury could not return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party based on the evidence presented,it may enter a summary judgment.
motion to amend complaint 
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that leave to amend a complaint shall be freely given when justice so requires.fed.civ.p a.in deciding whether to grant a motion to amend,courts should consider undue delay in filing,lack of notice to the opposing party,bad faith by the moving party,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments,undue prejudice to the opposing party,and futility of amendment.see coe bell,cir citing brooks celeste,cir citations omitted.

iii.analysis 
a.the fmla 
the fmla requires certain employers to provide their employees with up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave in the event that the employee has a serious medical condition.a d.however,this entitlement is not without restrictions.the employer may require the employee to submit a medical certification of the employee condition prior to the leave,or as soon as possible,if the leave was taken suddenly.b.as long as the employee is taking fmla leave,the employer may require the employee to submit a recertification of the medical condition as often as every thirty days.
furthermore,upon proper notification,the employer may require the employee to submit a certification by her health care provider as a condition of returning to work.if the employee has not submitted a required certification by the time the employee fmla leave has ended,then the employee may be terminated.c.the fmla also does not require the employer to reinstate an employee after her leave has ceased if the employee is unable to fulfill the essential functions of her job.b.
brumbalough motion for partial summary judgment 
brumbalough appeals the district court denial of her motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of camelot liability.on appeal,brumbalough argues that the district court erred in denying her motion because she was still on fmla leave when she was terminated.
according to brumbalough,camelot improperly required her to submit a certification under the threat of termination because the fmla only permits such an ultimatum to be made when the employee fmla leave has concluded.c u nless the employee provides either a certification or a new medical certification for a serious health condition at the time fmla leave is concluded,the employee may be terminated.emphasis added.
in denying brumbalough motion,the district court found that brumbalough ended her leave when she notified camelot of her intent to return to work on july.brumbalough asserts that her fmla leave did not conclude either until she was able to obtain the medical certification required by camelot for her to return to work or,in the alternative,until september.therefore,brumbalough argues,camelot had no authority to terminate her on august.
while the fmla grants up to twelve weeks of leave,the fmla also permits the employer to require certain documentation before the leave may be covered under the act.as previously mentioned,employers may require an employee to submit a recertification every thirty days in order to continue taking fmla leave.c.the employer must give the employee at least fifteen days to submit such recertification.see d.if the employee fails to provide the recertification and continues to take leave,her leave is no longer covered under the fmla.b.
in the present case,at the inception of brumbalough leave,camelot requested that she submit a medical recertification form if she was still unable to return to work after two months of leave.at.brumbalough leave began on june,and camelot indicated to her that her leave would continue until on or about.id.camelot therefore,providing proper notification,required that brumbalough submit a recertification by august,months into her leave.brumbalough failed to do so accordingly,by august,brumbalough was no longer covered under the fmla.consequently,our analysis must proceed to whether camelot violated brumbalough right to reinstatement under the fmla,not whether brumbalough was unlawfully terminated during fmla coverage the district court denial of brumbalough motion for partial summary judgment is affirmed.
camelot motion for summary judgment 
upon camelot motion for summary judgment,the district court granted the motion,finding that camelot was entitled to terminate brumbalough because she did not submit a proper certification at the conclusion of her fmla leave,and alternatively,because she would have been unable to perform the essential functions of her employment had she been reinstated.
brumbalough challenges the district court decision arguing that summary judgment for camelot was improper because camelot had no authority to terminate brumbalough for failure to submit a certification under c as her fmla leave had not yet ended stalling note of august,qualified as a certification and whether camelot received the august,certification is a question for the jury and there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether she would have been able to perform the essential functions of her employment brumbalough also argues that camelot should have provided her with an alternative position or a reduced leave schedule.
the certification 
camelot required brumbalough to submit a certification by august,in order to be reinstated.brumbalough claims that she sent a note from her doctor to camelot on august,indicating that she was fit for duty.brumbalough also claims that she spoke to jolly,who told brumbalough that the note was insufficient and that camelot would require further documentation before reinstatement.although jolly testified that she never received this note,for the purposes of camelot motion for summary judgment,the district court properly assumed that brumbalough had sent the note to camelot.
the doctor note,in its entirety,states,linda brumbalough may return to work on.she should only work a hour work week and limit her out of town travel to day per week.at.the district court concluded that this note did not meet defendant requirements for a certification,because it did not specify whether brumbalough could perform the essential functions of her job.at.the district court therefore found that termination was proper because brumbalough failed to provide a specific certification to her employer.
although the fmla permits employers to require a certification prior to reinstatement,the relevant regulation states the following 
an employer may seek certification only with regard to the particular health condition that caused the employee need for fmla leave.the certification itself need only be a simple statement of an employee ability to return to work.a health care provider employed by the employer may contact the employee health care provider with the employee permission,for purposes of clarification of the employee fitness to return to work.no additional information may be acquired,and clarification may be requested only for the serious health condition for which fmla leave was taken.the employer may not delay the employee return to work while contact with the health care provider is being made.
c emphasis added.there is no controlling case law on what a simple statement of an employee ability to return to work must include to be sufficient under the regulations.however,a plain reading of this regulation indicates that the certification need only state that the employee can return to work.while the employer may require more information,the regulation clearly states that the employer can not delay reinstating the employee simply because the employer is obtaining further information or clarification from the employee health care provider.id.moreover,an employer may not impose requirements that conflict with the fmla and its regulations.cavin honda,cir.
this view is bolstered by the fact that the fmla and accompanying regulations lay out in specific detail what must be included in an initial medical certification,whereas the regulations expressly state that only a simple statement is needed in a certification.compare b stating that medical certification of a serious health problem will be sufficient when it includes the date that the problems began,the probable duration of the ailment,all other appropriate medical facts regarding the condition,a statement that the employee is unable to perform work functions,as well as any requirements regarding intermittent leave,with c requiring only a simple statement of the employee ability to return to work.see also cooper olin,cir observing that there are more stringent requirements for medical certification than for the certification mathews fairview health,wl,at,finding that a slip by a doctor which stated only that the employee could return to work and should not work more than hours in a period,was a sufficient certification which required immediate reinstatement underhill willamina lumber,wl,at finding that a letter from the employee doctor stating that the employee can return to work is specific enough to constitute a certification and require reinstatement regardless of whether defendant had concerns about plaintiff ability to do his job.
accordingly,we hold that once an employee submits a statement from her health care provider which indicates that she may return to work,the employer duty to reinstate her has been triggered under the fmla therefore,we reverse the district court conclusion that brumbalough certification was inadequate and conclude that camelot was required to reinstate brumbalough upon receipt of stalling august,note.if camelot decided that the same note was insufficient as a certification,it should have sought clarification from brumbalough doctor.since,in this case,there is a genuine issue as to the material fact of whether camelot received the august,note,we remand the case for further.
essential functions of employment 
in granting camelot motion for summary judgment,the district court alternatively concluded that regardless of the timely submission of a certification,camelot was entitled to terminate brumbalough because brumbalough would have been unable to perform the essential functions of her job upon her return.see b if the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition,including the continuation of a serious health condition,the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the fmla.
determining what functions are essential to a particular position is a question of fact.see skrjanc great lakes power serv,cir stating that whether the employee could have returned to his old job upon the conclusion of his fmla leave is a question of fact see also hall united states postal,cir holding that determination of whether qualifications are essential functions of a job requires the court to engage in a highly inquiry and that such a determination should be based on more than statements in a job description and should reflect the actual functioning and circumstances of the particular enterprise involved federal and state guide to employee medical leave benefits and disabilities law stating that under the also uses the term essential functions determining whether or not a particular job function is essential requires a factual determination made on a basis citing pt.app.n.
the parties presented the following evidence regarding whether brumbalough could perform the essential functions of the state clinical director if she had been reinstated after her leave concluded.
in a letter that camelot sent to brumbalough doctor,the company stated 
in considering your decision to so certify that brumbalough is fit for duty,we ask that you review linda job description and a related document entitled procedure for supervision of clinical managers and other clinical supervisors.we also ask that you consider that linda job as involved in the past,and will likely involve in the future,the requirement that linda be hours a day,seven days a week.in addition,during crisis situations or whenever she is required to act as a substitute clinical director when a vacancy occurs in one of the facilities she supervises,she may be working beyond a typical forty hour workweek.finally,her travel schedule of one visit per month to all of the facilities she supervises will remain intact,as will the requirement that she conduct quarterly reviews of her facilities.
at.a review of camelot job description form for the state clinical director programs reveals nothing helpful because it fails to quantify the number of hours the state clinical director may have to work.at.the form,in a section entitled essential duties and responsibilities,only lists,in a qualitative fashion,the people that state clinical director will oversee,the programs that the state clinical director will supervise.at.the second document that was sent to brumbalough doctor describes the procedures for supervision of clinical managers,and its only relevance here is that it lists individual case consultations and emergency,as needed as one of the state clinical director supervisory duties.at.
brumbalough initial certification stated that she should only work a hour workweek and limit her travel to one day per week.a second letter written by brumbalough doctor on august,stated that brumbalough may return to work with some modifications of duties while she continues to
