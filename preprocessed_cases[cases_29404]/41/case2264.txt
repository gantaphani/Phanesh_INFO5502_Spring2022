jose appeals the order of the district court permitting appellee,the united states the government,to medicate him involuntarily to render him competent for trial.we vacate and remand.
background 
defendant was indicted on january,as a alien found in the united states in violation of defendant is subject to a maximum prison term of twenty years,and the government calculates his likely sentencing range under the advisory sentencing guidelines as months.on may,defendant moved for a competency examination.on september,the district court found defendant incompetent to stand trial and committed him to the custody of the attorney general pursuant to.defendant subsequently was transferred to the united states medical center for federal prisoners in springfield,missouri.
on march,the government requested an evidentiary hearing on its motion to medicate defendant involuntarily to render him competent to stand trial.alternatively,the government requested an order directing the medical center to evaluate defendant for dangerousness.at a hearing held on march,the district court granted the motion to medicate defendant involuntarily.the district court issued a written order to that effect on march,and defendant timely appealed.on april,a motions panel of this court stayed the involuntary medication order pending the outcome of this appeal.consequently,defendant has not yet been medicated pursuant to the terms of the district court order.
discussion 
the parties agree that sell united states,d,governs the instant dispute.in that case,the united states moved to medicate a criminal defendant involuntarily to restore his competency for trial.on appeal from the trial court order granting the government motion,which the eighth circuit had affirmed,the supreme court considered whether the constitution permits the government to administer antipsychotic drugs involuntarily to a mentally ill criminal order to render that defendant competent to stand trial for serious,but nonviolent,crimes.sell,at.the court concluded that the constitution allows the government to do so in limited circumstances.id.
the supreme court began its analysis in sell by reviewing its earlier decisions in washington harper,d,and riggins nevada,d.in harper,the supreme court recognized that an individual has a significant liberty interest under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs.harper,at.the court concluded,however,that a state interest in administering medication to a dangerous inmate is legitimate and important,id.at,and held that the due process clause allows a state to treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will,if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate medical interest.id.at.in riggins,the supreme court overturned an order permitting involuntary medication to render a defendant competent for trial on the basis that the district court did not acknowledge the defendant liberty interest in freedom from unwanted antipsychotic drugs.at.it concluded that t his error may well have impaired constitutionally protected trial rights,by affecting the defendant demeanor,testimony,ability to follow proceedings,and communications with counsel.id.sell synthesized these two decisions as follows 
harper and riggins indicate that the constitution permits the government involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill defendant facing serious criminal charges in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial,but only if the treatment is medically appropriate,is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial,and,taking account of less intrusive alternatives,is necessary significantly to further important governmental interests.
this standard will permit involuntary administration of drugs solely for trial competence purposes in certain instances.but those instances may be rare.that is because the standard says or fairly implies that the trial court must make four findings.
first,the court must find that important governmental interests are at stake.id.at.emphasis in original.
the government interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of a serious crime is important.that is so whether the offense is a serious crime against the person or a serious crime against property.in both instances the government seeks to protect through application of the criminal law the basic need for security.
courts,however,must consider the facts of the individual case in evaluating the government interest in prosecution.special circumstances may lessen the importance of that interest the potential for future civil confinement affects,but does not totally undermine,the strength of the need for prosecution.the same is true of the possibility that the defendant has already been confined for a significant amount of time for which he would receive credit toward any sentence ultimately imposed,see b.moreover,the government has a concomitant,constitutionally essential interest in assuring that the defendant trial is a fair one.
id.internal citations omitted.
second,the court must conclude that involuntary medication will significantly further those concomitant state interests.id.at.emphasis in original.specifically,the court must find that the administration of the drugs is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial and substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the defendant ability to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense.id.
third,the court must conclude that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests.id.emphasis in original.it must be shown that any alternative,less intrusive methods are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results and the court must consider less intrusive means for administering the drugs,such as a court order backed by the contempt power.id.
finally,the court must find that administration of the drugs is medically appropriate,in the patient best medical interest in light of his medical condition.id.emphasis in original.after identifying these four required findings,the supreme court stressed that a sell inquiry is independent of the procedure that allows involuntary medication of dangerous inmates under harper.in fact,the court stated explicitly that consideration of an involuntary medication order based on dangerousness is preferable to consideration of an order intended to render a defendant competent for trial 
a court need not consider whether to allow forced medication to render a defendant competent for trial,if forced medication is warranted for a different purpose,such as the purposes set out in harper related to the individual dangerousness,or purposes related to the individual own interests where refusal to take drugs puts his health gravely at risk.there are often strong reasons for a court to determine whether forced administration of drugs can be justified on these alternative grounds before turning to the trial competence question.
for one thing,the inquiry into whether medication is permissible,say,to render an individual nondangerous is usually more objective and manageable than the inquiry into whether medication is permissible to render a defendant competent.the medical experts may find it easier to provide an informed opinion about whether,given the risk of side effects,particular drugs are medically appropriate and necessary to control a patient potentially dangerous behavior or to avoid serious harm to the patient himself than to try to balance harms and benefits related to the more quintessentially legal questions of trial fairness and competence.
for another thing,courts typically address involuntary medical treatment as a civil matter,and justify it on these alternative,grounds.
even if a court decides medication can not be authorized on the alternative grounds,the findings underlying such a decision will help to inform expert opinion and judicial decisionmaking in respect to a request to administer drugs for trial competence purposes we consequently believe that a court,asked to approve forced administration of drugs for purposes of rendering a defendant competent to stand trial,should ordinarily determine whether the government seeks,or has first sought,permission for forced administration of drugs on these other grounds and,if not,why not.
id.at.internal citations omitted emphasis in original.in remanding the case to the district court,the sell court noted that the government could pursue multiple grounds for forced medication on remand,including the danger sell poses to himself or others.id.at.
because certain aspects of sell are particularly relevant to the instant appeal,we discuss them in depth below and apply them to the instant case.but before we do,we must address a threshold question whether the district court had an obligation to apply harper and make a dangerousness inquiry before proceeding under sell.
as we have held previously,t he supreme court clearly intends courts to explore other procedures,such as harper hearings which are to be employed in the case of dangerousness before considering involuntary medication orders under sell.united states,cir parenthetical in original.because sell orders are disfavored,the district court,in an ordinary case,should refrain from proceeding with the sell inquiry before examining dangerousness and other bases to administer medication forcibly.accordingly,prior to undertaking the sell inquiry,a district court ordinarily should make a specific determination on the record that no other basis for forcibly administering medication is reasonably available.if a district court does not conduct a dangerousness inquiry under harper,it should state for the record why it is not doing so.
at the hearing in this case,the district court undertook the sell inquiry without making any findings regarding the availability or appropriateness of other means forcibly to medicate defendant.it did so,however,only after the government had made clear that it did not intend to seek involuntary medication on dangerousness grounds,a position that it has reiterated on this appeal.as it emphasized in its brief to this court although the government offered evidence of defendant potential danger to others while in custody,it did not seek to have defendant forcibly medicated based on dangerousness,and wolfson shied away from defendant dangerous conduct while in custody as a basis for forcibly medicating him.red br.
because the government disclaimed any opportunity to make a showing of dangerousness under harper,we can not fault the district court for honoring the parties agreement to proceed directly to the sell inquiry.we emphasize,however,that sell inquiries are disfavored in part because the medical opinions required for a sell order are more,and thus more subject to error,than those required for a harper analysis.see sell,at.for one thing,the inquiry into whether medication is permissible,say,to render an individual nondangerous is usually more objective and manageable than the inquiry into whether medication is permissible to render a defendant competent.a defendant liberty interest in avoiding unnecessary involuntary medication is too important to allow for situations in which the court is asked to undertake the more analysis for what may be arbitrary or tactical reasons.because we vacate the district court order on other grounds,on remand the district court may wish to inquire further as to the government reasons for not seeking involuntary medication on the basis of dangerousness,and should note for the record its reasons for not proceeding under harper,before undertaking the sell inquiry 
we now move to the district court application of the sell factors.neither the supreme court nor this circuit has specified the standard of review applicable to a sell order.two of our sister circuits,however,have passed on this question.in united states gomes,cir,the second circuit held that the first sell seriousness of the underlying a legal question subject to de novo review,and that the remaining sell factors are factual questions that should be reviewed for clear error.see id.at.the tenth circuit,however,held that both the first and second sell factors are legal questions that should be reviewed de novo.see united states bradley,cir.
we agree with the second circuit.while the importance of an asserted governmental interest is an issue that this court is to review and evaluate for itself in the first instance,the question of whether medicating a particular defendant involuntarily would significantly further the asserted governmental interests at stake typically involves substantial questions of fact.resolution of such questions is best left to the district court and must be accorded deference on appeal.accordingly,we follow the second circuit approach and review the district court determinations with regard to the first sell factor de novo,and the remaining sell factors for clear error.see gomes,at.
sell does not identify a requisite degree of specificity concerning the drugs to be used for involuntary medication.however,it does imply that a court should consider these issues at a detailed level the specific kinds of drugs at issue may matter here as elsewhere.different kinds of antipsychotic drugs may produce different side effects and enjoy different levels of success.id.at.see also,at discussing sell and stating that s pecificity as to the medications to be administered is critical id.at stating that the court must develop a record that gives attention to the type of drugs proposed,their dosage,and the expected duration of a person exposure citation omitted.
sell discussion of specificity would have little meaning if a district court were required to consider specific drugs at a sell hearing but then could grant the bureau of prisons unfettered discretion in its medication of a defendant.while sell appropriately does not direct district courts to micromanage the decisions of medical professionals,reading it as imposing no limits upon the discretion of the treating physicians would render judicial inquiry about specific drugs academic.a broad grant of discretion to medical professionals also risks distracting such professionals from sell narrow purpose of restoring a defendant competency for trial.see sell,at.the failure to focus upon trial competence could well have mattered.whether a particular drug will tend to sedate a defendant,interfere with communication with counsel,prevent rapid reaction to trial developments,or diminish the ability to express emotions are matters important in determining the permissibility of medication to restore competence,but not necessarily relevant when dangerousness is primarily at issue.internal citation omitted.
sell appears to anticipate physicians resistance to specific judicial direction regarding treatments that are acceptable for the purpose of rendering a defendant competent to stand trial 
the medical experts may find it easier to provide an informed opinion about whether,given the risk of side effects,particular drugs are medically appropriate and necessary to control a patient potentially dangerous behavior or to avoid serious harm to the patient himself than to try to balance harms and benefits related to the more quintessentially legal questions of trial fairness and competence.
id.at.the court noted the strong reasons that often exist for justifying forced medication on other grounds,and observed that instances in which an order for involuntary medication would be appropriate under sell may be rare.id.at.read together,these statements indicate that the proper approach to physicians understandable chafing under the particularized judicial direction required by sell is not to grant physicians unlimited discretion in their efforts to restore a defendant to competency for trial but rather,if the facts warrant,to find another legal basis for involuntary medication.
accordingly,we hold that a sell order must provide some limitations on the specific medications that may be administered and the maximum dosages and duration of treatment.at a minimum,to pass muster under sell,the district court order must identify the speci
