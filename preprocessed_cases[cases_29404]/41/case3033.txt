background 
the technology in this case pertains to diagnostic tools that not only detect but also classify hepatitis c virus hcv genotypes in a biological sample,which facilitates tailoring the treatment of patients with different genotypes.the patent claims a method of genotyping hcv based on distinct genetic sequences that can be found in the prime untranslated region utr of the hcv genome.this method teaches specifically hybridizing probes,or short strands of nucleic acids,to a target sequence in the utr via complementary base pairing principles,and then detecting the formation of any complexes formed between the probes and the nucleic acids of the utr.
abbott genotyping assay kits,like the method claimed in the patent,also involve specifically hybridizing probes to the nucleic acids of the hcv utr.the kits then detect the successful formation of any specifically hybridized complexes using the process of realtime polymerase chain reaction pcr.through this process,dye molecules attached to abbott probes are released and observable as fluorescent signals after polymerase enzymes destroy the hybridized complexes.
innogenetics sued abbott,asserting that abbott genotyping assay kits infringe claims,and of the patent.claim,the only independent claim on appeal,reads in its entirety as follows 
a method of genotyping hcv present in a biological sample comprising hybridizing nucleic acids in a biological sample with at least one probe and detecting a complex as formed with said probe and said nucleic acids of hcv,using a probe that specifically hybridizes to the domain extending from the nucleotides at positions to of the untranslated region of the hcv.
abbott moved for summary judgment,asserting that its kits were not infringing,that the patent was invalid,and that the patent had been procured by inequitable conduct.in its order denying abbott motions,the district court construed the claim limitation detecting a complex as formed to mean detecting a complex that is or has been formed.the district court also construed the limitation in the preamble,method of genotyping,to mean a method that distinguishes among types subtypes of hepatitis c virus hcv and classifies the hcv into a genotype or subtype.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court denied abbott motion and granted innogenetics motion,concluding that abbott had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to require a trial on the issue of inequitable conduct.furthermore,the district court deemed abbott inequitable conduct claim exceptional and awarded attorney fees to innogenetics.
at the final conference,the district court granted innogenetics motion in limine and excluded testimony on obviousness by abbott witness,patterson.however,the written order commemorating the conference rulings inaccurately stated that defendant was precluded from entering any evidence of obviousness at trial.aware of the mistake,abbott nonetheless never moved for correction or reconsideration of the written order,noting only that it wished to preserve an objection on the issue.additionally,the district court precluded the following evidence related to anticipation patent the cha patent on the grounds that abbott did not disclose the patent as an anticipating prior art reference until the last day of discovery and any testimony beyond the actual words and content of the cha pct application from cha,the inventor of the cha patent and the cha pct application,on the grounds that he had not been tendered as an expert witness and that an expert report had not been submitted.
because abbott conceded that its entire noninfringement argument had been predicated on a construction of the claims that the court had not adopted,the district court entered judgment as a matter of law of literal infringement against abbott for literal infringement of claims,and of the patent.the case then proceeded to a bifurcated jury trial with only abbott affirmative defense of anticipation tried during the liability phase.at trial,abbott presented the international patent application for the invention claimed in the cha patent and the testimony of its expert,bruce patterson,that the resnick patent anticipated claim of the patent.however,before the case went to the jury,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law of no anticipation by the resnick patent based on its determination that patterson testimony rested on an inaccurate understanding of the construction of the limitation genotyping.the jury concluded that claim of the patent was not anticipated during the damages phase of trial,the jury awarded million in damages to innogenetics and found abbott infringement to be willful.
the district court denied abbott motion for a new trial on infringement and invalidity and for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial on damages.however,the district court did grant abbott motion for judgment as a matter of law that infringement was not willful.the district court also granted innogenetics motion for a permanent injunction.
on appeal,abbott challenges a myriad of issues,including the district court claim construction,summary judgment of literal infringement,evidentiary exclusions as to abbott obviousness and anticipation defenses,judgment as a matter of law that the resnick patent did not anticipate claim of the patent,summary judgment of no inequitable conduct,award of attorney fees to innogenetics for abbott counterclaim of inequitable conduct due to its exceptionality,and grant of a permanent injunction.on,innogenetics challenges the district court judgment as a matter of law overturning the jury verdict of willful infringement.we address each of these issues in turn.
infringementa.claim construction 
we begin our inquiry with the district court claim construction,which we review de novo.cybor fas,en banc.abbott takes umbrage with the district court construction of the word as from the claim limitation detecting a complex as formed with said probe and said nucleic acids of hcv.according to abbott,the word as limits the claims at issue to detecting hybridized complexes in a contemporaneous manner.hence,abbott asserts that its products are not encompassed by the patent because they detect the formation of a hybridized complex through the observation of fluorescence emitted after the complex has been destroyed,and not the actual complex itself.we conclude that the claim language makes no such distinction.abbott proposed construction unduly limits the claims of the patent by divorcing the word as from its full context,as formed with said probe and said nucleic acids of hcv.the district court properly construed the claim limitation as detecting the formation of complexes,regardless of whether the method of detecting requires destroying the complex itself.
in determining the meaning of a disputed claim limitation,we look primarily to the intrinsic evidence of record,examining the claim language,the written description,and the prosecution history.phillips awh,en banc.words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art.id.at.claims are read in view of the specification,which is the single best guide to the meaning of disputed terms.id.at.in examining the specification for proper context,however,this court will not at any time import limitations from the specification into the claims.collegenet,applyyourself,citing teleflex,ficosa am.
a plain reading of the claim limitation suggests that it does just what it detects the formation of a complex between a probe and nucleic acids of the hcv.nowhere does the claim language suggest that it only detects the complex itself.indeed,in an expert report submitted by innogenetics,william reznikoff,a molecular genetics expert,opined that,in the context of the entire patent and its prosecution history,one ordinarily skilled in the art would understand claim to include detecting any complexes that have been formed.abbott provides no expert opinions on how a person ordinarily skilled in the art would have a different understanding of the claim limitation.nor does abbott ever contest the credibility of reznikoff understanding.
while we may not be in as able a position as the district court to ferret out the credibility of an expert,reznikoff reading is supported by the intrinsic evidence.the specification of the patent explicitly states that the detection of hybrids may be determined by means of colorimetric,fluorescent,radiometric detection or any other method comprised in the state of the art.patent emphasis added.abbott contends that the written description constricts the claim limitation to a method of contemporaneous detection because the described embodiments all feature detection of an actual complex.however,as is well established,an applicant is not required to describe in the specification every conceivable and possible future embodiment of his invention.sri int l matsushita of.given the sparse but broad statements in the specification about how the claimed invention detects hybridized complexes,see patent,abbott reading of the process of detection improperly narrows the claim language.
lastly,relying on various dictionaries,abbott argues that the word as is correctly defined as at the same time that while.abbott reliance on a single dictionary definition without where as has multiple the very error of construction that we warned against in phillips.see at the main problem with elevating the dictionary to such prominence is that it focuses the inquiry on the abstract meaning of words rather than on the meaning of claim limitations within the context of the patent.in context,the use of the word as is merely syntactical,linking the word complex to a description of its composition.see online dictionary.com dictionary as last visited,defining as to mean when considered in a specified form or used before a preposition or a participle,as illustrated by the phrase,my opinion as distinguished from his.
as the district court pointed out,there is little meaningful distinction between a method of detecting the hybridized complex itself and a method of detecting the hybridized complex through fluorescence emitted immediately after it is destroyed.what is detected is still a complex formed with said probe and said nucleic acids of hcv.we uphold the district court claim construction because it is consistent with our understanding of the claim limitation at issue.
judgment as a matter of law of literal infringement 
we affirm the jmol entered against abbott for literal infringement of claims,and of the patent because it has not properly raised any plausible arguments on appeal.given that the district court did not adopt abbott proposed claim construction,the sole defense against literal infringement asserted by abbott was that realtime pcr,the method of detection used in its assay kits,was not known to the ordinary artisan at the time of the filing of the patent application.however,the district court deemed this issue forfeited because abbott did not raise this issue before trial when it could have been given thorough consideration.instead it raised the issue for the first time at on the night before the start of trial and did so simply by submitting a proposed jury instruction,rather than by bringing the matter directly to the attention of the court and opposing counsel.
we review procedural issues not unique to patent law under regional circuit law.bowling hasbro.absent extraordinary circumstances,the seventh circuit has stated that it rarely reaches forfeited arguments in civil litigation.ocean atl.dev.aurora christian,cir.abbott belief that there was no need to raise its argument prior to the court adopting a claim construction not proposed by either party falls well short of extraordinary.accordingly,we affirm the district court finding that abbott had been fully heard on the issue of literal infringement and that there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for abbott on that issue.see.
it should be noted that,forfeiture aside,abbott argument lacks merit.essentially,abbott argues that a patent can never be literally infringed by embodiments that did not exist at the time of filing.our case law allows for technology to be captured within the literal scope of valid claims that are drafted broadly enough.see superguide directv,finding that the claim limitation regularly received television signal is broad enough to encompass digital signals even though no televisions that could receive digital signals existed as of the filing date.
additionally,abbott itself has put forth evidence that realtime pcr did in fact exist by the time the inventors filed their pct application in,and by the time they applied for the patent in.in his expert report,abbott witness,bruce patterson,stated that realtime pcr using to exonuclease activity was pioneered around abbott does not dispute this evidence.we have no reason to disturb the district court grant of jmol as to literal infringement.
ii.invalidity 
abbott challenges the district court denial of its motion for a new trial on the issue of invalidity on a number of evidentiary exclusions.regional circuit law governs our review of motions for a new trial.emi group,cypress semiconductor.under seventh circuit law,the district court denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see naeem mckesson drug,cir.a new trial may be granted where the verdict is against the weight of the evidence,the damages are excessive,or if for other reasons the trial was not fair to the moving party.id.internal quotations omitted.evidentiary rulings are also reviewed for abuse of discretion.wollenburg comtech,cir citations omitted.
obviousness 
abbott contends that it was clear error for the district court to preclude abbott obviousness defense.during the discovery period,the district court granted innogenetics motion to strike patterson supplemental expert report because it violated the court earlier order on the filing of such supplemental reports.abbott does not contest that ruling.this left abbott with only patterson original expert report for his planned testimony on obviousness.the district court determined that the report was insufficient to support a jury finding of obviousness and thus failed the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a.therefore,at the final pretrial conference,it granted innogenetics motion in limine,and excluded patterson from testifying about obviousness at trial.
however,the written order commemorating the conference rulings inaccurately stated that defendant was precluded from entering any evidence of obviousness at trial.aware of the mistake,abbott nonetheless never moved for correction or reconsideration of the written order.instead,it advised plaintiff counsel in writing that it would not be contesting the written ruling and would put in no evidence of obviousness.abbott confirmed this decision on the first day of trial,noting only that it wished to preserve an objection on the issue,the district court denied abbott rule b motion for a new trial on obviousness because abbott,despite its knowledge from the very beginning that the written order was inaccurate,was only then seeking correction by way of overturning the jury unfavorable verdict against it.abbott now appeals the district court denial of its motion for a new trial on obviousness on the grounds that patterson testimony on the issue was excluded and that,furthermore,no other evidence on the issue was allowed.because the district court rulings were not an abuse of discretion,we leave the jury verdict intact.
patterson testimony 
the district court did not err in finding that patterson report on the alleged obviousness of the asserted claims of the patent was deficient for purposes of disclosure under rule.for each of the claims that he analyzes for obviousness,patterson merely lists a number of prior art references and then concludes with the stock phrase to one skilled in the art it would have been obvious to perform the genotyping method in claims of the patent.t here must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness.in re kahn,see also ksr int l teleflex,d to facilitate review,this analysis should be made explicit.citing kahn,at.nowhere does patterson state how or why a person ordinarily skilled in the art would have found the claims of the patent obvious in light of some combination of those particular references.as the district court found it is not credible to think that a lay jury could examine the cha application,the resnick patent that defendant cited as prior art or any of the other references and determine on its own whether there were differences among them and the patent.innogenetics,abbott,slip op.at.such vague testimony would not have been helpful to a lay jury in avoiding the pitfalls of hindsight that belie a determination of obviousness.see graham john deere,d discussing the importance of guarding against hindsight and resist ing the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue when considering the obviousness of a patent.
on appeal,abbott argues in a single sentence,without any explanation,that the district court erred in concluding that patterson did not offer any evidence of a motivation to combine the various prior art references that he opined rendered the claims of the patent obvious.to be sure,patterson suggested that one of skill in the art was motivated to find a method capable of genotyping because at least one prior art reference had disclosed that different genotypes of hcv respond differently to interferon therapy.the district court was nevertheless correct that knowledge of a problem and motivation to solve it are entirely different from motivation to combine particular references to reach the particular claimed method.innogenetics,slip op.at a generalized motivation to develop a method is not the kind of motivation required by the patent laws.we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it precluded patterson vague and conclusory obviousness testimony which did not offer any motivation for one skilled in the art to combine the particular references he cites in order to practice the claimed method 
abbott also argues that there is no requirement that an expert opine on motivation to combine references,and that motivation can be established by other witnesses or the prior art.abbott is correct that an expert is not the only source for evidence that it would be obvious for one skilled in the art to combine references to reach the claimed method.but,as the district court held,some kind of motivation must be shown from some source,so that the jury can understand why a person of ordinary skill would have thought of either combining two or more references or modifying one to achieve the patented method.id.at.however,as we discuss in the next section,abbott was precluded from offering any other evidence of obviousness,due to abbott own failure to notify the district court of its error in its preclusion order,and this determination was not an abuse of discretion.
preclusion of all evidence of obviousness 
even in the face of the inaccurate preclusion order,we conclude that the district court denial of a new trial on the issue of obviousness was well within its discretion.in the seventh circuit,a new trial is granted only when the record shows that the jury verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice or where the verdict,on the record,cries out to be overturned or shocks our conscience.latino kaizer,cir internal quotations omitted.this is hardly a case that cries out to be overturned or shocks our conscience.in its opening brief,abbott only support for its argument that it had suffered prejudice from not being able to present other witnesses on obviousness is the bald statement that some of its other witnesses could have established invalidity under.speculation is not sufficient to demonstrate prejudice.the district court found,and our review of the record does not show otherwise,that abbott said nothing about what these witnesses would have had to say about obviousness in specific.innogenetics,slip op.at without such information,i can not determine whether defendant was prejudiced by not being permitted to adduce evidence on obviousness.without having provided any satisfactory explanation as to why it waited until the conclusion of trial to alert the court to the inaccurate order,abbott will have to bear the cost of being precluded from presenting any evidence of obviousness at trial.for the above reasons,the district court did not abuse its discretion denying abbott a new trial on the issue of obviousness.
anticipation 
cha testimony 
for purposes of showing that the claims of the patent were anticipated by prior art and thus invalid,abbott sought to introduce at trial the testimony of cha,the inventor and author of three prior art references,including the cha pct application,which was before the jury.the district court confined cha testimony to the actual words and content of the cha pct application because an expert report was required even though abbott had only disclosed cha as a fact witness and,pursuant to.a a,as an expert who had not been specially retained.the district court concluded that,given cha role as the inventor behind the application,the mere fact that he was not receiving compensation for his scientific testimony did not exempt abbott from furnishing an expert report.without information about the proposed content of cha de facto expert testimony,innogenetics would not have been able to prepare an adequate deposition or.
on appeal,abbott contends that t here is no requirement that a retained expert,rather than the prior art author,provide an explanation of how the ordinary artisan would have understood a reference disclosures.abbott entirely fails to address the district court reason for restricting cha witnesses who will be giving scientific testimony are not exempt from the report requirements of rule a b,even when they are not compensated for their work.in sum,the district court concluded that abbott should have provided an expert report to innogenetics for cha specialized testimony.the seventh circuit has expressly left open the question of whether experts not specially retained but providing scientific testimony must comply with rule a b,see musser gentiva health,cir,and we need not reach this issue since abbott has not challenged this determination.
the district court also concluded that cha testimony should be limited because any information he might have to offer beyond the words of the cha pct application would be irrelevant to the issue before the jury of whether the cha pct application was sufficient in itself to have informed a person of ordinary skill in the art in how to distinguish among hcv genotypes by using probes in the utr.as the inventor behind the cha pct application,cha could have added information that might not have been understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art just from reading the application,such as the conditions he used for his experiments or explanations for anomalous results.again,abbott fails to address the district court reasoning or discuss how cha testimony would inform the jury of how the ordinary artisan would understand the disclosures of the cha pct application.therefore,we affirm the district court evidentiary ruling because it was not an abuse of its discretion.
the cha patent 
abbott did not disclose the cha patent as an anticipatory prior art reference under until the last day of discovery,after the time for depositions had passed.abbott had not discussed the cha patent in an expert report,identified it during discovery in response to innogenetics interrogatories on anticipation,or mentioned it in the final pretrial conference.abbott did not refer to the cha patent again until the eve of trial,when abbott sought to amend the district court jury instructions to include the cha patent in the jury instructions specific to anticipation.finding that the belated introduction of the cha patent as an anticipatory prior art reference was prejudicial to innogenetics,the district court excluded the cha patent from consideration on the issue of anticipation.
although abbott technically complied with the requirements of,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the cha patent from trial.abbott disclosure of the cha patent as an anticipatory prior art reference on the very last day of discovery meant innogenetics was stripped of any meaningful opportunity to prepare an adequate of the reference.see atd lydall,the purpose of,like that of the federal rules,is to prevent unfair and prejudicial surprise,not to facilitate production of evidence.that innogenetics had an expert analyze the cha patent in the context of inequitable conduct does not mean,as abbott would have us believe,that abbott late disclosure did not prejudice innogenetics on the issue of validity under.the district court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the cha patent 
jmol of no anticipation by the resnick patent 
abbott argues on appeal that the district court erred in granting jmol of no anticipation of claim of the patent by the resnick patent and in denying its motion for a new trial on the same basis the district court grant of jmol was predicated on its determination that patterson testimony with regard to anticipation by the resnick patent rested on an inaccurate understanding of the construction of the term genotyping.innogenetics,slip op.at.
this determination by the district court,that patterson testimony was tainted by an inaccurate understanding of the claim term genotyping,is clearly erroneous.at trial,patterson testified on behalf of abbott that the resnick patent anticipated claim of the patent.specifically,he stated that the resnick patent disclosed probes that distinguish between two groups of hepatitis c isolates one containing hepatitis c and the types of hepatitis opposing counsel objected,arguing that patterson use of the word distinguish at trial was inappropriate because his expert report submitted under rule defined a method of genotyping as the process of detecting and classifying the different strains of the virus as manifested by nucleotide sequence variation in a certain region of the virus genome.in other words,genotyping detects and classifies the various genotypes of a virus,such as,in the case of hcv,and.docket.patterson expert.
the dispute over whether patterson based his testimony on the district court claim construction seems to turn upon his use of the words detect and classify and the district court use of the words distinguish and classify in its construction of a method of genotyping as a method that distinguishes among types subtypes of hepatitis c virus hcv and classifies the hcv into a genotype or subtype.despite the difference in semantics,we discern no difference in meaning between the definition of genotyping used by patterson and the one adopted by the district court.
the patent,by its own terms,differs from the prior art in its ability not just to detect the presence of hcv,but more importantly,to identify the types subtypes of hcv that exist in a sample.the specification of the patent states 
several patent applications have addressed the problem of detecting the presence of hcv furthermore,the ur of hcv isolates has been proven to be a good candidate for designing probes and primers for general hcv detection however,none of these patent applications presents a method of identifying the type subtype of hcv present in the sample to be analyzed consequently,the aim of the present invention is to provide a method for the rapid and indisputable determination of the presence of one or several genotypes of hcv present in a biological sample and indisputably classifying the determined isolate s.
patent emphasis added.as disclosed,the method of genotyping in the patent requires more than simply determining whether hcv is present,detecting hcv in a sample.it requires detecting hcv,and then distinguishing among one or more of the types subtypes of hcv and being able to classify the types subtypes found.certainly,one of the preferred embodiments of the patent is capable of distinguishing among all six presently known types of hcv using multiple probes.patent.
to the extent,however,that innogenetics argues that a method of genotyping requires identifying both the presence and the absence of types in a sample and thereby distinguishing among all six types of hcv,it is in error.oral arg.tr,i t the ability to exclude it the ability to say i know what i have and i know what i do have you may or may not be able to say that you do have something else that is in the contaminated sample you might be able to say i got type a and type b,but you ca say a negative,that i do have type or type.claim is not so narrow as to require a method capable of identifying every possible genotype of hcv present and absent in a sample.in fact,claim states that the claimed method of genotyping may be performed with at least one probe.this contemplates infringement by a method that uses a single probe to detect and classify the presence of a single type of hcv.a single probe would not be capable of identifying what genotypes are present along with what genotypes are not present in a sample a single probe could not distinguish and classify all six types.in short,the method of genotyping in claim covers a method capable of detecting and classifying at least one particular type of hcv without necessarily identifying the absence of all other types.this is the only definition consistent with the language of the claim itself and is supported by the written description.
in this respect,patterson expert report and trial testimony are both consistent with the construction of method of genotyping.in his expert report,patterson stated that the resnick patent is capable of detecting and classifying types of hcv.docket patterson expert.at trial,contradicting the testimony of innogenetics witnesses,he testified that the resnick patent distinguish es between two groups of hcv,type hcv and all other types of hcv.trial tr.vol.patterson reading of the resnick patent was that it disclosed a method capable of identifying whether a sample contained hcv type as opposed to another type of hcv.if true,this would meet the method of genotyping limitation of claim patterson failure to use the district court exact words does not change the substance of his testimony or render it inapplicable.
we therefore find improper the district court preclusion of patterson testimony on the basis that he was using a different definition of method of genotyping.accordingly,we reverse the district court entry of jmol and remand for a new trial on the issue of whether the resnick patent anticipated claim of the patent consistent with this opinion.
