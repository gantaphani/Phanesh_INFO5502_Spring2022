the issue in this case is whether a claim for patent infringement should have been brought in a prior case between the parties and is now precluded by the prior judgment.acumed llc acumed appeals a decision of the united states district court for the district of oregon dismissing its action against stryker,et,stryker as barred by claim preclusion.specifically,the district court held that acumed present infringement suit against stryker was precluded by a prior infringement suit between the parties which was resolved by a final judgment on the merits,namely acumed llc stryker,wl or.april,acumed i.because the district court misconstrued this court precedent regarding the manner in which claim preclusion applies to successive claims for patent infringement,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in april,acumed sued stryker for infringement of united states patent the patent.the patent is directed to an intermedullary nail for fixing fractures of the proximal humeral cortex.patent.the accused product in acumed i was stryker proximal humeral nail phn,which is used to treat proximal humeral bone fractures.
during discovery in acumed i,acumed learned that stryker had developed a longer version of the phn named the long.acumed also obtained manufacturing drawings,development documents,and other information about the long.however,stryker was not marketing the long in the united states during discovery,and presumably for this reason,acumed did not amend its acumed i complaint to add an infringement claim based on the long.
in april,roughly four months after the close of fact discovery in acumed i,stryker began publicly marketing and selling the long in the united states.acumed,however,did not inquire as to the commercial status of the long in the united states until july.after receiving acumed inquiry,stryker informed acumed that it did not view the long to be part of the litigation over the phn and refused to respond substantively as to the commercial status of the long having failed to obtain a response from stryker,acumed filed a motion to compel production of a physical sample of the long and disclosure of sales data regarding the long.in its motion to compel,acumed stated that 
i f the long version,the long is substantially similar to the regular nail,the phn but for its length,the parties existing infringement contentions would adequately embrace that nail.if,on the other hand,the nail is materially different,acumed will decide at a later date whether a second suit is appropriate.
at.at the district court behest,stryker provided the requested long sample and sales information.after inspecting the sample,acumed argued to the district court that the long was substantially similar to the phn and that the long might also infringe the patent.at.the district court then offered to allow acumed to add a claim of infringement based on the long but warned that adding the long claim would necessitate postponing the trial date for up to one year.preferring to avoid this delay,acumed decided to postpone its long infringement claim and the parties proceeded to trial solely on the phn infringement claim.the trial concluded with a jury verdict that the phn infringed the patent and that stryker infringement was willful.the district court entered final judgment in acumed i on april.the judgment of infringement and willfulness was affirmed by this court in acumed llc stryker.
on may,acumed filed its complaint in the case presently on appeal,acumed llc stryker,wl,acumed ii,alleging that stryker long nail infringes the patent.the district court dismissed acumed suit pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that acumed long infringement claim was precluded by the judgment of infringement with respect to the phn in acumed acumed appeals that dismissal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
under the doctrine of claim preclusion a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.parklane hosiery shore,d.the supreme court has also explained 
the rule of claim preclusion provides that when a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final judgment on the merits of a cause of action,the parties to the suit and their privies are thereafter bound not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand,but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.
comm r of internal revenue sunnen.quoting cromwell county of sac.whether a claim is barred by claim preclusion is a question of law that appellate courts review de novo.see,faust united states,e j gallo winery gallo cattle,cir.
to the extent that a case turns on general principles of claim preclusion,as opposed to a rule of law having special application to patent cases,this court applies the law of the regional circuit in which the district court the ninth circuit.see media tech.licensing,llc upper deck.the ninth circuit applies claim preclusion where the same parties,or their privies,were involved in the prior litigation,the prior litigation involved the same claim or cause of action as the later suit,and the prior litigation was terminated by a final judgment on the merits.cent.delta water agency united states,cir citing labs.of,d.in this case,only the second,the same claim at issue.
whether two claims for patent infringement are identical is a claim preclusion issue that is particular to patent law,and therefore we analyze it under federal circuit law.hallco foster,hereinafter hallco citing foster,at.in applying the doctrine of claim preclusion,this court is guided by the restatement second of judgments.foster,at,under the restatement approach to claim preclusion,a claim is defined by the transactional facts from which it arises.id.as explained in the restatement 
when a valid and final judgment rendered in an action extinguishes the plaintiff claim pursuant to the rules of merger or bar,the claim extinguished includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction,or series of connected transactions,out of which the action arose.
what factual grouping constitutes a transaction,and what groupings constitute a series,are to be determined pragmatically,giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time,space,origin,or motivation,whether they form a convenient trial unit,and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties expectations or business understanding or usage.
restatement second of judgments.in foster,this court held that one of the essential transactional facts giving rise to a patent infringement claim is the structure of the device or devices in issue.at.in so holding,the foster court relied on young engineers,united states international trade commission,which held 
with respect to patent litigation,we are unpersuaded that an infringement claim,for purposes of claim preclusion,embraces more than the specific devices before the court in the first suit.adjudication of infringement is a determination that a thing is made,used or sold without authority under the claim s of a valid enforceable patent.thus,the status of an infringer is derived from the status imposed on the thing that is embraced by the asserted patent claims,the thing adjudged to be infringing.
