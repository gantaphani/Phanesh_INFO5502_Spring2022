john and mary doe collectively,the does,sued the,armour pharmaceutical company armour,alpha therapeutic corporation alpha,baxter healthcare corporation baxter,and bayer corporation,cutter biological cutter,in two separate actions in iowa state court.they claimed that one of the defendants had negligently caused their son,john doe,doe to become infected with human immunodeficiency virus hiv by allowing a product they knew carried a risk of infection to remain on the market.doe is a hemophiliac who has received various treatments for the disease,including infusions of factor viii concentrate,which the defendants produced.
this case presents three issues,all of which turn on whether the does have presented evidence sufficient to create a genuine question of fact regarding who caused doe to be infected with hiv.the first issue is whether,under traditional negligence,the does have presented enough evidence that any single defendant was the cause of doe infection.the second issue is whether,under alternative liability,the plaintiffs have presented enough evidence that the four defendants together are the only ones who could be responsible for doe infection.if the four defendants are the only possible tortfeasors,then the does argue that each defendant has the burden of proving that it did not cause doe injury.the third issue is whether the does can sustain a civil conspiracy cause of action against the defendants.the resolution of this last issue turns on the resolution of the first two issues if the does have created a genuine question of fact regarding causation,then their civil conspiracy claim may go forward.the district court ruled against the does on all three issues,and the does appeal.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction to hear this case under.this court has jurisdiction over the appeal under.we affirm.
factual background 
john doe,was born on september.at ten months,physicians diagnosed him as suffering from hemophilia a,which results from a deficiency in the production of a blood factor component known as factor viii.lack of factor viii stops the blood from coagulating normally.
there are various ways to treat hemophilia a,and doe has undergone several of them at various times.the disease may be treated by supplementing levels of the factor viii protein through infusions of whole blood,plasma,cryoprecipitate,and factor viii concentrate.from november,to april,doe received cryoprecipitate infusions.cryoprecipitate is the precipitate that forms when plasma is frozen and then thawed.it is rich in factor viii,but contains other components of the source plasma.each cryoprecipitate treatment comes from a small number of donors.according to one of the does experts,the cryoprecipitate used in iowa at the time was locally procured from single donors.on may,doe received his first infusion of factor viii concentrate.factor viii concentrate is made from pooled human plasma from many different donors from across the country.manufacturers separate components of the plasma and isolate the factor viii protein for use in the therapy.factor viii concentrate is made from the plasma of hundreds or thousands of donors,so the number of donors in any single dose is quite large.doe continued to receive factor viii concentrate infusions manufactured by various companies until january.after that month,he received only factor viii concentrate or monoclonal factor concentrates.neither of these last methods of treatment carry any risk of hiv infection.the destroys the hiv virus,and monoclonal factors are derived from sources that can not carry the disease.
doe tested positive for hiv in july.the parties agree that his infection occurred during a single infusion,and that it is not possible to identify which particular infusion caused his infection.instead,the does attempted to establish,using expert testimony,the period during which doe was infected.they presented expert testimony that doe received treatments that exposed him to some risk of hiv exposure beginning in november and continuing through january.there is evidence that the risk of exposure from cryoprecipitate treatments between november and may was very low.they also presented expert testimony that doe risk of exposure greatly increased when he began receiving treatments of factor viii concentrate on may.the does also offered evidence that doe was not infected by a factor viii concentrate treatment or a monoclonal concentrate treatment according to medical records,this places the date of doe infection between and january,the period during which doe received cryoprecipitate treatments and factor viii concentrate treatments that had not been.the does spend much of their effort trying to establish which defendants supplied the factor viii concentrate between may and january.although they have named the relevant suppliers of factor viii concentrate,they have not named the manufacturers of the cryoprecipitate as defendants.
the does rely on hospital records that indicate the source of the concentrate with which doe was treated.according to those records,doe received factor viii concentrate prescriptions from three manufacturers cutter,armour,and alpha.the evidence indicates he received nineteen prescriptions from may to november.he received two prescriptions for alpha products,on may,and june.except for those two dates,all doe prescriptions from may to september,were for cutter factor concentrate.thereafter,from december,to november,doe used the factor concentrate manufactured by armour.complicating this issue,the does experts contend that the records are incomplete.they estimate that he received many more doses of factor viii concentrate than the surviving records reflect.
the does expert medical testimony further limits the dates of possible infection.they presented statements by four experts.james mosley,asserted that doe was infected after the middle of.william robinson,opined that he was infected around february.roger grimson,was of the opinion that doe was infected in or after august.finally,robert remis provided probabilities of infection for each relevant year.he said that there was a chance that doe was infected between and.he also said there was a chance of infection in,in,and in the defendants presented their own experts,who asserted that the infection probably occurred before august.
in addition,the does have presented an expert declaration asserting that alpha,armour,baxter,and cutter were the only players in the factor viii concentrate market in iowa at the relevant time.the expert declaration states the four named defendants in this case had of the national factor viii market in,of the national factor viii market in,and of the market in.summ.at the same declaration indicates that the other purported market players did not distribute to iowa during the relevant period.
defendants claim they have presented contrary evidence that shows they were not the only manufacturers in the market at the time doe was using factor viii concentrate.they represent to the court that there were seven other market players at the time the american red cross red cross abbott laboratories abbott new york blood center scripps laboratories scripps squibb and michigan state laboratories.this claim is almost entirely unsupported by the record citations defendants have provided.for every purported market player except the red cross,the defendants rely for their claims solely on the depositions of fred feldman and allan brownstein.feldman,however,represents only that certain other manufacturers were in the business of making factor concentrate in late.his testimony is unhelpful.brownstein is perhaps less helpful still.brownstein gave testimony that some other companies were producing factor viii concentrate in the late.it is clear from his deposition transcript that his memory is limited,and he makes no representations regarding production in the or these companies distribution of their product.thus,defendants point to no evidence that other companies were in the factor viii concentrate market during the early to middle.
the most important factual dispute concerns whether the red cross provided some factor viii concentrate to doe during the period before.the does admit that on one occasion they obtained factor viii concentrate distributed to the university of minnesota by the red cross.what are contested are the dates of these purchases.the dates are important because,as of,the red cross distributed only factor viii concentrate,which the parties admit can not transmit hiv.the does provide conflicting evidence on this point.doe testified in her deposition that she believed that she purchased the red cross factor concentrate before.summ.at.however,in a later declaration,doe stated that she had reviewed her records and they refreshed her recollection that she purchased the red cross factor concentrate in.the does include as support copies of the records of their son treatment at the university of minnesota.the records confirm that he began treatment at the university of minnesota on june.thus,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the does,it appears that doe earlier testimony was mistaken,and doe did not receive factor concentrate from the red cross until after they had begun their product.
in addition,the does presented evidence that all four defendants conspired to keep factor concentrate they knew to be contaminated with hiv on the shelves after they had decided to change their production method to eliminate the risk of infection.the district court ruled that the does had presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on that claim,provided that negligence could be the underlying offense.later,the iowa supreme court held,in answer to a certified question in another case,that negligence can be the underlying offense upon which a civil conspiracy claim is based.the defendants do not challenge the sufficiency of the does evidence that there was a conspiracy,but instead seek to avoid liability for civil conspiracy on the ground that the does can not establish that any single defendant caused doe injury and thus can not establish that there was an underlying tort.
procedural background 
the does filed two negligence actions in iowa state court in.the defendants removed them to the united states district court for the southern district of iowa based on diversity jurisdiction.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the cases to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois for coordinated pretrial proceedings.in,the cases were sent back to the southern district of iowa.after discovery,the defendants sought summary judgment on the basis that the does could not establish causation and that in iowa a civil conspiracy claim can not be predicated upon an underlying negligence claim.the district court granted summary judgment on the negligence claims,holding that the does had failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on the question who caused doe infection.the district court withheld judgment on the civil conspiracy claim because the iowa supreme court had before it a certified question in another case.in wright brooke group,iowa,the iowa supreme court held that plaintiffs can base a civil conspiracy claim on a underlying tort.on june,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on the alternate basis that the does could not establish the underlying tort.the does timely appealed.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.dico,amoco oil,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.the party opposing summary judgment must present more than a scintilla of evidence and must advance specific facts to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial.dico,at quoting bell,cir.
the does first claim that the district court erred by dismissing their claim under a traditional negligence theory of liability.we must decide whether the does presented enough evidence respecting which one defendant caused doe to become infected with hiv to allow a jury to impose liability.the does presented evidence that shows doe was infected between he started using january he started using a safe,version of factor viii concentrate.they also presented expert testimony stating that the infection most likely occurred during,or.the does also presented evidence that they used the factor viii concentrate product of three of the named defendants armour,alpha,and cutter all parties agree that there is no way to determine the precise injection that infected doe the only evidence that can distinguish the three defendants are the dates doe used their products and the expert statements regarding the date of infection.
a defendant breach of its duty of care is actionable negligence only if the breach is the proximate cause of a plaintiff injury.cedar falls cedar falls sch,iowa.proximate cause has two elements the defendant conduct must have in fact caused the damages and the policy of the law must require the defendant to be legally responsible for them.id.to establish the first element of proximate causation,the does must show that their son damages would not have occurred a defendant negligence.id.
the does claim founders on the shoals of the requirement,for it is conceded by the does that there is no way to identify the moment of infection.the best they can hope to do is narrow the potential dates and show which companies provided the product during that period.their experts have not narrowed the potential dates of infection so far that a rational jury could conclude that the conduct of one of the defendants was the cause of doe infection.the best that can be said for the evidence is that there is a strong likelihood that either cutter or armour supplied the factor viii concentrate that infected doe.but the evidence provides no means of distinguishing between these two defendants.consequently,even taking the expert statements proffered by the does as true,a jury would be required to speculate in order to find one of the defendants liable for doe damages.
the does argue that the court should not require them to prove any single defendant was a cause.they argue for the lesser standard articulated by the iowa supreme court in huber watson,iowa.that court held that i n cases involving exposure to asbestos,a reasonable inference of exposure to a defendant product,coupled with expert testimony regarding asbestos fiber drift and the cumulative effects of exposure to asbestos,is enough to prove proximate cause.id.at quoting beeman manville.asbestos disease comp.fund,iowa.the test is whether a jury could logically make the necessary inference of the causal connection between defendant action and the plaintiff injury.id.under this standard,the does argue,the evidence would support a jury verdict in their favor because their expert testimony narrows the range of possible dates of infection and would allow a jury to base its judgment on probability judgments of experts that one defendant or another was a substantial cause of doe injuries.
the does reliance on huber reasoning is misplaced.huber and all the cases upon which it relies concern liability for injuries caused by asbestos exposure.the crucial difference between asbestos exposure and exposure to hiv is that the effects of asbestos exposure are cumulative.hence,incidents of asbestos exposure are concurrent causes of a plaintiff injuries.the parties and experts all admit that hiv infection does not work in the same way.doe was infected on a particular occasion.doe separate infusions were not concurrent causes of his hiv infection.plaintiffs are relieved of the need to show that a defendant was a cause of an injury only where the conduct of two or more persons is so related to an event that their combined conduct,viewed as a whole,is a cause of the event,and the application of the rule to them individually would absolve all of them.spaur fiberglas,iowa quoting page keeton,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,ed.since the parties admit that concurrent causation is not at issue in this case,the does are not relieved of the need to distinguish between the defendants and show that one was the cause o
