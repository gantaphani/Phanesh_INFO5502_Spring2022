this is a dispute regarding the termination of joel helfman disability ltd benefits.after suffering various cardiac episodes in late,helfman began receiving disability benefits from genworth life and health insurance company,formerly known as ge group life assurance company genworth,and sun life assurance company of canada sun life.genworth and sun life terminated payment of ltd benefits to helfman in march and may,respectively.the district court below found that the employee retirement income security act erisa governed plaintiff plan,as plaintiff had not satisfied the first of four required criteria for the safe harbor exemption from erisa to apply.applying applicable erisa standards,the district court upheld defendants termination of plaintiff disability benefits as not arbitrary or capricious.helfman appeals the finding that his ltd benefits plans are governed by erisa and the finding that sun life termination of benefits was not arbitrary or capricious.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court finding that erisa governs plaintiff ltd plans,but reverse the district court finding that sun life termination was not arbitrary or capricious and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
joel helfman is a male previously employed by two construction businesses owned by his family,atlas filmore lumber company atlas filmore and fairway construction company fairway.helfman owns of atlas filmore.the two businesses,though separate entities for and purposes,are apparently very closely related,sharing the same address,phone number,and data universal numbering system number for government contract work.
although helfman worked for both companies,he was officially employed by atlas filmore.his official job title appeared to be,as his employer listed his occupation in helfman claim for disability benefits.helfman,however,listed his occupation simply as executive.his employer stated that his job duties entailed supervis ing meetings,estimating,reviewing bids,new products.helfman was responsible for supervising ten employees.
in june,fairway began coverage for its employees under a group disability insurance policy issued by genworth.in june,atlas filmore began coverage for its employees under a group disability insurance policy issued by sun life.atlas filmore paid premiums for helfman to both genworth and sun life.helfman alleges he then reimbursed atlas filmore the full cost of his premiums,although sun life and genworth dispute the evidentiary support for this assertion.helfman concedes that it is a factual issue left unresolved by the district court.
on december,helfman visited his doctor,concerned by burning discomfort in his chest.helfman had previously suffered a heart attack in,subsequent to which he had undergone a balloon angioplasty of his right coronary artery,later undergoing the same procedure on his left anterior descending artery.helfman is also a smoker and suffers from morbid obesity,hypertension,and diabetes,among other conditions.a heart catheterization subsequent to his december visit revealed severe coronary artery disease.accordingly,on december,helfman underwent quadruple bypass surgery.he spent the following months at his condominium in florida,enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program and recuperating in general.
in early january,helfman applied for and received disability benefits from both genworth and sun life.after the appropriate time period,both started paying ltd benefits.during the first months of ltd benefit payment,sun life policy terms required helfman to demonstrate that he was unable because of injury or sickness to perform the material and substantial duties of his own occupation.
helfman continued extensive treatment in,undergoing a repeat catheterization in june,after which his primary treating physician,alan silverman,elected to treat him medically as opposed to surgically due to his condition.in october,silverman notes state that helfman denied chest pain and was exercising on a treadmill without difficulty and without symptoms.in february,silverman approved helfman for gastric bypass surgery to treat his morbid obesity.throughout helfman treatment history,however,silverman opined that helfman could not return to work due to stress and the potential for it to exacerbate his condition.
in january,while processing helfman benefits claim,sun life learned that genworth was also paying helfman benefits.sun life notified genworth,the latter entity which then investigated and discovered that genworth paid helfman benefits because of his fairway insurance,sun life because of his atlas filmore insurance.
genworth terminated benefits on march,finding that helfman was no longer eligible because his benefits from sun life qualified as other income as that term is defined under genworth policy.sun life terminated benefits on may,after a file review by loretta dionne,led it to determine that helfman was no longer disabled as defined by the policy.for purposes of ltd benefits,under sun life policy an individual is totally disabled if during the elimination period and the next months,the employee,because of injury or sickness,is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his own occupation.in a letter to helfman,sun life found that silverman had noted improvements in helfman condition,specifically that in october he was exercising without difficulty and that he denied chest pain,and that his condition was sufficiently stable for gastric bypass surgery.sun life further concluded that helfman subjective complaints of stress did not support an objective finding that he could not perform the material and substantial duties of his previous occupation.
in response,silverman wrote a letter to sun life,again insisting that helfman was unable to work due to stress and explaining the course of treatment.in pertinent part,silverman opined that helfman remained in a group for further cardiac events treatment notes such as his approval for helfman gastric bypass surgery were unrelated to whether he could perform the duties of his occupation.silverman specifically opined that the stress of surgery was unrelated to the ongoing stress of helfman occupation.on administrative appeal to sun life,sun life submitted helfman file for review to wallace watson,robert violetta,sun life rehabilitation consultant and paul sweeney,a cardiologist.on january,sun life informed helfman that it was upholding the denial of benefits.
having exhausted his administrative appeals before each entity,on june,helfman filed suit in the oakland county circuit court for the state of michigan.defendant sun life removed the case to the eastern district of michigan,citing both federal question jurisdiction under erisa and diversity jurisdiction as grounds for removal.genworth consented to the removal.although helfman disputes that erisa applies to his case,he concedes that removal was nevertheless proper on diversity grounds.
in an opinion and order dated august,the district court found that erisa applied to helfman program,due to erisa policy goal of promoting a uniform regulatory scheme.finding that the interpretation sought by helfman would thwart this goal,the court found the safe harbor exemption from erisa did not apply.accordingly,the district court applied erisa standards of review to helfman claim and found that neither defendant decision to terminate benefits was arbitrary or capricious 
helfman timely appealed,reiterating his argument that erisa does not govern and that state law applies to his claim.should we find that erisa applies,helfman appeals solely the finding that the denial of benefits by sun life was not arbitrary or capricious.
ii.analysis 
applicability of erisa 
helfman argues that the administration of his disability benefits is not governed by erisa but rather is governed by state law.specifically,helfman argues that he is subject to the safe harbor exception to erisa applicability.
the safe harbor exempts from erisa coverage c ertain group or insurance programs.j.state law governs plans falling within the safe harbor.for the safe harbor to apply,all four of the following criteria must be met 
no contributions are made by an employer or employee organization 
participation in the program is completely voluntary for employees or members 
the sole functions of the employer or employee organization with respect to the program are,without endorsing the program,to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees or members to collect premiums through payroll deductions or dues checkoffs and to remit them to the insurer and 
the employer or employee organization receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program,other than reasonable compensation,excluding any profit,for administrative services actually rendered in connection with payroll deductions or dues checkoffs.
id.j to see also thompson am.home assurance,cir a policy will be exempted under erisa only if all four of the safe harbor criteria are satisfied.
whether the safe harbor applies in the instant case is a function of the first criterion.helfman argues that since he reimbursed both companies for his premiums,he has satisfied the first criterion,despite the fact that the companies contributed to premiums on behalf of other employees under the same group plan.helfman argues,however,that a hybrid approach is appropriate under the safe harbor because he,as an individual,meets the four criteria of the safe harbor,the governance of his ltd plan is exempt from erisa and subject to state law,whereas the remaining employees participating in the group plan on whose behalf the company contributes to premiums remain subject to erisa.
the district court assumed for purposes of argument that helfman had fully reimbursed his employer the full amount of his premiums.accordingly,the court below addressed the following discrete question of law under the first criterion of the safe harbor,may various employees who participate in the same plan be subject to differing governing schemes,according to whether they pay their own premiums in full or whether the employer contributes to their premiums in part or in whole the district court answered in the negative,finding that allowing a single plan to be at once subject to state and federal law,depending on the employee,would frustrate the purposes of erisa.
having found that application of the safe harbor was precluded because the first criterion could not,as a matter of law,be satisfied,the district court did not consider the remaining three criteria.although both appellees argue these three criteria on appeal,because determining whether the remaining three criteria have been met requires findings of fact not developed by the district court,our analysis likewise focuses solely on the first criterion.
with regard to the first criterion,because the district court assumed the truth of the factual issues presented and determined solely the legal issue of whether the same benefits plan may be governed by varying regulatory schemes with respect to any given employee,we review this legal issue de novo,likewise assuming that helfman fully reimbursed his employers his premiums.see waxman luna,cir w henever the trial court arrives at its conclusion by application of statutory law to the facts,such holding becomes a conclusion of law reviewable under the de novo standard.in the case before us,the district court has applied erisa statutory law to the facts of the case,and,therefore,we will undertake a de novo review of the district court conclusions of law.internal citation omitted see also,santino provident life accident ins,cir the district court ruling that erisa preempts santino state law claims is a legal conclusion,which this court reviews de novo.
we begin our analysis by considering the policy objectives underlying erisa preemption of state law,as these objectives are particularly instructive with respect to this issue.erisa explicitly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.the purpose of erisa preemption was to avoid conflicting federal and state regulation and to create a nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans,miami valley pension,cir accord.ass of health plans,nichols,cir the supreme court found that the basic thrust of the clause was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans quoting state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.
indeed,the supreme court has previously expressed its disapproval of the very result that helfman seeks because it would thwart these policy objectives.in raymond yates,profit sharing plan hendon,d,the court considered the issue of whether an could be a participant as defined by erisa and therefore subject thereto.the court found in the affirmative and,citing the aforementioned policy objectives,noted,recognizing the working owner as an plan participant also avoids the anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes governance for the nonowner employees governance for the working owner.id.at.
the policy objectives underlying erisa and the supreme court dicta in yates heavily inform our analysis.drawing therefrom,it is clear that the selective application of erisa that helfman seeks would frustrate the purposes underlying preemption and lead to the anomaly criticized in yates.although helfman argues that allowing a hybrid approach would lead to no real detriment,we disagree.the problems such disparate governance could create could indeed be myriad.for example,a nationwide corporation could potentially have thousands or even hundreds of thousands of employees under the same plan,for some of whom the plan is governed by the law of their particular state and for others of whom the plan is governed by erisa.the nationwide plan precisely illustrates the problem that helfman narrow focus has failed to recognize but that congress foresaw because our nation comprises fifty states,state regulation of plans creates the potential for fifty or indeed more conflicting governance structures.uniform governance under federal law avoids these conflicts.
nevertheless,helfman attempts to overcome the application of the above policy considerations in general and the yates case in particular by arguing that the circumstances and equities are not on all fours with the instant case.although helfman is correct that the holding in yates does not govern the precise issue we face,the practical effect identified and avoided by the court in reaching that holding is the same namely,to apply the safe harbor as requested by helfman would lead to the anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes.yates,at.to that end,we find that the erisa policy of uniform regulation dictates a finding that a single plan may not be variously governed by both erisa and state law,depending on the particular employee in question.
we likewise disagree with helfman attempt to analogize the instant case to our ruling in thompson american home assurance,cir.in that case,we determined the applicability of the safe harbor,in particular whether an employer had endorsed an employee welfare benefit plan under the third criterion so as to preclude the application of the safe harbor.we found that the proper framework for analyzing the third criterion was from the employees point of view.id.at.helfman contends that thompson informs the proper viewpoint for analyzing the first criterion.because his expectations are to be exempt from erisa and subject to state law,he argues,that expectation should control,irrespective of which scheme governs the disbursement of benefits to his fellow employees under the same plan.
but helfman oversimplifies the issue.reducing the analysis to a mere determination of which regulatory scheme the employee wishes to be subject to would lead to the very lack of uniformity that erisa preemption was intended to prevent.moreover,applying an vantage point to the third criterion is appropriate because it holds an employer responsible for its representations,and importantly such a framework does not lead to differing legal regimes governing the same program.but such a framework serves no such purpose with regard to the first criterion and indeed would lead to the anomaly we seek to avoid.
we also disagree with helfman contention that this hybrid approach is not only permitted under the first criterion but indeed would be desirable,as it would best achieve the goal of erisa of protect ing the interests of participants in employee benefit plans.b.contrary to helfman assertion,we recently found erisa extensive preemption provisions were actually intended to advance the protection of participants interests under b by ensur ing that employee benefit plan regulation would be exclusively a federal concern.am.council of life insurers ross,cir quoting aetna health davila,d.accordingly helfman interest in choosing a plan is not the sort of interest that b protects,and indeed those interests protected by b are best served by uniform governance under federal law.
accordingly,we hold that if an employer contributes to any employee payment of premiums,erisa must apply to the entirety of the particular insurance program,regardless of whether one or more employees pays his own premiums in full because helfman employer contributed to premiums on behalf of the majority of the employees,the first criterion of the safe harbor exception can not be met,and the judgment of the district court in that respect is affirmed.
whether sun life termination of ltd was arbitrary and capricious 
because the plan at issue is subject to erisa,erisa standards of review apply.we review de novo the decision of a district court granting judgment in an erisa disability action based on an administrative record.if,as here,the insurance plan administrator is vested with discretion to interpret the plan,we review the denial of benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard.delisle sun life assur.of,cir quotation and internal citation omitted accord,evans unumprovident,cir w here,as here,the plan administrator is given the discretionary authority to determine the eligibility for benefits or to construe the plan terms,we review the administrator decision to deny benefits using the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.quotation marks omitted.under this standard,we uphold the administrator decision if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.bennett kemper,cir quoting glenn metro.life ins,cir,aff,d.the administrator decision must be rational in light of the plan provisions.cooper life ins.of,cir quoting jones metro.life ins,cir.
helfman argues that even if we find erisa to be applicable,the denial of benefits by sun life should be reversed as arbitrary and capricious.helfman raises the following issues on appeal 
sun life failed to give proper consideration to the demands of his employment failed to consider the stress attributable to his work circumstance did not investigate his work circumstance did not consult with his treating physician did not conduct an independent medical exam and did not cause a face to face meeting with and evaluation of helfman.
helfman further argues that the district court failed to take into account sun life conflict of interest as both the arbiter and payor of benefits.
conflict of interest 
a conflict of interest exists for erisa purposes where the plan administrator evaluates and pays benefits claims,even when,as here,the administrator is an insurance company and not the beneficiary employer.delisle,at.various circumstances affect the weight we accord the conflict for example,a long history of biased claims administration may render the conflict more important,but where a claims administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy,the conflict should prove less important.glenn.at.
here,it appears that sun life used a combination of consultants and independent consultants in reviewing helfman claim.accordingly,the conflict of interest due to sun life both determining eligibility for benefits and paying those benefits should at least be considered.see moon unum provident,cir w hen a plan administrator explanation is based on the work of a doctor in its employ,we must view the explanation with some skepticism.
file review 
helfman argues that sun life reliance on a file review,in lieu of a physical examination,as well as its failure to interview silverman,demonstrate that it did not engage in a principled decision process.sun life responds that this does not undermine its determination,as helfman has not identified any evidence that was overlooked or not considered by sun life.
sun life is correct that there is nothing inherently objectionable about a file review by a qualified physician in the context of a benefits determination.calvert firstar fin,cir.yet while this court has found that an administrator is not barred from engaging in a file review in lieu of a physical exam,the failure to conduct a physical where the right to do so is specifically reserved in the,in some cases,raise questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination.id.at accord,bennett kemper,cir cooper life ins.of,cir smith cont l cas,cir evans unumprovident,cir.
with regard to interviews of physicians,although persons conducting a file review are not per se required to interview the treating physician,the plan administrator must provide them with all letters from a claimant physician,which the file reviewer must consider.see,glenn metro.life ins,cir where physician charged with conducting the independent file review was not provided letters that had been submitted by plaintiff physician to the plan administrator,this was another factor to be considered in the overall assessment of administrator process,aff,d.
here,sun life specifically reserved the right,at its own expense,to have any person,whose injury or sickness is the basis of a claim examined by a physician,other health professional or vocational expert of its choice.because the right to do so was reserved by the plan,its failure to examine helfman raises questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of its review of his claim,see,calvert,at,particularly given that,as will be discussed further below,sun life made determinations as to helfman credibility.accordingly we find that in the instant case,sun life decision to conduct only a file review tends to support a finding that its process was arbitrary and capricious.
on the other hand,although helfman has also argued that a failure to interview silverman supports a finding that its decision was arbitrary and capricious,we disagree.sun life did not,by its policy or by other directive,require those persons conducting the file review to interview silverman,and although the plan rejected silverman findings,his letters were extensively reviewed.glenn,at reviewing physician failed to consider letters,aff,d.
we turn now to helfman argument that sun life inappropriately disregarded his claims that the stress of his job prevented him from working,as well as silverman insistence that helfman not work lest stress exacerbate his condition and lead to further cardiac episodes.helfman further contends that sun life did not adequately account for stress in his job description.sun life determined that stress was merely a factor of helfman risk of relapse,not a condition preventing him from performing the material and substantial duties of his occupation.accordingly,while sun life acknowledged that helfman subjectively believed that stress was keeping him from working,sun life found that objectively he was capable of returning to work,with the potential of future cardiac episodes due to stress being a mere risk of relapse.
first,a cursory review of the final letter denying benefits demonstrates that sun life did not reach its decision based on a deliberate,principled reasoning process supported by substantial evidence.bennett kemper,cir quoting glenn,at.although in its initial denial of disability benefits sun life explained that it appears that silverman is basing his subjective support of your disability due to your subjective complaints of the potential for stress at work and not based on objective medical
