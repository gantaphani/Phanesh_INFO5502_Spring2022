leo england appeals from the district court order affirming the final decision of the commissioner of social security commissioner that denied england application for benefits.we affirm.
england,who is now years old,was born with hydrocephalus,a condition marked by cerebrospinal fluid within the skull.he received childhood social security disability benefits from to,when his case was reviewed pursuant to the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of,stat.after this review,the social security administration determined that england was not disabled and was ineligible for benefits effective may.an administrative appeal,as well as a new application for benefits,followed 
a hearing on england claims was held in may.because england had turned eighteen by the time of the hearing,the administrative law judge alj considered both whether england should have received child disability benefits and whether england was eligible for adult disability benefits.the evidence england submitted included reports from his school and evaluations conducted by a consultative psychologist,stephen harris.the alj heard testimony from england,his mother,and a medical expert,paul deyoub,who had reviewed england records.the alj determined that england was ineligible for child disability benefits because his impairments did not meet,medically equal,or functionally equal any impairments listed in pt,subpt.p,app.the alj also determined that england was not eligible for adult disability benefits because he had the capacity to work in jobs that exist in significant numbers in the local,regional,national economies.
child disability benefits 
england argues that the alj determination that he was not eligible for child disability benefits was not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree.
we review de novo a district court decision affirming a denial of social security benefits.reed barnhart,cir citing strongson barnhart,cir.we will affirm the denial of benefits so long as the commissioner decision conforms to the law and is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.id.quoting collins ex rel.williams barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but is enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate to support the commissioner conclusion.stormo barnhart,cir quoting prosch apfel,cir.we consider both evidence that detracts from and evidence that supports the commissioner decision.id.citing prosch,at.if substantial evidence supports the decision,we will not reverse,even if substantial evidence could have been marshaled in support of a different outcome.id.citation omitted.
in determining whether a claimant under the age of eighteen is disabled,the alj undertakes a sequential evaluation.a.the first step is to inquire whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity.id.the second step is to ascertain whether the impairment or combination of impairments is severe.id.the third step is to determine whether the claimant has an impairment or impairments that meet,medically equal,or functionally equal a listed impairment.id.a claimant will not be considered disabled unless he meets the requirements for each of these three steps.id.
the alj determined that because england was not engaged in gainful activity and had severe impairments,he satisfied the requirements of the first two steps.the alj rejected england contention that his impairments were functionally equivalent to a listed impairment,however,and thus determined that england did not meet the requirements of the third step.an impairment is functionally equivalent to a listing when the impairment results in an extreme limitation in one domain of functioning or a marked limitation in two domains of functioning.a a.there are five domains of functioning,see a b listing the domains,but the only domains relevant here are the domains of interacting and relating with others,acquiring and using information,and attending and completing tasks.a marked limitation in a domain is a limitation that seriously interferes with a child ability to independently initiate,sustain,or complete activities.a e i.a marked limitation is more than moderate but less than extreme.id.i t is the equivalent of the functioning we would expect to find on standardized testing with scores that are at least two,but less than three,standard deviations below the mean.id.test scores will be considered along with other evidence.a e.
the alj determined that england had a marked limitation in interacting and relating with others,but that he did not have marked limitations in any additional domains.accordingly,the alj concluded that england did not meet the requirements for functional equivalency under the third step.england contends that the alj determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.
acquiring and using information 
the domain of acquiring and using information pertains to how well a child acquires,learns,and uses information.a g.in concluding that england did not suffer from a marked limitation in this domain,the alj noted that in,school personnel reported that while england overall intellectual ability was in the borderline range,his general fund of knowledge and long term verbal memory skills were in the average range with total language skills and oral expression also reported in the average range and with listening skills in the low average range.the alj also observed that england had successfully progressed through school and had never been held back in any grade.in addition,the alj decision took note of england and evaluations by harris.during the evaluation,england achieved a verbal iq score of,a performance iq score of,and a full scale iq score of.in,england achieved a verbal iq of,a performance iq of,and a full scale iq of.moreover,in,harris completed a medical source statement of ability to do activities,in which he reported that england had only moderate as opposed to marked or extreme limitations in such activities as carrying out detailed instructions and making judgments on simple decisions 
england argues that his iq scores and other evidence indicate that he suffers from borderline to mild mental retardation,which compels the conclusion that he suffers from a marked limitation.england points out that harris had determined in that england adaptive functioning appeared to fall within the mildly retarded range.he also notes the exception of his verbal iq score of,which indicates mild iq scores indicate borderline mental retardation there was other evidence of low intellectual functioning.during harris examination,he observed that england could not perform simple arithmetic without errors,could not interpret proverbs,and had difficulty following normal conversation.an examination in showed that england could not spell his name backwards or perform simple calculations.in,when england was in seventh grade,his resource teacher stated that he was reading at a second grade level and that his math was at a fourth grade level.england also argues that although he had never been kept back in school,he was placed in special education classes in several subjects.
despite this evidence of low intellectual functioning,we conclude that the alj assessment is supported by substantial evidence.first,england iq scores and two of his three scores are less than two standard deviations below the mean two standard deviations below the mean would be while these numbers are not necessarily dispositive,see a e ii noting that the disability determination will not be restricted to test scores alone,they constitute meaningful support for the alj determination.
second,although harris characterized england adaptive functioning as falling within the mildly retarded range,he also described england overall level of intellectual functioning as borderline and remarked that england limitations in carrying out activities were only moderate,rather than marked.the alj task was to interpret the significance and import of harris assessments and to resolve any pertinent tensions or contradictions.in so doing,the alj properly relied upon deyoub,a medical expert,for assistance.see hudson ex rel.jones barnhart
