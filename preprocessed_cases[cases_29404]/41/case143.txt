for more than three decades,those who advocate for a woman right to choose and those who advocate for the right to life based on a belief that life begins at the moment of conception have struggled for advantage in the marketplace of ideas.a series of pitched battles,forming a part of this struggle,has been waged at abortion clinics,where protestors and counselors seek to dissuade prospective patients,shame clinic workers,and call attention to what they perceive as the evils of voluntary terminations of pregnancies.in this campaign massachusetts has been a battleground state.
this appeal arises out of yet another skirmish in this chronicle of discord.in a very real sense,genesis of the appeal dates back to the dawning of the millennium.at that time,the massachusetts legislature enacted a statute that created a floating buffer zone around the entrances,exits,and driveways of abortion clinics throughout the state 
given the benefit of hindsight,the legislature revised the law seven years later.the modified version of the statute replaced the floating buffer zone with a fixed buffer zone.this appeal involves a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the modified statute.
in a thoughtful and comprehensive opinion,the district court rejected the facial challenge in all its iterations and refused to enjoin enforcement of the new law.mccullen coakley,d.after careful consideration of the record,the parties briefs,some helpful briefs,and the arguments made orally,we affirm.
background 
in this case,as in so many cases,the past informs the present.we start there.
by the end of the twentieth century,massachusetts had experienced repeated incidents involving violence and other unduly aggressive behaviors in the vicinity of reproductive health care facilities rhcfs.choosing among a host of possible preventive measures,the legislature took up a bill that proposed creating a fixed buffer zone around the entrances,exits,and driveways of rhcfs.
the state senate held a hearing on the bill in april and received evidence of widespread harassment and intimidation outside rhcfs.numerous witnesses addressed not only the peculiar vulnerability of women seeking abortion services but also the deleterious effects of overly aggressive demonstrations on both patient and provider safety.the senate concluded that existing laws did not adequately safeguard clinic staff,prospective patients,or members of the public.
as part of its due diligence,the senate asked the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc for an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of the proposed law.the sjc discerned no constitutional impediment.opinion of the justices to the senate.
the senate subsequently engrossed a bill intended to enhance public safety in and around rhcfs while maintaining the relatively free flow of traffic.see.that bill resembled the original senate bill.
before the house of representatives could act on the senate bill,the united states supreme court decided hill colorado,in which the justices upheld,as a time,place,and manner restriction,a colorado statute designed to ameliorate the same panoply of evils through the use of a floating buffer zone,d.the colorado statute synthesized the fixed and floating buffer zone concepts,making it unlawful within a fixed zone for any person,in the absence of consent,to knowingly approach within eight feet of another person for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to,displaying a sign to,or engaging in oral protest,education,or counseling with such other person.id.at.quoting.
the massachusetts legislature recognized that hill had shed new light on the legal landscape.thus,the house tabled the senate bill and repaired to the drawing board.the legislature eventually enacted a law that was loosely patterned on the colorado statute.see an act relative to reproductive health care facilities act.the key component of the act was a prohibition against knowingly approaching within six feet of another without consent for certain defined purposes.because the prohibition only operated within an fixed buffer zone around rhcf entrances,exits,and driveways,it mimicked the colorado law in combining floating and fixed buffer zone concepts.
a group of massachusetts residents who wished to protest in front of rhcfs mounted both facial and challenges to the constitutionality of the new enactment.in successive decisions,we rejected those challenges.see mcguire reilly mcguire i,cir rejecting facial challenges mcguire reilly mcguire ii,cir rejecting renewed facial challenges as well as challenges.
over time,legislators became concerned that the statute had failed to achieve its desired goals.in,the legislature held public hearings devoted to the need for rewriting the statute.testimony including statements from law enforcement officials and clinic workers revealed unanticipated difficulties in enforcing the act and called into question that act efficacy.the upshot was a decision to reshape the law by,among other things,repudiating the floating buffer zone concept and relying instead on a fixed buffer zone.
on november,the legislature enacted the revised law.see an act relative to public safety at reproductive health care facilities act.it declares that n o person shall knowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent to an rhcf within a designated buffer zone.laws ch,b.the act describes the new buffer zone as comprising 
a radius of feet of any portion of an entrance,exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility or within the area within a rectangle created by extending the outside boundaries of any entrance,exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility in straight lines to the point where such lines intersect the sidelines of the street in front of such entrance,exit or driveway.
id.moreover,the law prohibits all persons from entering or remaining within the buffer zone during ordinary business hours,subject to exceptions for four classes of persons,namely 
persons entering or leaving such facility 
employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment 
law enforcement,ambulance,firefighting,construction,utilities,public works and other municipal agents acting within the scope of their employment and 
persons using the public sidewalk or street adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose of reaching a destination other than such facility.
id.each of these exceptions derives from the act.and the act,like the act,also requires that the buffer zone be clearly marked.see id.
on january,the attorney general sent a letter to an audience that included law enforcement and rhcf personnel.the letter purports to summarize the provisions of the act and to furnish guidance to assist in applying the four exemptions.this guidance comprises four paragraphs,set forth verbatim in an appendix to this opinion.
ii.travel of the case 
on january,eleanor mccullen,jean blackburn zarrella,gregory smith,carmel farrell,and eric caden,all massachusetts residents who regularly engage in counseling outside rhcfs,sued the attorney general of massachusetts,in her representative capacity,in the federal district court.their complaint invoked,limned a constellation of constitutional claims,and prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief aimed at derailing the act.without objection,the district court bifurcated the case into facial and challenges.as to the former,the court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with the hearing on the merits,see.a,and began a bench trial on may.
in due season,the court issued a decision denying relief.mccullen,d at.this interlocutory appeal followed.we have jurisdiction under a.
iii.analysis 
we begin our odyssey by outlining the legal standards that apply generally to facial challenges and then proceed to the myriad prongs of the plaintiffs facial challenge.because the issues raised on appeal implicate the first amendment,they engender de novo review.see bose consumers union,d.
general standards.
around the edges,the standards that apply in evaluating facial challenges to the constitutionality of statutes are not entirely clear.see richard fallon,commentary,and facial challenges and standing,harv.for present purposes,though,the path is reasonably.
the supreme court recently has stated that a facial challenge will fail if a statute has a plainly legitimate sweep.state grange.state repub.party,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this is a refinement of its earlier statement that a party mounting a facial challenge must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.united states salerno,d.howsoever worded,this standard imposes a very heavy burden on a party who mounts a facial challenge to a state statute.
the statute at issue here implicates freedom of speech.justice cardozo long ago observed that freedom of speech is the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom.palko connecticut.but even so precious a freedom must,in particular iterations,be balanced against the government legitimate interests in protecting public health and safety.see,schenck united states.the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre.holmes.
in striking this delicate balance,a court must calibrate the scales differently depending on the nature of the governmental action.mcguire i,at.that calibration takes place along a continuum.see berner delahanty,cir.at one end of the continuum are laws in which the government attempts to differentiate between divergent views on a singular subject that is,laws in which the government attempts to pick and choose among similarly situated speakers in order to advance or suppress a particular ideology or outlook.id.such discrimination is highly offensive to the core values of the first amendment,and courts are wary of such encroachments.see,rosenberger rector visitors of of,d.
even when a law does not favor one particular viewpoint over another,governmental restrictions on the content of speech may be impermissible.see turner broad,fcc,d.at this stage of the continuum,a reviewing court must start with a presumption that such a regulation is constitutionally suspect.city of paul,d amusements,town of dedham,cir.that presumption can be rebutted by a showing that the regulation is both necessary to the furtherance of a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to the achievement of that interest.see,boos barry,d.
further along the continuum are laws that do not regulate speech per se but,rather,regulate the time,place,and manner in which speech may occur.because such restrictions are by definition,they tend to burden speech only incidentally that is,they burden speech for reasons unrelated to either the speaker viewpoint or the speech content.see turner,at.regulations of this type will be upheld as long as they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.ward rock against racism,d quoting clark cmty.for creative,d.this more relaxed standard,familiarly known as intermediate scrutiny,is justified because the fact that a regulation is both and helps to ensure that government is not using the regulation as a sub rosa means of interfering in areas to which first amendment protections pertain.see turner,at.
content neutrality.
what we have said to this point leads naturally to the threshold question in this case.the district court found the act to be.mccullen,d at.the plaintiffs demur.because the resolution of this dispute will determine the contours of our subsequent analysis including the appropriate level of scrutiny,we tackle this question first.
our principal inquiry in this regard,both in speech cases generally and in cases specifically,is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.ward,at.thus,a law designed to serve purposes unrelated to the content of protected speech is deemed even if,incidentally,it has an adverse effect on certain messages while leaving others untouched.mcguire i,at accord mcguire ii,at.
the lower court,relying mainly on hill,at,determined that the act was because it did not regulate the places in which speech might occur.mccullen,d at.moreover,the law was enacted in response to legitimate safety and law enforcement concerns,and was justified by those objectives without reference to the content of any speech.id.
the plaintiffs resist this characterization.they acknowledge that the statute has a patina,but they insist that this patina masks a more sinister reality.they point to several facts which,in their estimation,collectively indicate that the legislature abiding motive was to curb speech.specifically,the plaintiffs assert that the expanded size of the buffer zone is suspicious that the zone itself,as reconfigured,contradicts its stated public safety goal in that it causes more safety hazards than it abates that the legislature deliberately drew its evidence from biased sources,in effect listening to only one side of the story that this court characterizations of the act,mcguire i,at,belie the legislators professed concerns about enforcement of that law and that the nonexistent emergency referenced in the preamble to the act is a figment of the legislators collective imagination and thus,a for the legislature real agenda.
although a few of the factual components of this broadside are new and others have been refurbished or reworked,the broadside itself is on the order of one that was leveled against the act and soundly rebuffed in mcguire there,we wrote 
to be sure,the plaintiffs insist that the state professed concerns about public safety,personal security,and access to medical facilities are mere pretexts for its desire to censor speech.this insistence gets them nowhere.for one thing,their insinuations are unsupported by any record evidence.for another thing,where differential treatment is justified,on an objective basis,by the government effort to combat secondary effects,it is insufficient that a regulation may have been adopted in direct response to the negative impact of a particular form of speech.
id.at.so it is here.
as in mcguire i,the plaintiffs basic complaint is that alleged deficiencies in the factual record compiled by the,distortions,mischaracterizations,and the an inference of pretext.but as in mcguire i,our independent review of the record confirms that the legislative factfinding adequately underpins what the legislature wrought.we need not cite book and verse.although the plaintiffs,ably represented,have done a thorough job of the legislative record,their claim of pretext is no more effective than was the counterpart claim advanced in mcguire consequently,it is enough to note our wholehearted agreement with the district court that the record is replete with factual references to specific incidents and patterns of problematic behavior around rhcfs.mccullen,d at.in the final analysis,the claim of factual inadequacy amounts to little more than wishful thinking.
we nonetheless consider it wise to embellish two points.first,the fact that we spoke approvingly of the act did not serve to freeze the statute in place.the legislature had a right some might say an obligation to monitor the statute operation and to revisit the matter if experience revealed unexpected problems.see ward,at.amusements,at.
second,the test for content neutrality does not require proof that the legislature response to a perceived problem be the only solution or even the best solution it simply requires that the evidence support a conclusion that the regulation is in service to a legitimate governmental interest unrelated to expressive content.mcguire ii,at mcguire i,at.in grading a regulation efficacy under this test,a reviewing court must grant a significant degree of respect to the legislature judgment.see turner,at.viewed through this deferential prism,the factfinding that undergirds the act easily attains a passing grade.
in a related vein,the plaintiffs maintain that several features of the act themselves constitute either or discrimination.these features include the exception for clinic employees and agents,the statute alleged,the fact that the legislature did not extend it to other types of medical clinics,and the attorney general guidance letter.
this structural argument is not original.without exception,claims analogous to those that comprise it were addressed in our earlier decisions anent the act.see mcguire ii,at mcguire i,at.those decisions render superfluous any exegetic discussion of the current version of the structural argument.for now,it suffices to say that the mere fact that a law has a disparate impact on particular kinds of speech is insufficient,without more,to ground an inference that the disparity results from a preference.see mcguire ii,at mcguire i,at.here,there is no more.
to be sure,the plaintiffs strive to distinguish our earlier decisions and add the missing integers to the equation.only two of these efforts deserve comment.
the argument that the law is due to the exception permitting those persons associated with rhcfs,clinic workers and patients but not others to enter the buffer zone was squarely raised and squarely repulsed in mcguire i,at.the present plaintiffs try to give that argument a new twist.they posit that the very size and nature of a fixed buffer zone somehow changes the constitutional calculus and makes this exception less defensible.this is whistling past the graveyard.
the decisive question in a facial challenge is not whether a regulation is necessary to achieve the legislature stated goal but,rather,whether a court can glean legitimate reasons for its existence.see id.at.this principle applies to the configuration of the buffer zone selected by the legislature.the size of that zone need only be reasonably related to the attainment of the legislature goal.that some might think a or buffer zone sufficient is not the issue.
here,moreover,differences in the buffer zone dimensions and other characteristics do not tip the constitutional balance.regardless of those differences,the exception for persons associated with rhcfs remains reasonably related to the legislature legitimate public safety objectives.no more is exigible to reject this aspect of the plaintiffs facial challenge 
second,the plaintiffs maintain that the attorney general interpretive guidance reprinted in the appendix demonstrates that the act is not.in particular,they highlight the passage in the guidance letter in which the attorney general uses the phrase abortion and partisan speech.the force of this attack is dissipated by our decision in mcguire ii,at,in which we explained that a state official interpretation of a statute,even if generally authoritative,can not render an otherwise constitutional statute vulnerable to a facial challenge.
in sum,we find nothing in either the text or the legislative history of the act that deprives that statute of status.we proceed,therefore,with intermediate scrutiny,recognizing that the constitutionality of the act turns on whether it is narrowly tailored and allows sufficient alternative means of communication.see,clark,at.
narrow of communication.
a regulation is narrowly tailored if it i facilitates a substantial governmental interest that would be less effectively served without the regulation and ii accomplishes this end without burdening substantially more speech than necessary.ward,at.
the first element of this definition is not seriously disputed here.the interests ascribed by the legislature to the act enhancing public safety around rhcfs,improving traffic flow,and the like are the same as those that we deemed both proper and substantial in mcguire i,at describing those interests as precisely the sort of interests that justify some incidental burdening of first amendment rights.
it is the second part of the definition that draws the plaintiffs fire they argue that the act regulates too much speech.but this argument rests on a misconception it assumes that,in order to survive intermediate scrutiny,a law and within a law,a buffer zone must burden no more speech than is absolutely necessary to accomplish the law legitimate purpose.
perscrutation of the plaintiffs briefs makes it apparent that this misconception arises out of a misreading of the court decisions in schenck network,d,and madsen women health center,d.in each instance,the court applied a no greater restriction than necessary standard to determine the validity of an injunction.see schenck,at.madsen,at.but injunctions which bind only the parties in a particular case and those in privity with them are more targeted than statutes which apply broadly to all concerned.this is a critically important distinction the court has made it pellucid that the absence of general applicability subjects injunctions to a stricter standard than legislative enactments.see madsen,at.ry.exp.agency,new york.t here is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally.jackson,concurring.a law of general application passes muster under narrow tailoring principles as long as it is not substantially broader than necessary to accomplish the legislature legitimate goal.see ward,at.see also madsen,at.
ward supplies the measuring stick that we must wield.the act is a law of general application.given that it promotes a substantial public interest,mcguire i,at,the decisive question is whether it burdens substantially more speech than necessary to serve that purpose.if the answer to that query is in the negative,the law does not offend the first amendment simply because a court concludes that the government interest could be adequately served by some alternative.ward,at.this means,of course,that a judge agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests or the degree to which those interests should be promoted are not conditions precedent to upholding a restriction.id.
that conclusion effectively ends this aspect of the matter.testimony from law enforcement officers and clinic workers attested to the ineffectiveness of the preexisting law.against that backdrop,the legislature determined,after considerable study,that the state declared interests would be better served by reconfiguring the buffer zone around rhcfs.the legislature labored to balance first amendment concerns with public safety concerns,see mccullen,d at recounting evidence,mulled the advantages and disadvantages of variously configured buffer zones,and decided reasonably,we think that a fixed buffer zone made sense.given the deference that is owed to such legislative judgments,see turner,at,we can not say that the act is substantially broader than necessary.
the fact that the legislature reached a different conclusion seven years earlier when it preferred a smaller buffer zone that had both floating and fixed components does not undercut this conclusion.after all,legislative choice is a dynamic process.simply because a legislature previously has attempted to address a particular problem in one way does not disable it from taking a different approach at a later time.see,ward,at.justifying increased regulation based on evidence of inadequacy of municipality prior attempts to combat noise amusements,at similar rust sullivan,d affirming agency reversal of position while noting that in exercising legislatively delegated authority agency is free to consider the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.experience is often the best teacher,and the incremental nature of the legislature actions seems more a virtue than a vice.on these facts,the legislature judgment must be respected.see turner,at.
relatedly,the plaintiffs suggest that the act is constitutionally infirm because it amounts to a ban on handbilling and interferes with the provision of an constitutional conversational distance.that suggestion is jejune.
contrary to the plaintiffs importunings,the constitution neither recognizes nor gives special protection to any particular conversational distance.see,schenck,at.upholding a fixed buffer zone.by the same token,handbilling is not specially protected.see heffron int l soc y for krishna conscious
