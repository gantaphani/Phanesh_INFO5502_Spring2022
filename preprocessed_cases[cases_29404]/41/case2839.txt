the district of columbia appeals from the judgment entered after a verdict in favor of neal gasser,a sergeant in the metropolitan police department,finding the district liable to him under the americans with disabilities act of disabilities act.gasser from the district court order refusing to direct the police department to promote him to lieutenant.among the matters in controversy is the proper application of the evidentiary standard laid down in duncan washington metropolitan area transit authority,en banc.
gasser complaint alleged that the police department violated the disabilities act when it refused to return him to full duty.see gasser ramsey,d.after a jury failed to reach a verdict,the case was set for retrial.the district court denied the district motions for judgment as a matter of law after gasser presented his and after the close of all the evidence.the jury returned a special verdict in gasser favor and awarded him for emotional distress.
the evidence,viewed most favorably to gasser,see reeves sanderson plumbing,d,showed as follows.gasser joined the police department as a patrol officer in and was promoted to master patrol officer in and to sergeant in police department policy requires that all officers be street ready or fit for full duty regardless of rank.this means that all the chief of be able to perform patrol functions from time to time.each officer is expected to be able to subdue a suspect within a matter of minutes,with or without assistance.
in july,gasser suffered a mesenteric vein blood clot in his abdomen.though gasser twice previously had been treated for discrete clots in his legs,this time doctors diagnosed a protein s deficiency.protein s deficiency is an inherited disorder that tends to cause blood to clot.doctors treat protein s deficiency with which coumadin is the most commonly prescribed.gasser hematologist,harold mirsky prescribed coumadin in to treat gasser blood disorder,and coumadin has been part of gasser regimen ever since.
gasser went on limited duty for six months after he began taking coumadin.limited duty is a temporary status,intended to provide sick or injured officers an opportunity to recover completely while preparing to return to full duty.an officer can not be promoted or earn overtime on limited duty.the district police and fire clinic provides care for,and makes decisions concerning the duty status of,sick or injured officers.because limited duty is not a status,once the doctors at the clinic provide all the medical care they can,a patient still unable to fulfill the obligations of his rank is involuntarily process involving multiple levels of recommendation and review.at all times relevant to this case,michelle was the clinic physician who decided when officers should be placed on limited duty.
by the end of,clinic physicians agreed to return gasser to status upon receiving a letter from mirsky urging them to do so clinic physicians knew gasser continued to take coumadin after returning to full duty.he performed at full duty without incident for a number of years.but when he sprained his wrist in an car accident in december,he again reported to the clinic.
at the clinic,gasser met craig thorne,a physician specializing in occupational medicine,who thought gasser should be on limited duty because he was taking coumadin.mirsky wrote a letter to,thorne supervisor,regarding gasser condition.in the letter,mirsky stated that gasser was not at any excessive risk of bleeding unless he experienced significant trauma.because mirsky understood gasser responsibilities to be supervisory,mirsky saw no reason to restrict gasser from working as a full duty sergeant.although thorne was inclined to leave gasser on limited duty,he consulted because gasser really wanted to work.
agreed with thorne preliminary diagnosis and was not convinced by mirsky letter that gasser should return to full duty.the letter perplexed because mirsky acknowledged that gasser was at an excessive risk of bleeding if he experienced significant trauma,but nevertheless urged his return to full duty.mirsky believed gasser could resume his responsibilities as a full duty sergeant,based on what gasser told him about his supervisory duties as a sergeant.the relevant question for,however,was not whether gasser could resume supervisory duties,but whether he was fit for full duty,which includes patrol duty.
ultimately,thorne and decided to refer gasser to another hematologist,joseph catlett,for an independent opinion.after examining gasser in late june,catlett sent a letter to in which he concluded that gasser had an increased risk of bleeding due to coumadin use.however,rather than giving an independent opinion of gasser fitness for full duty,catlett defer red to her expertise and told her the decision lies with her office.was not satisfied with this deferential position and decided to have another physician render an independent judgment.
she contacted the occupational health clinic at johns hopkins and scheduled gasser to see virginia weaver in august.weaver is a physician in internal and occupational medicine.after meeting with gasser,weaver concluded that he faced an increased risk for bleeding as a police officer taking coumadin.she was concerned that he might suffer severe trauma and excessive bleeding when engaging in high speed pursuits,participating in raids,or discharging firearms at persons.for these reasons,weaver believed gasser would be a threat to coworkers and to the public because he could become incapacitated very quickly and then he would not be there to assist coworkers.given gasser experience and desire to return to full duty,weaver thought that it would have been wonderful if he could have maintained a job as a trainer or supervisor without any time on the street.but recognizing that this was not possible under the police department policy,she recommended that he not return to full duty.
based on weaver report,concluded that her original assessment was correct,that gasser faced an increased risk for harm,and that he should not work as a full duty police officer.the consequences to gasser were severe.beyond making gasser ineligible for overtime pay and further promotion,the police department took gasser uniform,badge,and gun.it also confined him to desk duty and did not allow him to visit crime scenes.the police department also generally prohibited him from riding in a squad car for fear that a car in which he was riding might,in an emergency,be diverted to a crime scene where he could suffer physical trauma.
although the police department never returned gasser to full duty,it did return his uniform,badge,and gun in december.shortly thereafter,however,the police department initiated the process of involuntary retirement.gasser brought this suit before that process could be completed.
at trial,gasser presented to the jury the deposition testimony of francis thomas,a vocation rehabilitation specialist.gasser used the testimony to establish the number of jobs the police department regarded him as unable to perform.thomas began his analysis by determining the universe of jobs in the.area for which gasser was qualified absent any impairment.he found such jobs.thomas then removed from this group those jobs the police department regarded gasser as unable to perform.rather than removing jobs that involve a risk of physical trauma,however,thomas presumed that gasser would be able to perform only those jobs with responsibilities that resembled the desk duties he performed while on limited duty.he therefore removed from consideration all heavy duty jobs and medium type jobs and presumed that the police department regarded gasser as able to perform only light and sedentary type jobs.so restricted,gasser could perform only of the jobs for which thomas determined he was otherwise eligible.thomas did not take into account the driving restriction the police department placed on gasser,nor did he specifically analyze the types of law enforcement jobs gasser was able to perform.
after entry of judgment on the verdict,the district renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law.the district court ruled that even though thomas e
