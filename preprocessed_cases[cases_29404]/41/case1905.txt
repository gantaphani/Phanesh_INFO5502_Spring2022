on august,in light of developments reported by the united states probation office in florida,the government moved to revoke franklin conditional release.in support of the motion,the government produced a letter from probation officer mark davy,which described events of august.davy explained that franklin unexpectedly reported to the probation office,waited in the lobby for fewer than five minutes,and then returned home.from his home,franklin reportedly called the probation office and spoke to a receptionist.davy arranged for the call to be transferred to his extension,and he told franklin that in the future he should contact davy or his supervisor concerning any issues,rather than speaking to the receptionist.add.at.franklin then became agitated and upset with davy,and made additional threats and comments specifically directed toward davy,including that i gon na sic my hounds on you and i will blow your brains out.you and your supervisor.id.
according to davy,franklin further stated that he could make any statement he wanted to make under his protection of freedom of speech,and that davy had no jurisdiction or authority to control his statements or speech.id.franklin also reportedly said that when he leaves this country,he might say davy need s to be killed,his family,wife,children,mother,whole genealogy.id.he also said he might say the judge who messed me up,he might need to be killed.id.finally,after davy stated that he construed the comments as threats to himself,his supervisor,and the court,franklin replied that once he gets his,he is going to leave the country and those who have opposed him would be punished.id.at.
a letter from franklin brother,dated august,was also presented with the motion.the brother stated his belief that it was in franklin best interest to be taken into custody so that he may be evaluated with respect to his recent behavior and statements.id.at.he recounted that over the past two weeks,i have seen a side of him i have not seen before.id.although he did not believe franklin would harm him,franklin brother was afraid franklin might harm others.id.he asserted that,a lthough franklin is taking his prescribed medication,it appears the drugs are not working.id.he noted that his sister is afraid of franklin,and concluded that he considered franklin to be a potential risk to harm himself or others.id.
a warrant was issued for franklin arrest,and on august,the united states marshal service returned franklin to the united states medical center for federal prisoners in springfield,missouri.franklin motion of september,for a separate mental examination was granted,and kenneth burstin,a clinical psychologist,reviewed franklin files and interviewed him.the report compiled by burstin concluded that franklin continued to suffer from bipolar disorder,and that he does meet the criteria for commitment at this time.at.
the government then submitted to the district court a risk assessment review report report,complied by a panel of mental health experts.the report concluded that franklin,while able in the past to conceal manifestations of his illness relatively well,had clearly worse ned such that he disputes even suffering from mental illness.id.at.according to the panel,franklin anticipates that his psychiatric medication can soon be dispensed with altogether.id.
the report continued worryingly,this deterioration appears to have taken place despite reported medication appears his present regimen is no longer adequate,rather than simply a straightforward issue of compliance.id.franklin,according to the panel,is most resistant to considering a n increase in dose of any of his medications,and m oreover,continued deterioration,which will likely snowball if he makes good on his intimations that he should not be taking medication at all,will likely lead to a return to the kind of assaultive behavior documented in old records.id.the report concluded that i n light of these circumstances,it is the panel opinion,with reasonable medical and psychological certainty,that franklin release in his present clinical condition would pose a substantial risk to others or the property of others due to mental illness.id.at.
on september,a magistrate judge presided over an evidentiary hearing on the revocation motion,at which franklin testified.franklin acknowledged that he had a psychologic disorder,id.at,but testified that he was currently taking medication and was doing fine coping in open population.id.at.he maintained that he would not pose a danger to himself or others as long as i still on a regimented prescribed medication.id.he also indicated that he regretted his comments to davy and suggested that they were misunderstood.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,concluding that t he behavior of the defendant and the report submitted by the mental health professionals establish that he has failed to comply with his prescribed regimen of treatment and that his continued release would pose a risk to society.id.at.the judge acknowledged that there is no direct evidence that the treatment regimen was not followed,but reasoned that the abrupt change in defendant behavior supports that conclusion.id.at.the judge recommended that franklin release be revoked and that he be recommitted.
franklin took exception to the report and recommendation,noting his testimony that he had been taking his medication and that he would not be a danger to others.he argued that the evidence in this case is insufficient to show that,due to his mental illness,his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another.id.at.
the district court,after considering franklin objections,concluded that a review of the files and records in this case establishes that the defendant violated his conditional release and failed to comply with his prescribed regimen of treatment.id.at.the court also noted that t he unanimous expert opinion is that defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect,as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of b
