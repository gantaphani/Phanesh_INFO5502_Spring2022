after barbara michelle bush was indicted on two counts of threatening a federal judge,in violation of c,a psychiatric evaluation,sought by both the government and bush,concluded that bush was not competent to stand trial but that there was a substantial probability that the administration of antipsychotic medication would restore her competence.because bush refused treatment,the government filed a motion for an order permitting it to medicate bush involuntarily to render her competent to stand trial.
applying the standard set out in sell united states,d,the district court granted the government motion and ordered bush committed for hospitalization at the federal medical center in carswell,texas fmc carswell,where t he psychiatric staff at fmc carswell will administer antipsychotic drug treatment to bush on an involuntary basis if she continues to refuse treatment.the court stayed its order pending bush appeal.
on appeal,we conclude that the government had the burden of satisfying the sell standard by clear and convincing evidence and that when the current state of the record is considered with this higher standard of proof,questions arise whether the government carried its burden under sell.accordingly,we vacate the district court april,order and remand for further proceedings.
barbara bush suffers from delusional disorder,persecutory type,a psychotic mental illness primarily characterized by nonbizarre delusions situations that occur in real life such as being followed or persecuted,which,according to the government report of her condition,causes her to believe that several federal judges,her attorney,agencies in the state of maryland and her former employers in the federal government are conspiring to deny her money,medical treatment,educational opportunities,housing,and employment and are attempting to discredit her by bringing criminal charges and subjecting her to psychological evaluation.she has suffered from this disease since at least and exhibited symptoms possibly as early as.the disease has manifested itself in bush by extreme litigiousness,which has led her to file,by her account,over civil lawsuits since.this case has its genesis in one of those suits.
while enrolled in classes at prince george community college,bush came to believe that she was improperly denied disability accommodations,was subjected to loan fraud,and was unjustly harassed regarding email communications with another student,leading her to commence a civil action in the district of maryland,bush kofie,et,civil action no,which is the litigation underlying the case before us.in the course of the underlying well as in became convinced that the judges hearing her cases were deliberately committing acts of abuse and assaults against her by dismissing her claims and refusing her relief.she alleged that the stress caused by these recurring dismissals caused her to suffer several health problems.
emanating from these perceptions,bush wrote a letter dated december,to united states district judge deborah chasanow,copying district judge catherine blake and district judge colleen,and attached it to a pleading in bush kofie.while the letter purpose to the litigation is unclear,in it she quoted a legal treatise to describe her understanding of the application of to her situation 
barbara michelle bush intentional infliction of or,if she misses,her attempt to inflict physical harm upon the other,or her threat to inflict such harm,is said to be justified when she acts in proper against catherine blake,col l een kotelly,and deborah chasanow et,so that she is not guilty of any crime.
thus,according to maryland criminal law,barbara michelle bush may slay any of such persons or all of them,if it reasonably appears to her to be necessary so to do to protect herself from anymore great bodily harm or death.
francis wharton,the law of homicide,at frank bowlby,ed.
this letter prompted the fbi to approach bush on december,and warn her to stop mailing threatening communications to federal judges.it also prompted district judge peter messitte,to whom bush kofie had been assigned,to warn bush in a memorandum opinion dated december,not to include threatening language in communications with the court.bush has remained adamant,however,that she did not intend to threaten the judges and that she did not believe her letter was threatening.in fact,in a communication to the department of justice,bush claimed that the officials were accusing her of making threats as part of a cover up,that she was simply quoting the language from a decision of the maryland court of appeals,and that judge messitte admonished her only after he got upset because she appealed his decision.
on january,in response to judge messitte memorandum opinion,bush sent another letter to the district court entitled plaintiff peter messitte.this letter included,in bold letters at the top,the words no threat.in the letter,bush expressed her opinion that judge messitte actions were a threat against her and that judge messitte had committed an assault against her because he contributed to caused her to suffer a stroke as a direct result of unreasonable and cruel assaults to her known disabilities,presumably by denying her claim for relief and warning her not to threaten federal judges.bush again included the same language about slaying in that she had quoted in her december letter,this time including judge messitte name.
following the second letter,bush was arrested and charged with two counts of making threats to federal judges,in violation of c.she was incarcerated at the montgomery county detention center,where she presented with rambling speech and as grandiose and delusional h er speech was described as tangential and her thought content as disordered and illogical at times.a medical examination revealed also that she had diabetes and high blood pressure,which confirmed earlier medical records.to have her evaluated,bush was thereafter transferred to fmc carswell in texas.
the medical staff at fmc carswell evaluated bush,concluding that she suffered from delusional disorder,persecutory type,and that she was incompetent to stand trial.the report also suggested that there was a substantial probability that bush would regain competence if treated with antipsychotic medication and that without medication it was unlikely that she would regain her competence.the report added that it was unlikely that the medication would produce serious side effects and that any side effects could be controlled.
appended to the medical staff report was an individual report prepared by edulfo gonzalez,a psychiatrist at fmc carswell,which included his opinion that bush would respond well to treatment with medication.gonzalez stated that i n his opinion,treatment with antipsychotic medication is medically indicated,and is substantially likely to render bush competent to stand trial.addressing the medication specifically,gonzalez stated that only three medications could be administered involuntarily by decanoate,prolixin decanoate or enanthate,and risperdal consta.he explained that the first two drugs are of the older,typical class of antipsychotic medication and potentially have more troublesome significant side effects.he therefore indicated that risperdal consta would be preferable because of having fewer side effects.
gonzalez then listed the potential side effects of antipsychotic medications,which included,among other things,the possibility of elevated glucose and lipids,at times causing the development of diabetes mellitus in individuals who are predisposed to develop that illness.although bush was known to have a history of diabetes,gonzalez did not explain why she would not be at heightened risk of developing side effects relating to this disease.instead,he stated simply,to the best of my knowledge bush does not suffer from any medical conditions which would place her at substantial risk of developing any severe side effects from treatment with antipsychotic medications.finally,gonzalez stated,in my experience,treating individuals with this type of problem,i have never encountered a side effect that endangered the fairness of a trial.
because bush refused to cooperate with the medical staff in taking the drugs necessary to restore her to competency,the government filed a motion in the district court to order her forcibly medicated to render her competent to stand trial.the court thereafter conducted three hearings,during the first of which it directed that bush be evaluated by her own doctor,paul montalbano.
montalbano agreed with the government diagnosis of delusional disorder,persecutory type,but disagreed that medication would be effective.he stated,
i n my clinical experience,having performed over a hundred pretrial evaluations and in my capacity as pretrial chief,having supervised over a thousand pretrial evaluations,individuals with fixed or encapsulated paranoid delusional systems are difficult to treat even with medication and a significant number do not become competent to stand trial even if medicated.therefore,while bush may become competent if involuntarily medicated,i can not agree that there is a substantial probability that she will become competent with involuntary medication.
montalbano focused on bush long history of untreated mental disease and on the fact that her persecutory delusions were directed against government action to conclude that forced medication would unlikely be successful in her case.
the district court heard testimony from both montalbano and trent evans,a forensic psychologist on the team at fmc carswell that evaluated bush.in their testimony,both experts agreed that the common wisdom in the psychiatric community is that delusional disorders rarely respond to medication.evans testified,however,that despite this common wisdom he believed that antipsychotic medication would be substantially likely to work on bush,relying for his opinion on gonzalez report,as well as a study conducted by byron herbel and hans stelmach herbel study,which had been published subsequent to bush evaluation.see byron herbel hans stelmach,involuntary medication treatment for competency restoration of defendants with delusional disorder,am.acad.psychiatry.
the herbel study reported findings from an evaluation of the files of men involuntarily medicated at the federal medical center in butner,north carolina.of the men studied,or,were likely restored to competence after taking medication.more specifically,of the men who,like bush,had delusional disorder,persecutory type,or,were restored to competence.but,of the men with histories of untreated delusional disease longer than years,only,or,was likely restored to competence.the study concluded 
despite the limitations of this study,the results provide mental health professionals some evidence that most of the incompetent male defendants with a diagnosis of delusional disorder,especially the persecution subtype,will respond favorably to involuntary treatment with standard doses of first and antipsychotic medications.additional research is needed to confirm and expand on these findings.
following the hearings,the district court applied the standard in sell united states,d,ruling as follows 
having carefully reviewed the evidence in this case and conducting my own investigation and questioning of evans,i will accept the findings of evans on both prongs of the second sell factor.in my view,this does not detract from montalbano reputation,which is excellent,and his abilities,but i find that evans is simply more experienced in this area of psychotropic medication.he was part of a multidisciplinary team that evaluated bush over a period of a month and a half.in the aggregate,the team,all of whose members agree with evans,is more experienced than montalbano in this area.also,evans relied upon a study,and the study is certainly subject to debate,but it does point to a likelihood of restoration so that this forcible medication is not a full serum in that respect.
accordingly,i find that the administration of psychotropic medication is substantially likely to render bush competent to stand trial.based upon testimony of evans and the reports,which are admitted into evidence,i also find that the other prongs of the sell test are satisfied.
following the district court order to medicate bush involuntarily,bush filed this interlocutory appeal,see sell,at,and the district court stayed its order pending appeal.
a n individual has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs an interest that only an essential or overriding state interest might overcome.sell,at.quoting riggins nevada,d.this is because t he forcible injection of medication into a nonconsenting person body represents a substantial interference with that person liberty.washington harper,d.indeed,it has been observed that when the purpose or effect of forced drugging is to alter the will and the mind of the subject,it constitutes a deprivation of liberty in the most literal and fundamental sense.id.at.stevens,dissenting.
at the same time,the government has a significant interest in bringing a person accused of a serious crime to trial.see sell,at.the power to bring an accused to trial is fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty and prerequisite to social justice and peace.illinois allen,d brennan,concurring.it surely is not an overstatement to observe that the government ability to enforce the criminal laws in accordance with due process is the foundation on which social order rests and from which individual liberties emanate.thus,when an individual commits a crime,he forfeits his liberty interests to the extent necessary for the government to bring him to trial.recognizing this important governmental interest,the supreme court has held that in some circumstances,forced medication to render a defendant competent to stand trial for a crime that the per son is charged with committing may be constitutionally permissible,even though the circumstances in which it is appropriate may be rare.see sell,at.as the court stated the principle 
t he constitution permits the government involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill defendant facing serious criminal charges in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial,but only if the treatment is medically appropriate,is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial,and,taking account of less intrusive alternatives,is necessary significantly to further important governmental interests.
articulating a standard for determining the circumstances in which the government may obtain a court order to medicate involuntarily a defendant to render him competent to stand trial,the supreme court has focused on the competing interests of the defendant and the government.the standard thus requires the government to satisfy the following test first,the government must show that important governmental interests are at stake.sell,at.second,it must show that involuntary medication will significantly further those concomitant state interests.id.at.third,it must show that involuntary medication is necessary to further those governmental interests.id.and fourth,it must show that administration of the drugs is medically appropriate.id.
because the involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs for purposes of trial competence implicates both a person significant liberty interest in avoiding unwanted drugs and the public interest in prosecuting crimes,a higher standard of proof for entry of such an order is desirable.a higher standard greater than the standard but not as demanding as the the risk of erroneous decisions in this important context.see addington texas,d.analogizing from the standard articulated in addington,we therefore conclude that the government must satisfy the sell factors by clear and convincing evidence.this is consistent with the conclusions reached by all of the other courts of appeals that have considered the matter.see united states green,cir united states gomes,cir addington,at.holding that due process permits involuntary commitment to a mental hospital in a civil commitment proceeding applying the standard of proof.
with these legal standards in hand,we now address bush arguments on appeal.
