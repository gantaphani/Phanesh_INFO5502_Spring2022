james lockett,a prisoner at the alger maximum correctional facility in michigan,is serving a sentence of to years for assault.during a misconduct hearing at the prison,lockett became angry and used crude language to insult the hearing officer.he claims that two prison guards responded by forcibly removing him from the hearing room and assaulting him,thereby causing him to suffer minor cuts and lacerations.he further alleges that two prison nurses refused to treat his injuries.
lockett subsequently filed a pro se complaint pursuant to against the two prison guards and the two nurses employed by the michigan department of corrections mdoc,alleging that his first amendment right of free speech was violated when the prison guards attacked him and the nurses denied him medical treatment in retaliation for insulting the hearing officer.he also claims that his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was violated by the prison guards,who allegedly used excessive force against him,and by the nurses,who purportedly denied him medical treatment for his injuries.the prison guards,on the other hand,contend that lockett became belligerent and threatening upon leaving the hearing and that they used reasonable force to control him.furthermore,lockett medical records showed that one of the was never contacted to see him following the incident.the other nurse,who saw him twice within hours of the incident,attested that she did not observe any injuries,nor did he tell her of any.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court,which granted summary judgment in favor of all the defendants.
background 
factual background 
on july,lockett attended a prison administrative hearing to face charges of misconduct that had been filed against him by a prison officer.the nature of that misconduct is not described in the record and is not relevant to this appeal.during the hearing,lockett became angry with hearing officer maki.lockett stated in his affidavit that his anger was not due to the misconduct report against him,which he considered to be false,but because he believed that maki had conspired with various staff officers in regards to the misconduct report,was in cahoots with the prison officer who had filed the misconduct charges,and ran a kangaroo court.i felt a need to tell this hearings officer exact ly how i felt,and i called this hearings officer a foul and corrupted bitch,expressing verbally the way i felt towards this in his complaint,he explained,i just wanted hearing officer maki to know how i felt.maki immediately terminated the hearing and instructed the guards to take lockett back to his cell.the parties do not dispute the foregoing facts,but tell differing stories about what happened next.
lockett claims that joseph suardini,one of the two prison guards known as resident unit officers,or ruos who had accompanied him to the hearing,responded to lockett comment by forcing lockett out of his chair,shoving him out of the hearing room,and attempting to throw him head first down a flight of stairs.suardini did not succeed in throwing him down the stairs,lockett contends,only because the second ruo,harry irvine,was holding onto the restraint straps attached to lockett handcuffs.according to lockett,suardini then assaulted him by trying to push lockett head into a wall,attempting to choke him,and grabbing lockett by the throat,all of which caused lockett to suffer what he described as minor lacerations and cuts.lockett admits that he then bit suardini hand,but claims that he did so only in.ruo irvine allegedly joined in the assault by bending back lockett first two fingers,which lockett believed was an attempt to break them.lockett claims that the assault continued as irvine and suardini took him back to his cell,where he says that he was placed in soft restraints.
robert palmer,a fellow inmate,submitted an affidavit stating that he witnessed the altercation outside of the hearing room while cleaning a nearby common area.he attests that he observed suardini and irvine escorting lockett from the disciplinary hearing,and that he saw suardini grab lockett jaw and face,pull lockett down the stairs,and slam lockett into the wall.palmer also states that irvine was pulling lockett handcuff strap using extreme force,and that a t no time prior to this altercation had resident lockett made any aggressive motions toward staff.
irvine and suardini tell a substantially different version of the altercation.they contend that,as they removed lockett from the hearing room following his comment to maki,lockett lunged toward maki.this caused suardini to grab lockett restraints.suardini and irvine further claim that,upon leaving the hearing room,lockett became disruptive and yelled at suardini if i could get these cuffs off i kill you.lockett complaint and affidavit do not address whether he made such a threat,although he denies that he had lunged toward maki.the officers also assert that,as they escorted lockett down a flight of stairs toward his cell,lockett kicked suardini,tried to break free,and got a hold of and twisted suardini fingers.suardini affidavit states that he tried to restrain lockett by putting his arm around lockett and wrestling lockett to the floor until additional help arrived.
the incident reports filed by irvine and suardini further recount that they,with help from other officers,restrained lockett against a wall and that lockett fell to the floor in the process.at that point,lockett bit suardini hand and continued to struggle against the officers.irvine,suardini,and the other officers finally returned lockett to his cell,where they say that lockett refused to let them remove his restraints.suardini denies that he assaulted and tried to choke lockett.he also claims that he and irvine were taken to a hospital to receive treatment for unspecified injuries that they sustained in the altercation.the incident reports and affidavits filed by irvine and suardini are consistent with each other and with the statements filed by other prison officers who witnessed the altercation and assisted in restraining lockett.
lockett asserted in his complaint that the assault caused open wounds on both of his hands,his forehead,and knee,and that these injuries caused him extreme pain.but in his affidavit responding to mdoc motion for summary judgment,lockett described these injuries as minor lacerations and cuts on his forehead,left knee and both wrists,with sic blood.palmer affidavit makes no mention of lockett injuries.
the parties also tell different stories regarding whether lockett was denied medical treatment for the injuries he sustained in the incident.lockett asserts in his complaint that,following the alleged assault,he informed nurse nancy blackford of his injuries.he claims that blackford refused to treat him.the next day,he purportedly showed his injuries to a second nurse,maryrose galloway,who he alleges also refused to treat him.palmer affidavit does not make reference to any treatment that lockett may or may not have received for his purported injuries.
blackford,however,submitted an affidavit stating that,following the july,incident,she did not receive a call for medical assistance for lockett and that she had no contact with him.her later review of lockett medical chart showed that his restraints were checked four of which were by the hours following the incident,and that no complaints of injuries or pain were recorded.he was also scheduled to be seen by a nurse on july,but for some unknown reason he did not keep the appointment.lockett medical records also revealed that he complained of numbness and tingling in his right and left thumbs on august,but that a subsequent was negative for both dislocation and fracture.
blackford account is consistent with the affidavit of galloway,who first checked lockett restraints just before midnight on july.lockett was standing at his cell door and immediately began raising his voice as she approached him,complaining about his medications and his inability to get his off,which he had pulled over his head and down to his forearms.he was apparently unable to remove the completely because of his restraints.she observed that it would be seemingly impossible for lockett to have gotten his off as far as he had with the injuries he was claiming.galloway then gave lockett his medications.but she observed no signs of injury,much less the injuries lockett is claiming,and he made no mention of anything regarding a staff assault or injuries.galloway checked lockett restraints again early the next morning.according to galloway affidavit,he was laying on his bunk facing the wall in no distress.lockett looked at me when i asked him if he was okay,stated no in a sarcastic tone,then turned his back to me and would not answer any further.he was in no distress at that time.
lockett was subsequently charged with assault as a result of the july,incident.an administrative hearing on the charge was held in early august of.according to the hearing officer report,lockett refused to attend and the hearing was held without him.the hearing officer viewed a surveillance video that captured the altercation outside of the hearing room and described what he saw at the top of the stairs,one officer is seen contorting his body as he goes down steps.there appears to be a scuffle at the bottom of the stairs and the prisoner is taken back across the hall to his cell.the hearing officer concluded,based on the incident report,irvine and suardini statements,and the video,that lockett was guilty of assault.he found that 
t he prisoner became disruptive as he was being escorted the officer would not be moving and trying to control the prisoner movements unless lockett had moved first.then,at the bottom of the stairs there appears to have been a struggle between the two officers and this prisoner.the movements of staff are consistent with being kicked or bitten.i find that the prisoner made non consensual contact with the officer.the comments to the officer that lockett would kill the consistent with the fact that lockett deliberately and intentionally kicked and bit the officer.
lockett punishment was days of lost privileges.in addition,lockett acknowledges that he lost credits for the month following his disciplinary conviction for the assault,as mandated by michigan law.see.comp.laws.
procedural background 
on july,one day after the incident,lockett filed a grievance against nurses blackford and galloway for refusing to treat his injuries and deliberately causing him additional pain and suffering.he also filed a separate grievance against ruos irvine and suardini for assault,battery,and cruel and unusual punishment.the resolution of those grievances is unclear from the record,but mdoc does not argue that lockett has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.lockett then filed a pro se complaint pursuant to against blackford,galloway,irvine,and suardini in the district court in early august of.in it,he alleged that the defendants had violated his first amendment rights by attacking him and denying him medical treatment in retaliation for his comment to hearing officer maki,his eighth amendment right to be free of excessive force when restraining him,and his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by denying him medical treatment.mdoc,on behalf of the individual defendants,subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment,to which lockett responded without supporting documentation by repeating the allegations contained in his complaint and disputing mdoc version of events.
the magistrate judge assigned to the case issued a report and recommendation r r granting mdoc motion,finding that lockett action was barred pursuant to heck humphrey,d,because his allegations necessarily implied the invalidity of his disciplinary conviction for the july,assault,ruos irvine and suardini did not violate lockett eighth amendment rights because they used a reasonable,rather than an excessive,amount of force to control lockett,nurses blackford and galloway did not violate his eighth amendment rights in failing to treat his injuries because lockett failed to show the existence of a serious medical need,lockett first amendment claim failed because his comment to the hearing officer was not protected speech,and the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because lockett failed to show that they violated any of his constitutional rights.lockett responded to the r r by filing his own affidavit and that of robert palmer.
twenty days later,the district court adopted the r r over lockett objections.lockett has timely appealed with the assistance of counsel.

standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
applicability of heck bar to lockett claims 
section provides a cause of action for the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws by any person acting under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory.the supreme court,however,has limited the availability of actions for prisoners in a series of cases,the most pertinent of which is heck humphrey,d.our court recently explained the bar that heck places on suits brought by prisoners 
federal courts have long recognized the potential for prisoners to evade the habeas exhaustion requirements by challenging the duration of their confinement under,rather than by filing habeas petitions.consequently,the supreme court recognized a habeas exception to in preiser rodriguez,d,when it held that suits challenging the fact or duration of confinement fall within the traditional scope of habeas corpus and accordingly are not cognizable under.the court expanded the habeas exception to in heck humphrey,d,and edwards balisok,d.in heck,the court determined that,unless a prisoner conviction or sentence were previously set aside by a separate legal or administrative action,would not countenance claims for damages if a finding for the plaintiff would necessarily invalidate a conviction or sentence.and in balisok,the court concluded that a prisoner can not use to challenge prison procedures employed to deprive him of credits when the procedural defect alleged would,if established,necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed.at.at.
thomas eby,cir emphasis in original.
mdoc initially argued that heck bars both lockett first amendment claim and his eighth amendment claim,but later conceded at oral argument that his eighth amendment claim is not barred by heck because lockett disruptive and threatening behavior upon leaving the hearing room would not justify the allegedly excessive force that lockett was subjected to,even if lockett was in fact guilty of assault.see huey stine,cir in general,the federal courts hold that eighth amendment claims do not run afoul of heck because the question of the degree of force used by a police or corrections officer is analytically distinct from the question whether the plaintiff violated the law.citing nelson jashurek,cir noting that it is possible for a finding that the defendant was resisting arrest to coexist with a finding that the police used excessive force to subdue him,abrogated on other grounds by muhammad close,d.the same reasoning applies to lockett claim that the nurses were deliberately indifferent to his injuries.that claim could hypothetically succeed,regardless of whether the nurses knew of the altercation or lockett comment to the hearing officer,and notwithstanding lockett actual guilt in assaulting the ruos.
thus the only remaining question under heck is whether lockett first amendment claim necessarily implies the invalidity of his misconduct conviction for assault.lockett challenges mdoc contention that his claims are barred by heck and,alternatively,argues that,if heck applies to any of his claims,this court should nevertheless allow those claims to go forward under an exception to heck that was articulated by the second circuit in peralta vasquez,cir holding that,if a prisoner both agrees to and can successfully abandon once and for all a claim challenging the duration of his sentence as a precondition to maintaining his that his success in the action would have no effect on the sanctions that relate to the length of time he served in prison then the concern underlying heck would not apply and the claim would not be barred emphasis in original.
a successful action on lockett first amendment claim would mean that his comment to the hearing officer was protected speech and that the defendants had retaliated against him for engaging in such speech.but such a finding would not necessarily imply the invalidity of lockett misconduct conviction for assault because lockett could have unlawfully assaulted the officers in the course of the altercation by using force beyond that necessary to defend himself,even if the incident was precipitated by the officers own retaliatory conduct.where there is room for the facts alleged by the plaintiff and the facts essential to the judgment of the state agency to peacefully,the must be allowed to go forward.woods lozer,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,citing heck,at.accordingly,we conclude that lockett first amendment retaliation claim is analytically distinct from whether he was guilty of assault and therefore does not implicate heck.and because of our determination that none of lockett claims are barred by heck,we need not address his argument that this court should recognize the peralta exception to heck bar.
c.the merits of lockett first amendment claims 
a prisoner alleging retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right must show that 
the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct an adverse action was taken against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct and there is a causal connection between elements one and is,the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiff protected conduct.
blatter,cir en banc.lockett admits that he called hearing officer maki a foul and corrupted bitch.the threshold question is therefore whether that comment was protected conduct under the first prong of the test.
mdoc contends that lockett comment was not protected because it constituted insolent behavior in violation of mdoc disciplinary regulations.lockett did not respond to this argument,asserting instead that his speech was protected under the test.mdoc correctly notes that whether the test determines the protection to be afforded a prisoner speech is an open question in the sixth circuit.in,this court sitting en banc specifically refused to make a determination about the appropriateness of explicitly applying the limitation to speech by prisoners.id.at.nor do we need to decide that issue here,because the court held in that if a prisoner violates a legitimate prison regulation,he is not engaged in protected conduct,and can not proceed beyond step one of the retaliation analysis.id.at see also turner safley,d holding that a prison regulation that impinges on inmates constitutional rights is nevertheless valid if that regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.
mdoc policy directive provides that insolent behavior is a major misconduct violation.dep t of corr.pol y directive b,attachment b major misconducts,at.gov corrections follow the publications and information link,then follow the policy directives link,see also scott churchill,cir analyzing the claim of a michigan state prisoner against whom a prison officer filed an allegedly false major misconduct charge for insolent behavior denham shroad,cir addressing the claim of a michigan state prisoner who was convicted of major misconduct for,among other things,insolent behavior.such behavior is defined as w ords,actions,or other behavior which is intended to harass,degrade,or cause alarm in an employee.dep t of corr.pol y directive b,attachment b major misconducts,at.lockett comment that the hearing officer was a foul and corrupted bitch was insulting,derogatory,and questioned her authority as well as the integrity of the proceeding.it thus falls well within the definition of insolence under the mdoc policy directive.accordingly,lockett first amendment claim fails as a matter of law because his comment to the hearing officer was not protected conduct under.
d.the merits of lockett eighth amendment claims 
excessive force 
lockett next argues that ruos irvine and suardini used excessive force,in violation of the eighth amendment,when they restrained him following his july,hearing.mdoc does not dispute that the ruos used force against lockett,but instead challenges lockett claim that the force used was excessive.the eighth amendment prohibits punishments that involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,including inflictions of pain that are totally without penological justification.rhodes chapman,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.this court has held that in the prison context,good faith use of physical force may be necessary to maintain prison security and discipline.williams browman,cir.the supreme court has explained that 
w here a prison security measure is undertaken to resolve a disturbance that indisputably poses significant risks to the safety of inmates and prison staff,we think the question whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering ultimately turns on whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.
whitley albers,d internal quotation marks omitted.
furthermore,the extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor that may suggest whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary in a particular situation,or instead evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.hudson mcmillian,d holding that the extent of the defendant injuries,including bruises,swelling,loosened teeth,and a cracked dental plate,were sufficiently serious for his claim to survive a motion to dismiss quoting whitley,at.the eighth amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force,provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
an absence of serious injury is therefore relevant to the eighth amendment inquiry,but does not end it.id.at.this analysis must be carefully circumscribed to take into account the nature of the prison setting in which the conduct occurs and to prevent a prison official conduct from being subjected to unreasonable post hoc judicial.parrish johnson,cir see also williams,at a ll the facts and circumstances surrounding the application of force must be scrutinized and weighed.
lockett does not dispute that he insulted the hearing officer,became very angered and upset during the hearing,bit ruo suardini hand while being escorted back to his cell,and resisted the ruos in response to their allegedly excessive use of force.nor does he challenge mdoc contention that he verbally threatened the ruos outside of the hearing room.although his fellow prisoner attested that he did not see lockett acting in an aggressive manner toward the ruos,lockett undisputed conduct alone provided the ruos with a good faith basis for using force to control lockett,restore discipline and order,and transport him back to his cell.see williams,at.
lockett own assertions indicate that a minimal amount of force was applied by the ruos.he stated that suardini attempted,unsuccessfully,to throw him down the stairs and choke him,and that both ruos tried to push his face into the wall.in attempting to choke him,lockett explained that suardin
