the plaintiff,tommy holly holly,appeals from the district court grant of final summary judgment in favor of his former employer,defendant clairson industries clairson,on holly claims that clairson failed to reasonably accommodate his disability,in violation of title i of the americans with disabilities act of,ada,and its florida analog,the florida civil rights act of.stat.fcra.after seventeen years of strong work performance during which clairson informally accommodated holly tardiness,clairson terminated holly,pursuant to its new,punctuality policy.the district court granted summary judgment to clairson after finding that strict punctuality,as defined by clairson new policy,was an essential function of holly job within the meaning of the statutes,and that holly was incapable of performing that function with or without a reasonable accommodation.the district court further held,in the alternative,that holly was not the victim of unlawful discrimination because he had offered no evidence that clairson had treated him differently from,employees.
after thorough review of this record,we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist concerning whether strict punctuality was an essential function of holly position.accordingly,the entry of summary judgment for clairson on this issue was improper.moreover,it was error for the district court to have held,in the alternative,that holly is required to present evidence that his employer treated him differently than his.under the plain language of the ada and the fcra,an employer failure to reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified disabled employee itself constitutes unlawful discrimination,unless the employer can show undue hardship.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the relevant facts in this summary judgment record,which we take in the light most favorable to holly as the,see earl mervyns,cir per curiam,are these.holly became a paraplegic in,at the age of about,as a result of a motorcycle accident.since then,holly has been confined to a wheelchair for the majority of each day,although he is able to drive an automobile.clairson hired holly in,shortly after clairson opening.clairson is a custom plastic injections molder that manufactures,using an assembly line,industrial and medical devices such as disposable surgical tools.holly was hired for the position of mold polisher,where for many years he worked in the tool room polishing molds after they came off the assembly line.holly shift ran from to,although he normally worked more than forty,and sometimes as many as sixty,hours per week.
although holly has never had an attendance problem,he acknowledges that from the beginning of his employment at clairson,his disability frequently caused him to arrive late to work clairson employees punctuality is recorded when they punch in for work on a time clock located in the break room.employees access the break room in one of two ways utilizing either an internal entrance from the main area of the warehouse into the break room or an external entrance from the parking lot into the break room.to avoid overtime charges,employees are not permitted to clock in prior to five minutes before the start of their shift thus,holly was required to clock in between and in order to be on time.
for the first fifteen years or so of holly employment with clairson,absenteeism and tardiness were primarily addressed at an employee annual review,where supervisors had some discretion over whether to alter their recommendations for retention and salary raises based on an employee tardiness.mold polishers are directly supervised by the mold shop manager.thus,holly addressed the tardiness problems caused by his disability by discussing them with the mold shop manager.the mold shop manager from to,steve nilson nilson,and the mold shop manager from to,dennis miller miller,collectively served as holly immediate supervisor for some thirteen of holly seventeen years with clairson.each gave deposition testimony in this case.according to miller,under this flexible policy,i f the h uman r esources people would approach me and say that a man had been tardy or late or absent or whatever,i had the authority to tell them that it was okay by me for whatever reason.
holly testified,and the record reflects,that when he was late to work,it was usually only by a minute or so.both miller and nilson testified that on these they agreed accounted for the vast majority of his did not notice that holly was late,and only learned of these tardies from human resources prior to an annual review.holly gave various reasons for being a minute or so late.occasionally,he said,one of several picnic tables in the break room had been moved in front of the time clock,blocking his access to the clock from his wheelchair.although clairson normally moved such tables as soon as holly asked it to do so,holly supervisor from to,greg huff,noted on some of his annual reviews that some of the tardies recorded there were due to occasions when the time clock had been blocked by a table.miller similarly confirmed that t he break area where the time clock was situated was extremely small.and due to the number of employees that the company had,they had to have a lot of tables in the breakroom to accommodate the people during their breaks and the time clock was back behind the tables.so when holly came into the break area,he had to weave his way through the tables to get back to the clock.and it was like that up to,probably,six months before i left in may of 
holly testified that at other times,pallets of raw materials blocked the interior or exterior entrance to the break room.because clairson was short on storage space,he explained,it tended to store both raw materials and finished product in any dry place it could find.holly testified that miller often fought with archie mann,the person in charge of the production area in the warehouse,about the fact that hallways,entrances,the tool room and occasionally the breakroom were blocked,but that mann would respond that he had nowhere else to place the materials,and that more than once miller unblocked these places himself.miller confirmed that holly had complained to him on several occasions about various blockages and that miller had discussed the problem with mann,who had suggested that holly simply arrive to work ten or fifteen minutes earlier to move around our obstacles.holly estimated that these blockages caused him to be late four or five times after the new policy went into affect.
holly also said that occasionally he was unable to clock in on time because he was in a long line of fellow employees also trying to clock in in addition,although every employee encounters the occasional car problem,he said that some types of car problems would be particularly difficult for him to fix,given his disability.similarly,if it were raining heavily when he arrived at work,he sometimes waited in his car for the rain to subside he had difficulty handling his wheelchair and an umbrella at the same time,and unlike his,once he was wet he would remain wet throughout the work day,since he was unable to stand up and dry off.finally,holly said that he sees a urologist three to four times per year for complications related to his disability,and that this,too,sometimes caused him to be late to work.
more rarely,holly was noticeably thirty minutes or more.such lateness occurred when holly lost bowel control while driving to consequence of his had to return home to change before heading back to work again.holly did not feel comfortable discussing this problem with nilson,but when holly,miller,was promoted to mold shop manager,holly confided in miller according to miller,what i did is,i approached my boss,steve nilson,at that time,and he,in turn,approached phil effinger,who was the president of the company at the time,to express that and explain that.and that kind of helped us let some of those slide and it also helped us get him money at the end of the year when his reviews were due.
mold shop managers were required to have their annual review of employees approved by effinger.nilson testified that holly number of tardies would jump out compared to those of other mold polishers,and that holly sometimes did not receive a raise or received a lower raise than he otherwise deserved due to his tardiness,but that holly was kept on because of his job performance.in the mold shop department a tardiness issue did not affect how work was done,versus,as it is in production.manufacturing is really sensitive where mold building is not.miller,who supervised holly in his last several years at clairson,testified that he gave holly a raise e very time he came up for review,observing that mold polishing was as time sensitive as other areas,so that if somebody stayed late,as opposed to coming in early,it would really matter as long as the work was done.it is undisputed that holly did indeed get his work done in a timely fashion by working through breaks or after his shift to make up for any time he lost at the beginning of his shift.
clairson concedes that holly had a good attendance as opposed to a punctuality record,and that o ther than holly tardiness problems,he was a good employee.in fact,clairson approved numerous and regular merit raises for holly throughout his tenure at holly received his last merit raise in february of,just weeks before he was terminated on may of that year in fact,both of holly supervisors testified that he was very good at his job.miller said holly was always a good worker he was extremely talented.extremely organized,very neat,orderly,very meticulous about the stuff that he did.miller testified that he regularly recommended raises for holly based on holly ability to perform his job,the quality of his workmanship,his dependability.tommy was one of those fellas that may come in a minute or two late in the morning,but he would make it up.whether he would stay over in the evening,work through a break,work through a lunch hour,work through whatever to help the company get the job done.nilson similarly testified that f rom a job performance standpoint,holly did his job very well.
holly performance evaluations by all four mold shop managers who supervised holly during his seventeen years at clairson support this testimony.they consistently gave holly reviews,and described him as a very dependable and reliable employee who always hangs in there when needed,and as a real asset to our shop.holly supervisors also praised him for his excellent productivity and initiative,for his very good work,and for always help ing out when polishing is scarce.once,holly was named employee of the month.
in march of,clairson hired cloteen kilkelly kilkelly,an employee benefits specialist,to advise clairson on how to make some changes in that area.in november of,kilkelly became executive vice president and then,in april of,president.on june,on kilkelly recommendation,clairson instituted a new,attendance policy.under the policy,each absence from work counts as one occurrence,while each partial as a occurrence.an employee who clocks in even one second past his shift start time receives a occurrence.the policy provides for a progressive series of verbal and written warnings as an employee accrues more occurrences,and provides for immediate termination upon the accrual of eighteen tardies or nine occurrences within one year 
as the company employee manual explains,the policy employs a standard 
under the approach,there are no excused or unexcused absences.employees need not prove the legitimacy of an absence,nor are forced to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for an absence.
under a system,there is no need for a written physician excuse.physician statements will be required to support a request for a medical leave.medical leaves are granted for periods of five days or more.
thus,as kilkelly testified,tardy employees may not make up lost time during breaks or after their shift.nor may they plan to be excusably tardy for any reason,including to see a doctor unless their medical condition results in their missing five or more consecutive days of work.even paid vacation counts toward an employee occurrence allotment.moreover,the employee manual states that a ttendance is an essential job function for all at the company.employees with american disability act sic situations are not exempt from this policy.
the employee manual explains its rationale this way.as for the attendance policy in general,the handbook says 
each employee is expected to work the hours normally scheduled for his or her position.when employees fail to take attendance seriously,time consuming rearrangements and costly replacements are often necessary to maintain our business activity.each employee is therefore responsible for reporting to work regularly and on time 
with respect to partial in particular,the handbook explains 
tardy employees may delay assembly operations and force other employees to stand idle as the supervisor waits for unpunctual employees to report to work or until temporary replacements can be oriented and placed on the job 
kilkelly testified that the purpose of the standard was to take the subjectivity somewhat out of people being treated differently by different supervisors and to address the chronic offender.she confirmed that under this standard,there are no acceptable reasons for being tardy.
miller testified that once holly learned of the new policy,holly approached miller,then his immediate supervisor,and said to me that you know,it going to be extremely difficult for me to do this with my problems that i have.holly further said that miller told him on at least one occasion that he would go to the front office and talk to them o n my behalf.the record is unclear as to how far up clairson management chain holly expressed concern went after this.miller added that instead of approaching kilkelly,he approached nilson.miller explained that kilkelly 
was kind of a person to me to supervisors sic.she liked dealing with her managers,which steven nilson was my immediate manager.and steve and i talked all the time about different procedures and policies and what we could do.and steven and myself knew that a minute or two late was not hurting the company.we knew it was being made up.we knew that the guys were trying very hard for whatever reason.but whether he carried that on to kilkelly,i ca answer that.
miller also said that he expressed to nilson his concerns that under the new policy employees with medical problems would be disadvantaged 
i will give you an example.we had some fellows that are diabetics that have to take certain blood tests which ha ve to be performed at seven in the morning four times a year so every time they did that,they got half an occurrence and i expressed my concern to him about,you have a model employee here that works,sixty hours a week,saturdays,sundays,whatever,and we ca make an accommodation for a fellow that actually has a doctor appointment 
i told nilson i thought it was unfair the men that worked the day shift have to go to the doctor.the women have to go to the doctor.there has to be some type of exceptions made where the policy is flexible enough to allow you to do that.and this was so ironclad,and steven nilson agreed with me.but he said it been the directive from hr and that the way it going to be.
nilson,in turn,who was at the time a vice president of the company,testified that only clairson president,kilkelly,had the authority to veto a termination,and that with respect to holly,he had gone to hr trying to reverse occurrences,because it very difficult to replace an employee of that talent.and i was told that the system is in place for a reason,and no exceptions can be made.nilson said he argued to human resources,i need this employee in my department,it extremely hard to replace a mold polisher and because our department is not as attendant sic sensitive as other departments in the company,i wanted to retain him.however,holly disability apparently did not specifically enter into nilson conversation with human resources about retaining holly.
on october,holly received a verbal warning,pursuant to the policy,after being late eight times,for a total of four occurrences.on february,after being late three more times and accumulating a total of occurrences,he received a second verbal warning.on march,holly received a written warning after he was late one more time and reached six occurrences.on april,he received a second written warning after he was late two more times,for a total of seven occurrences.on may,after holly was late four more times and reached nine occurrences,holly was automatically terminated.according to clairson records,holly had been late a total of one hour and thirteen minutes over eighteen episodes.on twelve of those occasions,holly was tardy by only one minute.he was also late by five minutes on two occasions,by six minutes once,and by minutes once according to nilson,after holly termination,the mold shop was downsized by about,or by about employees,due to lack of sales.clairson has not refilled holly position.
after receiving a notice of right to sue from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,holly commenced this lawsuit against clairson in the circuit court of the fifth judicial circuit,in and for marion county,florida,for failure to reasonably accommodate his disability,leading to his termination,in violation of the americans with disabilities act of,ada,and its florida analog,the florida civil rights act of.stat.fcra clairson removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of florida,and responded that holly claims must fail because he is not a qualified individual within the meaning of the ada and the is,one who,with or without a reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of his position.clairson argued that strict punctuality,pursuant to its new attendance policy,is an essential function of holly job that he can not perform with or without an accommodation,and that,in any case,holly never requested an accommodation,and therefore clairson obligation to provide one was never triggered.
the district court granted final summary judgment to clairson on both of holly claims.the court determined that strict punctuality,as defined by clairson policy,was an essential function of holly position,and that no reasonable accommodation would enable him to perform that function.the district court also sua sponte held,in the alternative,that holly claims failed because he did not provide any evidence that clairson treated him differently from employees.holly timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
as the district court correctly observed,claims under the fcra are analyzed using the same framework as ada claims.see conagra foods,cir.we therefore consider both claims together.see id.
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment on ada claims,construing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.lowe.power,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
under the controlling law in this circuit,t he analysis of title vii employment discrimination claims is applicable to ada claims.earl,at.to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must show he is disabled he is a qualified individual and he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability.id.it is undisputed that holly is disabled within the meaning of the ada.the other two prongs,however,are contested in this appeal.
prong two qualified individual 
in order to make out the second prong of his prima facie case,holly must prove that he is a qualified individual that is,someone with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.see also earl,at.accordingly,an ada plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation,or,failing that,that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation,at quotation marks omitted.an accommodation is reasonable and necessary under the ada,in turn,only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.lucas grainger,cir lachance duffy draft house,cir see also o ii the term reasonable accommodation means modifications or adjustments to the work environment,or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed,that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position emphasis added.if the individual is unable to perform an essential function of his job,even with an accommodation,he is,by definition,not a qualified individual and,therefore,not covered under the ada.in other words,the ada does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff job,at quotation marks and alterations omitted.on the other hand,the ada may require an employer to restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating some of its marginal functions.lucas,at emphasis added.
holly argues that clairson failed to accommodate his disability by not allowing him to occasionally clock in to work late and make up any lost time during breaks or overtime,as he had been allowed to do for fifteen years prior to the implementation of the new policy.clairson responds that strict punctuality,as defined by its policy,is an essential function of holly position as mold polisher,and that as such,it is not required to eliminate this critical function.assuming arguendo that this is true and we return to this central question below,it is clear from the fact that holly violated clairson punctuality policy on several occasions,and indeed by holly own admission,that his disability prevents him from performing this function without an accommodation.it is also clear that permitting holly to occasionally clock in late and make up lost time over breaks and after hours would not allow him to perform the function of strict punctuality,as defined by clairson policy,according to which tardiness by mere seconds constitutes an infraction which can not be made up,regardless of the cause of the tardiness.thus,assuming that strict punctuality,as defined by clairson policy,is an essential function of holly position,the accommodation holly suggests would require clairson to eliminate an essential function of holly job,something the ada does not require clairson to do.we therefore agree with the district court that if strict punctuality is indeed an essential function of holly position as a mold polisher,then he can not perform this function with or without reasonable accommodation,he is therefore not a qualified individual under the ada,and his claims ultimately must fail.
however,holly argues that strict in at precisely each a marginal,not an essential,function of his position.a reasonable accommodation may include parttime or modified work schedules.stewart happy herman cheshire bridge,cir quoting b eeoc,enforcement guidance reasonable accommodation and undue hardship under the americans with disabilities act,eeoc compl.man.cch,hereinafter eeoc enforcement guidance,question possible reasonable accommodations could include adjustments to starting times example an employee with major depression is often late for work because of medication that make him extremely groggy in the morning.his scheduled hours are to,but he arrives at,or even on any given day i f this individual can perform his job responsibilities by regularly working a schedule of to,a reasonable accommodation would be to modify his schedule so that he is not required to report for work until.thus,holly argues that rather than terminating him,clairson could have reasonably accommodated him simply by altering this marginal function to allow him occasionally to clock in late and make up that time during breaks or after his shift ends,the very course of conduct followed by clairson for the bulk of holly employment.
it is by now clear that essential functions are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform.earl,at see also n i.moreover,consideration shall be given to the employer judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job,this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.see also,at.applying this factor to the case at hand,the district court found ample evidence that punctuality is an essential function of holly position.order at.the court cited the existence of the punctuality policy itself,clairson rationale for the policy,as stated in the tardy employees may delay assembly operations and force other employees to stand idle,and kilkelly testimony that tardiness and attendance were concerns for the employer.id.in relying almost exclusively on this evidence,the district court stressed that it is within the employer discretion to determine what job functions are essential and it is beyond dispute that clairson made attendance and punctuality essential functions,both through its discipline of employees and clearly established policies.id.at.
however,when considering the employer judgment regarding what is an essential function,we have previously considered not only the company official position,but also testimony from the plaintiff supervisor.see,at.here,the two men who supervised holly for the vast majority of his many years at clairson,including his last year or so during which the new policy was in effect,each testified that holly job was not time sensitive,and,notably,that precise punctuality did matter.nilson said that i n the mold shop department a tardiness issue did not affect how work was done,versus,as it is in production.manufacturing is really sensitive where mold building is not.miller similarly testified that mold polishing was as time sensitive as other areas,so that if somebody stayed late,as opposed to coming in early,it would really matter as long as the work was done.thus,we think the record fairly reflects a genuine issue of material fact on this factor alone 
moreover,w hether a function is essential is evaluated on a basis by examining a number of factors,at quotation marks omitted and emphasis added see also n i evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes,but is not limited to the employer judgment as to which functions are essential emphasis added.thus,as we observed recently in,although the employer view is entitled to substantial weight in the calculus,this factor alone may not be conclusive.id.at.indeed,if it were considered to be conclusive,then an employer that did not wish to be inconvenienced by making a reasonable accommodation could,simply by asserting that the function is essential,avoid the clear congressional mandate that employers mak e reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee,unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.b a.
according to the eeoc regulations implementing the ada,other factors to be considered include the amount of time spent on the job performing the function,the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function,the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,the work experience of past incumbents in the job,and the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs,at quotation marks omitted citing n see also davis.power light,cir same.in addition,the eeoc regulations identify three nonexclusive bases on which a job function may be deemed essential the reason the position exists is to perform the function there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed and the function is highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position was hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function,at quotation marks omitted citing n.
several of these factors have little or no bearing on this case.the record contains no information,for instance,regarding the terms of any collective bargaining agreement,or the work experience of current and past mold polishers other than the testimony of miller and nilson,both former mold polishers,that this job is not.a few other factors apply to some extent to the situation at hand but are not very illuminating.thus,for instance,mold polishers spend very little time on the job performing the function of strict punctuality,the reason the position of mold polisher exists is certainly not to perform the function of being punctual,and holly was not hired for his expertise in performing the highly specialized function of punctuality.on the other hand,to the extent that strict punctuality is important,one polisher duty to be punctual can not be redistributed to another polisher.
far more illuminating in this case is a consideration of the consequences of not requiring holly to perform the function of strict punctuality.according to clairson,these consequences would be dire.the reason that employee tardiness is such an issue at clairson,it says,is that tardy employees can delay clairson assembly operations and force other employees to stand idle until the tardy employee portion of the product assembly can be completed.clairson says that this reasoning holds equally true for the position of mold polisher,and that punctuality is an essential function of holly position because holly is one of many employees involved in assembling products for clairson.as holly stated himself in his deposition,some jobs take hours to complete and another job might take minutes.consequently,tardiness can slow product assembly.memo.of law in support of mtn.for sum.at see also id.at clairson manufacturing business requires its employees to work together to assemble products and punctuality is therefore essential.the district court agreed,and found that holly worked on the assembly line,polishing the steel tooling after it was formed from the molds.order at.this record,however,is not so clear.
as a threshold matter,the record does not suggest that holly worked on the assembly line.to the contrary,the record indicates that the mold shop where polishers work is actually separate from the assembly line which was in a different room of the warehouse,and that holly and others polish the molds after they come off of the assembly line.miller testified,for example,that holly polished the steel tooling after we were finished machining it emphasis added.even kilkelly testified that as mold polisher,holly would sit at a table and the steel molds that come off of another area,mold maker,the steel must be polished emphasis added.nor is there any record evidence that mold polishers are required to work together with other employees to assemble products.that is,there is no evidence that other mold polishers would need to wait for holly to arrive in order to complete their own mold polishing.nor is there any evidence of any stage of manufacturing,such that employees in that department would have their work delayed by the tardiness of a mold polisher.eeoc enforcement guidance,question if the result of modifying one employee work hours is to prevent other employees from doing their jobs,then the significant disruption to the operations of the employer constitutes an undue hardship.instead,the best inference we can draw from this record in favor of the we must do given the procedural posture in which we review that mold polishing,as miller and nilson explained,is a fairly solitary,activity.thus,whatever may be said of clairson employees who work on the assembly line,there is precious little in this record to support the claim that a mold polisher occasional by only one delay clairson assembly operations and force other employees to stand idle until his portion of the product assembly can be completed,or that a mold polisher tardiness can slow product assembly.
the district court considered the argument that holly work as a mold polisher was not time sensitive,but rejected it 
the fact that his polishing projects,by themselves,were not necessarily performed under strict deadlines does not mean that attendance and punctuality were not essential functions.as holly himself testified,some of his polishing jobs would take several hours,or even several days.by not arriving to work on time,he was slowing down his production,increasing overhead,and potentially increasing overtime costs.
id.at.but there is no discussion whatsoever in this record of clairson overhead costs under any circumstances,and we can find no record evidence to support the court finding of increased overhead.indeed,it is particularly difficult to imagine an actual increase in overhead costs due to holly tardiness since the vast majority of the time he was late by only one minute,and the accommodation he was permitted for some fifteen years,and which he seeks again now,involves his making up any lost time the same business day.similarly,there is no record evidence that holly was paid overtime in the past when he made up lost time during his breaks or after his shift,nor has he requested overtime pay as part of the accommodation he currently seeks.
in sum,although clairson makes the bare assertion that strict punctuality by mold polishers is important in order to keep production moving,the record contains virtually no evidence that holly needed to work with others to complete his work,that his tardiness ever caused production to slow down or caused any other detriment to clairson,or that he ever failed to complete his molds on time.to the contrary,holly supervisors,former mold polishers themselves,testified that holly work was not,that he was able to make up his lateness the same day without impacting business,and that he was a valuable employee they fought to retain.
these factors distinguish this case from earl,relied on by clairson and the district court,where we held,after considering not only the employer emphasis on the importance of punctuality,but also the importance of her timely presence at her job as store area coordinator,that punctuality was indeed an essential function of the plaintiff position.at.unlike holly position of mold polisher,the store area coordinator was shouldered with the duty of preparing her area of the store for customers each morning.if the plaintiff were tardy for her morning shift,then her area would not be ready for the usual influx of morning customers,and if she were tardy for a later shift,employees working the shift before hers would be forced to work overtime waiting for her to arrive.see id.
as a result,the most that can be said for clairson position is that a genuine dispute of material fact exists regarding whether punctuality as defined by clairson policy is an essential element of holly job,and it was thus error for the district court to have taken this issue away from the and awarded summary judgment to clairson 
prong three subjected to unlawful discrimination 
although clairson did not claim that holly failed to make out the third prong of his prima facie he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his district court sua sponte held,in the alternative,that summary judgment for clairson was warranted because holly has not identified a single comparator or put forth a single shred of evidence that he was treated differently from any employee who violated clairson attendance policy.order at.the district court implication that holly was required to prove disparate treatment reflects,we believe,a misunderstanding of the fundamental nature of a reasonable accommodation claim under the ada 
under the ada,an employer may not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to discharge of employees.a see also earl,at.t he term discriminate includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an employee,unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business b a.thus,an employer failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ada,so long as that individual is otherwise qualified,and unless the employer can show undue hardship.there is no additional burden on holly to show that clairson enforced its punctuality policy in a discriminatory manner by granting leniency under the policy to holly while denying holly the same leniency,nor any subsequent burdens on clairson to show that it had any legitimate reasons for terminating holly or on holly to establish that these reasons were pretextual.order at 
put another way,clairson is not insulated from liability under the ada by treating its employees exactly the same as its disabled employees.in race and sex employment discrimination cases,discrimination is usually proved by showing that employers treat similarly situated employees differently because of their race or sex.however,the very purpose of reasonable accommodation laws is to require employers to treat disabled individuals differently in some,when different treatment would allow a disabled individual to perform the essential functions of his position by accommodating his disability without posing an undue hardship on the employer.allowing,policies to trump the ada requirement of reasonable accommodations would utterly eviscerate that ada requirement.as the supreme court has explained 
p references will sometimes prove necessary to achieve the act basic equal opportunity goal.the act requires preferences in the form of reasonable accommodations that are needed for those with disabilities to obtain the same workplace opportunities that those without disabilities automatically enjoy.by definition any special accommodation requires the employer to treat an employee with a disability differently,preferentially.and the fact that the difference in treatment violates an employer rule can not by itself place the accommodation beyond the act potential reach.
were that not so,the reasonable accommodation provision could not accomplish its intended objective neutral rules,for instance,would automatically prevent the accommodation of an individual who needs additional breaks from work,perhaps to permit medical visits.
us airways,barnett,d see also lederle parenterals,cir reversing district court holding that accommodating plaintiff by permitting her medical leave beyond that allowed under the company own policy is per se unreasonable,and requiring an individualized assessment of plaintiff need eeoc enforcement guidance,question if an employee with a disability needs additional unpaid leave as a reasonable accommodation,the employer must modify its leave policy to provide the employee with the additional leave,unless it can show that there is another effective accommodation that would enable the person to perform the essential functions of position,or granting additional leave would cause an undue hardship.modifying workplace policies,including leave policies,is a form of reasonable accommodation,question an employer must provide a modified or schedule when required as a reasonable accommodation,absent undue hardship,even if it does not provide such schedules for other employees.emphasis added.
in sum,the fact that holly were equally subjected to clairson punctuality policy is not relevant to the question whether clairson discriminated against holly by failing to reasonably accommodate his disability,and it was error for the district court to hold otherwise 
iii.conclusion 
because there plainly are genuine issues of material fact concerning whether holly is a qualified individual within the meaning of the ada,the entry of summary judgment for clairson on this issue was improper.moreover,it was error for the district court to grant summary judgment for clairson on the alternative ground that holly failed to provide evidence of disparate treatment.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
holly testified that his disability was the direct cause of approximately of the occasions on which he was late to work the remaining,he said,was due to weather or vehicle difficulti
