this is eugene gall third appearance in our court arising out of his murder conviction and sentence of death in kentucky state court.gall was the appellant in his two prior appearances,and his record in that role is.in,we reversed the district court denial of gall petition for a writ of habeas corpus,found that gall murder conviction was unconstitutional,and therefore ordered the district court to grant gall a conditional writ of habeas corpus.gall parker gall iii,cir the condition placed on the writ allowed the commonwealth either to release gall or to initiate involuntary civil commitment proceedings due to gall extreme and pervasive psychological issues.then,in,we affirmed the district court denial of gall request for an order compelling the commonwealth to proceed with involuntary commitment instead of releasing him into the custody of the state of ohio.gall scroggy gall iv,app x cir.
here,however,gall finds himself in the unusual position of defending the district court decision,as it is the commonwealth that brings this appeal.after unsuccessfully seeking an order from the kentucky state courts vacating the conviction and expunging it from his record,gall again turned to the district court for relief.he sought an order mandating that the commonwealth vacate the conviction.the district court agreed with gall,declared that the conviction was nullified,and directed the commonwealth to expunge the conviction from gall criminal record.gall scroggy,dist.lexis.the commonwealth now appeals,and we affirm.
in,gall was convicted in kentucky state court of raping and murdering a girl and was sentenced to death.in,though we acknowledged that there was little doubt that gall had committed the horrible crimes with which he had been charged,we conditionally granted gall petition for a writ of habeas corpus due to the commonwealth failure to prove an essential element of murder as it existed at the time in kentucky law.gall iii,at.recognizing that gall nevertheless posed a danger to society as a result of his uncontrollable psychological impulses and should never be allowed to rejoin free society,we condition ed the grant of gall habeas petition on the state granting him an involuntary hospitalization proceeding,just as he would have been provided if he had been found insane under.ann.requiring such a proceeding for defendants who are acquitted by reason of insanity.id.at 
the commonwealth sought en banc and supreme court review to no avail.the district court thus took the case back up on remand to order the conditional writ and to supervise the release or commitment process.it became apparent during a status conference that the commonwealth did not intend to initiate involuntary commitment proceedings and,instead,intended to release gall into the custody of ohio,where gall had been convicted of numerous crimes and sentenced to life in prison.state gall,ohio app d,ohio affirming conviction.gall understandably preferred to spend the rest of his life in a kentucky mental hospital instead of an ohio prison.thus,in,under the same caption and case number as his original habeas petition,he moved the district court to enforce our judgment,arguing that our conditional writ essentially amounted to a directive ordering the commonwealth to initiate involuntary commitment and that the commonwealth was powerless to opt to extradite him to ohio instead.
gall motion to enforce our judgment asked that the district court enter the attached final judgment,a draft order that gall tendered with his motion.the draft order purported to direct the commonwealth to proceed with involuntary commitment proceedings and included,among other things,language declaring that his conviction and death sentence are unconstitutional and are vacated.the district court did not adopt gall proposed judgment.instead,for reasons not apparent from the record,it entered its own judgment ordering gall release within ninety days,with an additional thirty days if the commonwealth elected to proceed with civil commitment.importantly for purposes of this appeal,the district court judgment did not include language vacating gall conviction or otherwise addressing its continued presence on his record.
when the commonwealth released gall into ohio custody,gall appealed the district court judgment.his sole argument on appeal was that the district court should have ordered the commonwealth to proceed with involuntary commitment he did not raise on appeal the district court failure to vacate the underlying conviction.our court affirmed the district court in.gall iv,app x.
after losing his fight to stay in kentucky,gall soon moved the kentucky state court to vacate the conviction.he filed an action in state court in seeking to have the conviction vacated under kentucky state procedure.the trial court denied the motion and,in june,the kentucky court of appeals affirmed.gall commonwealth.unpub.lexis.june.the kentucky supreme court denied review in march.
gall therefore returned to federal court seeking an order directing the commonwealth to vacate his conviction.again under the caption of his initial habeas claim,gall moved to enforce our ruling in gall iii declaring the conviction unconstitutional.gall essentially argued that an unconstitutional conviction is a legal nullity and therefore expungement of the conviction is required.he claims that vacation of his conviction is important because he is set to come before the parole board in ohio in and that,in assessing his suitability for parole,a prior murder conviction on his record would be relevant.the commonwealth opposed gall motion on the following theories that either the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion or that the matter is moot because the commonwealth has released gall in accordance with the writ venue was improper in federal court in kentucky because gall is currently incarcerated in ohio gall failed to show harm flowing from the collateral consequences of the conviction remaining on his record,so his pleadings do not allege injury gall either waived his right to or is procedurally barred from seeking to have the conviction vacated and that notions of federalism,comity,and justice cut against vacating gall conviction because neither the commonwealth nor its courts want to vacate the conviction and because vacating the conviction could aid in gall parole in ohio.magistrate judge gregory wehrman recommended that the court grant gall motion and,over the commonwealth objection,the district court adopted the magistrate recommendation in a opinion.the court therefore declared that the conviction was nullified and directed the commonwealth to expunge the conviction the commonwealth timely appealed.
though gall styles his motion as a motion to enforce our judgment in gall iii,he brought the motion under the caption of his federal habeas case,and the motion raises substantive questions of the implication of a writ of habeas corpus and the power of a federal court sitting in habeas.we generally review a district court disposition of a habeas petition de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.satterlee wolfenbarger,cir.questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.ruimveld birkett,cir.as this appeal principally concerns legal conclusions regarding the federal court power to order expungement of a state conviction and policy questions regarding whether the court should exercise that power,we review the district court decision de novo.
the commonwealth arguments on appeal are materially identical to those made before the district court.prior to addressing these arguments in turn,however,it is useful to review our leading case on the ability of a federal court sitting in habeas to nullify an unconstitutional state conviction.
that case is gentry deuth,cir.the issue in gentry was whether a federal court retains jurisdiction over a habeas case for purposes of declaring a state conviction deemed unconstitutional to be null and void if the defendant is no longer in state custody on the way to answering in the affirmative,we characterized the expungement of an unconstitutional conviction from one record as the essential relief contemplated by a conditional writ of habeas corpus.id.at t he court may order granting a conditional writ of habeas corpus ordering either release or retrial within ninety days implicitly expected that the commonwealth would vacate the prior judgment pursuant to seeking a new trial,and thus the commonwealth failure to seek a new trial effectively circumvented the district court purpose.see also id.at a successful habeas challenge to an unconstitutional conviction necessitates relief not only from any present incarceration arising from that conviction,but also from any collateral consequences thereof.therefore,gentry challenge to the collateral consequences of her conviction was implied by her original petition challenging her conviction as unconstitutional.thus,because a federal court always retains jurisdiction to enforce its lawful judgments,including habeas judgments,the court has the authority to see that its judgment is fully effectuated.this includes the ability to order the state to expunge a conviction.id.at.
in other words,a habeas petition challenging the constitutionality of a conviction as opposed to the constitutionality of a particular sentence challenges both the conviction itself and the resulting confinement and other collateral or incidental consequences stemming from the conviction.if the petition is well taken,then the necessary remedy is relief from both the direct and collateral consequences of the unconstitutional conviction.it follows that,because ongoing collateral consequences are assumed to flow from an unconstitutional conviction and because the full relief implied by the writ is the elimination of all direct and collateral consequences,nullification of the conviction and expungement of the conviction from one record are naturally and necessarily implicit in granting the writ.id.at as a practical,logical,and necessary matter,relief from the collateral consequences of an unconstitutionally obtained state criminal conviction effectively requires expungement of the conviction from the petitioner record,and expungement of the record implies nullification of the unconstitutional conviction.indeed,as a general proposition,we know of no authority or plausible rationale indicating that states ever have a substantive justification to keep an unconstitutional conviction on an individual record,and we find it telling that the commonwealth has not cited a single case of a state successfully maintaining an unconstitutional conviction on the record of a petitioner seeking its removal.the only question is whether the state takes care of the ministerial function of expungement of its own accord or whether it insists that the habeas petitioner affirmatively request expungement.
having thus reviewed gentry,we believe that the majority of the commonwealth arguments in this case are plainly foreclosed by this prior precedent.
a.the district court retained jurisdiction to consider and grant gall motion.
just as it did in gentry,the commonwealth argues that the district court no longer has habeas jurisdiction because gall has been released from the custody of the kentucky prison.and just as it was in gentry,the commonwealth is incorrect.
in support of its argument,the commonwealth cites gentry for the proposition that when a state meets the terms of the habeas court condition,thereby avoiding the writ actual issuance,the habeas court does not retain any further jurisdiction over the matter.appellant br.at citing gentry,at.the commonwealth proceeds to argue that it met the terms of gall conditional writ by releasing him to the state of ohio,so the habeas court lost jurisdiction at that time.in relying upon this statement,the commonwealth reveals a misreading of and a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of conditional writs of habeas corpus.
as we explained in gentry,the sole distinction between a conditional and an absolute grant of the writ of habeas corpus is that the former lies latent unless and until the state fails to perform the established condition,at which time the writ springs to life,and,thus,c onditional grants of writs of habeas corpus are final orders exactly like absolute grants,and they ordinarily and ideally operate automatically,that is,without the need for the district court to act further.at.an absolute writ immediately provides the petitioner the right to relief from all direct and collateral consequences of the unconstitutional conviction.a conditional writ places a hold on that right pending the state exercise of the option allowed by the conditional writ but,if the state does not exercise the option,the conditional writ converts into an absolute writ,complete with the right to relief from all direct and collateral consequences.id.the federal court retains jurisdiction to afford that relief until the unconstitutional judgment is gone.edelman mckee,cir.
in gentry,as in the case of most conditional writs,the option was for the state to retry the defendant.because it failed to exercise that option,the writ became absolute the same is generally true in this case,the only difference being the nature of the condition placed on the writ.the option provided the commonwealth by the conditional writ was to initiate involuntary commitment proceedings.when it failed to exercise that option,the writ became absolute.thus,as in gentry,the federal court retains jurisdiction to effectuate and enforce the judgment encompassed by the writ provided that all other requisites for federal jurisdiction,such as a live case or controversy,are also present.
venue was proper in the united states district court for the eastern district of kentucky.
the commonwealth next argues that,because gall is currently incarcerated in ohio and because the harm of the alleged collateral consequences would come to fruition in ohio,he must seek vacation of the kentucky conviction,if anywhere,in ohio.however,as the district court correctly reasoned,gall request for vacation of the conviction is necessarily tied to his original petition for a writ of habeas corpus.because venue was proper in the eastern district of kentucky for gall to bring his habeas petition originally,d,so too is venue proper in that district to seek enforcement of that court judgment on the petition.
gall adequately alleges injury.
the commonwealth further argues that gall has not pled with sufficient particularity that he is suffering any injury from the conviction remaining on his record.ongoing or future harm is a prerequisite for the existence of a case or controversy,a necessary requirement for the continued existence of federal habeas jurisdiction.gentry,at describing the evolution of the case or controversy requirement in habeas cases.because gall maintains that the conviction will affect his proceedings before the ohio parole board,and because that hearing will not occur until at least the year,the commonwealth claims that he is not currently suffering any injury in fact.in this regard,the commonwealth does not seem to dispute that the conviction will be relevant to the decision of the ohio parole board and,instead,seems to argue simply that the alleged injury is too far in the future to give rise to the injury necessary to establish a case or controversy.this argument misunderstands the nature of the collateral consequences flowing from an unconstitutional felony conviction and elevates form over function.
first,we summarily found in gall iv that gall continued to suffer from collateral consequences in even though he had already been transferred to ohio.gall iv,app x at.though we did not state explicitly what those collateral consequences were,we nevertheless found that they were present.additionally,our decision in gall iv necessarily did not alleviate those collateral consequences because we denied gall any relief.as nothing has changed since our opinion,it would seem to follow that the collateral consequences still exist.
even if we had not already decided the collateral consequences issue in gall iv,we held in gentry that collateral consequences are essentially presumed simply by virtue of the unconstitutional conviction continued existence.gentry.thus,once a habeas petitioner provides the minimal showing of the existence of collateral consequences that we found to be required in gentry,it becomes the state burden to show conclusively that collateral consequences do not exist in a case of an unconstitutional conviction remaining on one record.this makes perfect sense when viewed in felony conviction is a scarlet letter placed upon an individual by the state that carries with it consequences that we have described as legion and patently obvious.id.at.though it seems settled that the mere presence of the conviction is not,in and of itself,sufficient injury to give rise to a case or controversy,it is equally settled by gentry that a petitioner need not show much more than the possibility of tangible collateral consequences for the burden to shift to the state to show that the consequences are not in fact possible.see also spencer kenna,d in recent decades,we have been willing to presume that a wrongful criminal conviction has continuing collateral consequences or,what is effectively the same,to count collateral consequences that are remote and unlikely to occur.
in this case,the commonwealth has not proven to our satisfaction that the conviction will have no possible effect on the ohio parole board consideration indeed,in its brief on appeal,the commonwealth admits that,although it doubts that the conviction will impact the parole hearing due to the presence of other felony convictions,it is impossible to know how this prior conviction will be handled until gall comes up for parole.appellant br.at.furthermore,despite its expressed doubt as to the presence of collateral consequences,we note that the commonwealth has mounted a vigorous defense over an issue that it would have us believe is meaningless.we are satisfied of the continued existence of collateral consequences sufficient to give rise to a case or controversy.
we also disagree with the notion implied in the commonwealth argument that gall should simply wait until the day of his parole hearing gets closer to bring this challenge.as stated above,the commonwealth has not shown that the conviction will be completely irrelevant to his parole hearing.we can find no compelling reason to delay addressing what will be an issue at some point,and we find it particularly ironic that the commonwealth argues here that gall should wait when,as we will see,the commonwealth argues later that gall has waited too long.
gall has not waived or procedurally defaulted on his right to request nullification and expungement of the conviction.
the commonwealth contends that gall waived or defaulted on his right to seek relief from the federal courts regarding expungement of the conviction.the basis for this argument is that gall briefly raised the issue in the district court in connection with his motion to enforce in gall iv and did not press the issue on appeal.this is easily the commonwealth strongest argument in this case as it is the only aspect of this case that is materially distinguishable from gentry.indeed,as we have already mentioned,we can imagine no reasonable substantive argument in support of a state maintaining an unconstitutional conviction on an individual record,so the only way for a state to obtain this result legally is to rely upon an individual litigant procedural.in this case,however,we do not find gall actions to be procedurally faulty,and certainly not sufficiently so as to justify the anomalous result of an unconstitutional conviction remaining on gall record.
we begin with the observation made above,and that we made in gentry,that a conviction declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction becomes a legal nullity at the moment that the judgment becomes final.see gentry,at a state acts ultra vires when it obtains a criminal conviction in violation of the united states constitution,and ultra vires acts bear no legitimate force in a government under the law.a public act without legitimate force is indistinct under the law from an act that never was,or an act that has been voided.and,as we stated above,the expungement of a conviction is a necessary consequence of that conviction having been declared unconstitutional,so the only remaining matter is the purely administrative step of erasing the conviction from the records.although the federal courts certainly have the authority to order a state to take this ministerial step,we do not see it as being the federal courts responsibility to do so.ideally,the state would expunge the conviction of its own accord,but we recognize that bureaucracy often and innocently gets in the way of the ideal and efficient operation of government.we therefore assume that the state courts would,upon request,follow up and order the removal of an unconstitutional conviction as a matter of course and without protestation.furthermore,we do not believe our thinking on this point to be novel or unreasonable.if a state conviction is declared unconstitutional,the state,either by itself or by order of its courts,should expunge the conviction,and the federal courts should not be called upon to exercise the paternalistic function of directing the state to do that which it necessarily must do.
with these general principles in mind,we turn to gall case.as we just said,it would not have been unreasonable for gall to assume that the best place to seek to have his state conviction expunged was the court of the state where he had been convicted.and,indeed,gall did just that when,in,he asked the kentucky state court to vacate his conviction under state procedural rules.for their own reasons,the commonwealth courts declined to provide gall the relief to which he is entitled,but we nevertheless do not fault gall for directing his request to the state courts.
this leaves only the question whether gall failure to argue the issue of expungement on appeal in gall iv precludes him from asking the federal courts to order expungement now.viewing the pleadings at issue in gall iv,it is clear that the primary issue was whether the commonwealth had the authority to decline our invitation to initiate civil commitment proceedings and to opt instead to release gall into the custody of ohio.the vacation of gall conviction is not mentioned at all in the body of his motion to enforce our judgment.instead,vacation of the conviction is only raised by language in gall proposed final judgment that he tendered along with his moving papers proclaiming that his conviction was unconstitutional and vacated.
we find it highly material that expungement of the conviction was not the subject of gall motion in and,instead,was only fleetingly mentioned in a proposed final judgment.had expungement of the conviction been the actual subject of the motion,then gall failure to press the point on appeal might preclude him from raising the issue in the future.but the issue was only raised in a proposed order,which parties submit almost as an afterthought and which courts often disregard without ever even looking at them.stated differently,that the district court declined to enter the proposed final judgment submitted by gall does not necessarily imply that the court substantively considered whether to order expungement of the conviction and decided against it it could just as easily mean that the court never looked at the proposed order because it prefers to prepare its own orders or because it was denying the relief that was the focus of the proceedings.thus,vacation of the conviction appearing in the proposed order indicates,at most,a belief on gall part that the federal court had the power to nullify the conviction,a belief we later confirmed in gentry.but,as we stated above,neither before nor after gentry is it unreasonable for a litigant to believe that the best and most direct way to have an unconstitutional state conviction expunged from one record is to ask the state to do so 
in sum,because expungement of the conviction was not truly at issue in gall iv,because we find no indication that the district court substantively considered and rejected the suggestion in the proposed order to direct expungement of the conviction,and becau
