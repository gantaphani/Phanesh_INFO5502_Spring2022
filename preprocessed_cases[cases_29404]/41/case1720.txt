after elizabeth rask was dismissed from her job,she sued her former employer,fresenius medical care north america,under the americans with disabilities act ada,see,the minnesota human rights act mhra,see,and the family and medical leave act fmla,see.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fresenius,rask fresenius med.care north america,wl,and rask appealed.we affirm.
rask worked as a patient care technician at two of fresenius kidney dialysis clinics in minnesota.following a series of disciplinary and attendance problems,fresenius terminated her employment when she failed to come to work on may.rask had a long history of depression,and she filed an action claiming that her depression was a disability and that termination of her employment constituted discrimination under the ada and the mhra.she also claimed that some of the days when she did not come to work were covered medical leave under the fmla.
the ada prohibits employers from discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability,a,whom it defines as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.to make out a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must establish that she is disabled within its meaning,that she is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation,and that she suffered an adverse employment action in circumstances that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination based on disability.dropinski douglas county,cir.apart from one difference,which is not relevant here,an mhra claim proceeds the same way as does a claim under the ada.kammueller loomis,fargo,cir.
although the parties hotly contested the question of whether rask depression is a disability,we conclude that we need not resolve that matter because rask failed to show that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job.we have consistently held that regular and reliable attendance is a necessary element of most jobs,and we see no reason to hold otherwise in the circumstances of this case.see pickens soo line,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted,cert.denied,d.while there is evidence in the record that fresenius had sufficient manpower to staff its operations without rask,rask made no showing that fresenius would be able to do so on short notice at times when fresenius expected her to be at work.we note that rask did not have the type of job that could be performed from another site or put off until another time she cared for seriously ill patients in need of dialysis.jackson veterans,cir.after having a history of unpredictable absences,rask admitted that she was unable to come to work on a regular and reliable basis when she told her supervisors,i having problems with my medication and i might miss a day here and there because of it.as discussed below,the specific circumstances of her employment demonstrate that this statement referred to rask taking unexcused absences on short notice.rask therefore has failed to show that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job without an accommodation.
rask would nonetheless be qualified under the ada if a reasonable accommodation would allow her to perform the essential functions of her position.we hold,however,that fresenius had no duty to accommodate rask because she failed as a matter of law to provide sufficient notice of her need.the standard is clear where,as here,the disability,resulting limitations,and necessary reasonable accommodations,are not open,obvious,and apparent to the employer,as is often the case when mental disabilities are involved,the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations,and to suggest the reasonable accommodations.wallin minnesota dep t of corrections,cir emphasis in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted,cert.denied,d.
a major point of dispute between the parties was whether rask provided fresenius notice of the fact that she was depressed at all.assuming that she did tell her employer that she was diagnosed with depression,her claim still fails under the criteria laid out in wallin.the closest that rask came to satisfying the wallin requirements was in a meeting with two of her supervisors she attested that she let them know that i having problems with my medication and,you know,would you stand by me,i might miss a day here and there because of it.even if having problems with medication were a specific identification of a disability,which we doubt,and even if i might miss a day here and there were a suggestion of what a reasonable accommodation might be,no reasonable person could find that rask specifically identif ied her resulting limitations,id.
the point of requiring an employee to provide this kind of information is to allow the employer to understand that the employee suffers from a disability.without this information the employer is unable to engage in the interactive process required to determine what accommodations might be appropriate and available.see pt,app.at.because rask did not inform fresenius of the specific limitations that her depression gave rise to,fresenius had no duty to find an accommodation for her.
we believe,moreover,that even if what rask told her employer put it on notice that she was disabled,she did not,in fact,suggest accommodations that were reasonable,wallin,at.allowing her to be absent can not as a matter of law be a reasonable accommodation given the circumstances of rask employment.it is undisputed that rask was allowed to modify the number of hours that she worked at will.there is also no dispute that at the time of the meeting with her supervisors mentioned above she was working only two days a week.she therefore already had a lot of time away from work and could take more if she needed it.talk of having to miss days in this context can refer only to sudden unanticipated absences on the few days when rask was actually scheduled to work.the duty to accommodate does not extend to the provision of adjustments or modifications that are primarily for the personal benefit of the individual with a disability.thus,if an adjustment or modification is,specifically assists the individual in performing the duties of a particular job,it will be considered a type of reasonable accommodation.on the other hand,if an adjustment or modification assists the individual throughout his or her daily activities,on and off the job,it will be considered a personal item that the employer is not required to provide.pt,app.at.the ability to take sudden,unscheduled absences would not have assisted rask in performing the duties of her particular job they would have been for her personal benefit.rask therefore failed to suggest a reasonable accommodation.
rask was required to show that she could perform the essential functions of her job either with or without a reasonable accommodation.after having had a history of unexpected absences,she admitted that she could not come to work on a regular and reliable basis,which was essential for her position.rask also did not give proper notice to fresenius that she needed an accommodation nor did she show that being permitted to miss work on short notice was a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to perform her job.thus rask failed to offer sufficient evidence to support a finding that she was a qualified individual,a,and the district court properly granted summary judgment to fresenius on her ada and mhra claims.
we turn now to rask fmla claims.under the act,an eligible employee is entitled to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave during a period b ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.d.the fmla prohibits employers from discriminating against employees for using their fmla leave.see stallings hussmann,cir.rask claims that fresenius violated the fmla by terminating her employment based on absences for which she shou
