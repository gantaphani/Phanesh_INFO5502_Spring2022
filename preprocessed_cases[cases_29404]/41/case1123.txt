background 
plaintiff has long been an active member of the movement who,specifically,engages in sidewalk counseling and peaceful protest outside abortion clinics in and around cincinnati,ohio at plaintiff alleges that he has never threatened or committed any act of violence while counseling or protesting.id.at plaintiff admits,however,that on several occasions,he crossed the property line of the abortion clinics to communicate with clinic patients and hand them literature.accordingly,plaintiff has been charged with and convicted of criminal trespass in the past.yet,plaintiff claims that he has always treated judges and prosecutors with respect,served his sentence s with dignity,and complied with any related court orders.id.plaintiff characterizes himself as a regular presence at cincinnati women services cws,an abortion clinic in cincinnati.plaintiff admits that,on the basis of his experience at cws and with its president,debi jackson jackson,his regular presence is an unwelcome presence.id.
plaintiff suit arose from two separate encounters with the city of cincinnati police.the first occurred october,on the public sidewalk outside cws,where plaintiff protested and counseled clinic patients.on that day,plaintiff hung a sign on the neighboring property fence.the sign said,god has a plan for your baby,and listed a telephone number.at a clinic patient complained about plaintiff sign and,apparently in response to the patient complaint,jackson removed plaintiff sign from the fence and walked toward the cws clinic with the intention of destroying it.id.plaintiff demanded that jackson return his sign,to no avail.at that point,plaintiff walked onto cws property and took back his sign from jackson,thereafter promptly return ing to the public sidewalk.id.jackson subsequently contacted the city of cincinnati police.
defendant charles hains hains,an officer of the cincinnati police department,responded to the scene and placed plaintiff under arrest.defendant hains did not have a warrant for plaintiff arrest and did not observe the incident at issue.additionally,defendant hains refused to listen to a witness account of the incident,admonishing her to tell it to the judge.at ultimately,defendant hains arrested plaintiff for criminal trespass and disorderly conduct.plaintiff remained in custody for approximately four hours,after which time he was released on bond.pursuant to these charges,plaintiff appeared in hamilton county municipal court on several occasions along with counsel.the court conducted a bench trial on may,finding plaintiff guilty of criminal trespass,but acquitting him of disorderly conduct.on appeal heard april,the hamilton county court of appeals reversed plaintiff conviction for criminal trespass upon a finding that plaintiff was privileged to enter cws property to retrieve his sign.over the course of these proceedings,plaintiff incurred attorney fees in excess of,and avers that he suffered various other harms and indignities plaintiff avers that defendant hains acted in malicious reckless disregard of plaintiff clearly established statutory and constitutional rights.at 
the second encounter took place on june.that day,plaintiff again counseled clinic patients and protested on the public sidewalk near cws.in order to communicate with a clinic patient arriving in the cws parking lot that day,plaintiff walked into an adjacent public park and spoke to the patient through a chain link fence.plaintiff describes the conversation as not hostile and says it lasted for several minutes before the clinic patient entered the clinic.at following that encounter,an employee at cws called the cincinnati police to complain of trespass by plaintiff.defendant daniel mcshane mcshane,an officer of the cincinnati police department,responded and placed plaintiff under arrest for criminal trespass.plaintiff states that mcshane had no warrant for plaintiff arrest and refused to listen to a witness account of the incident.additionally,mcshane was apparently not present at the scene during plaintiff encounter with the clinic patient.defendant mcshane filed criminal trespass charges against plaintiff,and plaintiff was held at the hamilton county justice center for four hours that day.on this trespass charge,plaintiff also appeared several times before the hamilton county municipal court along with counsel before the court ultimately dismissed the charge on november.plaintiff states that he incurred over in attorney fees in relation to this charge.plaintiff alleges that defendant mcshane performed maliciously in reckless disregard of plaintiff clearly established statutory and constitutional rights.at 
on december,defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint for failure to state a claim.therein,defendants set forth five bases for granting their motion to dismiss that plaintiff failed to plead a federal constitutional claim that qualified immunity would shield defendants from suit that issue preclusion applied that there existed an insufficient justification for pendent jurisdiction and that plaintiff failed to adequately plead state tort claims.plaintiff responded with a motion to convert defendants motion to dismiss into a proceeding for summary judgment and for discovery,as well as a response in opposition to defendants motion to dismiss.
ultimately,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.in its order dismissing plaintiff case,the district court reasoned as follows 
plaintiff fourth amendment claims clearly relate to his arrests,and his first amendment claims are grounded in the theory that his arrests impeded his freedom of expression and of assembly.should the arrests be supported by probable cause,then none of plaintiff constitutional claims survive.having reviewed this matter,the court finds the arresting officers,in relying on testimony of a reliable witness and finding plaintiff at the scene of the alleged trespass,reasonably believed that plaintiff committed trespass.accordingly the officers had probable cause.
logsdon,wl,at.additionally,the district court found that even if it erred in finding no constitutional violations,defendants were each protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity.id.at.specifically,the district court opined that defendant hains was clearly reasonable in arresting plaintiff,and that defendant mcshane at worst reasonably misapprehended the law governing the circumstances he discovered.id.plaintiff timely appealed the district court order.

qualified immunity and plaintiff fourth amendment claims 
plaintiff contends that the district court erred in dismissing his suit inasmuch as his complaint states a claim for violations of his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.the district court granted defendants rule b motion to dismiss,finding that defendants each had probable cause to arrest plaintiff and,at any rate,were protected by qualified immunity.having scrutinized with special care the district court order dismissing plaintiff claims,we hold that the district court erred in granting defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff fourth amendment claims.
qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.as a threshold matter,we first consider whether the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.if,upon review,we determine that the officer in question violated the claimant constitutional rights,we proceed to a second question whether at the time of the alleged violation that right was clearly established.id.accepting plaintiff factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,we find that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiff fourth amendment claims against defendants hains and mcshane.we approach the question within the framework of qualified immunity analysis,and first conclude that,on the facts alleged,defendants hains and mcshane each violated the fourth amendment in arresting plaintiff absent a warrant inasmuch as they lacked probable cause.see saucier,at.
the fourth amendment protects the right of individuals to be free from improper arrest and detention.const.amend.iv the right of people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable seizures shall not be violated.a warrantless arrest by a law officer is reasonable under the fourth amendment where there is probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed,devenpeck alford,d,and the validity of the arrest does not depend on whether the suspect actually committed a crime.michigan defillippo,d.accordingly,i n order for a wrongful arrest claim to succeed under,a plaintiff must prove that the police lacked probable cause.fridley horrighs,cir citing painter robertson,cir.
probable cause exists if the facts and circumstances known to the officer warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed.henry united states,d see also beck ohio,d illinois gates,d.the inquiry depends upon the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest,devenpeck,at,where supported by reasonably trustworthy information.beck,at.no duty to investigate applies to officers faced with the prospect of a warrantless arrest.in initially formulating probable cause,they need not investigate independently every claim of innocence.gardenhire schubert,cir.and after the officer determines,on the basis of the facts and circumstances known to him,that probable cause exists,the officer has no further duty to investigate or to search for exculpatory evidence.ahlers schebil,cir criss city of kent,cir.however,the initial probable cause determination must be founded on both the inculpatory and exculpatory evidence known to the arresting officer,gardenhire,at emphasis in original estate of dietrich burrows,cir,and the officer can not simply turn a blind eye toward potentially exculpatory evidence.ahlers,at see also id.at noting that officers may not make hasty,unsubstantiated arrests with impunity fridley,at the officer may not ignore information which becomes available in the course of routine investigations.in general,the existence of probable cause in a action presents a jury question,unless there is only one reasonable determination possible.fridley,at quotation marks omitted.
whether an officer is authorized to make an arrest ordinarily depends,in the first instance on state law.defillippo,at.defendants each arrested plaintiff for criminal trespass in ohio,an individual commits criminal trespass by k nowingly enter ing or remain ing on the land or premises of another absent privilege to do so.ohio a.the ohio code defines privilege as an immunity,license,or right conferred by law,bestowed by express or implied grant,arising out of status,position,office,or relationship,or growing out of necessity.id.at a.ohio courts construe the requirement as an element of the offense of criminal trespass,and not an affirmative defense.state newell,ohio app d,in a criminal trespass charge,the state is required to prove lack of privilege.state keegan,ohio app d,classifying absence of privilege as an essential element of trespass.accordingly,defendants had probable cause to arrest plaintiff if,on the basis of the facts known to them,they could reasonably conclude that plaintiff knowingly entered cws property without privilege.
at the time defendant hains arrested plaintiff,hains knew only that jackson called the cincinnati police to complain that plaintiff had entered the cws property upon arriving at the scene,defendant hains refused to listen to an eyewitness account of the incident,directing the witness to tell it to the judge.although plaintiff admits that he knowingly entered the premises of cws to retrieve his sign on october,on the facts alleged in plaintiff complaint,defendant hains did not observe this conduct,nor did plaintiff admit such conduct to defendant hains at the scene.similarly,the facts and circumstances known to defendant mcshane,as alleged in plaintiff complaint,were that someone at cws called the city of cincinnati police division alleging that plaintiff had trespassed.at like hains,mcshane did not witness the alleged trespass.also like hains,defendant mcshane declined to hear a sidewalk counselor attempted explanation of the incident.id.at 
reading plaintiff complaint in the light most favorable to him,defendants failed to reasonably determine whether they had probable cause.in the course of initially assessing whether probable cause to arrest plaintiff existed,defendants respectively turn ed a blind eye to potentially exculpatory evidence when they refused to listen to the witnesses at the scene.a prudent officer must draw reasonable conclusions from the facts and circumstances known to him as supported by reasonably trustworthy information.see beck,at.it appears that defendants deliberately excluded from a totality of known facts and circumstances information that might bear on the accuracy,reliability,or trustworthiness of the report that plaintiff had trespassed on cws property.to that extent,defendants did not act as prudent officer s and their conclusions can not be deemed reasonable.rather,potentially conflicting explanations from these eyewitnesses would have informed defendants probable cause analyses,giving them reason to question the reliability of reports that plaintiff had committed criminal trespass ahlers,at.although our circuit precedent does not mandate that law enforcement operatives should conduct as a necessary predicate to the warrantless arrest of suspects,painter,at,it does require that warrantless arrest follow consideration of the totality of the circumstances reasonably known to the arresting officers.because officers initially assessing probable cause to arrest may not disregard potentially exculpatory information made readily available by witnesses on the scene,there is a set of facts consistent with the pleadings in which defendants violated plaintiff fourth amendment rights.see gardenhire,at ahlers,at painter,at.
at oral argument,defendants argued that officers need not entertain any exculpatory evidence to the contrary when they receive a call from a reliable source reporting purportedly criminal activity.defendants argument is undermined as a result of defendants failure to offer a persuasive explanation of what constitutes a reliable source.for purposes of this discussion,we shall limit our definition of reliable source to someone with respect to whom there is no apparent reason to question the person reliability.probable cause assessments depend on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer.here,the totality should have encompassed readily available eyewitness accounts,but did not because d
