thomas blakley seeks review of a district court judgment affirming the decision of an administrative law judge alj,who denied blakley request for social security disability benefits.blakley argues that the alj improperly rejected the opinions of his treating physicians and failed to provide reasons on the record for according them less than controlling weight.because the alj failed to give good reasons for discounting the opinions of blakley treating physicians,in violation of d,we reverse the judgment of the district court affirming the alj decision and remand with instructions to return the claim to the commissioner of social security commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
born in,thomas blakley was years old at the time of the alj decision.blakley has a education and worked in underground coal mines from until february,when he was injured while attempting to hang a pump line,which fell and hit him across his shoulder and neck.
blakley was immediately seen at the emergency room following his accident.thereafter,on february,blakley physician started him on a course of physical therapy.on march,blakley had two mri scans,which showed degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine and a left tear.one of the mri scans revealed changes between and,a large disc osteophyte complex at with some flattening of the spinal cord,and large central disc osteophyte complex at with some flattening of the spinal cord.
blakley began treatment with steven kiefer,a neurosurgeon,in april.based on blakley ongoing complaints of pain,kiefer ordered a cervical myelogram and a corresponding cervical ct scan.the cervical myelogram revealed osteophytes and disc protrusions on the cervical spine.the ct scan confirmed this finding and also established that blakley had narrowing of the neuroforamen at,large hypertrophic boney spurs,and a mild disc bulge.it further revealed boney spurs at.
based on these findings,kiefer performed an anterior cervical discectomy of the vertebra on july.though the tests had also revealed problems with the vertebra,that area of blakley spine was not treated with surgery.kiefer followed up with blakley on august,noting that blakley was coming along,had normal pain from surgery,had relief of radicular symptoms in his arms,but continued to have some trouble with his hands.
kiefer also reviewed a may electrodiagnostic study and diagnosed blakley with carpal tunnel syndrome.kiefer prescribed wrist splints to help with blakley numbness and pain,and further noted that blakley may need carpal tunnel surgery in the future.
at the next two visits with kiefer,blakley complained of continued pain in his right arm with bothersome intrascapular pain.he also complained of persistent numbness in the right thumb and index finger,and numbness in the right distal arm without pain.
on february,blakley was seen again by kiefer.this time,kiefer noted that blakley complaints of aches and pains related to the neck were in excess of what i would expect at this point.kiefer ordered an mri of blakley thoracic spine,which showed degenerative disc disease at,and with disc protrusions.at both and,the mri showed disc material protrusion with an annular tear.on april,blakley again reported to kiefer that he continued to have intrascapular pain and left shoulder pain.blakley also complained of upper thoracic pain with intermittent radiation into his anterior chest.
contemporaneous with kiefer treatment,blakley began treatment with ben kibler,an orthopedic surgeon,on may,for problems related to his shoulder.during blakley initial visit,kibler reviewed blakley mri,which showed that blakley had a left tear and bruising of the bone.on october,kibler performed surgery to repair blakley tear.blakley shoulder improved after surgery.by january,kibler opined that blakley would be out of work for another six weeks,after which we can turn him loose.however,on january,blakley filed an application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits.
on february,blakley reported to kibler that his condition had worsened.he complained of soreness and tenderness and a feeling that something was catching in his shoulder.in his office notes,kibler expressed,i am not real sure why he has regressed.
on march,blakley reported an improvement in his shoulder,but complained to kibler of some acromioclavicular ac joint soreness and tenderness.on may,blakley underwent an ac joint repair.on june,blakley reported some soreness,but overall had better strength and range of motion after the ac joint surgery.
at the request of the social security administration agency,blakley was evaluated by mark burns in june,shortly after blakley may ac joint repair.in his evaluation,burns noted that blakley had the ability to handle objects and had normal gross manipulation and grip strength.burns examination also revealed no clubbing cyanosis or edema and no deformities,redness or tenderness of blakley extremities.burns also noted that blakley states he is now wearing wrist splints bilaterally with fair relief.
burns determined that blakley has ability to perform activities involving sitting,standing,moving about,lifting,carrying,handling objects,hearing,seeing,speaking,and traveling and that his physical and orthopedic examination were within normal limits with the exception of decreased flexion and abduction involving the left shoulder.burns opined that blakley will obtain full range of motion after continued intense physical therapy.
two consulting state agency physicians performed a records review of blakley evidence and claims on june,and september,respectively.they determined that blakley could lift pounds occasionally,pounds frequently,and sit,stand,or walk for six hours of an workday.the state agency physicians also found that blakley could climb ladders,ropes,and scaffolds occasionally,but he would be limited in his ability to reach in all directions.the physicians also adopted the june opinion of mark burns,who determined that blakley has ability to perform activities involving sitting,standing,moving about,lifting,carrying,handling objects,hearing,seeing,speaking,and traveling and that his physical and orthopedic examination were within normal limits with the exception of decreased flexion and abduction involving the left shoulder.
on august,after another follow up with blakley,kibler noted that blakley continued to make progress and his range of motion continued to improve.however,blakley continued to complain of back pain,which kibler thought may require some stabilization program.an october,radiography comparison showed that blakley had some changes of the ac joint with sclerosis on the surface of the left humeral head with possible necrosis or ostosis.on october,kibler opined that most of blakley pain was related to his neck and back.
on december,kibler restricted blakley to no more than pounds lifting to his waist and no overhead lifting on a repetitive basis.in the report,kibler explained that blakley continued to have generalized problems,some of which are related to his shoulder,a lot are related to his neck and back,all of which necessitated the restriction.
kibler office notes from february,revealed that blakley continued to have some problems from his neck,back,and knees.kibler also noted that blakley showed excellent strength in external rotation with arm down at the side and that h is do not show any abnormality of the ac joint or of the glenohumeral joint.kibler concluded that he may very well have some problems with the rotator cuff and ac joint but these are relatively minimal and are not giving him his functional disability.
in may,at the request of blakley counsel,david muffly performed an orthopedic consultative examination.in his report,muffly reviewed blakley october functional capacity examination and adopted the recommendations of no overhead lifting and no more than pounds from floor to waist level.muffly noted that blakley had normal arm strength but exhibited signs of carpal tunnel syndrome.muffly assessed a impairment to the whole body based on blakley cervical spine impairment,for the shoulder impairment,and for the combined impairment.he also calculated a impairment for each hand for carpal tunnel syndrome.in muffly opinion,blakley carpal tunnel syndrome combined with his other impairments left him totally disabled.
on june,muffly completed another medical assessment.that assessment incorporated the limitation,and further restricted blakley from sitting,standing,or walking for more than three hours in an eight hour workday,no more than occasional stooping,crouching,kneeling,or crawling,never climbing or balancing,and restrictions on reaching,handling,feeling,pushing,pulling,moving machinery,and heights.
blakley was also seen for mental impairments.syed raza,a psychiatrist,first saw blakley on april,for a consultative evaluation at the agency behest.raza observed that blakley was well groomed,had normal posture and gait,was oriented,and had fair memory.raza also noted blakley had sleep difficulty,irritability,anhedonia,and feelings of helplessness.raza diagnosed a mood disorder resulting from blakley general medical condition and stated that the prognosis was guarded due to blakley poor understanding of the need for professional help.raza also found that blakley would benefit from psychotropic medications,that blakley had the ability to understand instructions,that blakley had good concentration,but that he was unable to complete tasks in a normal time due to neck,shoulder,and hand pain.raza also opined that blakley had poor coping skills and responded abnormally to pressure.
raza subsequently began treating blakley at the cumberland comprehensive care facility beginning in november.in his november and january reports,raza noted that blakley exhibited mood disorders brought on by his medical conditions and that he isolated himself.blakley continued regular treatment with raza through july.
at the request of blakley counsel,barbara belew,a psychologist,provided a consultative examination of blakley on may.she reported that blakley visual memory was impaired,he had evidence of emotional distress affecting several aspects of his life,he appeared distressed,and he had a tendency to withdraw.belew found that blakley had developed symptoms of anxiety and depression,despite the fact that he was taking medication and participating in monthly therapy sessions.ultimately,belew opined that,given blakley combination of features,there was adequate evidence to determine he is disabled.
procedural history 
the commissioner denied blakley claim for benefits initially on july,and upon reconsideration on september.blakley subsequently requested a hearing before an alj.
that hearing was held on august.both blakley and an impartial vocational expert testified.blakley testified to experiencing pain in his left shoulder,neck,and arms.blakley also reported numbness in his hands,making it difficult to pick things up.during his testimony,blakley explained that he is only able to raise his left arm half way before it catches.he also testified to feeling nervous and depressed since his accident,for which he was taking prescription medications.blakley further explained that his surgeon had inserted a titanium plate and screws into his neck,which causes blakley to suffer bad headaches.blakley claimed that,as a result,his neck becomes so tired during the day that he has trouble holding his head up.as a result,blakley reported having to lie down three or four times daily for or minutes to rest his neck.
the vocational expert testified that blakley prior jobs in the coal mines were medium and skilled.the alj posed five hypothetical questions to the expert.the alj first hypothetical,upon which the alj ultimately relied,restricted blakley to a medium level of exertion,no more than occasional climbing and reaching overhead,and a seriously limited but not precluded ability to deal with work stresses.the expert responded that blakley could not return to work as a roof bolter in the coal mines but could perform other medium level jobs,including cleaner,cashier,stock clerk,and hand packer.the expert also opined that blakley could perform light jobs.
on december,the alj issued her decision,holding that blakley was not disabled under sections i and d of the social security act,i and d.the alj made blakley disability determination following the governing analysis outlined in.at step one,the alj found that blakley had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since his disability onset date.at step two,the alj determined that blakley suffered from a severe combination of impairments consisting of osteoarithritis,mood and anxiety disorders,stage ii black lung,and residuals of cervical disc with allografting and plating,anterior cervical discectomy with allografting and plating,and ac joint repair.third,the alj concluded that blakley impairments did not meet or medically equal any of the impairments listed in part,subpart b,appendix.fourth,the alj adopted the state agency physicians opinions and rfc determinations,finding that blakley retained the residual functional capacity to perform a range of medium work,and that blakley could lift pounds occasionally,pounds frequently,and sit,stand,or walk about hours of an hour workday.the alj determined that blakley could also occasionally climb ropes,ladders,and scaffolds but could do no more than occasional reaching in all directions.blakely had,however,a limited ability to deal with work stresses.at the fifth step,the alj concluded that,given blakley rfc,there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that blakley could perform.accordingly,the alj concluded that blakley was not disabled.
the appeals council denied blakley request for review of the alj decision,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner of social security.see wilson comm r of soc,cir.blakley subsequently filed a complaint in the district court for review of the commissioner decision pursuant to g.
on august,upon for summary judgment,the district court issued a memorandum opinion affirming the alj decision,and entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the commissioner.blakley then filed this timely appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in social security cases,the commissioner determines whether a claimant is disabled within the meaning of the social security act and,thereby,entitled to benefits.h.our review of the alj decision is limited to whether the alj applied the correct legal standards and whether the findings of the alj are supported by substantial evidence.key callahan,cir.the standard is met if a reasonable mind might accept the relevant evidence as adequate to support a conclusion.warner comm r of soc,cir.the standard presupposes that there is a zone of choice within which the decisionmakers can go either way,without interference by the courts.mullen bowen,cir.therefore,if substantial evidence supports the alj decision,this court defers to that finding even if there is substantial evidence in the record that would have supported an opposite conclusion.callahan,at.we give de novo review to the district court conclusions on each issue.valley comm r of soc,cir.
b.the treating physician rule and the requirement 
in assessing the medical evidence supporting a claim for disability benefits,the alj must adhere to certain standards.one such standard,known as the treating physician rule,requires the alj to generally give greater deference to the opinions of treating physicians than to the opinions of physicians because 
these sources are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed,longitudinal picture of the claimant medical impairment s and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that can not be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations,such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations.
wilson,at quoting d.
the alj must give a treating source opinion controlling weight if the treating source opinion is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the case record.wilson,at quoting d.on the other hand,a social security explains th
