after learning that the settlement of a medical malpractice claim against him had been reported to state and national professional authorities,herand abcarian filed this suit against the university of illinois and a number of its employees alleging numerous violations of his constitutional rights.the district court dismissed the amended complaint in its entirety and entered a judgment dismissing the case.abcarian then moved the district court to reconsider its ruling and allow him to amend his complaint again,but the district court denied that motion.
we affirm in all respects.abcarian own complaint shows that the defendants merely complied with legal requirements for filing notices of medical malpractice settlements with federal and state authorities.by filing those notices,the defendants did not violate abcarian free speech rights or his rights to equal protection of the law and due process of law.
plaintiff allegations 
because the district court granted the defendants rule b motion to dismiss,we take the complaint factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in abcarian favor from those allegations.london rbs citizens,cir.where those allegations are contradicted by written exhibits that abcarian attached to his amended complaint,however,the exhibits trump the allegations.see northern indiana gun outdoor shows,city of south bend,cir.we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.united states lewis,cir,citing olson wexford clearing servs,cir.
at all relevant times,abcarian was head of the department of surgery at the university of illinois college of medicine at chicago and service chief of the department of surgery of the university of illinois medical center at chicago.during his tenure,abcarian and the individual were all university over a number of issues including risk management,faculty recruitment,compensation and fringe benefits,other issues that abcarian vaguely refers to as managerial obstruction of numerous needed changes,and medical malpractice insurance premiums.
in,abcarian was notified that a lawsuit was being contemplated against him based on the death of john behzad,a former patient.when the defendants learned of this potential lawsuit,says the complaint,they conspired together to use that suit to discredit abcarian reputation.as part of this alleged conspiracy,the university executed a settlement agreement with john behzad son david behzad.the agreement released the university and its employees and agents implicitly but undoubtedly including abcarian from any and all claims arising out of john behzad death in exchange for a payment of 
abcarian alleges that the execution of this settlement agreement was the first step in a conspiracy to destroy his reputation and career.how could a settlement advance the conspirators goal of discrediting abcarian abcarian answer to this question is that the defendants entered into the settlement agreement and paid behzad nearly a million dollars merely so they could report the settlement of a medical malpractice claim against abcarian to the illinois department of financial and professional regulation idfpr and the national practitioner data bank npdb upon receiving those reports,both the idfpr and the npdb asked abcarian to provide information about the settlement the idfpr told abcarian that a failure to provide a timely response to its request could result in disciplinary action.abcarian does not allege,however,that any formal disciplinary proceedings were ever initiated against him,let alone that any formal disciplinary sanctions were imposed.
the alleged conspiracy to destroy abcarian professional reputation did not end with the reporting of the settlement,according to abcarian.the same day that the settlement agreement was executed,the defendants directed david behzad counsel to file suit against abcarian in a state trial court.they further directed behzad counsel not to serve abcarian with process in that suit,but to inform the court that the matter had been settled and to request a dismissal of the lawsuit.abcarian believes that the defendants did this to prevent him from contesting the merits of the malpractice claim.
the state trial court approved the settlement agreement and dismissed the case with prejudice.when abcarian learned of the dismissal,he filed a petition to vacate the dismissal.he asked that the settlement be vacated and the settlement funds returned to the defendants.the defendants,through counsel,intervened to oppose this petition.the court vacated the dismissal order but declined to vacate the settlement agreement.behzad then voluntarily dismissed his lawsuit with prejudice.the trial court decision was affirmed on appeal,behzad abcarian.may,unpublished order,and the illinois supreme court declined review,behzad abcarian,
abcarian then brought this lawsuit against the defendants alleging various constitutional claims under,as well as a number of state law claims.on the defendants motion to dismiss abcarian amended complaint,the district court dismissed all claims against the board of trustees of the university of illinois on eleventh amendment grounds and dismissed all of abcarian constitutional claims against the individual defendants for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.abcarian mcdonald,c,wl.march.the district court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.id.at.abcarian later asked the court to amend its judgment and to allow him to amend his complaint again,but the court denied both requests.abcarian mcdonald,c,wl.
abcarian appeals the district court dismissal of his free speech,equal protection,and procedural due process claims against the individual defendants.he also challenges the court refusal to amend its judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e and argues that the court should have permitted him to amend his complaint.he does not appeal the dismissal of his claims against the board of trustees or the dismissal of his substantive due process and jury trial claims.
dismissal on the meritsa.first amendment retaliation claim 
in count i of his amended complaint,abcarian claimed that the defendants violated his first amendment rights by retaliating against him for exercising his freedom of speech.the district court concluded that the supreme court decision in garcetti ceballos,foreclosed this claim because all of the speech that prompted the alleged retaliation was speech in the course of abcarian official duties as a public employee.
on appeal,abcarian makes two arguments to avoid the effect of garcetti.first,he argues that garcetti forbids retaliation claims only against employers themselves,not against fellow employees.this is an issue on which we reserved judgment in fairley andrews,cir.second,he argues that even if garcetti reaches retaliation claims against other employees,it does not foreclose his claim because his speech did not owe its existence to his professional responsibilities.see at.
garcetti held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.id.the case arose when a state prosecutor brought a first amendment retaliation claim arising out of discipline imposed on him after he drafted a memorandum questioning the validity of a search warrant obtained in a pending criminal case.id.at.the supreme court rejected his claim.although the court noted employers heightened interest in controlling employee speech when necessary to manage workplace operations,it focused on the fact that restricting speech made pursuant to employment duties does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.id.at.as a result,the court rejected the notion that the first amendment shields from discipline the expressions employees make pursuant to their professional duties.id.at.
plaintiff abcarian seeks to narrow garcetti to apply only to claims against the employer as an entity,while still allowing claims against individual who acted as agents of the employer.we are not persuaded.it would be difficult to reconcile garcetti with a broad rule permitting retaliation claims against in all circumstances.although the supreme court couched its analysis in the context of the relationship,it indicated that employees speaking pursuant to their official duties do not speak as citizens for purposes of the first amendment.id.at.for this reason,we have read garcetti broadly.see,spiegla hull,cir garcetti made clear that public employees speaking pursuant to their official duties are speaking as employees,not citizens,and thus are not protected by the first amendment regardless of the content of their speech.
in fairley,on which abcarian primarily relies,the plaintiffs brought first amendment retaliation claims against both their employer and their.at.although we questioned the applicability of garcetti to all acts of,we observed that the defendants in fairley were merely enforcing the employer policy.at.because their actions were allegedly condoned by their employer,who was himself immune from liability under garcetti,we held that the defendants were also immune from liability.we explained this conclusion by noting the significant difference between who try to subvert the employer policies and who merely enforce the employer policies.id.applying this distinction,we reinstated claims against who allegedly bullied and threatened the plaintiffs to deter them from testifying against other employees in a civil rights lawsuit.we reasoned that the duty to provide testimony is better understood for these purposes not as a job duty,something done for the benefit of the employer,but as a duty that any person owes to the court,something done for the rule of law.id.at.
in essence,fairley held that the reasoning of garcetti reaches claims against employers and also claims against whose actions directly advance the employer interest in maintaining an orderly workplace.this would apply when the acts under instructions from,with express approval of,or in clear accordance with the policies set out by the employer itself.in such circumstances,the actions implicate the employer administrative interests so squarely as to require application of garcetti for the benefit of the.suppose,for example,that the prosecutor in garcetti had been reported in compliance with the employer written policies by a coworker for his behavior and had been disciplined then.under abcarian proposed narrow interpretation of garcetti,the employer would be immune from a retaliation claim but the would not,despite the fact that he acted only to further the employer interests.such a rule would be at least as disruptive to workplace discipline as would a rule allowing retaliation suits against the employer contrary to garcetti.although employers could still respond to workplace complaints without fear of suit,we could expect that complaints would be made less frequently because of the other employees fear of being sued by their.less able to rely on its own employees to provide necessary information on which to base its disciplinary decisions,the employer would be in practically the same position,from a managerial standpoint,that it would have occupied if garcetti had been decided the other way.
accordingly,we reject abcarian first argument and conclude that garcetti applies to the retaliation claim against the individual defendants.abcarian specifically alleged that the board of trustees adopt ed and ratif ied the actions of the conspirators as its official policy,forcing a conclusion that the defendants alleged retaliatory acts advanced the board interests as an employer.because fairley made clear that garcetti shelters employee actions in this situation,we need not decide the broader question whether garcetti applies to all instances of retaliation.
abcarian second argument against application of garcetti is that his speech was not pursuant to his official responsibilities.garcetti bars retaliation claims only if the plaintiff spoke as an employee rather than as a citizen.see chacklos stevens,cir garcetti requires a threshold determination regarding whether the public employee spoke in his capacity as a private citizen or as an employee,citing renken gregory,cir.when determining whether a plaintiff spoke as an employee or as a citizen,we take a practical view of the facts alleged in the complaint,looking to the employee level of responsibility and the context in which the statements were made.tamayo blagojevich,cir.
a natural reading of the allegations in abcarian amended complaint indicates that he spoke while discharging the responsibilities of his office,not as a member of the general public.abcarian was not merely a staff physician with limited authority.he was,among other things,the service chief of the department of surgery at the university of illinois medical center at chicago as well as head of the department of surgery at the university of illinois college of medicine at chicago.abcarian had significant authority and responsibility over a wide range of issues affecting the surgical departments at both institutions and therefore had a broader responsibility to speak in the course of his employment obligations.the subjects on which he management,the fees charged to physicians,and surgeon abuse of prescription medications,among other affected both surgical departments and fell within the broad ambit of his responsibilities.this alleged speech was within the scope of abcarian responsibilities as an employee.see id.an employee with significant and comprehensive responsibility certainly has greater responsibility to speak.
abcarian amended complaint gives us insufficient reason to believe that,despite the likelihood that he spoke in the course of his job responsibilities,he ever stepped outside his administrative role to speak as a citizen.on appeal,abcarian admits that his amended complaint is entirely devoid of any job description or other detail of abcarian affirmative duties,leaving us to speculate whether he spoke as a citizen or in the course of his employment.a mere speculative possibility that abcarian spoke as a citizen is no longer enough to satisfy federal notice pleading requirements.see ashcroft iqbal,limestone dev.village of lemont,cir concentra health,cir.nor are abcarian conclusory allegations that he spoke as a citizen on matters of public concern.see tamayo,at stating that a plaintiff can not escape the strictures of garcetti by asserting a legal conclusion that he spoke as a citizen outside the duties of his employment.the amended complaint fails to show that it is at all plausible,rather than perhaps theoretically possible,that abcarian spoke in his capacity as a citizen when he spoke with other university employees about university affairs relevant to his job duties.see iqbal.at the plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.
because any plausible reading of abcarian amended complaint indicates that his speech was made pursuant to his official duties,and because abcarian failed to make any factual allegations indicating otherwise,garcetti bars his first amendment retaliation claim.dismissal of count i of the amended complaint was proper.
equal protection claim 
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment most typically reaches state action that treats a person poorly because of the person race or other suspect classification,such as sex,national origin,religion,political affiliation,among others,or because the person has exercised a fundamental right,or because the person is a member of a group that is the target of irrational government discrimination.see generally engquist oregon dep t of agriculture,plyler doe,srail village of lisle,cir.the supreme court has also recognized the prospect of a equal protection claim.village of willowbrook olech.a claim need not allege discrimination based on a suspect classification,but must allege that the plaintiff was singled out arbitrarily,without rational basis,for unfair treatment,avila pappas,cir see generally srail,at summarizing seventh circuit divergent precedent regarding whether illegitimate animus can substitute for absence of rational basis for state action.
abcarian tries to take advantage of this theory in count vi of the amended complaint,which alleges that defendants violated his equal protection rights by reporting the behzad settlement but not the settlement of a malpractice claim against another physician.the district court dismissed count vi and the related claim for equitable relief on the ground that abcarian claim was barred by the supreme court decision in engquist.abcarian contends that engquist applies only to claims against governmental employers but not to claims against other government employees.
we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed the equal protection claim,but for another reason under the law,defendants had no discretion in deciding whether to report the behzad settlement.engquist held that claims can not be based on the highly discretionary and individualized sorts of decisions that public employers must make about their employees.the court pointed out that its decision in olech,which first recognized equal protection claims,rested on the existence of a clear standard against which departures,even for a single plaintiff,could be readily assessed.at.at.some forms of state action by their nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based on a vast array of subjective,individualized assessments.id.at.a llowing a challenge based on the arbitrary singling out of a particular person would undermine the very discretion that such state officials are entrusted to exercise.id.it is no proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjective,individualized decision that it was subjective and individualized.id.accordingly,the theory of equal protection is a poor fit with employment decisions,which are themselves often subjective and individualized,resting on a wide array of factors that are difficult to articulate and quantify.id.at.based on this analysis,the court held that a theory of equal protection has no place in the public employment context.id.at.
we have interpreted engquist to stand for the broad proposition that inherently subjective discretionary governmental decisions may be immune from claims.see,avila,at noting in dicta that claims can not rest on governmental activity that is discretionary by design srail,at rejecting challenge to village subjective and individualized decision not to extend water services united states moore,cir stating that challenges may be inapplicable to any governmental action that is the product of a highly discretionary decisionmaking process we have also recognized that engquist has limited applicability when a decisionmaker discretion is circumscribed by constitutional or statutory provisions.for example,because police discretion is narrowed by objective constitutional limitations such as the fourth amendment,not all discretionary police is immune from challenge.see wanes zurick,cir.
but when the law gives a state actor no discretion,it is hard to see how a person can claim irrational discrimination when the law is applied to him.state and federal law required the defendants to report the settlement of behzad malpractice claim to the relevant federal and state matter however frivolous or insubstantial that claim may have been.see a requiring any entity making a payment in settlement of a medical malpractice claim to report certain information to the npdb ilcs a requiring any entity which indemnifies a physician for his professional liability to report the settlement of a claim 
abcarian complaint seeks to assert a claim of selective enforcement of a law against only disfavored claim long familiar in equal protection jurisprudence when based on race,national origin,or other suspect classifications.see yick wo hopkins,reversing convictions because underlying ordinance was enforced solely against individuals of chinese ancestry.notably,such cases are typically brought against police,prosecutors,or other individuals having discretion in the enforcement of the law.see,wayte united states,challenge implicating prosecutorial discretion yick wo,u.at challenge to ordinance vesting discretion in decisionmaker so great as to be considered naked and arbitrary power.equal protection claims are allowed in such circumstances not because the particular law at issue is facially invalid or inapplicable to the plaintiff conduct,but because of the concern that individuals with discretion in law enforcement will take advantage of that discretion to oppress unpopular groups 
but abcarian claim here has little in common with a typical selective enforcement claim.as we noted above,the defendants were required to report the settlement of behzad claim to the authorities.see a ilcs a.they had neither naked and arbitrary power,yick wo,at,nor a broad discretion to act,wayte,at.unlike a police officer or prosecutor having significant discretion as to how or whether to enforce the law,these defendants had no choice as to whether they complied with the law.if they disregarded their reporting obligations,they ran the risk of civil and criminal certainly not at issue when a police officer chooses not to issue a traffic ticket or when a prosecutor declines to press charges.see c imposing civil penalty of not more than for a failure to report ilcs g making a failure to report a misdemeanor.absent any meaningful discretion on the defendants part to decide whether to report the settlement of a particular malpractice claim,we see little risk of the kind of discriminatory action addressed by the fourteenth amendment.the district court was correct to dismiss count vi of abcarian amended complaint and the related claim for equitable relief.
procedural due process claims 
abcarian last constitutional claim is that defendants violated his right to procedural due process by reporting the behzad settlement to state and national authorities.he now challenges the district court dismissal of counts ii and iv and his related request for equitable relief.
a procedural due process claim involves a analysis first,we determine whether the defendants deprived the plaintiff of a protected liberty or property interest,and if so,then we assess what process was due.brokaw mercer county,cir,citing hamlin vaudenberg,cir see armstrong manzo,stating that deprivations of life,liberty,or property must be accompanied by notice and the opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the interest at issue,quoting mullane central hanover bank tr,
abcarian claims that the defendants defamed him and thereby infringed his liberty to pursue his chosen occupation.the supreme court has made it clear that defamation alone,even by a state actor,does not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.paul davis.to avoid constitutionalizing state defamation law,defamation by a government actor does not implicate the due process clause unless a right or status previously recognized by state law was distinctly altered or extinguished as a result.id.at brown city of michigan city,cir.to avoid this problem,a plaintiff must allege that he was stigmatized by the defendant conduct,the stigmatizing information was publicly disclosed and he suffered a tangible loss of other employment opportunities as a result of public disclosure.townsend vallas,cir johnson martin,cir.
abcarian amended complaint shows that he can not satisfy the third prong of this test.it is true that he has a protected liberty interest in pursuing his chosen profession,of course,but that right is not infringed by ordinary defamation or even by a serious deprivation of one future employment prospects.dupuy.samuels,cir.to plead a constitutionally relevant tangible loss of his employment opportunities,abcarian must allege that his good name,reputation,honor or integrity was called into question in a manner that makes it virtually impossible for him to find new employment in his chosen field.townsend,at head chicago sch.reform bd.of trustees,cir olivieri rodriguez,cir.
abcarian can not meet this burden for a simple and benign reason he still has his job i
