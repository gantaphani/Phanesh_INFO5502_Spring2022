secretary of the department of health and human services kathleen sebelius the secretary appeals the adverse summary judgment grant in an action brought by five hospitals hospitals,each recipients of medicare direct graduate medical education dgme payments for approved family medicine residency programs.the district court found the secretary methodology for calculating the hospitals per resident amounts pras under the existing regulation e i regulation,known as sequential geographic methodology sgm,arbitrary and capricious.on appeal,the secretary argues the agency provider review reimbursement board prrb improperly granted expedited judicial review ejr to the hospitals challenge to sgm.the hospitals cross appeal,challenging,among other determinations,the district court failure to find the regulation both substantively and procedurally invalid on its face.
finding a lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the prrb incorrect granting of ejr,we vacate the district court invalidation of sgm,and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the hospitals challenge and further remand to the agency for it to determine the validity of the methodology.we affirm the district court determination as to the validity of the regulation.
background 
factual background 
the hospitals operate residency training programs in rural family medicine,and include yakima medical center and yakima valley memorial hospital yakima medical,located in yakima valley,washington,vincent hospital and clinic health system,located in billings,montana,and merle west medical center merle west,located in klamath falls,oregon.the five hospitals were recipients of medicare dgme payments,which are based on a pra and calculated according to several formulas.these formulas included the regulation and sgm.
the regulation based the pra for the new graduate medical education programs on the lower of the following a the hospital actual costs b the mean value of per resident amounts of hospitals located in the same geographic wage area.in areas with fewer than three amounts in the wage area,the intermediary was required to write hcfa health care financing administration central office for a determination of the per resident amount to use.at.
hcfa described sgm in a june letter to the reimbursement manager of blue cross of montana.the methodology was used in the by hcfa to calculate the pras for hospitals with fewer than three amounts in the wage area.see.at.in its letter,hcfa noted 
if there are at least three hospitals in the same geographic wage area,we determine the base year per resident amount based on a weighted average of the per resident amounts in the same geographic wage area.if there are less than three teaching hospitals in the same geographic wage area,we include all hospitals in contiguous wage areas.if we continue to have fewer than three hospitals for this calculation,we use a statewide average.in the case of vincent and deaconess,there are fewer than three hospitals with teaching programs in the entire state so we calculated a weighted average among all hospitals with teaching programs in contiguous states.
however,in its final rule,issued in,the secretary ultimately declined to adopt sgm as its methodology,relying instead on the regional weighted average per resident amounts determined for each of the nine census regions established by the bureau of census for statistical and reporting purposes for areas with fewer than three hospitals in a given geographic wage area.
here,the secretary calculated the hospitals pras via sgm,based on the weighted average of pras of teaching hospitals in each state for merle west,yakima medical,the pras of oregon and washington,respectively,or the weighted average of pras of teaching hospitals in contiguous states.the hospitals appealed these pra determinations to the prrb,contending their allowed medicare dgme costs exceeded these determinations.
procedural background 
the hospitals district court action challenged both the secretary regulation and its prior methodology,or sgm,as inconsistent with the plain and unambiguous wording of the governing medicare statute,inconsistent with clear congressional intent,patently unreasonable,arbitrary and capricious,and otherwise contrary to law.
in,the prrb,which had granted ejr as to the validity of the secretary regulation,granted ejr over the issue of whether e i regulation,as applied by the intermediaries via sgm to each of the providers in this appeal,violates h f.ejr permits a party to seek judicial review in federal court,without the issuance of a final decision of the prrb,of an action which involves a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy whenever the board determines that it is without authority to decide the question.f.
in,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the hospitals,and found sgm lacked the force of law and that under the appropriate skidmore level of deference sgm is arbitrary and capricious.in the same order,the court accorded the regulation chevron deference upheld the regulation,and declined to find the regulation arbitrary and capricious.the court then ordered the secretary in to calculate a weighted average pra based on plaintiffs costs,and set each plaintiff pra at the lesser of a each plaintiff actual average cost per resident or b the average weighted cost per resident of the five plaintiffs.the order required the secretary to submit the new figures to the court and allowed the court to retain jurisdiction over the matter.the secretary ultimately submitted those calculations,and the court awarded these amounts and entered judgment for the hospitals.
the secretary filed a timely notice of appeal challenging the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court under the ejr,the court reversal of the prrb determination,via sgm,of the dgme amounts due to the hospitals,and the court limitation of the secretary discretion to reaudit the hospitals base dgme costs.
the hospitals filed a timely cross appeal challenging the court failure to invalidate sgm on procedural grounds,failure to find the regulation substantively and procedurally invalid on its face,failure to specify,in the alternative,that its remedy was based on the regulation itself,and the exclusion of evidence of the secretary comparable programs under.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo both the district court subject matter jurisdiction and the district court grant of summary judgment.see schnabel lui,cir subject matter jurisdiction rene mgm grand hotel,cir grant of summary judgment,cert.denied.same.our review is not of the secretary prrb reimbursement determination itself,but the district court determinations.
iii.discussion 
the secretary challenges the district court jurisdiction,contending because reimbursement determinations under sgm do not turn on a question of law or regulation that the prrb can not review,they consequently are not amenable to expedited judicial review under f.because sgm is an ad hoc methodology and does not meet the requirements of f,we agree that the prrb grant of ejr was in error,and the district court should not have determined it had jurisdiction.
prrb decision 
section f gives providers the right to obtain judicial review of any action of the fiscal intermediary involving a question of law or regulations whenever the board determines that it is without authority to decide the question.see bethesda hosp.ass bowen,subsection f grants providers the right to obtain judicial review of an action of the fiscal intermediary,but the predicate is that the board must first make a determination that it is without authority to decide the matter because the provider claim involves a question of law or regulations.
the prrb granted ejr for sgm in its proceeding over the issue of whether the regulation,as applied by the intermediaries to each of the providers in this appeal,violates h f by failing to base the providers average amounts on the approved equivalent resident amounts of comparable residency programs.the prrb found jurisdiction to address the issue in a hearing and then conclude d it lack ed the authority to grant relief sought by the providers,using the providers audited,medicare allowable costs as the basis for pras because the remedy was not prescribed by the regulation.it also stated it was unable to invalidate a method of reimbursement that is solely within the discretion of the secretary to administer,as is the case here.here,we evaluate the prrb determination that it lacked the authority to review sgm.if,as the secretary contends,the prrb had the authority to decide the question of sgm validity,then its grant of ejr was incorrect,and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to evaluate sgm validity.
the prrb reviewed the decision of a fiscal to the pra for each hospital,which was used to calculate the dgme funds.per the statute,the hospital had the right to obtain judicial review of any action of the fiscal intermediary here,the pra determination by the cms using sgm which involves a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy whenever the board determines that it is without authority to decide the question.f.our task is to determine whether sgm is a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy.see id.
ad hoc policy or regulation 
the secretary argues that sgm was an ad hoc policy and not a regulation under the statute.we agree the district court lacked jurisdiction to review sgm because sgm was not a regulation no rule was promulgated as this was a adjudication,and did not involve rulemaking of any kind.
we distinguish rulemaking from adjudication 
a rule is the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization,procedure,or practice requirements of an agency an adjudication which results in an order is virtually any agency action that is not rulemaking.two principal characteristics distinguish rulemaking from adjudication.first,adjudications resolve disputes among specific individuals in specific cases,whereas rulemaking affects the rights of broad classes of unspecified individuals.second,because adjudications involve concrete disputes,they have an immediate effect on specific individuals those involved in the dispute.rulemaking,in contrast,is prospective,and has a definitive effect on individuals only after the rule subsequently is applied.
yesler terrace community council cisneros,cir internal citations omitted alterations in original.a regulation is defined as a rule or order,having legal force,usually issued by an administrative agency.see black law dictionary ed.here,sgm was promulgated not through notice and comment rulemaking,formal adjudication,or formal rulemaking,but rather came in a letter to the hospitals,which stated it would be applied on a basis.sgm likewise did not affect the rights of a broad class of people,and so no notice and comment was required,as it was not rulemaking.see maclean dep t of homeland security,cir.it was applied to specific individuals in specific cases,namely each of the hospitals,and involved the concrete dispute of the calculation of a pra for hospitals with less than three comparable hospitals in the area.see yesler terrace,at.

interpretations such as those in opinion interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all lack the force of law christensen harris county.the prrb,therefore,had the authority to decide the question at issue because it did not involve a question of law or regulations.see f.the board incorrectly determined that it lacked authority to decide the issue,and,as a result,incorrectly granted ejr.therefore,the district court lacked jurisdiction over the validity of sgm.we vacate the district court invalidation of sgm,and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the hospitals challenge and further remand to the agency for it to determine the validity of the methodology 
b.the regulation 
the remaining issue before us,from the hospitals cross appeal,is whether the district court erred in concluding the regulation was both substantively and procedurally valid on its face.the hospitals argue the district court erred in failing to invalidate,under chevron,at,the portion of the regulation applicable to hospitals in geographic wage areas with less than three teaching hospitals,because the regulation deviated from the mandate of h by impermissibly differentiat ing a subset of new teaching programs from all others.they also argue the regulation was arbitrary and capricious under a due to the secretary failure to provide notice of or rationale of the methodology to be applied by the hcfa with respect to hospitals in a geographic wage area with less than three hospitals.
the district court did not err in upholding the validity of the regulation under chevron,nor did it err in declining to find the regulation arbitrary and capricious 
chevron step one 
we ask first whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.here,the statute is ambiguous with respect to the secretary responsibility of establishing pras for dgme programs.the plain language of the statute is based in the ambiguous term comparable programs the secretary shall provide for such approved fte equivalent resident amounts as the secretary determines to be appropriate,based on approved fte resident amounts for comparable programs.h.congress,however,provided no criteria to determine program compatibility.
the hospitals cite to the federal register,and the secretary inten t to establish reasonable dgme costs in a manner that would not disadvantage new programs.however,in that same text of the regulation,the secretary also notes,if there are fewer than three amounts in the wage area,we are proposing that the intermediary write hcfa central office for a determination of the per resident amount to use.the per resident amount used for the first year would be updated in future years without regard to actual costs.at emphasis added.simply indicating that the secretary did not want hospitals to be disadvantaged is not an indication of the meaning of comparable,and certainly does not preclude this portion of the regulation,particularly when the secretary notes that updates in future years will be without regard to actual costs.
the hospitals also contend the comparable programs requirement is rendered superfluous by the portion of the secretary regulation here,and that the secretary interpretation adds new language to the statute not contained therein,thereby creating two different classes of new teaching programs.nothing in the statute,however,attempts to define comparable programs,or exclude any possible definitions the regulation merely defines what is ambiguous within the statute.
chevron step two 
under chevron step two,if congressional intent is ambiguous,a reviewing court must defer to the agency interpretation of the statute unless it is contrary to clear congressional intent or frustrates the policy congress sought to implement.schneider chertoff,cir.the hospitals argue nothing in the statute implies the secretary may treat hospitals in wage areas with less than three teaching hospitals different from all other new programs.however,nowhere does the statute itself forbid the secretary from making such an exception.the district court correctly noted that g iven the absence of clear congressional intent to the contrary,it was permissible for the secretary to provide for the exceptio
