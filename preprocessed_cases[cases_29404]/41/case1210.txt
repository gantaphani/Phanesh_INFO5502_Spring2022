sutton,on behalf of the putative class of persons implanted with the device,seeks the imposition of a medical monitoring fund providing the following notice to all persons implanted with the device of its potential harm periodic medical examinations,including necessary studies and tests,to determine the extent of graft compromise and its progression,if any education for physicians about diagnosing and treating any scarring that may result from using the device and medical treatment to remove the device from all individuals exhibiting bypass graft compromise as a result of using the device.

standing under article iii 
sutton brings suit on behalf of a class of uninjured device implantees.in order to satisfy the standing requirements of article iii of the constitution,sutton must meet three requirements.failure to establish any one of them deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to hear the suit.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first,sutton must demonstrate he has suffered an injury in fact that is both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citing lujan,at.second,the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of jude.id.finally,sutton must show that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.

standing based upon increased risk of future harm 
sutton makes three main factual allegations in his complaint the device is defective and unreasonably dangerous implantation of the device puts sutton and class members at a substantially greater risk for developing restenosis and occlusion of the bypass graft and this increased risk necessitates both current and future medical testing and monitoring.the district court found sutton alleged injury purely hypothetical because he did not provide the court with any information from which to assess his allegedly increased risk of harm from implantation of the aortic connector.sutton jude,d.the thrust of the district court decision was that sutton failed to establish a sufficient risk of harm associated with the device to survive dismissal for lack of standing.we find the district court incorrectly attempted to evaluate the merits of sutton contention that he is entitled to medical monitoring costs.during the threshold standing inquiry,the district court should have accepted sutton allegations as true and construed the complaint in sutton favor.see greater cincinnati coalition for the homeless,at.
sutton argues that exposure to an increased risk of disease has been recognized by federal courts as an injury in fact sufficient to confer article iii standing.he likens exposure to the device to exposure to toxins such as nuclear emissions and asbestos.see duke power carolina envtl.study group,d finding standing where plaintiffs had not yet manifested any physical injury as a result of exposure to nuclear emission carlough amchem,conferring standing from mere exposure to asbestos.the district court correctly stated that the device presently at issue differs from toxic substances in that the device provides a medical benefit to individuals exposed to it.the district court also properly noted that medical devices can be beneficial for some users while causing complications in others.for purposes of standing however,we hold the differences between exposure to toxic substances and allegedly defective products are immaterial.
in recent years,tort plaintiffs have increasingly sought,and have regularly been awarded,medical monitoring costs in both toxic tort and product liability cases.see arvin maskin,et,medical monitoring a viable remedy for deserving plaintiffs or tort law most expensive consolation prize,mitchell,citing day nlo,bower westinghouse.a medical monitoring award aids presently healthy plaintiffs who have been exposed to an increased risk of future harm to detect and treat any resultant harm at an early stage.ayers jackson township.
the question of whether an increased risk of harm requiring current medical monitoring is a sufficient injury in fact to confer standing is one of first impression in this circuit.the main basis found in the case law for allowing such claims to proceed is friends for all children,lockheed aircraft.friends for all children concerned a tort action on behalf of vietnamese orphans for injuries suffered in an aviation accident in vietnam in.the court found a sufficient injury in fact for approximately forty adopted vietnamese children living in france fac ing irreparable injury unless they promptly obtained diagnostic examinations at.after finding the plaintiffs had standing to pursue their claim,the friends for all children court upheld the district court decision ordering lockheed to establ
