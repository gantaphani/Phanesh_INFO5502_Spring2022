in april of,david bowen applied for disability insurance benefits from the social security administration ssa.he claimed that he had become disabled due to both physical and mental conditions that rendered him incapable of working.during two hearings held before an administrative law judge alj,both bowen and the commissioner presented medical evidence related to bowen conditions.the alj ultimately concluded that bowen was not entitled to disability benefits because he retained a sufficient residual functional capacity rfc to work.in so concluding,the alj credited the medical evidence that bowen was,at most,only moderately limited in his functional capabilities,and rejected without discussion the severe functional limitations that bowen treating psychologist ascribed to him.
after the ssa appeals council denied bowen request for review,he filed suit in federal district court.the district court ruled in favor of the commissioner.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the judgment of the district court with instructions to remand the case to the commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
bowen is presently years old,has an education,and is married with two children.he worked for years at a mining operation in kentucky as a buggy operator and a operator.in april of,bowen suffered a injury to his back,aggravating a previous injury from.initially,he was able to continue working,but he claims that the injury worsened to the point where he had to cease work in september of.he has not worked since that time and has experienced symptoms of depression.
bowen filed his present application for disability insurance benefits in april of,asserting that both physical and psychological conditions preclude him from working.on appeal,bowen challenges only that portion of the alj decision addressing his psychological condition.we will therefore limit our discussion to the facts relevant to that determination.
bowen was first admitted to the mountain comprehensive care center mccc in eastern kentucky in july of.he was referred to the unit for symptoms that included depression.since that time,he has been evaluated by a number of psychologists and psychiatrists.these health professionals all diagnosed bowen with some form of depression.their particular diagnoses,however,varied significantly regarding the extent of bowen depression,his residual mental capabilities,the possibility that he suffered from other psychological impairments,and the possibility of his malingering.
the record on appeal includes the opinions of eight psychologists and psychiatrists jane brake,richard cohen,james dumas,wayne edwards,robert granacher,dorothy holean,eric johnson,and lea perritt.in addition,the alj identified bowen written treatment records from mccc as a medical source.these records consist of notes taken during bowen periodic outpatient visits to mccc and the results of his annual status examinations.the vast majority of these notes and examination records are signed by both holean and a chris caudill,the latter not being further identified by the parties.as the commissioner notes,holean was bowen treating psychologist at mccc.the record contains treatment notes signed jointly by holean and caudill beginning in july of and continuing through the end of the relevant record in.
bowen was also treated by dumas,a psychiatrist at mccc.the other medical sources listed above either examined bowen or reviewed his records on behalf of the ssa pursuant to his disability claims.most relevant to this appeal are the opinions of dumas and holean,who treated bowen,and those of brake and cohen,who reviewed bowen records on behalf of the ssa.their opinions form the basis of bowen principal claim of error.
holean submitted an assessment in april of that found bowen to possess a poor rfc regarding his ability to deal with stress,maintain attention or concentration,behave in an emotionally stable manner,and perform other essential workplace activities.after reviewing bowen record on behalf of the ssa in december of,cohen submitted an rfc assessment that appeared to agree with this bleak evaluation of bowen generally poor rfc.elsewhere on his evaluation,however,cohen and without further there are no marked functional limitations.cohen added that bowen exhibited evidence of malingering on portions of his psychological testing.edwards and johnson both echoed these concerns of possible malingering.
in sharp contrast to the severe assessments of cohen and holean,brake submitted an rfc assessment in november of that found bowen depression to only moderately limit his functional capabilities.brake reviewed bowen medical records on behalf of the ssa and assessed him to be either not significantly limited or only moderately limited in all categories included on the rfc chart that she completed.she further opined that bowen was able to understand and recall material,maintain the mental effort needed to complete tasks,function in an setting,and handle routine situations.
bowen treating psychiatrist at mccc,dumas,submitted an evaluation of bowen in april of,but he did not assess bowen rfc specifically.instead,dumas narrative psychiatric evaluation diagnosed bowen with depression and an adjustment disorder.he concluded that bowen depression was being fairly.dumas also determined that bowen appears to have responded well to his current medication,his cognition appears to be intact,his judgment and insight appear to be reasonable,and his mood was much improved.
despite finding that bowen condition was fairly,dumas increased bowen dosage of prozac for a trial period.dumas also assigned bowen a global assessment of functioning gaf score of,indicating moderate impairment.see kornecky comm r of soc,cir explaining that a gaf of indicates moderate symptoms,flat affect and circumstantial speech,occasional panic attacks,or moderate difficulty in social,occupational,or school functioning,few friends,conflicts with peers or.brackets and quotation marks omitted.
as noted above,the record consists of multiple other medical opinions that generally fall in line with either brake assessment or with that of cohen and holean.because this appeal primarily raises a procedural issue,however,we will omit any detailed discussion of the remaining expert opinions.
procedural background 
the present litigation stems from bowen second application to the commissioner for disability benefits.his first application claimed that he became disabled in september of due to back problems,pain,high blood pressure,nerves,depression,foot problems,and arthritis.an alj issued an unfavorable decision regarding that application,which was upheld by both the appeals council and the district court.
following the final denial of his first application,bowen filed his second application in april of,asserting that his continued affliction with substantially the same conditions rendered him totally disabled.because the ssa had already issued a final decision on his first application,the alj concluded that res judicata barred bowen from claiming benefits for the period between september of and november of,when the appeals council affirmed the denial of his first application.the alj thus considered bowen present application for benefits to cover only the period from november of through the date that his disability insurance coverage expired in december of.
after a hearing,the alj denied bowen second application for benefits.the appeals council declined bowen request for review in april of,which rendered the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.bowen subsequently filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of kentucky.the district court affirmed the commissioner denial of benefits to bowen,and this timely appeal followed.
