background 
underlying offense and state court proceedings 
during the spring of,the victim in this case contacted deshazer after her recent divorce.the two,who were former childhood friends,began to interact via telephone and.their relationship progressed,and in july deshazer,who was living in wisconsin,spent a month at her home in wyoming.
the victim then learned that her sister was ill and began to fly frequently to las vegas to visit her.at this point,she told deshazer that the relationship would not work.deshazer continued,however,to contact her by telephone and,despite her pleas that he stop.in december,he hand delivered a note and left it in her mailbox.the note included this passage sorry i missed you.i hope to hear from you by january.otherwise,perhaps you will see me when i return.
after the note,some time passed without incident.on january,however,deshazer loaded his vehicle with various guns,duct tape,and other supplies and set out to the victim home.as he attempted to burst through her front door,she heard him and retrieved a gun she had obtained for this very situation.during the ensuing confrontation,a neighbor knocked on the door,and the victim was able to escape and call the police.deshazer was arrested about an hour later near gillette,wyoming.in the car,the police found,among other inculpatory items,a digital recording on which deshazer said he intended to seek retribution from the victim for destroying his life.
deshazer was charged in wyoming state court with attempted kidnapping,aggravated assault and battery,and aggravated burglary.shortly thereafter,he was indicted in federal district court on one count of interstate stalking,in violation of,and one count of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c a ii.
the federal charges were deferred pending resolution of the state charges.deshazer was found guilty on the state charges,but while awaiting sentencing he was diagnosed with delusional and depressive disorders.the wyoming state hospital informed the state trial court that his delusional disorder was well controlled by his current medication,but that he had been legally incompetent during the trial.deshazer was then taken into federal custody for further evaluation that could be used in the state sentencing proceedings.
federal proceedings 
doctors evaluated deshazer at the federal medical center in rochester,minnesota.in december,a report submitted to the district court stated that deshazer does not presently suffer from a mental disease or defect rendering him unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him,or to assist properly in his defense.deshazer was subsequently returned to state custody for sentencing.upon completion of the state proceedings,deshazer was returned to federal custody in july to face the federal charges against him.
first competency hearing 
after postponing arraignment to allow defense counsel to obtain an independent mental evaluation,the district court held a competency hearing on february.upon hearing testimony from defense and government experts,the district court found deshazer competent to stand trial.specifically,the government expert opinion persuaded the court.it corresponded to the opinion set forth in the december report,that deshazer had an obsessive compulsive disorder and not a mental illness.the court also told defense counsel to inform deshazer that it would not allow him to play games with the court.
at the arraignment,trial was set for july.in may,however,defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy.the trial was delayed for resolution of this motion and an interlocutory appeal to this court.the appeal was mooted,however,when the wyoming supreme court reversed deshazer convictions on competency grounds that august.
second competency hearing 
trial was rescheduled for february.on motions by both the government and counsel for deshazer,however,the district court scheduled another competency hearing for the morning of trial.at that hearing,the district court expressed concerns with the possible staleness of the report by the federal medical center and ordered that deshazer be evaluated again by a facility within the bureau of prisons.the district court scheduled a third competency hearing for august.
third competency hearing 
on august,counsel for deshazer moved to continue the third competency hearing and requested independent competency evaluations.after a hearing,the district court granted the defense requests.while those evaluations were underway,and before a new date had been set for a competency hearing,the district court set a preliminary trial date of january,and an alternate date of april.
a few weeks before the january,trial date,counsel for deshazer filed a motion asking the court to continue the trial,schedule a new competency hearing,and dismiss the charges pursuant to jackson indiana,d.the district court denied the motion to dismiss the charges pursuant to jackson deshazer immediately appealed,but it granted the motion to continue the trial so that the court could yet again evaluate deshazer mental competency.the district court again indicated its suspicion that deshazer was manipulating the system.
in may,deshazer refused to be medicated any further and filed a motion to stay forced medication.the district court granted the motion despite its concern that deshazer was malingering.in august,cristina pietz,a federal examiner,determined that deshazer suffered from no mental illness or defect.rather,he had obsessive impulses that interfered with daily functioning.
in july,we dismissed deshazer interlocutory appeal based on jackson for lack of appellate jurisdiction.see united states deshazer,cir.the district court then denied another motion by defense counsel for hospitalization and further evaluation since one had been conducted in august by pietz.deshazer also had his counsel file a motion stating his desire to represent himself under faretta california,d.
in august,the court held a third competency hearing.at that hearing,there was no real dispute that deshazer rationally understood,inter alia,the nature of the proceedings against him,the strength of the government evidence,and the potential availability of an insanity defense.accordingly,the central question was whether deshazer suffered from a mental disease that rendered him unable to assist in his defense.see a.deshazer expert,bruce kahn,who had examined deshazer many times previously,testified that deshazer was delusional and that this mental disease interfered with his ability to work with counsel.kahn testimony can be summarized as follows deshazer had been,and is at the present time,delusionally obsessed with the victim in that he believes she deliberately used him for the purpose of ruining his life.because of these delusions,deshazer is furious with the victim,and his sole intent is to avenge himself by making the truth about the victim be known.he thinks only the victim can deliver that truth by testifying at trial that he is a nice person and that she intentionally used him and tried to hurt him.this mindset is also the motivation for deshazer request to represent himself at trial.his counsel does not support that trial strategy,and deshazer feels only he can effectively the victim.
in contrast,pietz testified that deshazer was not delusional that his interest in the victim and his desire to put her on the stand to expose the truth was indicative of an personality disorder,rather than a mental illness and that he could assist in his own defense if he chose to do so.the district court ultimately found pietz testimony more persuasive and thus found deshazer competent to stand trial.
faretta hearing 
having determined that deshazer was competent to stand trial,the court held two hearings in september concerning his request to represent himself pursuant to faretta.the court repeatedly and vehemently urged deshazer that he should proceed with counsel.the court added that due to the overwhelming evidence against him,the only plausible defense was likely insanity,and that he needed counsel assistance to present that defense.the court additionally questioned the wisdom of deshazer professed trial strategy.the court warned him that he would likely anger the jury and suggested that even if the victim testified in the way that he hoped,such testimony would not acquit him.despite the district court repeated admonitions,deshazer unequivocally affirmed his desire to represent himself.after determining he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel,the court granted the motion to proceed pro se and appointed his counsel as standby counsel.the matter went to trial in november,and the jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts.the court sentenced deshazer to months imprisonment.
on appeal counsel for deshazer argues that the district court erroneously found him competent to stand trial he was not competent to waive his right to an attorney and represent himself and he was denied treatment during the pendency of his case,which he contends violates the principles set forth in jackson.
ii.discussion 
competency determination 
the constitution forbids the trial of a defendant who lacks mental competency.see indiana edwards,d.the test for competency to stand trial asks whether a defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.united states mackovich,cir quotations omitted see also drope missouri,d it has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him,to consult with counsel,and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.
we review the district court competency determination for clear error and will reverse only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.mackovich,at quotations omitted.when assessing a defendant competence,the district court may rely on a number of factors,including medical opinion and the court observation of the defendant comportment.id.quotation omitted.that a defendant suffers from some degree of mental illness or disorder does not necessarily mean that he is incompetent to assist in his own defense.id.at.
deshazer contends that the district court erred in finding him competent to stand trial for three reasons the finding was based on the court unsupported view that he was malingering the finding was based on an erroneous legal opinion by pietz and the court did not give sufficient weight to the requirement that a defendant have the ability to cooperate with his attorney and assist in his defense.
first,the district court competency order does not indicate that its determination was based,even in part,on its view that deshazer was purposefully manipulating the court system in an attempt to further delay a opinion that was not shared by any of the experts involved or even the government.while the district court judge certainly voiced his suspicions throughout the proceedings,he repeatedly stated that despite his personal views,the court determination must be based on evidence provided by appropriate professionals 
indeed,the court focused on the testimony presented by each side respective experts.during the august competency hearing,both kahn and pietz testified that deshazer could understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him.the principal disagreement was over whether he was able to assist in his defense.kahn opined that deshazer suffered from a delusional disorder that compromised his ability to assist counsel at trial.pietz concluded that deshazer did not suffer from a mental illness but rather from a personality disorder,and that despite this disorder,deshazer had the capacity to assist in his own defense if he chose to do so.the district court stated that it found pietz evaluation and opinion more persuasive,and expressly adopted her conclusion.specifically,the court found that deshazer had a rational and factual understanding of the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him,and that he is capable of cooperating and assisting in his defense.in short,the record belies deshazer assertion that the court relied on its suspicion that he was manipulating the system to support its competency determination.
deshazer also argues that the competency determination is clearly erroneous because it was,he contends,based on pietz legally erroneous view that a personality disorder is not a mental illness under the court,however,did not rely on pietz legal conclusion.pietz testified that a personality disorder,or axis ii illness,is not a mental illness for purposes of,which she said was clear in both the relevant literature and under kansas hendricks,d.the government agrees that hendricks does not stand for such a,that a mental illness must be diagnosable as an axis i illness for purposes of.indeed,hendricks did not even discuss.instead,it held that a mental problem does not necessarily have to be diagnosable as a mental illness in order to allow a state to involuntarily institutionalize a person.id.at.the case is inapposite,as it did not even address competency to stand trial.
in its competency order,the court did not reference pietz erroneous legal conclusion or hendricks.pietz also testified that the defendant could rationally assist in his defense and cooperate with his are the relevant considerations for a competency determination.whether or not deshazer could be diagnosed with an axis i or axis ii illness is irrelevant,and there is no indication the district court relied on such a diagnosis.
finally,deshazer contends that the district court gave little or no weight to the requirement that an accused be rationally and intelligently able to assist his counsel.to the contrary,the district court identified this requirement as the only genuine issue concerning his competency to stand trial.the district court simply chose to credit the testimony of pietz on this point,as it was entitled to do.see mackovich,at i t is not clearly erroneous for a district court to declare a defendant competent by adopting the findings of one expert and discounting the contrary findings of another.
waiver of right to counsel 
a defendant has a sixth amendment right to.see faretta california,d.because the right to counsel is also guaranteed by the sixth amendment,however,a defendant may waive the right to counsel and proceed at trial pro se only if the waiver is knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.maynard boone,cir.the validity of such a waiver thus contains two distinct inquiries.id.the court must first ensure that the defendant is competent to waive counsel.id.it must then determine that the waiver is knowing and voluntary.id.
the second prong of this the waiver is knowing and on the defendant understanding of the significance and consequences of his decision,as well as whether the decision was coerced.id.at.thus,we have said that i t is ideal when the trial judge conducts a thorough and comprehensive formal inquiry including topics such as the nature of the charges,the range of punishment,possible defenses,and a disclosure of risks involved in representing oneself pro se.united states turner,cir quotations omitted.in this case,there is no serious dispute that the district court repeated warnings and instructions were sufficient to inform deshazer of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding pro se.nor does deshazer maintain that his decision was made involuntarily.
deshazer instead contends that he was not competent to waive his right to counsel.in contrast to the analysis,we have held that the competency analysis focuses on the defendant ability to understand the proceedings,and that the standard is the same as the stan
