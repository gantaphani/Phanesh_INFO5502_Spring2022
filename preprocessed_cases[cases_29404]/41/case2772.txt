discrimination 
mcfadden claims ballard spahr and discriminated against her upon the basis of her race when the firm denied her request to be reassigned to the receptionist position and when it terminated her.we evaluate each allegation using the familiar framework established for title vii cases in mcdonnell douglas green.see howard green,mcdonnell douglas framework applies to cases alleging discrimination in violation of dchra metrocare.metro.area transit,applying mcdonnell douglas framework to claim of discrimination under.under this framework,
if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the defendant must come forward with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions i f the defendant meets its burden of production,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to persuade the fact finder that the defendant reason for its action is a mere pretext for discrimination and thus that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent.

in keeping with brady office of sergeant at arms,the district court did not pause to consider whether mcfadden had made out a prima facie case but instead went on directly to hold ballard spahr had provided a legitimate,reason for each of the challenged actions ballard spahr did not make mcfadden its receptionist because that position was occupied by hahn,who was on medical leave and it terminated mcfadden because she could no longer do her job owing to her medical condition.d.the district court then held mcfadden had not produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude the reasons offered by the firm were pretextual and granted summary judgment for the defendants.
mcfadden argues ballard spahr reason for refusing to give her the job of receptionist was a pretext because at that time,may,hahn had been on medical leave for several months and so had no legal entitlement to the position.that is not evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer the firm refusal to reassign mcfadden was racially motivated.the firm claimed not that hahn was legally entitled to the position at the time of mcfadden request for reassignment but rather that it was holding the position open for her return,a claim supported by its use of a temporary employee to fill in during hahn absence and until it became clear in august or september that hahn would not be returning.
mcfadden suggests the reason given by ballard spahr for her she was unable to perform the essential functions,of the legal secretary not itself a legitimate,reason because it is on its face,discriminatory on the basis of disability.there is nothing to this the ada does not prohibit an employer from terminating an employee who can not perform the essential functions of her position,albeit with a reasonable accommodation.see a prohibiting discrimination against a qualified individual defining qualified individual as one who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position.mcfadden in her brief acknowledges her medical condition rendered her unable to perform the essential functions of a legal secretary disabled and no longer able to type,mcfadden became unable to continue working as a legal secretary.that is precisely the reason given by ballard spahr for terminating her.
mcfadden also argues the rationale for ballard spahr decision to terminate her was a pretext because several caucasian support staff received accommodations not offered to mcfadden.the district court found none of these employees was similarly situated to mcfadden because each had a different supervisor and none was unable to perform her job due to a permanent medical condition.d at.the latter point is dispositive.that ballard spahr gave another employee time off in order to recover from a stroke,receive treatment for cancer,travel,or care for a newborn,does not provide the slightest reason to doubt ballard spahr claim to have terminated mcfadden because,as a result of her medical conditions,she was permanently unable to work as either a legal secretary or a typist.see royall ass of letter carriers,allegation other employees were treated more favorably could not establish pretext where plaintiff had not shown all of the relevant aspects of his employment were nearly identical internal quotation marks omitted.
in sum,the district court correctly held mcfadden produced insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to hold pretextual ballard spahr proffered reasons for not reassigning her and for terminating her.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to mcfadden claim of discrimination upon the basis of race.
reasonable accommodation 
the ada prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual with a disability who,with reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the job,airways,barnett,quoting a b,and the dchra is to like effect,see whitbleck vital signs.mcfadden claims ballard spahr violated the ada and the dchra by refusing to reassign her to the receptionist position when she could no longer work as a legal secretary.
the district court held reassignment of mcfadden to the receptionist position was not a reasonable accommodation for two reasons.first,although the ada provides reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position,the receptionist position was not vacant when mcfadden requested reassignment.second,mcfadden could not perform the essential functions of the receptionist position because those functions included punctuality and reliability and
