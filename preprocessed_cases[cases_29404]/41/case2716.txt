this appeal concerns an evidentiary privilege known as the medical peer review privilege.the privilege seeks to protect from discovery and disclosure records containing performance reviews and assessments of physicians by their peers,primarily in connection with their practices at hospitals.the issue before us is whether to recognize the privilege in federal civil rights cases.the fourth and seventh circuits have denied the privilege in these cases.we join them in declining to recognize a privilege for documents relating to medical peer review proceedings in federal discrimination cases.
we also conclude in this opinion that the district court improperly limited the scope of discovery and,as a result,prematurely granted defendants motion for summary judgment.
background 
these issues arose in russell adkins federal civil rights action,filed pursuant to,and.in his complaint,adkins,an staff physician with privileges at the houston medical center hmc,asserted that hmc and several hmc physicians collectively defendants discriminated against him on racial grounds in their implementation and utilization of hmc peer review and physician disciplinary process.in conformity with medical staff bylaws,adkins was provisionally admitted to practice at hmc in for a minimum of one year.adkins contends that during this first year,the head of the department of surgery,deighton,unilaterally chose to review all of adkins medical charts,an unusually high level of review for new physicians.none of adkins cases during his first year were found to warrant further investigation by a peer review committee.nevertheless,hmc extended his provisional status by six months on the grounds that he allegedly failed to follow protocols for of surgical patients,failed to complete medical records in a timely manner and had problems with availability for call.adkins concedes that he failed to complete medical charts within the time frame dictated by hmc medical on eight different occasions during that time.however,he argues that such delays were a problem and that deighton himself acknowledged having received warning letters for failure to complete his charts in a timely manner.
adkins further claims that in,and again in,hmc imposed additional conditions on his continued employment even though he had a good record as a physician.finally,adkins claims that hmc deliberately mishandled the care of one of his patients,and later used that case as a pretext to take action against him.specifically,he alleges that nurses falsified reports related to condition,refused to contact him about her care,and contravened his orders relating to her care,resulting in her pain and discomfort.he claims that the staff at hmc incorrectly informed that he was out of town,and deliberately withheld information about her status from him,which ensured that he was unavailable to assist her.he argues that hmc then used case as grounds to begin peer review of his practices,and unfairly determined that he was unavailable to assist,meting out the disproportionately harsh penalties of suspension and subsequently,termination against him.
defendants dispute this characterization of adkins practice at the hospital.they allege that adkins repeatedly experienced problems with availability for call,timely completion of medical records and failure to follow hospital protocol on patient admissions.defendants further allege that in,adkins grossly mishandled a surgical operation on a infant by operating on him without proper surgical equipment,thus raising additional questions about his professional judgment.finally,defendants allege that peer review of adkins treatment of was automatically required by hospital procedure that mandated review of all patient cases involving repeat surgeries.they claim that external peer review determined that adkins availability and level of care was inadequate,and that in light of his record,suspension was an appropriate measure to protect the health and safety of patients at the hospital.
in may,defendants sought dismissal of adkins complaint for failure to state a claim on qualified immunity grounds.the district court converted this motion into one for summary judgment and initially allowed discovery on issues relating to qualified immunity only.during discovery,adkins requested documents relating to peer review of all physicians at the hospital during the seven years that adkins was a member of the hospital staff.in response,defendants filed a motion for a protective order,arguing that adkins was seeking information relating to the peer review process,which was covered by the georgia medical peer review privilege although the court concluded that the privilege applied to federal civil rights actions,it nevertheless ordered defendants to provide adkins with descriptions of all incidents giving rise to peer review,without disclosing the documents themselves.the court limited production to peer review documents covering physicians it deemed similarly situated to adkins,namely physicians in the department of surgery during a time period,rather than documents relating to all physicians with staff privileges at hmc during the time period requested by adkins.
in response to defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court undertook review of the disclosed peer review files.the court also reviewed a list identifying the race of the physicians at hmc that were suspended in the last five years.following this review,the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.adkins now appeals the judgment,contending that the court improperly recognized the privilege,and improperly limited the scope of his discovery request.
the medical peer review privilege 
adkins argues that the district court incorrectly ruled that federal law allows for a medical peer review privilege in discrimination cases.the decision to recognize a privilege is a mixed question of law and fact,which we review de novo.carman mcdonnell douglas,cir.while all fifty states and the district of columbia recognize such a privilege,the eleventh circuit has not yet definitively ruled on whether it applies in federal court,and as we previously stated,the fourth and seventh circuits have failed to recognize the privilege.see virmani novant health,cir mem l hosp.shadur,cir per curiam.
evidentiary privileges in the federal courts are governed by,which provides 
except as otherwise required by the constitution as provided by act of congress,or in rules prescribed by the supreme court,the privilege of a witness shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience.
the federal rules of evidence empower the federal courts to continue the evolutionary development of evidentiary privileges.trammel united states,d.however,these privileges remain disfavored and should not be lightly created.united states nixon,d.the supreme court has cautioned that privileges contravene the fundamental principle that the public has a right to every man evidence.of eeoc,d alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,there is a presumption against privileges which may only be overcome when it would achieve a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.trammel,at.at.this is a high standard,and only the most compelling candidates will overcome the law weighty dependence on the availability of relevant evidence.pearson miller,cir.
the supreme court decision in jaffee redmond,d,provides us with useful guidance on how to determine whether an evidentiary privilege should be created.in jaffee,the supreme court identified some factors as relevant to the inquiry including the needs of the public good whether the privilege is rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust the evidentiary benefit of the denial of the privilege and consensus among the states.at.at.in deciding whether to recognize a privilege,we must consider that there is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of giving,and that any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exception
