brian colburn was terminated from his job as a machine operator at the nichols portland division of the parker hannifin corporation nichols.colburn sued,alleging primarily that his employer,nichols,fired him in retaliation for his having taken leave protected under the family and medical leave act of fmla,and the similar maine statute.ann.tit.in turn,nichols responded that it had discharged colburn because he told the company he was out sick with a migraine when he was seen going to the gym,shopping,and driving around doing errands.
we affirm summary judgment in favor of the defendant on different grounds than those used by the district court and the magistrate judge.in doing so,we reject certain reasoning urged on those courts by the defendant.we hold that a claim for retaliatory discharge from employment is not extinguished by a finding that the plaintiff was unable to return to work at the expiration of his period of fmla leave.nonetheless,we hold that no reasonable jury could conclude that this particular plaintiff was fired in retaliation for his exercise of fmla rights.
we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,who opposed the entry of summary judgment.crete city of lowell,cir.in january,nichols hired plaintiff colburn as a utility worker.during the next four years,colburn was promoted four times he eventually held the position of machine operator i,with responsibility for troubleshooting machines,as well as for some training of other machine operators.
on october,during his lunch break at work,colburn experienced what would turn out to be the first of many intensely painful migraines.although he had suffered from headaches in the past,the new wave of migraines was more severe and often accompanied by shooting pain,blurry vision,dizziness,or nausea.from october to,colburn went on a prescheduled hunting vacation.when he returned to work on october,he experienced a migraine a half hour into his shift at nichols and had to leave work.from then on,he began to take intermittent sick leave on account of his migraines he missed days work between october and january.
in autumn of,colburn filed with nichols an application for disability benefits.in that application,dated november,he stated that he was unable to perform a ll activities when an attack occurs,including driving.the application was never finalized.on at least three occasions in december,shannon craig,a human resources representative,requested from colburn medical information that the company needed to substantiate his need for medical leave and to determine his eligibility for disability benefits.according to craig record of their conversations,colburn repeatedly promised to submit the paperwork,but failed actually to do so.colburn concedes that he did not submit any of the requested medical documents to the company.he now argues that at the time he filed the application,he had signed an authorization to release medical information that gave nichols access to all of his medical records accordingly,the onus was on nichols to secure the necessary medical documents.at his deposition,however,he never testified that he had told craig that she should get the medical records herself using his authorization.
colburn asserted in his affidavit that while he was on leave,he frequently provided complete updates to his employer about his health.he testified at his deposition that when he spoke with randy purinton,his immediate supervisor,purinton never put pressure on him to return to work or subjected him to criticism or discipline.in december,however,colburn spoke with christine fox,a human resources administrator at nichols,about his medical condition.colburn stated in his affidavit that fox used a hostile tone and made him feel like he was doing something wrong for making a medical claim.
on january,nichols retained a private investigator to conduct surveillance of colburn.nichols states that it initiated the investigation because it became suspicious of colburn for two reasons first,colburn failed to submit the medical information the company needed to process his disability application,despite three requests by human resources personnel,and second,he could not be reached at home on days when he had called in sick.
the investigator began surveillance of colburn on january and colburn reported for work on both days.on january and,colburn was scheduled to work the to shift.sometime around on january,colburn called his supervisor to say that he had a severe headache and would not be able to come into work until later in the afternoon.around,the investigator followed colburn as he drove from his home to a gym.thirty minutes after entering the gym attired in workout clothes,colburn departed in jeans and a shirt.colburn then drove to a video store,where he rented a video,and then to three variety stores.he emerged at from the third store with a paper bag containing what appeared to be two bottles.around the same time,he left a voicemail for his supervisor apprising him that his migraine had returned and that he would not be coming into work at all that day.at that point,the investigator lost sight of colburn in heavy traffic.the investigator returned to colburn residence at and,upon seeing that colburn was in his garage,apparently gathering items from his car and preparing to go inside the house,discontinued surveillance for the day.
upon resuming surveillance on january,the investigator observed colburn departing from his home at.the investigator tracked colburn as he drove to multiple locations he went into his gym for about thirty minutes,rented videos from two video stores,and stopped at a bank.colburn also visited two shopping areas,where he seemed to have been searching for a payphone.around,colburn left a voicemail for his supervisor indicating that he was ill and would not be able to work that day.after making that phone call,colburn stopped at a variety store there,he purchased a of beer and some pretzels.he did not return home until after,at which point the investigator discontinued surveillance.
on january,jan stanley,nichols human resources manager,received from the investigator a report detailing his observations during the course of his surveillance of colburn.later that day,company officials steve oliver and harold sexton,along with randy purinton,met with colburn and informed him that he was being discharged.colburn testified at his deposition that his understanding after that meeting was that they had terminated him in part because he had been observed at the gym at the same time he had called in sick.stanley confirmed in deposition testimony that colburn had been fired because his actions on january and were inconsistent with those of someone experiencing an incapacitating migraine.she also testified that nichols has a positive progressive discipline policy,under which employees usually receive some notice of,and opportunity to address,the employer disciplinary concerns.however,under that policy,serious misconduct can result in immediate dismissal of the employee.
both parties agree that at the time he was fired,colburn had not exhausted the full leave period to which he was entitled under the fmla.see a,b.in key testimony,he admitted at his deposition that he was unable to return to work due to his medical condition until,well past the expiration date of his fmla leave.stanley testified that colburn was on unpaid leave at the time of his termination.
colburn said at his deposition that he had no recollection of whether he had called in sick on january and.nor did he recall what he did those days if he had called in sick.he later acknowledged that he did,in fact,engage in the activities depicted in the surveillance tape.he argued,however,that the activities documented in the video were not inconsistent with his having a migraine which prevented him from working he suggested that he was most likely experiencing the onset or aftermath of a migraine,which did not prevent him from functioning at the minimal levels shown on the video.
colburn filed suit on january,in federal district court against nichols,alleging violations of the fmla,and the similar maine statute.ann.tit,he made two fmla claims.first,he alleged that nichols interfered with his substantive rights under the fmla by failing to restore him to his position following the termination of his fmla leave,in violation of.second,he alleged that nichols fired him in retaliation for his taking medical leave,in violation of.
after the close of discovery,nichols filed on august,a motion for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint.on october,a magistrate judge filed a recommended decision granting nichols summary judgment motion.after oral argument,the district court,on de novo review,issued an order on january,that adopted the magistrate judge recommendation to grant defendant summary judgment motion as to all counts of the complaint and to strike certain sections of colburn summary judgment affidavit.colburn appeals both of these rulings.
review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo,rodriguez am.int l ins,cir,and we may affirm the district court decision on any sufficient ground supported by the record,carcieri norton,cir.
our review of this otherwise straightforward case has been complicated by some analytic confusion,largely caused by the defendant.we clarify the law and affirm summary judgment on the basis that there is insufficient evidence for a rational factfinder to conclude that nichols interfered with colburn substantive rights under the fmla or that it terminated him in retaliation for his taking medical leave.
fmla standards 
the fmla contains two distinct types of provisions those establishing substantive rights and those providing protection for the exercise of those rights.see hodgens general dynamics,cir.the first,which we have described as essentially prescriptive,set s substantive floors for conduct by employers,and creat es entitlements for employees.id.at quoting diaz fort wayne foundry,cir.such provisions,codified at,entitle eligible employees to,inter alia,a total of workweeks of leave,which may be taken intermittently when medically necessary,for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his position.a d,b.with limited exceptions,see b,upon the employee return from a qualified leave,the employer must reinstate the employee to the same position or an alternate position with equivalent pay,benefits,and working conditions,and without loss of accrued seniority.hodgens,at citing a and c see also hillstrom best tlc hotel,cir.
in addition to the grant of substantive rights,the statute sets forth a list of prohibited acts at 
a interference with rights 
exercise of rights 
it shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under this subchapter.
discrimination 
it shall be unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter.
b interference with proceedings or inquiries 
it shall be unlawful for any person to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual because such individual 
has filed any charge,or has instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding,under or related to this subchapter 
has given,or is about to give,any information in connection with any inquiry or proceeding relating to any right provided under this subchapter or 
has testified,or is about to testify,in any inquiry or proceeding relating to any right provided under this subchapter.
the statute prohibits,then,both interference and discrimination.notably,however,there is no clear demarcation in between what is interference and what is discrimination,and the terms overlap in some situations.see,conoshenti pub.serv.gas,cir bachelder am.airlines,cir.employers found to be in violation of are subject to a claim for,inter alia,equitable relief and compensatory damages,including wages,salary,and benefits.
claims for violations of substantive rights are brought under a,which prohibits actions by any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of such rights.see,harrell postal,cir see also lareau et,labor and employment law.to meet his or her burden in an interference with substantive rights claim,a plaintiff need only show,by a preponderance of the evidence,entitlement to the disputed leave no showing as to employer intent is required.see smith diffee,cir king preferred technical group,cir.
in addition to a claim alleging the deprivation of substantive rights,an employee may also bring suit against an employer under a retaliation theory.although the text of a makes no reference to retaliation,this court has recognized such a cause of action in the statute and specifically the interpretative regulation c hodgens,at cir citing a,and c see also keeler putnam fiduciary trust,cir.
the regulation c provides 
an employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees or prospective employees who have used fmla leave.for example,if an employee on leave without pay would otherwise be entitled to full benefits other than health benefits,the same benefits would be required to be provided to an employee on unpaid fmla leave.by the same token,employers can not use the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions,such as hiring,promotions or disciplinary actions nor can fmla leave be counted under no fault attendance policies.
this regulation unambiguously interprets as prohibiting retaliation.however,it does not make any distinction among a,a,or b as the source of the prohibition.this statutory and regulatory ambiguity has led to some differences in view.
specifically,courts have disagreed about whether interference refers to a category of claims separate and distinct from those involving retaliation,or whether it describes a group of unlawful actions,of which retaliation is a part.see bachelder,at.the term interference may,depending on the facts,cover both retaliation claims,see hodgens,at,and claims,see conoshenti,at.the distinction would matter if the standards of proof used turned on which statutory section were pled,rather than on the nature of the facts and the theory of the case.yet,whether a claim is characterized as interference or not,its elements actually differ depending on whether the plaintiff is,at bottom,claiming that the employer denied his or her substantive rights under the fmla or that the employer retaliated against him or her for having exercised or attempted to exercise those rights.bachelder,at characterizing a claim under c as an interference claim,where plaintiff did not allege that the employer terminated her in retaliation for taking fmla leave,but rather that the employer used her taking fmla leave as a negative factor in its decision to terminate her.
for example,this circuit approach to an fmla claim of retaliation is to permit proof directly or by inference,with the ultimate burden of proof remaining on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer adverse employment action was in retaliation for exercise of protected rights.see hodgens,at.in contrast,employer motive plays no role in a claim for substantive denial of benefits.see id.at richey,manual on employment discrimination law and civil rights actions ed citing diaz,at.
in the present case,both the magistrate judge and district court concluded that plaintiff could not have made out a persuasive case under either the denial of substantive theory or the retaliation theory.their conclusion was the only outcome warranted by the record.
denial of substantive claim 
the two courts noted that colburn,by his own admission,would not have been able to return to work until april,well after the expiration of his fmla leave because the department of labor regulations interpreting the fmla state that an employee has no right to reinstatement i f the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of the continuation of a serious health condition,the courts concluded that colburn interference with substantive rights claim fails because nichols was under no obligation to reinstate him.b see also a,b,a.that conclusion is plainly correct,and the substantive rights interference claim was properly dismissed.
retaliation claim 
rejection of defendant theory of analysis 
before the district court,the defendant argued that if an fmla plaintiff can not return to work prior to the exhaustion of his fmla leave,then ipso facto his retaliation claim fails it propounds the same theory on appeal.defendant theory mischaracterizes the law,and we reject it.
defendant grounds its argument in the text of two regulations,b and d.neither supports its theory.the first provision deals with an employee rights on returning to work from fmla leave it sets a limit on the right to reinstatement set out in a.as such,it circumscribes only colburn ability to bring an interference claim.the second provision deals only with an employee who has taken workers compensation leave concurrently with fmla leave.nothing in the record shows that colburn was on workers compensation leave at any point during october to april,and thus the provision is irrelevant to colburn claim.
our law is clear that an fmla plaintiff may pursue a retaliation claim even if there is no claim of violation of substantive rights to leave.see hodgens,at describing the independent causes of action under the substantive and proscriptive provisions of the fmla accord hunt rapides healthcare,llc,cir the fmla provides two distinct causes of action,to which courts apply different analyses.further,the failure of a substantive claim of denial of leave does not foreclose a retaliation claim.see hunt,at noting that a plaintiff need not establish a violation of the substantive,prescriptive provisions of the fmla to allege a violation of the proscriptive provisions.
nichols also proposes that even if the failure of colburn substantive claim does not automatically extinguish his retaliation claim,then the latter still fails because colburn incurred no damages.this theory is also wrong.that a plaintiff can not make out a case for damages for a substantive rights infringement claim does not mean no cause of action for retaliation can be stated.
a sets out the remedies for violations of 
any employer who violates section of this title shall be liable to any eligible employee affected 
a for damages equal to 
i the amount of 
i any wages,salary,employment benefits,or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation or 
ii in a case in which wages,salary,employment benefits,or other compensation have not been denied or lost to the employee,any actual monetary losses sustained by the employee as a direct result of the violation,such as the cost of providing care,up to a sum equal to weeks of wages or salary for the employee 
ii the interest on the amount described in clause i calculated at the prevailing rate and 
iii an additional amount as liquidated damages equal to the sum of the amount described in clause i and the interest described in clause ii,except that if an employer who has violated section of this title proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission which violated section of this title was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of section of this title,such court may,in the discretion of the court,reduce the amount of the liability to the amount and interest determined under clauses i and ii,respectively and 
b for such equitable relief as may be appropriate,including employment,reinstatement,and promotion.
fees and costs 
the court in such an action shall,in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff,allow a reasonable attorney fee,reasonable expert witness fees,and other costs of the action to be paid by the defendant.
as to his claim of interference with his substantive rights under the fmla,colburn was not entitled to any remedy because he admitted he could not return to work at the expiration of the leave.but that did not mean there was no actionable harm under a retaliation theory.in some situations,a successful retaliation claim will lead to independent damages.
colburn termination occurred on january.he admitted that he would not have been able to return to work until after his period of leave expired,and he thus would not have been entitled to reinstatement under.accordingly,with regard to his retaliation claim,he would not have been entitled to any compensation or benefits after the date he exhausted his fmla leave.in theory,he nonetheless could have had a loss of salary in the period between the date of the alleged wrongful termination and the date his leave expired.yet,because his leave was an unpaid leave,he had no lost income.also theoretically,colburn could have suffered damages in the form of lost value of employment benefits say,health and dental insurance in the period between his termination and the expiration of the unpaid leave.see defining employment benefits.but he proffered no evidence showing that the alleged retaliatory firing resulted in such losses 
damages,however,are not the only remedy available under the fmla.the fmla also provides for equitable relief,including reinstatement,see id.a b thus,a hypothetical plaintiff who proved retaliation could be reinstated once he or she is able to perform all essential functions of the position,see a an employee has no greater right to reinstatement than if the employee had been continuously employed during the fmla leave period,even if he or she had no monetary damages.indeed,counsel for colburn made this very argument.
further,the statute provides,in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff,for reasonable attorney fee,reasonable expert witness fees,and other costs of the action to be paid by the defendant.a.thus,had colburn proven his claim of retaliation and established entitlement to some form of equitable relief,he could have been awarded attorney fees and costs.
the fact that colburn could not have returned to work before the expiration of his leave and thus can not make out a claim for interference with his substantive rights does not necessarily preclude a retaliation claim 
proper analysis of the retaliation claim 
the crux of colburn complaint is that nichols terminated him not because of any inappropriate behavior on his part,but in retaliation for his having taken protected medical leave.colburn thus must show a causal link between his termination and retaliatory animus on the part of the employer.
in a retaliation case,there are varying approaches to showing intent.our circuit has long held that where,as here,a plaintiff did not show direct evidence of retaliation he or she could use the inferential model of showing intent under a modified version of the framework established in mcdonnell douglas green,d see hodgens,at.with perhaps the exception of the ninth circuit all other circuits have decided to use the same framework.see,potenza city of new york,cir lepore lanvision,cir unpublished decision nichols ashland hosp,cir chaffin john carter,cir skrjanc great lakes power serv,cir king,at smith allen health,cir morgan hilti,cir strickland water works sewer,cir gleklen democratic cong.campaign.
as hodgens states 
under that framework,a plaintiff employee must carry the initial burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.if he does so,then the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee termination,sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the employee if the employer evidence creates a genuine issue of fact,the presumption of discrimination drops from the case,and the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of showing that the employer stated reason for terminating him was in fact a pretext for retaliating against him for having taken protected fmla leave.
at alteration in original citations omitted quoting mcdonnell douglas,at.
although we are doubtful colburn even makes out a prima facie case we turn to the issue of pretext.nichols says that it fired colburn because of its belief that he had falsified his reasons for being absent from work and that falsehood wa
