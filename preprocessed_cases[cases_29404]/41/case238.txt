this antitrust case requires us to examine the structure and operation of delivery in an era marked by a bewildering array of insurer and provider arrangements.the plaintiffs,appellants here,represent the interests of podiatrists in puerto rico.they sued la cruz azul de puerto rico blue cross and,in the federal district court complaining,inter alia,that the defendants had conspired with medical doctors to exclude podiatric care from their standard benefits packages during the period from to.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had offered insufficient evidence that physicians controlled the plans policymaking functions with respect to either insurance benefits or reimbursement rates and,therefore,had offered insufficient evidence of concerted action.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in the defendants favor.relatedly,the court dismissed a lanham act claim against blue cross.the plaintiffs appeal from these determinations.we affirm.
background 
except for the lanham act count as to which the allegations of the amended complaint control,we glean the relevant facts from the summary judgment record.we draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.smith,cir.our recital begins with a roster of the protagonists,proceeds to detail the plaintiffs claims and the facts upon which they rely,and then summarizes the district court main holdings.
a.the protagonists.
the plaintiffs include the podiatrist association a trade association,a number of practicing podiatrists,their spouses,and their conjugal partnerships.inasmuch as the podiatrists are the real parties in interest,we shall discuss the matters sub judice as if they were the sole plaintiffs.
podiatrists are licensed providers in puerto rico as elsewhere.they afford medical care to the foot and lower extremities.podiatrists attend schools of podiatric medicine.those who successfully complete the curriculum are awarded degrees and become doctors of podiatric medicine.once admitted to practice,podiatrists provide services that are similar to those offered by some medical doctors,so that the two groups compete against each other for certain patients.one court has suggested that podiatrists can furnish comparable services at lower costs.see hahn or.physicians,cir.along this line,the plaintiffs amended complaint alleges,albeit without supporting evidence,that podiatrists offer services that are not only of equal or better quality than those provided by medical doctors but also generally less expensive.
the defendants are puerto rico two major providers of insurance they do not contest the plaintiffs allegation that enjoys roughly of puerto rico health insurance market and blue cross enjoys roughly of that market.
is a corporation.from forward,its board of directors has been composed of nineteen members,eight of whom are medical doctors.the other members include a dentist,hospital officials,and community representatives.the board has complete control over corporate policymaking,and all changes in the benefits packages and reimbursement rates established by are subject to board approval.the executive committee,which exercises responsibility over corporate policies between board meetings,consists of seven board members.since,three of those president,and been medical doctors.the medical director,who reports to the board,is required by the corporation bylaws to have an degree.
blue cross has a more complicated corporate history.before,it functioned as a corporation.its board members included seven medical doctors,seven hospital executives,and fourteen subscriber representatives.blue cross became a corporation in.upon its conversion to status,blue cross established a fourteen member board of directors.all the members represented subscribers none of them were medical doctors.in november of that year,independence holdings,a subsidiary of independence blue cross,acquired a majority of its shares.at that time,the board was pared to seven members none of whom are medical doctors.
when it functioned as a,blue cross had a fees and contracts committee that was responsible for proposing and evaluating benefits packages and reimbursement policies.the committee consisted of eight members two medical doctors,two hospital executives,and four subscriber representatives.blue cross also maintained a medical advisory committee composed of three medical doctors all of whom doubled in brass as board members.despite the existence of these committees,all major decisions concerning benefits and reimbursement rates remained subject to the board approval.
b.the plaintiffs allegations.
the plaintiffs amended complaint mounts two kinds of claims.the first set,involving alleged antitrust violations,are rooted in section of the sherman act,and a parallel provision,laws ann.in a related vein,the plaintiffs charged both defendants with having engaged in unfair business practices in violation of section a of the lanham act,a,and article of the civil code,laws ann.
the plaintiffs antitrust claims start with the premise that the defendants have favored medical doctors by excluding podiatrists,podiatric care,and ancillary services essential to podiatric care from their basic health insurance coverages that even when podiatric care is covered,the defendants reimburse podiatrists at lower rates than those paid to medical doctors for comparable services and that many patients who are in need of foot care turn to medical doctors rather than podiatrists.the plaintiffs further aver that this favoritism is no accident in their view,the defendants and the internal decisionmaking processes used to formulate their benefits packages have been dominated by medical doctors,so that the discrimination that permeates the plans activities is the outgrowth of a conspiracy that has placed anticompetitive restraints on trade.these restraints operate,the plaintiffs say,to increase prices diverting patients to more expensive treatment,treatment by medical doctors,decrease output driving some patients to forgo podiatric care altogether,and curtail podiatrists earnings.
in support of these antitrust claims,the plaintiffs point to the following evidence.first,they remark that physicians have served on the defendants boards of directors and have occupied key decisionmaking positions within the defendants organizational structures.in contrast,no podiatrist has ever participated in either defendant governance apparatus.second,the plaintiffs identify specific meetings in which the defendants exclusionary benefits policies were discussed and approved.they assert that those meetings were dominated by physicians.
the second type of claim mounted by the plaintiffs accuses the defendants of making false representations regarding the quality of podiatric care.in this regard,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants spread misinformation to subscribers regarding the competency of podiatrists,the relative professionalism of podiatrists medical doctors,and the limited availability of reimbursement for podiatric care.the plaintiffs claim that these disparaging comments caused them both economic loss and reputational damage.
the current dispute is emblematic of the nationwide conflict between physicians and other participants in the market.see,flegel christian,cir bhan nme,cir.acad.of clinical psychologists blue shield,cir.podiatrists have long been part of this conflict.in the past,they have accused physicians of employing anticompetitive means to place hospital staff privileges beyond their reach,cooper forsyth county hosp,cir,battled with boards to determine what podiatric services qualify for medicare reimbursement.state med.soc y.bd.of exam rs in podiatry,and fought against perceived conspiracies to exclude podiatric care from insurance coverage,hahn,at.consequently,we are able to view the current hostilities through the prism of a significant body of case law.
travel of the case.
the plaintiffs sued on december,and filed an amended complaint on march.shortly thereafter,blue cross moved for summary judgment with respect to the antitrust claims and for dismissal of the remaining claims.the district court permitted the plaintiffs to undertake discovery on the issues raised in the summary judgment motion.while those motions were pending,moved for summary judgment on all claims asserted against it.the parties appear to have assumed that discovery could go forward on the issues framed by this motion.
on september,the district court,in two parallel opinions,granted substantially all the relief requested by the defendants.see podiatrist ass n,cruz azul de,unpublished podiatrist ass n,unpublished.in each instance,the court focused its antitrust analysis on the issue of whether physicians controlled the particular defendant benefits policies and concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to show such control.the court also granted summary judgment for on the lanham act count.as to blue cross,the court determined that the plaintiffs had failed to state an actionable lanham act claim and granted that defendant motion to dismiss.moreover,the court determined that issue had not properly been joined on certain claims against,see infra part ii c,and left those claims for later resolution.
having disposed of most of the causes of action asserted under federal law,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims asserted under article of the civil code.those claims were dismissed without prejudice.see c see also martinez colon,cir upholding dismissal without prejudice of pendent claims when the district court determined far in advance of trial that no legitimate federal question existed.after the plaintiffs dropped the residuum of potential federal claims against a matter to which we shall return,this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiffs hawk several assignments of error.first,they challenge the district court resolution of the physician control issue.second,they maintain that the lower court evaluated only one of a myriad of antitrust theories set forth in their amended complaint.finally,they contend that the court improperly granted blue cross motion to dismiss the lanham act claim.we first confront the arguments relating to the antitrust claims and then discuss the district court disposition of the lanham act claim 
a.the principal antitrust claim.
section of the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.that language establishes two prerequisites for a section claim.first,the plaintiff must show concerted action between two or more separate parties.monsanto serv,d.second,the plaintiff must show that such action unreasonably restrains trade.nynex discon,d.the district court restricted its analysis to the first of these prerequisites,finding insufficient evidence to support the plaintiffs allegation that the defendants benefits policies were born out of concerted action.we test this conclusion against the summary judgment standard.
the standard of review.the role of summary judgment is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.garside osco drug,cir quoting.advisory committee note.thus,summary judgment is appropriate as long as the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
we afford plenary review to orders granting or denying summary judgment.garside,at.like the district court,we must view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment,indulging all reasonable inferences in that party favor,at.despite this favorable presumption,the evidence relied upon by the party opposing summary judgment must suffice to show a genuine issue of material fact,that is,a bona fide dispute about a fact that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case under the applicable law.united states v.one parcel of real prop.great harbor neck,new shoreham,cir.
to be sure,the supreme court has cautioned that,in antitrust cases,dismissals prior to giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very sparingly.hosp.trustees of rex,d discussing poller columbia broad,d.this does not mean,however,that summary judgment is unavailable in antitrust cases.see first bank cities serv,d see also texaco,medina,cir noting that the courts,including the supreme court,now more freely approve the use of summary judgment in such cases.more to the point,the doctrine has no force in cases in which the plaintiff has been afforded sufficient opportunity for discovery.see,matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.this is such a case.
sufficiency of the evidence.against this backdrop,we turn to the plaintiffs basic allegation that the evidence supports a finding of an anticompetitive conspiracy between and among those physicians who served on the defendants boards and the defendants themselves.this allegation does not get them very far,for the supreme court has largely dismissed the possibility of an intraenterprise conspiracy as a basis for liability under section of the sherman act.see copperweld independence tube,d see also vii phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed describing as universally accepted the proposition that a corporate officer can not conspire with his own corporation.in other words,agreements between two or more actors who operate within and for the benefit of a single economic enterprise do not satisfy the concerted action requirement of section.copperweld,at.
that does not end our inquiry,for the copperweld court intended to exempt conduct from the rigors of section only when the actors,collectively,pursue the common interests of the whole rather than interests separate from those of the corporation itself.id.at.a different analysis is required when the alleged coconspirators,regardless of their status,pursue interests that diverge from those of the enterprise itself.sullivan football league,cir vii areeda hovenkamp,supra.this nuance does not help the plaintiffs in this case because they have not submitted any evidence suggesting that physicians on either board have their own agendas or harbor private economic interests distinct from those of the corporations themselves.inasmuch as nothing in the record lends support to a conclusion that those physicians acted as independent,economic agents,the plaintiffs have not articulated a claim that involves anything more than activity occurring within a single enterprise.as we have said,such a claim falls within the sphere of copperweld preclusion and,accordingly,fails to articulate a viable antitrust claim.
in a variation on this theme,the plaintiffs argue that physicians controlled the defendants and their benefits policies,so that each defendant was little more than a corporate carapace housing a conspiracy among physicians.according to this argument,the defendants benefits policies were products of the antecedent conspiracy.
this argument focuses our attention on the issue of physician control.after all,when competing providers challenge an insurer benefits policies,alleging exclusionary practices instigated by physicians,those providers must make a threshold showing that the physicians effectively control the plan.hahn,at.dental ass med.serv.ass n,cir.acad.of clinical psychologists,at.this is as it should be,for a health insurer actions can reflect an agreement in restraint of trade among physicians only if,and to the extent that,the insurer is an instrumentality of the physicians concerted action.see vii areeda hovenkamp,supra.
the district court characterized the inquiry as one involving whether the physicians operated a structural conspiracy within the defendants corporate skeletons.it examined the makeup of the defendants boards and the identity of key decisionmakers.based on this appraisal,the court ruled that the record did not contain evidence adequate to establish that physicians either dictated the defendants benefits policies or otherwise exercised the requisite degree of control.the plaintiffs challenge this assessment.
the inquiry into whether an organization represents,or is a reflection of,the concerted action of conspiring economic actors is a functional one.see united states sealy,d w e look at substance rather than form and we are moved by the identity of the persons who act,rather than the label of their hats.thus,the preferred the one that we to examine the composition of a corporation board to determine whether a particular group has exercised or has the ability to exercise majority control.see,hahn,at.dental ass n,at.acad.of clinical psychologists,at.
regarding,the plaintiffs managed to establish nothing more than that physicians held eight of the nineteen seats on the board.that is a minority plainly not enough to show control.the corporate bylaws make manifest that board action requires a majority vote,and the physicians simply do not constitute a majority.nor can they achieve control under the extant circumstances the bylaws specify that at least ten of the nineteen board members must at all times be.
the plaintiffs fallback position covers a great deal of ground.they asseverate that physicians have enough representation on the board to influence board decisions that physicians play important roles when formulates its restrictive benefits policies that many key executives of,including the board chair and medical director,are physicians and that physicians occupy three of seven seats on the executive committee.this is a mixture of unsupported conclusions and marginally relevant but ultimately unconvincing facts.
the first two statements are argumentative.the mere fact that physicians have some input into decisionmaking processes does not show control.see,barry blue cross,cir.dental ass n,at.without hard proof that physician input metamorphosed into physician the summary judgment record contains exhortations do not advance the plaintiffs cause.
the second two statements are factual,but not probative.it is true that certain of ranking executives are medical doctors and that three of them serve on its executive committee.but such facts,without more,prove very little.see.dental ass n,at discounting the influence of physicians serving on certain committees when corporate bylaws vested ultimate control in the board see also barry,at employing the same reasoning when company rules placed ultimate control elsewhere.
here,there is no more.the plaintiffs have wholly failed to show how the placement of these individuals translates into control.equally as important,they have not shown how their placement suffices to overcome the significance and role of the board.the corporate bylaws state unambiguously that all business decisions and policy changes are subject to board approval,and nothing in the record suggests that the board relinquished this authority.absent some probative evidence that board approval was a rubber ingredient that is lacking antitrust claim against can not stand.
the plaintiffs likewise have failed to adduce sufficient evidence to suggest that blue cross is under physician control.the record shows that,during the period from to,physicians constituted a distinct minority of the board holding seven out of seats.this was not fortuitous both the corporation former bylaws and the relevant provisions of law,laws ann,demanded this minority status.from forward,the possibility of physician control seems even more remote the corporation became a entity,and the board became a zone.
in a creative formulation,the plaintiffs attempt to change the arithmetic by pointing out that physicians and hospital executives collectively held half of the seats on blue cross board.this is mathematically member board included seven physicians and seven hospital legally irrelevant.the record is barren of any evidence indicating that these two groups worked as a unit or even that they shared common economic interests.certainly,we can not infer as much in the absence of any proof.physicians and hospitals are in some respects natural enemies,squabbling over how to divide the steadily shrinking portion of premium dollars that insurers devote to provider reimbursement.see,jeffrey harris,regulation and internal control in hospitals,bull.acad.of med,discussing structural and historical tensions pitting hospital administrators against medical staff.
the plaintiffs next initiative is to note that physicians occupied certain ancillary offices,such as positions on the fees and contracts committee and the medical committee.they couple this with an assessment of the roles that these committees played in blue cross operations.from these facts,they argue that physicians were responsible for the development of the insurer policies.as with,however,we can attach no special significance to the unadorned fact of physician participation on any committee.see barry,at.dental ass n,at.this is especially true in light of the bylaw provision that expressly grants the blue cross board the sole authority to set the services to be offered to the subscribers.
to sum up,the plaintiffs have failed to establish the first foundational element of their argument.the defendants boards retained the ultimate say over their benefits policies and reimbursement rates,and physicians were represented sparsely if at all on these boards.by the same token,the plaintiffs have not established that physicians exercised the requisite degree of control over policymaking in any other fashion.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the plaintiffs structural conspiracy antitrust claim.
let us be perfectly clear.we base this ruling on the plaintiffs failure to muster evidence showing physician control.we hasten to add,however,that for purposes of section of the sherman act,control is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for finding concerted action.see,arizona maricopa county med.soc y,d broad.music,columbia broad,d see also vii areeda hovenkamp,supra.even then,satisfying the concerted action requirement is but one precondition to establishing a section violation.see,ncaa bd.of regents,d.this appeal,however,turns on the question of whether physicians exercised the requisite degree of control over the defendants to support a section claim.having answered that question in the negative,we take no view as to whether any additional factors might independently preclude the maintenance of an action under the statute.
b.the puerto rico antitrust claims.
the plaintiffs recast their sherman act claims as separate causes of action under puerto rico antitrust law,laws ann.that statute prohibits e very contract,combination or conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade or commerce in the commonwealth of puerto rico.id.because this language mirrors the language of section of the sherman act,we have treated the two provisions as coextensive.see caribe bmw,bayerische motoren werke aktiengesellschaft,cir see also pressure vessels empire gas,offic.trans,slip op.offic.trans.at examining puerto rico antitrust statute and articulating its equivalency to federal law.hence,we apply the reasoning elucidated above and affirm the district court entry of summary judgment for the defendants on these claims.
c.the plaintiffs alternative antitrust theories.
the plaintiffs next contend that they presented three alternative antitrust theories before the district court,namely,that the physician members of the defendants boards were part of an anticompetitive conspiracy that included board members that there was a conspiracy among physicians who influenced,though they did not control,the defendants and their policies and that the defendants were parties to an anticompetitive conspiracy among medical doctors who compete with podiatrists.these theories are viable,the plaintiffs say,notwithstanding the absence of physician control the defendants.consequently,the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the antitrust claims.
to put these nascent claims into perspective,we examine the record below.none of these additional theories is readily apparent from a thoughtful reading of the amended complaint,and neither nor blue cross addressed them in their initial summary judgment memoranda.the plaintiffs sought to widen the playing field by mentioning the additional theories in their oppositions to the defendants motions.disregarded
