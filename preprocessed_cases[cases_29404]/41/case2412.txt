appellant,tommy thompson,secretary of the department of health and human services the secretary,challenges the district court grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff hospitals the providers.at issue is the secretary obligation to reimburse the providers for bad debts arising from the failure of medicare part b participants to make coinsurance and deductible payments under circumstances in which,california state medicaid program,may be responsible for such payments.
section a of title of the united states code provides in part that no reimbursement payments shall be made to any provider unless it has furnished such information as the secretary may request in order to determine the amounts due such provider a.exercising this authority,the secretary,throughout the relevant period,consistently required the providers to submit evidence that they had billed for coinsurance and deductible obligations and received a refusal to pay,known as a remittance advice or the providers found this must bill policy onerous for a number of reasons and undertook to develop a system intended to establish whether,and to what extent,was liable for particular coinsurance or deductible payments under the applicable law.after the system was designed,the providers asked if the secretary would be willing to accept the data that the system would produce in lieu of evidence that had refused to pay when billed.the secretary declined to accept this tender,reaffirming the policy.
because we find the policy to be a reasonable implementation of the reimbursement system and not inconsistent with the statute and regulations governing fiscal years through the relevant period,we will reverse the summary judgment entered by the district court in favor of the providers and remand with instructions that summary judgment be entered in favor of the secretary.
ii.the medicare system 
medicare,generally 
medicare pays for covered medical care provided to eligible aged and disabled persons.the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,formerly the health care financing administration hcfa,is the component of the department of health and human services that administers the medicare program for the secretary.cms is headed by the administrator,who acts on behalf of the secretary in administrating the medicare program.
medicare is divided into two parts.part a authorizes payments primarily for institutional care,including hospital inpatient services and skilled nursing facilities.generally,everyone who is eligible for social security benefits is also eligible for part a benefits.
part b pays for physicians services,outpatient hospital services,and durable medical equipment.part b resembles a private insurance policy.individuals elect to be covered by part b.they pay premiums as well as coinsurance and deductibles.reimbursement for outpatient hospital services provided to part b enrollees is handled by private insurance companies,who serve as fiscal intermediaries intermediaries for the medicare program.see.
cost shifting 
the medicare statute and regulations prohibit cost shifting.see v a d.generally,cost shifting occurs in the following two ways the necessary costs of delivering health care to medicare enrollees are borne by individuals who are not medicare recipients or the necessary costs of delivering health care to the hospital other patients not covered by medicare are borne by medicare see v a stating that the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this subchapter will not be borne by individuals not so covered,and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs.
part b enrollees are responsible for paying coinsurance and deductible amounts.because the coinsurance and deductible amounts are sometimes uncollectible from the enrollee,medicare reimburses the health care provider for this bad debt to prevent a cost shift from the medicare recipient to individuals not covered by medicare.see d.
crossover patients from state medicaid programs 
medicaid is a program that enables states to provide necessary medical care to individuals whose resources are inadequate to pay for such care.see.state medicaid agencies may enter into a agreement with the secretary whereby the state enrolls the poorest medicare beneficiaries,some of whom are also eligible for medicaid,into the part b program.these patients are often called crossover patients.generally,the state agrees to pay the premiums,coinsurance,and deductibles for the crossover patients as part of its medicaid program.
crossover bad debts 
under n,a state medicaid program may impose a payment ceiling.the ceiling limits payment of the crossover patient coinsurance and deductible to the difference between what the state would have paid for the service if the person had not been enrolled in part b of medicare and what part b of medicare actually did pay,up to the full amount of the coinsurance and deductible.elected to impose such a ceiling in.
for example,suppose the following facts a hospital incurs a cost of in providing services to a crossover patient.medicare,under part b,pays of that cost.the amount representing the coinsurance deductible usually paid by a part b enrollee is.if determines that it would only pay for the care provided to the crossover patient if the patient were not enrolled in part b,then it will pay none of the to the health care provider,therefore pays none of the.however,if determines that it would have paid of the covered service,then it will pay the provider of the,therefore pays for of the.
in these examples,the health care provider is shortchanged by and respectively.to prevent cost shifting,medicare,through the intermediary,reimburses the provider for the amount over the cost ceiling as a bad debt.
california application of its payment ceiling to outpatient hospital services required each provider to prepare a detailed bill for so that could price the services as if it were the primary payer and compare that price to what medicare had already paid.would pay only the difference.the bill had to be because electronic billing system was not compatible with medicare.
shortly after imposed the payment ceiling,the providers asked the intermediaries if they were required to bill for amounts above the payment ceiling.and the intermediaries instructed the providers that they were required to bill and receive a formal denial from it in order to be reimbursed by medicare for the bad debt.
many providers elected not to bill at all,or to bill on only some claims because they determined that billing was too costly when compared to the money would ultimately pay pursuant to the payment ceiling.because the providers did not bill,they were denied medicare reimbursement for the unbilled bad debts caused by payment ceiling.
the providers,hoping to find an alternative to billing,enlisted carlson,price,fass and company carlson price to help them create a database of unbilled crossover bad debt.the providers also secured a limited amount of help from the california department of health services cdhs.cdhs asked eds,a private company that processes the claims for the state of california,to assist carlson price in developing a list of unbilled bad debt amounts.eds agreed and contracted independently with carlson price to help produce the data for crossover patients.
using the carlson price system,the providers consultant ran sample cost reports.because of the costliness of the process,the consultant wanted to be assured that the proposed surrogate data would be accepted.instead of producing the documentation,the providers submitted a proposal outlining the method eds would use to identify the bad debts for each hospital cost year from to accordingly,no documentation was submitted as part of the record to support the claims,other than that of the sample reports.the documentation to support the claims has not yet been created by eds for a majority of the reimbursement years in question.the intermediaries,citing the policy,rejected the data relating to unbilled claims.
iii.the prior proceedings 
a.the prrb decision 
the providers appealed the intermediaries decision to the provider reimbursement review body charged with the initial appeal of an intermediary decision under medicare.see a.
the prrb based its decision on the provisions of the provider reimbursement manual prm,which contains interpretive rules reflecting cms construction of its own regulations and statutes.california hosp.outpatient crossover bad debts group blue cross of california,prrb,wl.the prrb held that the prm allowed providers of services that are subject to the payment ceiling to recover the unpaid deductibles and coinsurance amounts as bad debts,so long as the indigence of the patient had been established with respect to crossover patients,the board concluded that indigence of the patient was established by their being medicaid eligible.the prrb also concluded that the data had at a minimum,the same basic information as on a remittance advice.id.at.
b.the administrator decision 
the administrator,acting on behalf of the secretary,reversed the prrb decision,sustaining the secretary right to insist upon being billed.california hosp.outpatient crossover bad debts group blue cross of california,wl.the administrator acknowledged that the prm allowed a provider to deem patients qualifying for medicaid indigent,but he held that the regulations required reasonable collection efforts before a bad debt was reimbursable.in the context,the administrator concluded that a reasonable collection effort under the regulations included establishing whether,and if so how much,would pay.
the administrator also held that the regulations require the provider to keep records and data throughout the cost year and to then make available those records to the intermediary in order to settle the cost report in the normal course of business.id.at.the administrator concluded that by failing to bill,the providers did not maintain contemporaneous documentation in the ordinary course of business to support their claims.id.
c.the district court decision 
the providers sought judicial review of the administrator decision and the district court overturned that decision.cmty.hosp.thompson,no,wl,dist.lexis.in the course of granting summary judgment for the providers,the district court held that nothing in the statute,regulations,or the prm required the policy and that the secretary was seeking to impose additional unstated and unwritten requirements,which they did not support.id.at.the court also concluded that the requirement was expressly disavowed by one provision of the prm,l,which states that it may not be necessary for a provider to actually bill the medicaid program to establish a medicare crossover bad debt where the provider can establish that medicaid is not responsible for payment.id.at.
the court further held that the policy violated the prohibitions of the statute and regulations,noting that the must bill requirement causes some bad debt to go unrecovered and some billing procedures that cost more than they recover.these lost costs,the court concluded,must be redistributed somewhere.id.at.
finally,the court found that the system was capable of determin ing the amount that will not pay pursuant to the its sic payment ceiling,without having to go through the often prohibitively burdensome process of hand billing.id.at.therefore,the court reversed the administrator decision and remanded the matter to the secretary with directions to accept the data 
iv.jurisdiction and standards of review 
jurisdiction 
the administrator reversal of the prrb was a final decision by the secretary,reviewable by the district court under f.we review the district court grant of summary judgment under.
standard of review,generally 
the district court review of the administrator decision,and our de novo review of its decision,are governed by the administrative procedure act,which provides that the agency decision will be set aside only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or unsupported by substantial evidence.a,e.see also french hosp.med.ctr.shalala,cir.
deference to an agency interpretation of a statute is not appropriate if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.
neither side maintains that congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue here.on the contrary,it is clear from the text of the medicare act that congress expected the secretary to resolve this and similar issues.
the medicare statute gives the secretary broad discretion to determine what reasonable cost s of services to medicare beneficiaries may be reimbursed to providers of services.see v a stating that reasonable costs shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used,and the items to be included.and,as we have noted,it also specifically granted the secretary broad discretion as to what information to require as a condition of payment to providers under the medicare program.a.since congress has explicitly left this gap for the agency to fill,any regulation regarding the issue must be given controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.
it is not necessary,however,that the secretary provide resolution of such an issue by promulgating regulations.as the supreme court concluded in shalala guernsey mem l,d 
there is no basis for suggesting that the secretary has a statutory duty to promulgate regulations that,either by default rule or by specification,address every conceivable question in the process of determining equitable reimbursement.to the extent the medicare statute broad delegation of authority imposes a rulemaking obligation,it is one the secretary has without doubt discharged.the secretary has issued regulations to address a wide range of reimbursement questions.the regulations are comprehensive and intricate in detail,addressing matters such as limits on cost reimbursement,apportioning costs to medicare services,and the specific treatment of numerous particular costs.
as to particular reimbursement details not addressed by her regulations,the secretary relies upon an elaborate adjudicative structure which includes the right to review by the provider reimbursement review board,and,in some instances,the secretary,as well as judicial review in federal district court of final agency action.that her regulations do not resolve the specific timing question before us in a conclusive way,does not,of course,render them invalid,for the methods for the estimation of reasonable costs required by the statute only need be generalizations that necessarily will fail to yield exact numbers.the apa does not require that all specific applications of a rule evolve by further,more precise rules rather than by adjudication.the secretary mode of determining benefits by both rulemaking and adjudication is,in our view,a proper exercise of her statutory mandate.
id.at.citations omitted.it is,thus,well settled that,if the secretary fills a gap that he is authorized to fill,his resolution in the course of formal adjudication of the kind we review is controlling unless arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute 
pronouncements in manuals like the prm,which do not have the force of law,are entitled to less deference than an interpretation arrived at after a formal adjudication or rulemaking.christensen harris county,d.as the supreme court explained in christensen,
i nterpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant deference.see,reno koray,d internal agency guideline,which is not subject to the rigors of the administrative procedur e act,including public notice and comment,entitled only to some deference internal quotation marks omitted eeoc arabian american oil,d interpretative guidelines do not receive chevron deference martin occupational safety and health review comm n,d interpretative rules and enforcement guidelines are not entitled to the same deference as norms that derive from the exercise of the secretary delegated lawmaking powers.see generally davis pierce,administrative law treatise ed.instead,interpretations contained in formats such as opinion letters are entitled to respect under our decision in skidmore swift,but only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade,ibid.
id.thus,as the supreme court noted in guernsey,at,i nterpretive rules found in the prm do not have the force and effect of law and are not accorded that chevron weight in the adjudicatory process.
the deference to which such interpretive rules are entitled was described in skidmore swift,as follows 
we consider that the interpretations of the administrator,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority,do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.the weight of such a judgment will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.
id.at.see united states mead,d.
although an agency interpretation of its own regulation is usually given substantial deference,a n agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency earlier interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consistently held agency view,d quoting watt alaska,d.see also thomas jefferson shalala,d.
v.the governing law during the relevant period 
a.the statute 
as previously noted,the medicare statute authorizes the secretary to reimburse both direct and indirect costs of providers of services and to promulgate regulations stipulating how that will be done.v a a.
b.the regulations 
utilizing this statutory authority,the secretary has promulgated regulations setting forth the criteria for allowable bad debt and the kind of documentation that must be submitted to establish that those criteria have been met.section e of title of the code of federal regulations provides as follows 
e criteria for allowable bad debt.a bad debt must meet the following criteria to be allowable 
the debt must be related to covered services and derived from deductible and coinsurance amounts.
the provider must be able to establish that reasonable collection efforts were made 
the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless.
sound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future.
section a provides 
a general.the principles of cost reimbursement require that providers maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under the program.standardized definitions,accounting,statistics,and reporting practices that are widely accepted in the hospital and related fields are followed.changes in these practices and systems will not be required in order to determine costs payable under the principles of reimbursement.essentially the methods of determining costs payable under medicare involve making use of data available from the institution basi c accounts,as usually maintained,to arrive at equitable and proper payment for services to beneficiaries.
the secretary,speaking through the administrator,found that the policy is a fundamental requirement to demonstrate,as required by e in the context,that reasonable collection efforts have been made and that the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless.california,wl,at.he further found that the fact that a state implements a payment ceiling does not relieve a provider from billing in order to contemporaneously establish an amount that is unpaid and uncollectible id.finally,the secretary concluded that the policy was necessary in order to generate contemporaneous documentation that could be maintained in the usual course of the provider business as required by a.we find this to be a reasonable reading of these regulations.
it may be true,as the providers insist,that these regulations can be read as not precluding the possibility of a provider establishing the criteria of e by alternative means that would also generate contemporary records to be maintained in the usual course of its business.this would not,however,justify our refusing to accept the secretary insistence on billing in this case.
first,as the secretary specifically concluded with record support,r egardless of whether surrogate documentation can be provided,in this case the providers did not maintain contemporaneous documentation in the ordinary course of business to support their claims.california,wl,at.more fundamentally,however,it is not necessary for the secretary to resolve all issues by regulation.guernsey,at.the secretary is authorized to determine what supporting documentation will be required.when he makes a determination through adjudication,we will defer to that interpretation if it is not inconsistent with the statute and regulations,and is a reasonable implementation thereof.given that billing the state is the most straightforward and reliable way of determining whether,and,if so,how much the state will pay,we are unable to say that the policy is inconsistent with the statute or regulations or is an unreasonable implementation of them.
c.the provider reimbursement manual part i 
during the relevant period,and of the prm part i provided additional advice with respect to reimbursement.section provided in relevant part 
to be considered a reasonable collection effort,a provider effort to collect medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts must be similar to the effort the provider puts forth to collect comparable amounts from patients.it must involve the issuance of a bill on or shortly after discharge or death of the beneficiary to the party responsible for the patient personal financial obligations.it also includes other actions such as subsequent billings,collection letters and telephone calls or personal contacts with this party which constitute a genuine,rather than a token,collection effort.the provider collection effort may include using or threatening to use court action to obtain payment.see for indigent or medically indigent patients.
documentation provider collection effort should be documented in the patient file by copies of the bill s,letters,reports of telephone and personal contact.
section provided 
in some cases,the provider may have established before discharge,or within a reasonable time before the current admission,that the beneficiary is either indigent or medically indigent.providers can deem medicare beneficiaries indigent or medically indigent when such individuals have also been determined eligible for medicaid as either categorically needy individuals or medically needy individuals,respectively.otherwise,the provider should apply its customary methods for determining the indigence of patients to the case of the medicare beneficiary under the following guidelines 
a.the patient indigence must be determined by the provider,not by the patient,a patient signed declaration of his inability to pay his medical bills can not be considered proof of indigency 
b.the provider should take into account a patient total resources which would include,but are not limited to,an analysis of assets only those convertible to cash,and unnecessary for the patient daily living,liabilities,and income and expenses.in making this analysis the provider should take into account any extenuating circumstances that would affect the determination of the patient indigence 
c.the provider must determine that no source other than the patient would be legally responsible for the patient medical bill,title xix,local welfare agency and guardian and 
d.the patient file should contain documentation of the method by which indigence was determined in addition to all backup information to substantiate the determination.
once indigence is determined and the provider concludes that there had been no improvement in the beneficiary financial condition,the debt may be deemed uncollectible without applying the procedures.see for bad debts under state welfare programs.
finally,section,entitled medicare bad debts under state welfare programs,provided in relevant part 
where the state is obligated either by statute or under the terms of its plan to pay all,or any part,of the medicare deductible or coinsurance amounts,those amounts are not allowable as bad debts under medicare.any portion of such deductible or coinsurance amounts that the state is not obligated to pay can be included as a bad debt under medicare,provided that the requirements of or,if applicable,are met.
in some instances,the state has an obligation to pay,but either does not pay anything or pays only part of the deductible or coinsurance because of a state payment ceiling.for example,assume that a state pays a maximum of per day for snf services and the provider cost is a day.the coinsurance is a day so that medicare pays less.in this case,the state limits its payment towards the coinsurance to less.in these situations,any portion of the deductible or coinsurance that the state does not pay that remains unpaid by the patient,can be included as a bad debt under medicare,provided that the requirements of are met.
as the secretary reads these provisions,they establish a general rule that reasonable collection effort within the meaning of the regulations involves billing anyone responsible for payment,excuse billing indigent patients,and provide that where a state may be liable for coinsurance and deductible debt not paid by the patient,whether or not there is a ceiling,bad debt can be reimbursed only if and to the extent that the state does not pay.these propositions,in the secretary view,necessarily imply that a potentially liable state must be billed.he finds this confirmed by the portion of stipulating that there may be a claim only if the state does not pay anything or pays only part because of a state payment ceiling this requirement that the state not have satisfied the patient debt is illusory,the secretary maintains,if the regulations impose no duty to demand payment from the state.
the providers read as providing an exception to the billing requirement of,which,in the case of an indigent patient eligible for medicaid,relieves the provider of the duty to bill not only the patient but also any potentially liable state.the providers arrive at this conclusion because allows medicaid patients to be deemed indigent and provides that o nce indigence is determined the debt may be deemed uncollectible without applying the procedures.prm.
once again,we are unable to say that the secretary interpretation is unreasonable.patients are not deemed indigent.when a patient is not deemed indigent,the provider must apply the requirements of a d to establish the patient indigence.section c requires that the provider must determine that no other source other than the patient would be legally responsible for the patient medical bill,title xix,local welfare agency and guardian.section c,although literally inapplicable to medicaid patients,evidences that the secretary understandably remains interested in alternative sources of payment when the patient,himself,is unable to pay for the service.it is difficult to understand why anyone responsible for the reimbursement program would insist on a provider pursuing those secondarily liable in cases where the patient is determined to be indigent,and not so insisting where the patient is deemed to be indigent because he or she qualifies for medicaid.this fact supports the secretary view that excuses only billing the indigent patient and that the subject of billing states with welfare programs is covered by,as evidenced by the parenthetical that concludes see for bad debts under state welfare programs.see gci health care,thompson,d,the reasoning behind prm prevents a provider from undertaking collection efforts when such efforts would be largely futile due to a patient indigence this reasoning does not apply when a state is the responsible payor under a state medicaid plan.
the first quoted paragraph of declares that to the extent a state is responsible for medicare deductible or coinsurance amounts,those amounts may not be claimed as bad debt.conversely,it establishes that to the extent a state is not responsible for such amounts,they may be claimed as bad debt if a the requirements of are met,the patient has been deemed or determined to be indigent and billing of the patient is excused,or b if applicable,the requirements of are met,reasonable efforts have been made to collect from the patient.
the second quoted paragraph makes clear that the same principles apply when there is a payment ceiling.as the providers stress,however,this paragraph concludes with a reference to only,omitting any reference to.to the providers,this confirms their view that waives the billing requirement of for all potentially liable parties where the patient has been deemed to be indigent.
given that the second quoted paragraph of appears to involve a subset of the cases covered by the first,the absence of a reference to is puzzling.the providers explanation for this is less than satisfying,however.section can not be read to make a distinction between cases in which there is a state plan without a ceiling and cases in which there is a state plan with a ceiling.thus,if can be read to grant a billing exemption other than with respect to the patient,it is an exemption that extends to cases that come within the scope of the first as well as the second paragraph of.section,accordingly,does not explain the difference in phrasing in the first quoted paragraph of and the second.while it is true that the existence of a ceiling may make it predictable,in some cases,that no state payment will be forthcoming,in many cases,it will be unclear whether the state will pay,and,if so,how much.more importantly,the providers have suggested no persuasive reason why the secretary might have decided that billing the state was not necessary in ceiling cases,while necessary in other state welfare situations.
while the lack of parallel language in the last sentence of the second quoted paragraph of provides a basis for an argument that a difference in treatment was intended in ceiling cases,we do not think it provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the secretary interpretation of these provisions is unreasonable.read together,the relevant provisions of prm part i indicate that the secretary insists upon reasonable efforts to collect from states that may be liable for deductibles and coinsurance.those provisions,fairly read,require reasonable collection efforts,including billing,in indigency cases as well as cases,and in ceiling cases as well as cases.
as with the regulations,the providers contend that these provisions of prm part i do not rule out the possibility that one could comply with by establishing the extent of a state obligation to pay by a means other than billing and awaiting the state answer.while we agree with the secretary that,and are more reasonably read to require billing,our conclusion would be no different if we believed the providers reading were a permissible one.at most,these provisions are ambiguous,and we must defer to the secretary reasonable determination that billing is required,a determination which he has arrived at through formal adjudication.
adjudicative decisions 
the foregoing constitute the only statutes,regulations,and manual instructions in existence during the relevant period.during that period,there is no evidence that the secretary ever reimbursed crossover bad debt without an.these providers consistently asked for reimbursement without an and were consistently denied.moreover,several prrb cases decided prior to denied reimbursement pursuant to the policy.see hospital de area de carolina,admin,medicare medicaid guide cch reversing a prrb decision and denying reimbursement,in part because the provider never filed claims for reimbursement of unpaid deductibles and coinsurance amounts with puerto rico medicaid program joseph,prrb,medicare medicaid guide cch holding that collection efforts were not adequate when a provider failed to take action to collect amounts owed by the georgia medicaid system.
although the providers argue that,on at least two occasions,the prrb has deviated from the requirement,both cases were decided after the relevant period moreover,in neither case did the secretary leave a decision standing that reimbursed without a supporting 
in santa marta hosp.blue cross and blue shield ass n,prrb,wl,the prrb did construe prm as not requiring the billing of a state medicaid program.id.at stating that the board is persuaded by the provider argument that,in the face of instructions to the contrary,the provider need not bill the program for medicare part b deductible and coinsurance amounts in order for the provider to sustain bad debt claims.however,this case provides little support for the providers assertion that the secretary has approved reimbursement in the absence of a billing of the state.the prrb ultimately denied the claim,and its decision was not appealed.while the administrator could have reviewed the prrb decision sua sponte,it had no occasion to do so given that reimbursement was denied.
in pro rehab,blue cross and blue shield ass n,wl,a provider of physical therapy services to nursing home residents in virginia sought reimbursement for bad debt,complaining that an amendment to virginia plan had barred all direct claims against the state by such providers and had relegated them to making claims on the nursing homes who would secure reimbursement through the nursing facility per diem rates.the physical therapy provider asserted that this per diem,approach did not result in full payment for his services because virginia had placed ceilings on such per diem rates.it was in this context that the prrb understandably said it was unpersuaded by the contention that the provider should have billed the state of virginia in the face of virginia amendment eliminating direct reimbursement.prrb,wl,at.on review,the administrator held that virginia per diem ceilings were not the kind of ceiling referred to in,a holding that is unhelpful here.wl.the administrator further held that the physical therapy provider could not recover because the secretary requirement required that he submit a bill to the nursing home and have his demand rejected.id.
the prrb decisions before and during the relevant period are thus consistent with the secretary position.
vi.prm part ii l,column 
a.the provision 
part ii of the prm was promulgated in november of.l states,in pertinent part,the following 
evidence of the bad debt arising from medicare medicaid crossovers may include a copy of the medicaid remittance showing the crossover claim and resulting medicaid payment or.however,it may not be necessary for a provider to actually bill the medicaid program to establish a medicare crossover bad debt where the provider can establish that medicaid is not responsible for payment.in lieu of billing the medicaid program,the provider must furnish documentation of 
medicaid eligibility at the time services were rendered via valid medicaid eligibility number,and 
nonpayment that would have occurred if the crossover claim had actually been filed with medicaid.
the payment calculation will be audited based on the state medicaid plan in effect on the date that services were furnished.providers should be aware of any change in the medicaid payment formula that might impact the crossover calculation,and ensure that these changes are reflected in the claimed medicare bad debt.
the providers understandably point to this portion of as establishing that crossover bad debt can be reimbursable without a supporting.the secretary insists,in response,that the authorization of an alternative to billing is irrelevant,here,because it applies only when patients are categorically denied payment under the state medicaid program appellant brief at.as an example of such a categorical denial of payment,the secretary cites bad debt associated with the treatment of individuals aged by institutions for the mentally ill.id.at.the medicaid statute and regulations categorically preclude payment for such services.
we conclude that the text of l is not subject to the interpretation that the secretary seeks to give it.the references to the payment calculation be ing audited based on the state medicaid plan in effect on the date of the service and to changes in the medicaid payment formula are simply incompatible with a reading that limits the authority given to cases of categorical exclusions.accordingly,we agree with the providers that the author of l thought it permissible i n lieu of billing the medicaid program,for a provider to furnish documentation of medicaid eligibility and the n that would have occurred if the crossover claim had actually been filed with medicaid.moreover,nothing suggests the author understood l to be establishing a change in policy 
b.the legal effect of l 
l is thus inconsistent with the secretary policy,and we must decide what the legal significance of that inconsistency is.this is not a situation in which an administrative agency that has consistently interpreted a statute or regulation in one way asks the court to defer to a new and different interpretation.see,at.thomas jefferson,at.in situations of that kind,interested parties understandably will have relied on the agency first reading.here,the record demonstrates that the secretary enforced the policy to which he asks us to defer throughout the relevant period,and there is no evidence of his having reimbursed crossover bad debt without evidence of billing.
the providers consistently asked for reimbursement without evidence of billing throughout the relevant period,and reimbursement was consistently denied.indeed,this was what led to their efforts to develop a surrogate data approach.accordingly,the providers can not claim that their reliance interests have been unfairly frustrated.the only inconsistency to which the providers can point is found in a manual provision that was not in existence during the relevant period,the cost years concluding in through and that does not have the force of law.
as we have noted,the provisions of the prm are entitled to less deference than regulations which do have such force,and the weight to be given it should depend upon those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.skidmore,at.while l is surely relevant to our determination of the amount of deference to be given to the policy,we know nothing about the circumstances of its promulgation that would cause us to favor it over the consistently applied policy during the relevant period.similarly,if read to authorize the providers surrogate data system,as they insist it does,we believe there is reason to favor the policy.because a regulation has the force of law,an interpretation of a regulation in part ii of the prm that is inconsistent with the regulation should not be enforced.med.enters.bowen,cir.we believe a is most reasonably read,as the secretary does,to require documentation reflecting data available from the institution basic accounts,as usually maintained.a.yet,as the secretary found,in this case,the providers did not maintain contemporaneous documentation in the ordinary course of business to support their claim.accordingly,to the extent l is read to authorize reimbursement to the providers in this case,it can not be enforced.
vii.cost shifting 
as we have previously noted,the medicare statute prohibits the shifting of the cost of providing healthcare for medicare beneficiaries to other patients and.more specifically,v a directs that the secretary regulations 
shall i take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services in order that the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this subchapter will not be borne by individuals not so covered,and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs 
the providers insist that the secretary policy is in conflict with this directive,and the district court agreed.it reasoned as follows 
defendants do not dispute th
