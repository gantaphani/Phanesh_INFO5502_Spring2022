after weld county chose to hire someone else as its fiscal officer,margee johnson,an accountant for the county,came to believe that she did get the job because she is a woman and has a physical disability.in response,she brought this lawsuit,alleging discrimination in violation of,among other things,title vii of the civil rights act of and the americans with disability act ada.in the end,however,the district court granted the county request for summary judgment on all counts against it.we now affirm that decision because johnson failed to rebut the county evidence suggesting that the male candidate it hired as fiscal officer had superior qualifications to hers,as well as its evidence that she was not,at the time of the hiring decision,disabled within the meaning of the ada.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to johnson,as we must,see.c,they tell us this.in,johnson began working for weld county as an accountant,though,several years earlier,she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.by all reports,johnson was a good employee who worked for the county without complaint for many years.
the troubles giving rise to this case began only in when marilyn carlino,the county fiscal officer and johnson direct supervisor,resigned.until a new fiscal officer could be hired,walter speckman,director of the county department of human services,placed johnson in the position on an interim basis,for which she received a temporary pay raise.at the same time,johnson and others applied for the job on a permanent basis.ultimately,the county narrowed the pool of candidates to five individuals johnson,three other female candidates,and one male candidate,dennis bogott.after a committee consisting of speckman and six women interviewed,scored,and ranked the candidates,it recommended the two individuals to speckman,who,as director,made the final decision.the top two candidates were bogott and a female candidate johnson was ranked fourth of the five candidates.after a background check of the top two candidates,bogott,who had years experience in the accounting field,was hired and began work as the county fiscal officer in april.
when bogott started work,johnson was tasked with training him,though she says she really did his job for him.johnson continued to receive her pay increase during this training period,which lasted into may,though she insists she continued to perform bogott duties well after that.
eventually,in september,johnson complained to the human resources department,speckman,and bogott that she was a victim of discrimination.the human resources department responded by offering to extend her temporary pay increase retroactively through august within a few days of johnson complaints,speckman and bogott began to ignore her and eventually came to tease and snub her.
on november,johnson filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and eventually received a letter giving notice of her right to sue.johnson resigned from weld county on may,and then filed this lawsuit alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and disability.in due course,the county moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted on all of johnson claims.
johnson responded by bringing this appeal.in what follows,we analyze her various claims in sequence.parts focus on her title vii sex discrimination for failure to hire part ii,pay discrimination part iii,and retaliation part iv.part v,meanwhile,focuses on her disability claims under the ada.because this case comes to us on summary judgment,we assess all of johnson claims de novo that is,we will affirm the district court disposition only if our independent review of the record,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to johnson,reveals that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.at the same time,we review challenges to the district court determinations regarding what is and is not competent evidence for our consideration at the summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion.see argo blue cross blue shield of,cir.
johnson argues first and foremost that the county discriminated against her on the basis of her sex,in violation of title vii,et,by hiring bogott instead of her as the county permanent fiscal officer.she suggests she has a triable title vii claim in light of both direct,see trans world airlines,thurston,and circumstantial evidence,see mcdonnell douglas.green,montes vail clinic,cir.either mode of proof,of course,can suffice to defeat summary judgment,and so we examine each in turn.
johnson direct evidence of sex discrimination consists of her testimony that bogott and barb burns,a county accounting technician,told her that speckman admitted to them bogott and burns that he speckman did hire her johnson because of her sex and multiple sclerosis.johnson also relies on the fact that mike willoughby,a department of labor auditor not employed by the county,told her that bogott had told him willoughby that speckman had told him bogott that he did hire her johnson because she was a woman.
the district court held that this evidence failed to create a triable question of fact because it is inadmissible hearsay.johnson disputes this analysis,offering three essential reasons why,in her view,we should find the district court evidentiary ruling to constitute an abuse of discretion.none is persuasive.
johnson first suggests that speckman statements are not hearsay but rather admissions by a,emphasizing that he was the individual county officer responsible for the hiring decision.see.d d.the difficulty with this argument is that,even accepting speckman statements as admissions,a hearsay problem remains.
the remaining problem,as the district court correctly noted,is that speckman alleged admissions come bundled inside bogott,burns,and willoughby remarks to johnson,which are themselves hearsay.see.c.because the district court could consider the hearsay statements of bogott,burns,or willoughby,by necessity it could consider anything contained within them,including speckman alleged admissions.
to this,johnson replies that bogott statement is admissible because he,like speckman,qualifies as a.and it is surely the case that,were both bogott and speckman,the hearsay problem would evaporate because both links in the chain of communication would involve admissions.see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence,at joseph mclaughlin,moore kuka welding,cir holding witness testimony of party agent statement to second party agent,who relayed statement to witness,admissible under federal rules of evidence d d and.
the difficulty for johnson is that bogott can not be fairly considered a.under our controlling precedent,an employee statements are not attributable to his employer as a admission in an employment dispute unless the employee was involved in the decisionmaking process affecting the employment action at issue.jaramillo.judicial dep t,cir per curiam quoting aliotta passenger,cir.the undisputed facts confirm that bogott was remotely involved in the fiscal officer hiring decision instead,he was merely another candidate for the position,not yet even a county employee.accordingly,the district court rightly concluded that his statements are outside the scope of his employment and not admissible as statements of a party opponent.id.
johnson separately contends that bogott,burns,and willoughby statements are hearsay because they are not offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.that is,johnson contends that their statements are offered to prove the truth of what speckman that he said it.opening br.at emphasis omitted.
this wo solve the hearsay problem either.even assuming without deciding that the mere fact speckman made his comments is relevant to johnson case,the only way johnson can prove the fact of speckman comments is through bogott,burns,and willoughby hearsay statements to her.it is the same as though johnson had testified that bogott,burns,and willoughby each told her that speckman had driven through town at noon.even if speckman actions driving through town or speaking as a do themselves raise a hearsay problem,the statements describing them still do.see kenneth broun et,mccormick on evidence,at ed.for example,witness w reports on the stand that declarant d has stated that x was driving at a given time and place.the proponent is trying with this evidence to prove that x did so act.the assertion is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,and by definition,it is hearsay.
finally,johnson urges us to consider bogott,burns,and willoughby statements because they could be replaced at trial by admissible evidence,namely their live testimony.this we can not do.when a proper hearsay objection has been made and preserved,i t is well settled in this circuit that we can consider only admissible evidence in reviewing an order granting summary judgment.city of oklahoma city,cir quoting gross burggraf constr,cir see also montes,at under our precedents,we are constrained to disregard such hearsay on summary judgment when,as here,there is a proper objection to its use and the proponent of the testimony can direct us to no applicable exception to the hearsay rule.
seeking to avoid this result,johnson relies on language in celotex catrett,in which the supreme court indicated that w e do not mean that the nonmoving party must produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment.id.at.this,johnson argues,permits consideration of hearsay evidence at summary judgment if its proponent could later replace it with the declarant testimony at trial.
we long ago rejected just this argument as a misreading of celotex.in thomas ibm,cir,we explained that,while celotex indicates that the form of evidence produced by a nonmoving party at summary judgment may not need to be admissible at trial,the content or substance of the evidence must be admissible.id.at emphasis added.that is,rule permits parties at summary judgment to produce their evidence by means of affidavit,a form of evidence that is usually inadmissible at trial given our adversarial system preference for live testimony.yet,at the same time,rule does not suggest we enjoy a license to relax the content or substance of the federal rules of evidence when viewing a summary judgment affidavit the rule does nothing to intimate hearsay testimony that would be inadmissible at trial somehow becomes admissible simply by being included in an affidavit to defeat summary judgment.id.to the contrary,rule expressly prescribes that a summary judgment affidavit must be made on personal knowledge,set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence,and show that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters stated.e see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.material that is inadmissible will not be considered on a motion because it would not establish a genuine issue of material fact if offered at trial and continuing the action would be useless.
so it is that,although evidence presented in the form of an affidavit at summary judgment can be converted in form into live testimony at trial,the content or substance of the affidavit must be otherwise admissible,and any hearsay contained in a summary judgment affidavit remains hearsay,beyond the bounds of the court consideration.to read celotex otherwise would be to misconstrue the message of the supreme court that summary judgment is a legitimate and efficient way of disposing of unsupported claims because t he changes in summary judgment procedure heralded by celotex would have little impact if the proceedings could get bogged down in a needless examination of the hypothetical ways the nonmoving party evidence might be reduced to admissible form by the time of trial.duplantis shell offshore,cir quoting melissa nelken,one step forward,two steps back summary judgment after celotex,hastings,first alteration in original see also canada blain helicopters,cir.
had johnson followed the expedient contemplated by rule and secured sworn statements from those who allegedly heard speckman remarks,this case might be in a very different posture.young dillon,cir.but though on notice of the necessity of doing so under our precedent,she did not follow that course and so we are left,as was the district court,with the unavoidable conclusion that she lacks competent direct evidence of discrimination.
even so,johnson submits she should be permitted to proceed to trial in light of the admissible circumstantial evidence of discrimination she has amassed.under the familiar mcdonnell douglas framework,we analyze title vii claims based on circumstantial evidence in three steps.first,a plaintiff opposing summary judgment must make a prima facie case of discrimination.young,at.second,the defendant then must articulate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.id.third,the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff,who must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer reasons are a pretext for unlawful discrimination.id.
the first two steps of this analysis are not seriously in question before us.the district court determined that johnson established a prima facie case of discrimination,and we assume without deciding she has.the county,in turn,offered legitimate reasons for its failure to hire johnson,submitting that bogott was better qualified for the position by dint of his considerably greater accounting experience and superior credentials,and johnson lacked the requisite academic qualifications for the job.
the real dispute in this case,like many others,centers on mcdonnell douglas third step.under our precedents,a plaintiff can establish pretext by showing the defendant proffered explanations for its actions are so incoherent,weak,inconsistent,or contradictory that a rational factfinder could conclude they are unworthy of belief.hinds mgmt,cir quoting young,at.johnson challenges the county explanations for hiring bogott on several grounds,the most significant of which we discuss here in turn.
johnson first attacks the county explanation that bogott had superior qualifications,arguing that he proved himself unqualified when he was unable to perform his duties and needed johnson to do them for him.our authority to hold for johnson on this basis is limited,however.under mcdonnell douglas,our role is to ask whether the employer decision was wise,fair or correct,but whether it honestly believed the legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons it gave for its conduct and acted in good faith on those beliefs.rivera city county of denver,cir quoting bullington united air lines,cir first alteration in original.
that individuals and companies sometimes make employment decisions that prove to be bad ones in hindsight usually suggests no more than they got it wrong.to support an inference of pretext,to suggest that something more nefarious might be at play,a plaintiff must produce evidence that the employer did more than get it wrong.he or she must come forward with evidence that the employer did really believe its proffered reasons for action and thus may have been pursuing a hidden discriminatory agenda.this is because title vii licenses us not to act as a super personnel department to undo bad employment decisions instead,it charges us to serve as a vital means for redressing discriminatory ones.hinds,at.
toward this end,to suggest that an employer claim that it hired someone else because of superior qualifications is pretext for discrimination rather than an honestly even if mistakenly held belief,a plaintiff must come forward with facts showing an overwhelming disparity in qualifications.jaramillo,at internal quotation marks omitted.only if the differences in the candidates qualifications jump off the page and slap us in the face can we say that the employer claim is sufficiently suspicious to suggest discriminatory animus.odom frank,cir.further,we will examine the competing candidates qualifications only in light of the facts available to the decisionmaker at the time of the decision,not in light of facts that might have been apparent to others or that might have become apparent only in hindsight.see rivera,at.
we agree with the district court that any difference between johnson and bogott qualifications does not come close to suggesting pretext under these standards.bogott had a bachelor degree in business with a double major in finance and accounting,a supervisor certificate,and years experience in finance and accounting.meanwhile,johnson had a bachelor degree in business administration specializing in computers and accounting,with a minor in accounting an associate degree in accounting and at least ten years experience in accounting,including her stint as interim fiscal officer.even if bogott later proved incapable of performing his duties,as johnson asserts,his they appeared to the county when he was arguably superior,and certainly not overwhelmingly inferior,to johnson.
johnson separately challenges the county claim that she lacked the requisite academic qualifications for the job.the job description the county employed sought someone with a bachelor degree in business administration with an emphasis in accounting.at.the county contends that,in seeking an individual with an emphasis in accounting,it was after someone who,like bogott,majored in accounting,and that johnson degree,with only a minor in accounting,was insufficient.to this,johnson responds that her degree in business administration specializing in computers and accounting,with a minor in accounting,constitutes an emphasis in accounting,and so the county proffered explanation must be pretextual.
at least two problems attend johnson argument.in the first place,we are in no position to define what constitutes an emphasis in accounting as an academic matter trying to do so would run the risk of having us assume the role of a university super registrar office on top of an employer super personnel department.for our purposes,the relevant question is,once again,not what a university might think constitutes an emphasis in accounting,but whether the county honestly believed its claim that johnson lacked what it considered to be an emphasis in accounting.and on that score,johnson has come forward with no evidence suggesting it did not.
secondly,and independently,a s a general rule,an employee must proffer evidence that shows each of the employer justifications are pretextual.jaramillo,at quoting tyler states,cir.whatever the persuasiveness of its claims about its academic requirements,the county separately cited bogott arguably superior qualifications including some years additional experience and a supervisor certificate as a separate and additional reason for its hiring decision.johnson evidence and argument about her academic credentials does nothing to undercut this independent justification.
johnson suggests that pretext can be inferred from the fact that,according to her,speckman sometimes exploded at female,but not male,employees.from this,she argues,a jury could infer that speckman harbored a bias against women that infected his hiring decision.
to establish pretext from such comments,however,our precedent requires that they be somehow tied to the employment actions disputed in the case at hand.antonio sygma network,cir quoting eeoc bci bottling of,cir.that is,johnson must show that the allegedly discriminatory comments were directed at her,her position,or the defendant policy which resulted in the adverse action taken against her.young,at quoting rea martin marietta,cir alteration in original.
this johnson has not done.she points us to one alleged outburst in which speckman exploded when johnson expressed concerns about county accounting practices,telling her that she did know what she was talking about and was to tell him how to do his job.at.but johnson offers no evidence suggesting that this incident related at all to her sex or to the fiscal officer position.the alleged incident came,moreover,shortly before johnson ended her employment with the county,nearly a year after bogott was hired.without any meaningful connection,in either time or topic,to the decision not to hire johnson as fiscal officer,speckman alleged comment can not give rise to an inference that the county explanation for that decision is pretextual 
johnson contends that pretext can be inferred from an alleged procedural irregularity in the hiring process.in johnson view,barbara connolly was tacked on as a seventh member of the interview committee when there were supposed to be only six members,and connolly was allowed to veto johnson candidacy by casting a not recommended vote against her.
perhaps the most significant difficulty with this line of argument is the absence of record evidence suggesting that having seven members on the interview committee was contrary to any county hiring policy.but even overlooking this difficulty,it remains the law that not every failure to follow every directive in an employer policy manual gives rise to an inference of pretext for invidious discrimination.hinds,at.employers often fail to follow written policy manuals for benign sometimes even very sound business reasons,and in any event our job is to enforce employment manuals but to protect against unlawful discrimination.id.for an inference of pretext to arise on the basis of a procedural irregularity,we have held that there must be some evidence that the irregularity directly and uniquely disadvantaged a minority employee.randle city of aurora,cir.in the case before us,it is undisputed that every candidate,not just johnson and not just the female applicants,was interviewed by the committee.
johnson other challenges to connolly participation fare no better.there is no evidence that connolly not recommended vote functioned as the automatic veto johnson contends.rather,as the district court observed,the county published hiring procedure does specify what effect a single not recommended vote was to have,let alone command the preclusive effect johnson suggests.and affidavits from county only evidence johnson mentions on this that a not recommended vote by one interview committee member could be overcome by high scores from other committee members.perhaps even more pointedly still,as a practical matter connolly vote made no difference even without connolly not recommended,even disregarding connolly scoring of candidates.johnson still ranked fourth out of the five candidates,not in the top two destined to advance for final consideration 
johnson claims that the county separately violated title vii by paying her less than bogott during the period she was training him because,in her view,she was effectively doing his job.johnson argues that the district court erred in awarding the county summary judgment on her pay discrimination claim sua sponte when the county opening brief in support of summary judgment did focus on that particular theory.
though we generally do favor the granting of summary judgment sua sponte,a district court may do so if the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.scull new mexico,cir quoting sports racing,sports car club of,cir.and even if such notice is lacking,we will still affirm a grant of summary judgment if the losing party suffered no prejudice from the lack of notice.id.at.
that is the case here.though the county did squarely focus on johnson pay discrimination allegations in its opening summary judgment brief,in her opposition papers johnson nonetheless marshaled and outlined the evidence supporting her claim,as her counsel acknowledged to us at oral argument.there no indication that the district court subsequent grant of summary judgment on the claim prevented johnson from offering additional evidence or argument to defend her claim.see id.at.indeed,before us she relies on exactly the same evidence and arguments she made before the district court,and identifies no way in which she was prejudiced by the district court chosen procedural course.
having established that summary judgment on johnson pay discrimination claim was fairly in play before the district court,we turn to the question whether granting it was proper.though the court remarked that johnson allegations are insufficient to support a formal claim for pay discrimination,it proceeded to grant summary judgment for the county on a different rationale,explaining its view that johnson had abandoned the claim in the course of her summary judgment briefing.op.at.we disagree that johnson abandoned her pay discrimination claim rather,as we noted,she vigorously defended it in her summary judgment briefing.but we may,of course,affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on any ground adequately supported by the record.see elkins comfort,cir.and before us the county suggests the district court initial instinct was correct,arguing that johnson has indeed failed to present facts sufficient to support a prima facie case of pay discrimination.with this submission,we agree.
to establish a prima facie case of pay discrimination,johnson had to adduce evidence tending to show that she occupie d a job similar to that of a higher paid male in this case,bogott.sprague thorn,cir quoting meeks computer assocs.int l,cir.johnson has made no such showing in this case.there is no question that bogott had considerably greater accounting,finance,and supervisory experience than johnson.there is no dispute that their respective positions differed significantly in their stated responsibilities.and while johnson argues that she might have performed at least to percent of bogott duties during his training period,aplee.at,this left a wide swath of responsibilities solely and indisputably in his hands.the lack of similarity in johnson and bogott jobs is underscored by our precedent in sprague.there,we held that the plaintiff failed to establish that she occupied a comparable job to males when the higher paid managers had much greater experience and a greater array of responsibilities,and the plaintiff did not perform all of the functions that these managers performed.sprague,at.each of these considerations is equally present in our case,and we discern no way we could conscientiously come to a different result here than we did in sprague 
whether or not the county discriminated against her on the basis of sex,johnson argues it violated title vii by retaliating against her for alleging that it did.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under title vii,a plaintiff must show that she engaged in protected opposition to discrimination she suffered an adverse action that a reasonable employee would have found material and there is a causal nexus between her opposition and the employer adverse action.williams sports,cir quoting antonio,at.before us,the county does not dispute that johnson engaged in protected activities by complaining of discrimination both internally and to the eeoc,starting in september.instead,the county and the district court have suggested that johnson claim fails at the second step because any actions county employees took against johnson can not be fairly described as materially adverse.
in approaching the question whether any actions the county took against johnson were materially adverse,we are obliged to bear in mind that title vii protects individuals not from all retaliation but only from retaliation that produces an injury or harm that itself rises to a level of seriousness.id.at quoting burlington santa fe ry.white.to qualify under this standard,we held in williams that a plaintiff must show a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.quoting white,at internal quotation marks omitted.requiring this level of adversity is necessary to separate significant from trivial harms,id.quoting white,at,petty slights,minor annoyances,and simple lack of good manners,white,at.otherwise,minor and even trivial employment actions that an irritable,employee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination suit.mackenzie city county of denver,cir quoting smart ball state,cir.
in seeking to satisfy this standard,johnson argues before us that,shortly after she first complained of discrimination,speckman and bogott gave her the cold shoulder,sat farther away from her at meetings,became too busy to answer her questions,and generally tried to avoid her.at.we agree with the district court,however,that these alleged snubs,though surely unpleasant and disturbing,are insufficient to support a claim of retaliation under our case law.see,white,at citing barbara lindemann paul grossman,employment discrimination law ed noting that snubbing by supervisors is not actionable retaliation mackenzie,at holding that silent treatment is mere passive treatment that does not constitute an adverse employment action see also recio creighton,cir holding silent treatment not materially adverse mlynczak bodman,cir holding shunn ing by not actionable retaliation 
alternatively,johnson argues that bogott retaliated against her by urging her not to consult an attorney.the only evidence johnson cites in support of this claim,however,is her contemporary diary entry indicating that bogott told her that there was no reason for an attorney because he believed johnson grievance concerning her discontinued temporary pay increase had been resolved.at.and merely suggesting on one occasion to an employee that she not get the lawyers involved simply does not rise to the level of material adversity necessary to sustain a retaliation claim,as we previously recognized in garrison gambro,cir 
paralleling her title vii claims,johnson asserts the county violated the ada,et,by discriminating against her on the basis of her multiple sclerosis when it chose bogott instead of her to serve as the county fiscal officer 
where,as here,an ada plaintiff seeks to proceed to trial exclusively on the basis of circumstantial evidence of discrimination,we have held that the analytical framework first articulated in mcdonnell douglas in the context of title vii claims controls our analysis.mackenzie,at accordingly,the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination,showing a genuine issue of material fact exists on each of three points she is a disabled person as defined by the ada she is qualified,with or without reasonable accommodation,to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired and her employer discriminated against her because of her disability.id.if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.should the defendant articulate a nondiscriminatory reason,the burden shifts back to plaintiff to show a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendant reason for the discharge is pretextual.id.citation omitted.
the district court held that johnson failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because she failed to adduce evidence suggesting that she is a disabled person within the meaning of the ada.the ada defines a disability as either a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.before us,johnson challenges the district court holding,arguing that she had a substantially limiting impairment subsection a and that speckman regarded her as having such an impairment subsection c we address these contentions in turn.
to establish an ada disability under subsection a,our precedent indicates that a plaintiff must articulate with precision both her impairment and the major life activity it substantially limited.doebele mgmt,cir quoting poindexter atchison,topeka santa fe ry,cir.an impairment is substantially limiting when it renders an individual either unable or significantly restricted in her ability to perform a major life activity compared to the average person in the general population.id.at.
johnson claims her multiple sclerosis limited her ability to work.whether work qualifies as a major life activity for purposes of the ada is a question this court has not resolved,though we have previously assumed without deciding it does.see croy cobe,cir.proceeding on that same assumption here,to avoid summary judgment johnson must still point us to some evidence that her disease su
