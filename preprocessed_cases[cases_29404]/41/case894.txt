introduction 
laurie strong challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of university healthcare system,uhs dismissing her title vii retaliation claims.we must decide whether,within the applicable mcdonnell douglas framework,strong has shown that uhs would not have terminated her employment but for its alleged retaliatory motive.
factual background 
uhs is a large hospital in louisiana.prior to the termination of her employment,strong worked for approximately two years as a nurse coordinator in the liver department of uhs abdominal transplant center.
on december,strong attended a uhs meeting called by susan andrews,one of strong numerous supervisors.at the meeting,strong complained that douglas slakey,a surgeon,discriminated against her because she is a woman.strong cited three separate incidents he called her lazy he called her stupid and lazy and screamed at her and he got angry at her during a meeting.
in january,strong asked andrews about the status of her complaint against slakey.andrews responded that it was under consideration and that the details were confidential.soon after,andrews met with strong and reaffirmed that the matter was being reviewed and that further details were confidential.
before and after strong complained about slakey work conduct,however,strong conduct also was called into question.between late and early,numerous patients,supervisors and doctors complained about strong behavior in the workplace.
specifically,in october,a staff member reported that strong asked her to perform duties that were strong responsibility to perform in december,a patient husband reported that strong was rude and demeaning to his wife in,a surgeon reported that,in front of new employees,strong inappropriately commented that physicians at uhs use livers that are no good and high risk in,jeannette hammond and louis larmeu,two more of strong supervisors,reported that during a meeting initiated to address other matters,strong brought up her complaint against slakey and persisted in knowing its status also in,marian,director of nursing and seemingly strong most direct supervisor,reported that strong attitude was combative when given orders on january,a patient filed an official grievance against strong regarding her treatment of him in,a staff member reported that strong refused to see a patient who had been waiting in a room for over an hour also in,a nurse under strong supervision complained that strong mistreated him and in general,uhs employees observed that strong continuously showed supervisors little respect and challenged their authority.
strong was talked to or counseled by different supervisors after a number of the incidents.although strong does not explain exactly what the talks or counselings entailed,they appear to have been informal and brief discussions initiated to address the substance of particular complaints made against strong.strong disagrees with the allegations underlying some of the complaints.importantly,however,she does not allege that the complaints were made in retaliation for her complaint against slakey.
strong alleged disruptiveness continued even after supervisors confronted her.on march,implemented a new policy requiring that lab reports be entered by clerks rather than nurse coordinators.strong commented that the new policy was silly.to uhs supervisors,the comment was another example of strong tendency to challenge authority and exhibit a negative or hostile attitude in the workplace.
on march,asked strong to call the operating room to check on a transplant patient.strong resisted and had to be asked multiple times to make the call.later that day,a doctor reported to hammond again,one of strong supervisors that strong made negative comments about a transplant patient before the patient had even been seen by a doctor,and improperly steered patients away from certain doctors.
on march,during a meeting with andrews and,strong became combative and aggressive after being asked to inform a supervisor when dealing with a patient.she accused them of threatening her.in response,andrews and asked a human resources hr employee to join the meeting.it ended when strong asked one supervisor if she was done.
later that day,a staff member reported that strong erroneously characterized a patient as an alcohol drinker not eligible for a liver transplant.strong got the misinformation from a page from a different patient file,which mistakenly had been placed in the wrong file by a clerk.however,uhs partially faulted strong for not catching the error,which it determined should have been noticed after an adequate reading of the entire file.
according to uhs,the incident was the proverbial straw that broke the camel back.andrews decided to suspend strong with pay.strong then told hr she thought she was being retaliated against.but when hr asked strong to expand on her allegation of retaliation,she refused.
days later,hr asked strong to come to a meeting to explain her allegation of retaliation.strong came to the meeting,but provided hr with no evidence of retaliation.hr ultimately concluded that strong retaliation allegation had no merit.
on march,hr called strong to another meeting.there,uhs provided strong with reasons for her continued suspension poor performance and improper work conduct,including redirecting patients away from certain doctors,presenting patients in a negative fashion,arguing with superiors,and engaging in behavior obstructive to various department policies.strong provided no evidence at that time suggesting that the real reason was retaliation.
after further investigation and consideration,uhs fired strong on march,citing the numerous incidents outlined above.the decision was made collectively by her many supervisors.
procedural history 
on november,strong filed a complaint against uhs alleging violations of title vii and louisiana law.first,she alleged gender discrimination based on the incidents with slakey.second,she alleged retaliation based on her termination a few months after complaining of discrimination.
uhs moved for summary judgment,asking that the discrimination claims be dismissed because the three incidents with slakey were too insignificant to be actionable,and that the retaliation claims be dismissed because strong failed to present legally sufficient evidence that uhs stated reasons for firing strong were pretextual.
the district court agreed with both of uhs arguments and dismissed strong claims.on appeal,strong does not challenge the dismissal of her gender discrimination claims.she does,however,challenge the dismissal of her retaliation claims 
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.chacko sabre,cir.summary judgment is proper when there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgement as a matter of law.c.
legal analysis 
basic retaliation law 
because strong retaliation claims are based on a pretext theory,our analysis is governed by the mcdonnell douglas test and its framework.septimus of houston,cir.thus,to start,strong must make a prima facie showing that her termination was retaliatory.id.at.for summary judgment purposes only,uhs conceded at the district court that strong made a prima facie showing.
the burden then shifts to uhs to state a legitimate,reason for firing strong.id.uhs points to the long list of occurrences between october and march,and strong does not dispute that such occurrences provide an adequate,legal reason for termination.
finally,the burden shifts back to strong.id.her ultimate burden is to show pretext that is,to prove by a preponderance that uhs fired her not for its stated reasons,but in retaliation for her gender discrimination complaint against slakey.see id.
burden of proof 
it is well established that strong ultimately must prove that uhs stated reason for the adverse action was merely a pretext for the real,retaliatory purpose.id.at.surprisingly,the parties disagree whether strong must show that she would not have been fired but for uhs alleged retaliatory purpose.strong,relying on numerous ca
