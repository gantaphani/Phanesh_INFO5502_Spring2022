the oakland county community mental health authority provide s a comprehensive array of mental health services appropriate to individuals who are located within its geographic service area,regardless of an individual ability to pay.comp.laws.a board oversees the authority,id,and the executive director has control over the authority,id.
the executive director function s as the chief executive of the program.id.in supervising all employees,the executive director has authority to appoint a psychiatrist as medical director to advise the executive director on medical policy and treatment issues,id.
in,the authority restructured its organization,which among other things entailed its responsibilities.by october,the authority had completed the restructuring so that private contractors provided all patient care.
in november,the authority elevated nair from a position as the interim medical director,which he had held since january,to that of the permanent medical director.and in november,the authority hired william allen as its executive director.
in early,to trim administrative expenses,allen proposed reducing the position,which was paid per hour,from to.nair disagreed with the proposal,believing that it would further erode the role of the medical director to the detriment of the agency.ja.he sent allen,faxes and other documents to convince him the position required hours.notwithstanding nair objections,the reduction took effect in june.
one month later,nair raised the issue with a survey team,which displeased allen.in october,allen reviewed nair performance.while o verall,nair performance ha d met the conditions of his position,ja,allen found that more effort was needed in terms of providing assertive medical leadership,ja.
on november,still bothered by the reduction in his hours,nair sent a letter to the board outlining his concerns about his diminished responsibilities.s teadily and deliberately,he complained,the responsibilities of the medical director have been curtailed and recently the position has been downgraded to halftime level.ja.nair requested that the board set up a committee to study the role of the medical director in an agency like this.id.the letter concluded by asking the board to consider this matter urgent and have a response as soon as possible,as i have serious concerns about my legal,ethical and moral obligations.ja.
allen viewed the letter as an insubordinate act on nair part and informed him on november that this will have serious consequences to it.ja.a ny future efforts to go to the board before addressing issues with me,allen noted,will not be tolerated.ja.on november,allen sent nair a memo stating,i continue to be concerned about your lack of leadership with regard to medical director responsibilities and your constant concern about being to rather than assertively handling your responsibilities.ja.
on november,clifford johnson,the chairman of the board,responded to nair letter.johnson pointed out that the elimination of the authority direct care responsibilities had necessarily altered the function of the medical director.ja.he also noted that the medical director is selected and hired by,and supervised by,the executive director.ja.as a direct subordinate without duties,nair sole purpose was to add his professional expertise and perspective to the overall management effort.id.johnson thus saw no legitimate basis for the board action you request.id.
on february,allen terminated nair,telling him that i t just was working out.ja.in response,nair filed a complaint in federal court against the authority and allen,alleging that they had terminated him in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights and in violation of michigan whistleblowers protection act.claiming that it was an arm of the state because it received over of its budget from the state and because state money ultimately would be used to satisfy any judgment against it,the authority claimed that the eleventh amendment barred the lawsuit from being heard in federal court.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.in doing so,it did not address the authority defense but instead ruled that because nair speech did not touch on a matter of public concern,it could not form the basis of a first amendment retaliation claim,and that because nair was not attempting to report a hidden violation of law,he could not bring a claim under michigan whistleblower statute.
while the authority has raised a defense to this lawsuit,it has not urged us to address the defense at the outset and indeed has presented the defense as an alternative ground for affirmance.this litigation stance prompts us to consider a jurisdictional question that the parties have not argued or identified is a defense more akin to an absence of jurisdiction,which must be addressed at the outset and which may not be affected by the parties litigation conduct,or more akin to other affirmative defenses,which need not be addressed at the outset and which a defendant may waive 
from one vantage point,the defense looks like a contention that jurisdiction is missing.while the tenth amendment does not speak in terms,see alden maine,d noting that a state sovereign immunity arises under the tenth and eleventh amendments,and while the united states sovereign immunity is not described in the constitution at all,keifer keifer reconstruction fin,the eleventh amendment speaks in classic jurisdictional terms.the judicial power of the united states,it says,shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.except for capitalizing power rather than judicial,the article iii description of judicial authority and of limitations on that authority is strikingly similar to the eleventh amendment.in section one of article iii,the constitution creates t he judicial power of the united states,and in section two it describes the jurisdiction of the federal courts,namely that t he judicial power shall extend to all cases,in law and equity,arising under this constitution in addition to this similarity in language,there are other parallels between the two jurisdictional limitations.like jurisdiction,a defense may be asserted for the first time on appeal,edelman jordan,d,and it may and should be raised by federal courts on their own initiative.of corr.schacht,d.
but w hile the eleventh amendment is jurisdictional in the sense that it is a limitation on the federal court judicial power,the defense is not coextensive with the limitations on judicial power in article iii.calderon ashmus,d.unlike jurisdiction,a state may waive eleventh amendment immunity through its own conduct by legislation,port auth.feeney,d by removing an action to federal court,lapides bd.of regents of the.of,d or by appearing without objection and defending on the merits,ku tennessee,cir ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d n o action of the parties can confer jurisdiction upon a federal court.thus,the consent of the parties is irrelevant.unlike jurisdiction,federal courts have no obligation to raise an eleventh amendment issue on their own,even though they may do so if they wish.schacht,at.nor need a court raise an eleventh amendment defect on its own.unless the state raises the matter,a court can ignore it.ins.of ireland,at.a court,including an appellate court,will raise lack of jurisdiction on its own motion.and unlike jurisdiction,the entity asserting eleventh amendment immunity has the burden to show that it is entitled to immunity.gragg.cabinet for workforce,cir steel citizens for a better env t,d t he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its existence.
we have not spoken with one voice on whether we must,or whether we may,resolve a defense before addressing the merits.the most thorough discussion of the issue appears in caviness,cir,which reasoned that state immunity is jurisdictional in the same sense as the complete diversity requirement or the complaint rule and concluded that a defense had to be addressed before the merits.but was decided before schacht,which held that federal courts need not raise a defense on their own initiative,and was decided before lapides,which held that a state voluntary removal of a case from state court waives the defense.in view of these intervening supreme court decisions,we have said that is no longer good law when it comes to its statement that sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in the same sense as jurisdiction.kovacevich kent state,cir.kovacevich,however,proceeded to address the jurisdictional issue first and did not explain a court obligation in this area,even if as the court concluded sovereign immunity does not parallel jurisdiction.
both before and after kovacevich,we have issued several opinions saying that we must address the issue first.see,angel kentucky,cir we must therefore address the jurisdictional eleventh amendment question that clearly exists,even though it was not addressed by the court below.band of pottawatomi indians engler,cir stating that jurisdictional issues,including an eleventh amendment defense,must be addressed prior to reaching the merits rossborough trimble,cir as a threshold matter,we must determine whether the treasurer and the administrator are entitled to eleventh amendment immunity.johnson of cincinnati,cir we first address defendants eleventh amendment immunity defense because this defense raises a question of federal jurisdiction.wells brown,cir we are required to decide the eleventh amendment issue before we decide the merits.childs koosed,wl,at cir,in view of the district court disposition of the claims on eleventh amendment grounds,the district court was without jurisdiction to make the alternative ruling on the merits.see also haas quest recovery,d,although ohio couches its eleventh amendment argument as an alternative basis for dismissal,the court addresses jurisdictional arguments first.
and both before and after kovacevich,we have issued several opinions saying that we need not address the issue first.see,alkire irving,cir deciding to p ut the issue of sovereign immunity to the side and proceeding to consider the merits of alkire claims brindley best,cir w e need not decide whether the eleventh amendment bars plaintiff claims because the defendants should prevail on the merits.vandiver hardin county bd.of,cir the parties raise arguments regarding sovereign immunity for the commonwealth of kentucky.in light of our disposition on the merits,it is unnecessary to address these points.linser ohio dep t of mental health,wl,at cir,given the unsettled nature of the law regarding states eleventh amendment immunity as to titles i and ii of the ada,we do not address the question of whether linser claims are barred by the eleventh amendment.instead we address only the merits of linser claims.rowlands pointe mouille shooting club,wl,at cir.july,because plaintiff claim fails on procedural grounds,we need not decide the issue of whether the eleventh amendment bars a qui tam suit.steel constr,herman,cir having concluded that rule sanctions may not be incorporated into the commission rules,we need not decide whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity also precludes an award of rule sanctions against the united states in proceedings before the commission.
our sister courts of appeals have reached different conclusions on the point.four courts of appeals have held that the immunity question,like the article iii question,must be resolved before the merits.see united states.tech,cir in re jackson,cir martin kansas,cir seaborn.dep t of,cir.and six courts of appeals have held that the immunity question need not be addressed before the merits.see in re hechinger inv.of,cir strawser atkins,cir gordon city of kansas city,cir united states ex rel.long scs bus.tech,parella ret.bd.of the employee ret,cir compare kennedy juvenile ass n,cir with floyd thompson,cir.another circuit appears to have reached conflicting conclusions on the issue.compare ret.of morgan chase,cir and tyler douglas,cir holding that the court may avoid the question with dotson griesa,cir and hale mann,cir holding that the court must address the question at the outset because it is jurisdictional.
while the trend in this area seems to favor giving federal courts discretion over the issue,we need not decide the point because there is a narrower ground for decision,one that we suspect will account for most situations in which the issue arises.the most salient difference between sovereign immunity and jurisdiction is that the former may be altered by the parties litigation conduct while the latter may not be.and it is just one party litigation sovereign that may alter the existence of jurisdiction.if it is true that sovereign immunity may be waived and if it is true that just one party the state may waive the defense,the state would seem to be free to express whatever preference it wishes about whether the defense is a threshold issue or one that arises only if the sovereign would otherwise lose on the merits.surely a state that has authority to waive the broader question of whether it is amenable to suit at all,alden,at,has authority to waive the narrower question of whether a court must address a defense before the merits.because sovereign immunity grants the state a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so,schacht,at,it is hard to say that this right has been diminished when a state choose s whether to express a mercenary interest only in prevailing by any order of decision or to express a dignity interest in immediately divesting the federal courts of jurisdiction over the dispute.see fed.com state ports,d stating that a critical purpose of state sovereign immunity is to accord states the dignity that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities.if a state refuses to invoke its sovereign immunity as a threshold defense,usually by way of a motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,it can not credibly be heard to complain about the indignity of the federal courts resolving the merits of its in its favor no less.
in a related setting,the supreme court has given states some control over the order in which federal courts address defenses.in puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority metcalf eddy,d,the court held that states and state entities that claim to be arms of the state may take advantage of the collateral order doctrine to appeal a district court order denying a claim of eleventh amendment immunity.but in doing so the court did not require states immediately to appeal the denial of immunity.if a state may allow a district court to consider the merits before an appellate court considers its defense,it is difficult to see why a state should be prevented from allowing an appellate court to consider these same questions in the same order.
the defendants in this instance raised sovereign immunity as an alternative ground for rejecting nair claims.see def.br.at the eleventh amendment bar is applicable on an alternative basis for dismissal of plaintiff claim.under these circumstances and under any circumstances in which the state or the united states declines to raise sovereign immunity as a threshold defense,we conclude that the federal courts have discretion to address the defense and the merits in whichever order they prefer.to our knowledge,no court of appeals to consider this question has held to the contrary,and several have explicitly or implicitly embraced this approach.see bowers ncaa,cir inasmuch as the defendant does not urge that we resolve the eleventh amendm
