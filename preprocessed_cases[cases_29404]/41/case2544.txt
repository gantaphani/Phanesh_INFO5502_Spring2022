eight former employees of the vail clinic,a hospital in vail,colorado,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the clinic on their title vii claims.see title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et.title vii or the act.with respect to five of the appealing plaintiffs,we conclude that they fail to establish,as they must,the timeliness of their claims.with respect to the remaining three plaintiffs,we are able to address the substance of their appeal but,like the district court,conclude that they have not adduced facts from which a reasonable jury could find a violation of title vii.on these bases,we affirm 
summary judgment follows when a moving party points to the absence of factual support on an element essential to the case,and on which the bears the burden of proof at trial.see celotex catrett,d.the clinic argues that the plaintiffs in this case have failed to present record evidence sufficient to suggest that they filed timely title vii charges with the federal equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,and that proof of such a timely charge is a condition precedent to bringing suit.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and the parties legal arguments de novo,young dillon,cir,we are constrained to agree with respect to five of the eight plaintiffs before us.
an employee wishing to challenge an employment practice under title vii must first file a charge of discrimination with the eeoc.e ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,d.because title vii seeks to avoid the pressing of stale claims,it requires aggrieved persons to file any such charge within certain specified periods after the allegedly unlawful conduct occurred.zipes trans world airlines,d quotation omitted.if the employee does not submit a timely eeoc charge,he or she may not proceed to court.ledbetter.at.while the applicable deadline for filing a charge with the eeoc depends on a variety of circumstances,the latest possible filing date is days after the last allegedly unlawful act.see e.
here,the last alleged violation of title vii for each plaintiff coincided with his or her termination date and the undisputed facts reveal that five of the eight plaintiffs before us nely davila,margarita erazo,willie mae hopkins,elizabeth jaramillo,and mervyn vargas,filed their charges with the eeoc more than days after their respective terminations.under our precedents and those of the supreme court,this combination of facts would seem to require dismissal of the claims of these particular plaintiffs.see holmes utah,dep t of workforce,cir dismissing allegations which did not occur within the day filing period see also ledbetter.at.
specifically,the record before us reflects that most of the plaintiffs departed the clinic between november and may beginning approximately six months later,on november,and proceeding at various dates through april,they filed sworn charges with the eeoc.the following chart summarizes the exact dates on which each plaintiff was terminated and filed his or her charge with the eeoc 
as the chart reflects,all but escobedo,garcia and montes,filed charges with the eeoc more than three hundred days after their delay that would seemingly prove fatal to their effort to challenge the clinic conduct in court.
plaintiffs suggest that this case is more complicated because they filed charges within the meaning of title vii even before the dates reflected above.in support of this contention,plaintiffs submit that,long before they presented formal charges to the eeoc,they contacted the colorado civil rights division ccrd first by letter from their counsel on august,and then,shortly thereafter,by completing intake forms with the division.these contacts with the ccrd,they contend,suffice to qualify as the filing of charges with the eeoc under title vii.defendants,meanwhile,emphasize that no evidence reflecting or regarding these contacts with the ccrd exists in the record before us and urge that this deficiency is dispositive.we must agree.the viability of plaintiffs argument can be assessed only with a review of the content of their submissions to the ccrd without counsel letter or the intake forms all materials that are uniquely within plaintiffs control,we are unable to do more than speculate whether they qualified as charges or whether they were filed within the time period prescribed by law.and speculate we may not do.see bones honeywell,cir to defeat a motion for summary judgment,evidence,including testimony,must be based on more than mere speculation,conjecture,or surmise.
indeed,to ascertain whether plaintiffs materials might or might not qualify as filed charges with the eeoc is not the straightforward task it might at first blush seem.the question what sort of documents suffice to qualify as charges under title vii is surprisingly unresolved,see,ledbetter.at edelman lynchburg college,d,and has generated a circuit split some courts suggest that an informal intake questionnaire filed with a state entity like the ccrd or the eeoc almost always constitutes an eeoc charge others hold that it will rarely do so these competing positions are anchored by the ninth and sixth circuits,respectively many circuits appear to populate some form of middle ground while these circuits agree that a completed questionnaire must meet the eeoc regulations prescribing the minimum contents of a charge,see minimum contents of a title vii charge id.minimum contents of an adea charge,they differ on what more is required.most apply some variant of the manifestation of intent whether a reasonable person would have known that the aggrieved person intended to activate the act machinery through his or her submission of a some consider additional factors to date,at least,our circuit has not been called to voice a view.
plaintiffs argument would,of course,change all that and require us to decide whether and when the completion of an informal intake form with the ccrd may qualify as a charge with the eeoc.but without the plaintiffs actual ccrd filings,or even some meaningful record evidence about their contents,we would be marching into an intercircuit split unable to contribute thoughtfully to the discussion or even fairly resolve this appeal,for we could not begin to say whether plaintiffs filings meet even the minimum required to be considered a charge under any of the tests advanced by the circuit courts.taking the most permissive standard applied by courts for determining whether submission of a questionnaire with a state entity constitutes a charge under title vii,a plaintiff state filing must satisfy the charge content regulations promulgated by the eeoc.see,casavantes,at.the applicable eeoc regulations,in turn,require a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties,and to describe generally the action or practices complained of.see b.although this standard is not demanding,we simply can not know whether it is satisfied in this case without an examination of plaintiffs submission to the ccrd.thus,for example,title vii requires each discrete act of discrimination such as termination,failure to promote,denial of transfer,or refusal to hire to be described in and the subject of a timely filed charge.see passenger morgan,d see also davidson am.online,cir a claimant must file a charge of discrimination within the appropriate limitations period as to each such discrete act of discrimination that occurred.that is,a plaintiff can bring a lawsuit for only those unlawful employment practices described in his or her administrative charge.because we have no idea what acts of discrimination the plaintiffs in question included within their ccrd submission,we are in no position to assess what claims they may have preserved for litigation.
we find ourselves in an equally problematic position with respect to the question whether the alleged submission to the ccrd was ever filed with the eeoc in the requisite day period.see e see also ledbetter.at.even assuming that plaintiffs unproduced state submissions qualify as charges,we do not know when they were filed with the eeoc.if plaintiffs asked the ccrd to forward their charges to the eeoc,a filing would have been effected under eeoc regulations at most days later,on october.see b.however,if plaintiffs did not so request,the ccrd documents would not have been filed with the eeoc unless i plaintiffs filed them with the eeoc themselves,or ii plaintiffs alleged and provided evidence of the existence of a worksharing agreement whereby the ccrd acted as the agent of the eeoc for purposes of accepting a charge even in the absence of a forwarding request.see,johnson hunt,cir holding that,in light of a worksharing agreement between the state agency and the eeoc,a charge of discrimination filed with the state agency was properly filed with the eeoc on the same date.because the record before us does not include plaintiffs ccrd submission,and because there is no other evidence in the record suggesting that either a forwarding request was made or that a worksharing agreement existed,we simply can not know whether plaintiffs filed within the requisite statutory time period.
recognizing the limits of the record before us,plaintiffs offer two fallback arguments.
first,they assert that the eeoc doctrine dissipates any cause for concern about the timeliness of their charges.see reply br.pursuant to that doctrine,a defective charge filed during the applicable period may be amended outside the limitations period to cure technical defects or omissions if the amendments are directly related to or growing out of the subject matter of the original charge.b see also edelman,at.but the principle applies,and a prior defective charge may be subsequently amended,only when the earlier filing can itself be fairly construed to operate as a charge.see peterson city of wichita,cir permitting relation back where plaintiff submitted to the eeoc a timely though unverified charge see also edelman lynchburg,cir pijnenburg.health,cir.plaintiffs argument thus underscores rather than resolves our quandary,turning as it necessarily does on an assumption that their initial letter and intake forms to the ccrd qualified as charges to the eeoc,a question we simply are unable to answer on the record before us.
second,plaintiffs respond that it was the clinic,not them,who bore the burden of producing the ccrd correspondence and intake forms because whether plaintiffs filed a charge within the filing deadline is properly understood only as an affirmative defense and thus a matter on which the clinic bore the burden of proof.this,however,is an argument our precedents foreclose.while title vii mandatory time limit for filing charges with the eeoc is not a jurisdictional prerequisite and is thus subject to waiver,estoppel,and tolling when equity requires,see zipes,at,the obligation to demonstrate timeliness in filing a charge is a condition precedent to suit and thus a burden for plaintiffs to carry,see million frank,cir the supreme court has repeatedly described compliance with section e filing requirements as prerequisites that a plaintiff must satisfy before filing suit,morgan,at,noting as well that t imely filing is a prerequisite to the maintenance of a title vii action,united air lines,evans,d.in consonance with these directives,we and every circuit court to address the question directly therefore have deemed compliance with title vii filing deadline as a condition precedent rather than an affirmative defense.see million,at t he filing requirements of title vii are condition s precedent alexander local,laborers int l union of,cir lawrence cooper,cir perkins silverstein,cir jackson seaboard coast line,cir 
the structure of the act supports this conclusion.the filing deadlines associated with a title vii charge are integrated into the statutory section that delineates the various other steps a prospective plaintiff must satisfy before being given the keys to the courthouse door to file a complaint.see generally f requiring notification of the commission dismissal of,or failure to act upon,a charge filed pursuant to the statutory scheme prior to bringing a civil action see also ledbetter.at.this is in contrast to traditional affirmative defenses which are separate bars to suit and often not so integrated into the plaintiffs cause of action.jones bock,d in holding that the exhaustion requirement contained in the prison litigation reform act,et.plra,was an affirmative defense to action brought under,the court found significant that the plra itself is not a source of a prisoner claim rather,section was and it does not require exhaustion.placing the burden upon plaintiffs makes sense,too,of the practical realities at hand,for they enjoy superior access to the evidence necessary to prove their compliance with the statutory filing deadline,here their own letter and completed state forms.see wright graham,federal practice and procedure evidence at accord united states cont.ins,cir old ben coal interior bd.of mine op,cir 
unaffected by our analysis and disposition so far are the timely claims of escobedo,garcia,and montes.with respect to each,and by turn,we outline the relevant timely factual allegations and pertinent legal analysis.
escobedo,a hispanic woman of mexican descent,worked as a housekeeper in the clinic operating room department from approximately december through november.see app.at.escobedo claims revolve primarily around two facts an instruction she received to speak only english in the clinic operating rooms,and additional work she received from her supervisor that prompted her to quit.combined,she contends,these circumstances suffice to give rise to title vii claims for hostile work environment and disparate treatment.
because she had difficulty speaking english,see app.at,when she began working at the clinic escobedo primarily communicated with the english speaking operating room nurses through the aid of an interpreter.see app.at see also id.at.once,albeit in what she describes as a nice way,an operating room nurse asked escobedo to speak in english the nurse explained that she would like escobedo to practice her english because being more proficient would aid her job performance.see id.at.escobedo testified that she did indeed have difficulty receiving lengthy instruction from the nurses and that her job duties required quickly and carefully cleaning the operating rooms in compliance with directions from the operating room nurses.see see also id.at.
a few months later,onesima mejia,the housekeeping department supervisor,acting upon the request of the same operating room nurse,reiterated the nurse instruction that escobedo and the other operating room housekeeper speak english rather than spanish while working in the operating rooms.id.at.however,escobedo was expressly permitted to speak spanish during her breaks.id.at.neither does escobedo allege that she,or any other housekeeper,was asked to speak english outside of the operating room department or forbidden from engaging in related conversations with other spanish speakers in her native tongue escobedo also testified that she never complained about the nurses instruction,see id.at,although she reported other grievances,including the increased work assignments she received from mejia,see,id.at.
escobedo complains that,from shortly after she joined the clinic to the day of her resignation,her duties were repeatedly enlarged to include chores the nurses had previously been responsible for,such as stocking medical supplies in the operating rooms and moving stretchers from one room to another.see id.at.the nurses explained that other hospital staff had too much work and that the housekeepers essentially had to fill the gap.id.at.escobedo resigned because of this additional eventually became too much.id.at.however,she does not allege that the nurses assigned her work out of any ill will.to the contrary,she repeatedly testified that she got along well with the nurses their positive feedback to douglas grinnell,the housekeeping department manager,and mejia was the reason she received raises and on at least one occasion they tried to intervene on her behalf with mejia.see,id.at.neither does escobedo allege that she was singled out for additional work rather,she testified that she never believed she was assigned any more work than anyone else.see id.at.
escobedo informed mejia and grinnell of the difficult workload and requested they hire an additional housekeeper,something which they declined to do.see id.at.stan anderson,grinnell superior and the clinic director of facilities,testified that grinnell was tasked with b udgetary control of the housekeeping department and that the marching orders were to maintain the existing budget.id.at.the message sent from anderson was that the staffing was already very,very generous and not to enlarge the staff,though grinnell was not expressly forbidden from doing so.id.
escobedo claims that the foregoing instruction plus the additional work assignments she rise in the first instance to a claim for hostile work environment.in determining whether an actionable hostile work environment existed,we look to all the circumstances,morgan,at.quotation omitted,to see if the workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiff employment,and if the plaintiff was subjected to this abusive environment because of her national origin.herrera lufkin,cir quotation omitted.
in this undertaking,we consider all the circumstances not from the plaintiff subjective point of view but from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position.id.still,the victim must also subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive because without such a belief,the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim employment.harris forklift,d emphasis added see also id.at.ginsburg,concurring it suffices to prove that a reasonable person subjected to the discriminatory conduct would find,as the plaintiff did,that the harassment so altered working conditions as to make it more difficult to do the job.quotation and alteration omitted.the question on summary judgment,then,is whether a jury,in view of all of the evidence,could reasonably conclude the discriminatory harassment to be sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,meritor sav.bank vinson,d quotation omitted,and that the victim subjectively perceived the environment to be abusive,harris,at.
we begin by recognizing that instructions indeed can,in certain circumstances,create a hostile atmosphere for hispanics in their workplace and thus violate title vii.maldonado city of altus,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds,burlington santa fe ry.white,d see also garcia gloor,cir noting that while n either the statute nor common understanding equates national origin with the language that one chooses to speak,l anguage may be used as a covert basis for national origin discrimination a observing that policies may foster a sense of inferiority,isolation and intimidation based on an employee national origin 
to date,however,we have addressed only a sweeping policy mechanically enforced by an employer in all circumstances and at all times within the work environment we have not had occasion to review a more tailored policy limited,like the one now before us,to specific places or times within the workplace.see maldonado,at holding that an policy,which applied at all times to all employees regardless of occupation or activity,may have created a hostile work environment.
for its part,however,the eeoc,expressly distinguishes between policies on just this basis.see.with respect to policies blithely enforced at all times and places in the work environment,the eeoc presumes,subject to rebuttal,that they violate title vii.see id.a.with respect to tailored policies applicable only at certain times or places,the eeoc endorses no such presumption,suggesting that such rules may more often be linked to legitimate business necessit ies.id.b.
while the eeoc guidelines are not controlling,maldonado,at,we have intimated that they are nonetheless entitled to respect,not as interpretations of the governing law,but as an indication of what a reasonable,informed person may think about the impact of an work rule on minority employees,even if we might not draw the same inference.id.at.it is with this standard in mind that we turn to a consideration of the policy before us.
the rule complained of here prohibited escobedo and other housekeepers from speaking spanish solely while working in the operating room department,and apparently only for discussions,and carried with it a conceded business necessity.the policy bore no apparent effect in any other place within the clinic or during escobedo breaks or to discussions unrelated to her job,and thus,according to the eeoc,is a policy applicable only at certain times or places justifiable on a showing of business necessity.see,decision,fair empl.prac.cas.bna,wl,at.likewise,it is undisputed that clear and precise communication between the cleaning staff and the medical staff was essential in the operating rooms that the sanitariness of the operating rooms was of paramount importance to the hospital not to mention the health and safety of its patients and that most of the operating room nurses did not speak spanish and thus could not communicate with escobedo without resort to an policy.see appellee br.app.at.escobedo herself admits that maintaining the sanitariness of the operating rooms necessitated the quick and careful performance of her duties and that communication with the nurses was essential.neither do we have any evidence before us that the clinic policy was the product of,or resulted in,any sort of discriminatory animus 
all of this taken narrowness of the clinic policy,its origin in the clinic undisputed business necessity,and the absence of any evidence suggesting that the policy was the product of improper motive or that it gave rise to any discriminatory this case from the policy we faced in maldonado and the sorts of cases the eeoc has found to violate title vii.see maldonado,at observing that the business necessity proffered by the defendant was scant and that the blanket policy gave rise to ethnic taunting see also,christina childress air force,eeoc doc,wl,at july.on the record before us,and in consonance with the eeoc views,we therefore can not see any reasonable basis for concluding the clinic policy sufficient to give rise to a hostile work environment claim.
with respect to her claims of additional work assignments,escobedo makes no allegation that she or any other employee was singled out on the basis of race or national origin.in fact,she testified that she believed her work assignments were excessive because there was a shortage of housekeeping staff.
of course,even when an increase in assignments is not on its face discriminatory,if there exists other evidence of discriminatory conduct,a jury may reasonably infer that even seemingly work assignments were in fact motivated by discriminatory animus.see chavez new mexico,cir.but in order for facially conduct to be so tainted,the other conduct at issue must be overtly discriminatory.id.quoting yellow tech,cir.here,however,the only conduct by the nurses which even tangentially relates to escobedo national origin is the instruction related to the operating rooms.but,as we have noted,escobedo has not alleged that it was a vehicle to effect any discriminatory animus harbored by the nurses,let alone provide evidence of such intent or effect to the contrary,escobedo testified that she got along well with the nurses and they supported her in disputes with her supervisors.this evidence before us thus simply does not permit an inference of overt discrimination as required by our precedent and we can not say that the combination of the two incidents could reasonably be found to have created a hostile atmosphere.see bolden prc,cir holding that plaintiff failed to present a triable issue as to a hostile work environment where the derisive environment in the workshop was universal he was not singled out for he failed to show the derisive atmosphere stemmed from racial animus,at,holding that the obviously sex and conduct by a,inter alia,his stated belief that women in general were incompetent,stupid and scatterbrained so poisoned the entire body of conduct toward plaintiff that a jury reasonably could view all of the allegedly harassing conduct as the product of sex and gender hostility 
beyond her hostile work environment claim,escobedo also seeks relief under a disparate treatment theory,relying here solely on her allegations of excessive work.to succeed in a disparate treatment claim,escobedo must show that,through her work assignments,the clinic intentionally discriminated against her.see ledbetter.at.because escobedo seeks to prove such animus solely through indirect or circumstantial evidence,we examine her claim through the prism of the familiar framework established by mcdonnell douglas corporation green,d.pursuant to mcdonnell douglas,a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.see young,at.once he or she does so,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.id.if the defendant satisfies its burden,the plaintiff must then show that the defendant proffered justification was simply pretext for unlawful discrimination.id.
for our purposes,even should we assume that the additional duties escobedo received qualify as a materially adverse employment action for purposes of mcdonnell douglas first step,her claim would still falter.there is no question in this case but that the clinic has articulate d some legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.young,at.escobedo herself testified that the nurses assigned additional work to her and other housekeepers because there was a shortage of staff,and that she was assigned no more work than any other housekeeper.there is record evidence,as well,that the housekeeping department was discouraged from enlarging its staff because of budgetary constraints.in light of these facts,we must acknowledge that the clinic has met its exceedingly light burden of establishing a legitimate,reason for its challenged actions under mcdonnell douglas second step,zamora elite logistics,cir en banc,by producing evidence that escobedo cleaning duties were increased in parity with other housekeepers and because of the surplus of work in the department the lack of additional staff to complete it and the need to keep costs down.
to reach trial,escobedo must therefore show that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the clinic justification was pretextual.young,at.to accomplish this,escobedo must present facts suggesting that the clinic proffered national origin neutral reasons were so incoherent,weak,inconsistent,or contradictory that a rational factfinder could conclude the reasons were unworthy of belief.id.at this escobedo fails to do.escobedo herself repeatedly testified to the excess work throughout the entire housekeeping department and its distribution.she does not allege that the clinic had an excess of funds or in any way contest its assertions of economy.neither does she contend that she received her new assignments because she was hispanic.rather,her own testimony establishes that she had at least a cordial relationship with the nursing staff and that they repeatedly commended the quality of her work to grinnell and mejia,which resulted in her receipt of a raise.based on these facts,we are without choice but to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the clinic as to escobedo claims 
garcia,a hispanic man,worked in the clinic housekeeping department from until.see app.garcia claims that the confluence of being assigned an excessive amount of work and the clinic policy of forbidding family members from visiting employees during work hours at the hospital gives rise to a hostile work environment claim.
much like escobedo,garcia claims that he was forced to resign because mejia assigned him a whole lot of additional work,and he could do that sort of work.id.at.he contends that he quit before attempting to take on mejia new work assignments because he was barely able to finish with the assignments that he had before.id.at.prior to the enlargement of his job responsibilities,garcia duties included cleaning offices,and part of a hallway,as well as disposing of the garbage in the infectious diseases wing of the hospital.see id.at.the additional work mejia sought to add included cleaning elevators,welcome mats,and sweeping and mopping stairways.see id.
garcia presented various reasons for mejia perceived mistreatment of him.initially,he testified that he did not know if discriminatory animus motivated mejia assignment of additional work,see id.at do you think you were getting this extra work because you were hispanic well,that i do know.later,he added his opinion that he was given too much work because he was hispanic,although he candidly admitted he had no facts to support this belief.see id.at.elsewhere still,he stated that mejia treated him more poorly when she was mad but he believed her anger was not personal to him and that he was not the cause of it rather,her anger stemmed from home issues.id.at.and,finally,garcia expressed the belief that the clinic assigned him excessive work in the hopes that he would resign so that it could hire a replacement at a lower wage.see id.at.
garcia complains as well that mejia and grinnell repeatedly expressed in housekeeping department meetings the clinic policy forbidding the housekeeping staff family members from waiting in the clinic lobby,see id.at,and he indicates that he was reprimanded sometime during january for failing to comply with this policy,see id.at i n january,onesima saw my wife in the lobby and told me again that my wife could not wait there.in response,anderson testified for the clinic that this policy applied to all departments,and his assertion has not been contradicted on appeal.see id.at see also id.at.
we are unable to discern from these limited facts a basis on which a reasonable jury might infer a hostile work environment in violation of title vii.none of the traditional hallmarks of such a claim,such as evidence of ridicule or mistreatment based on race or national origin,are present.trujillo of.health sciences,cir see also herrera,at see also pvnf,at.to be sure,at one point garcia expressed the view that he received additional work assignments because he is hispanic.but garcia then proceeded to walk away from that testimony,admitting that he had no factual basis for his opinion,and suggesting that mejia behavior was instead the product of personal home issues.at no point,moreover,has garcia contested that the clinic faced purely economic pressures that compelled its assignment of additional responsibilities to housekeeping staff.
similarly,a jury could not reasonably divine that mejia decision to discipline him for failing to comply with the clinic policy forbidding family members from entering the clinic had anything to do with garcia national origin.far from suggesting an inference that mejia or the clinic applied the policy only to hispanics or solely reprimanded hispanics or other minorities for violating the rule,the record before us contains uncontroverted evidence that the policy was applied to all clinic staff 
montes,a hispanic woman,was employed in the clinic housekeeping department from until she was fired in,a firing she contends was the result of unlawful retaliation.
during her time at the clinic,montes met with a lawyer regarding the potential of bringing this lawsuit against the clinic.see app.at.montes asserts that one of her,felipe martinez,knew of her meeting with counsel and told mejia.see id.at.fired two months later by grinnell,montes claims her discharge was the product of retaliatory animus and designed to punish her decision to seek legal consultation.see id.at.meanwhile,the clinic asserts that grinnell discharged montes for insubordination after she failed to follow a supervisor housekeeping directive.see id.at.montes candidly admits that,shortly before being fired,she did disregard an order from the clinic lead housekeeper,mercedes agurcia,but urges that her insubordination was justified because the duty agurcia sought to assign to her properly belonged to a different employee.see id
