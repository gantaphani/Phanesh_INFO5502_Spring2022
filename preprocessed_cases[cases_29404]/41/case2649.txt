plaintiffs filed suit seeking to have a colorado statute regulating abortion declared unconstitutional and to have enforcement of that statute enjoined.the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs,holding that the lack of a health exception for the parental notification requirement of the statute rendered it unconstitutional.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
the colorado parental notification act pna was adopted as an initiative in colorado general election of november,it generally requires that minors in the state of colorado provide notice to at least one of their parents before obtaining an abortion.the legislative declaration of the act states 
the people of the state of colorado declare that family life and the preservation of the traditional family unit are of vital importance to the continuation of an orderly society that the rights of parents to rear and nurture their children during their formative years and to be involved in all decisions of importance affecting such minor children should be protected and encouraged,especially as such parental involvement relates to the pregnancy of an unemancipated minor,recognizing that the decision by any such minor to submit to an abortion may have adverse consequences for her.
performance of an abortion on an unemancipated minor is specifically prohibited until at least hours after written notice is delivered to the minor parent,guardian,or foster parent.id.violation of the pna is a class one misdemeanor and creates liability for civil damages.id.
there are two exceptions to the pna notice requirement.first,the notice requirement does not apply if the persons entitled to notice certify in writing that they have already been notified.id.a.second,the notice requirement does not apply if the minor declares that she is a victim of child abuse or neglect by the persons entitled to notice,and the physician reports this fact in accordance with colorado law.b.two affirmative defenses to liability also exist.first,the physician is absolved from liability if he shows that he reasonably relied upon representations by the minor indicating compliance with the pna.id.a.second,the physician can show that the abortion was necessary to prevent the imminent death of the minor and that there was insufficient time to provide the required notice.b.
plaintiffs filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the pna on december,named defendants originally were the governor of colorado and one local district attorney the suit was later expanded to include all local district attorneys in colorado one of plaintiffs claims was that the pna was facially unconstitutional because it lacked an exception permitting a physician to perform an abortion without notice or a waiting period even when necessary to protect the health of the pregnant minor planned parenthood of rocky mountains servs.owens,d.the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on this claim.id.at.

key to resolution of this case is our answer to this question does the united states constitution,as interpreted by the supreme court,require that state abortion regulations provide a health exception where such an exception is necessary to ensure that those regulations do not threaten the health of a pregnant woman if the answer is yes,then a subsidiary and related question that we must also answer is what is the appropriate standard of review to apply when a lawsuit challenges an abortion statute for failing to provide a health exception 
three cases are essential to answering the first question roe wade,d,which established the current constitutional principles regarding abortion planned parenthood of southeastern casey,d,which reaffirmed and refined the holdings of roe and stenberg carhart,d,which is the most recent holding by the supreme court on the constitutional requirements for a health exception for abortion regulations.
roe established the importance of protecting the health of pregnant women in the context of abortion regulation.one of the three central holdings of roe is that for the stage of pregnancy subsequent to viability,a state may regulate and even proscribe abortion,except,where it is necessary,in appropriate medical judgment,for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.roe,at.
this holding was reaffirmed in casey,where the court stated in the clearest possible terms that abortion regulations can not interfere with a woman ability to protect her own health.the casey court emphasized that the essential holding of roe forbids a state from interfering with a woman choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health.casey,at.in upholding pennsylvania abortion regulations,the court found it crucial that the statute had a medical emergency exception to the application of the state regulations,and that the exception was broad enough to assure that compliance with the state abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to the life or health of a woman.id.quotation omitted.
roe and casey directly address only state regulation of abortions,roe,at.casey,at.joint opinion of,kennedy,and souter,jj,a context in which the court has held that a state has a compelling interest in protecting potential life,roe,at.this means that,where the state interest in regulation of abortion is weaker,the state would likewise have no constitutional power to infringe on the right of the pregnant woman to protect her health.in other words,at no time during the period of pregnancy may the state regulate abortion in a manner that infringes on the ability of a pregnant woman to protect her health.in stenberg,the court confirmed this deduction.since the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation,it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation.at.
stenberg also confirmed that the lack of a health exception is a sufficient ground for invalidating a state abortion statute.id.announcing two independent reasons for invalidating the state abortion law in question,one of which was that the law lack ed any exception for the preservation of the health of the mother quotation omitted see also id.at,concurring t he nebraska statute is inconsistent with casey because it lacks an exception for those instances when the banned procedure is necessary to preserve the health of the mother.even the dissent in stenberg agreed that casey and roe require state abortion regulations to have health exceptions for those situations in which continuing a pregnancy would threaten the health of the mother.id.at.thomas,dissenting.the point of departure for the dissent regarded application of the foregoing standard to the facts in stenberg.id.contending that roe and casey were inapplicable to the presented facts because they say nothing at all about cases in which a physician considers one prohibited method of abortion to be preferable to permissible methods.
that the pna regulates abortion performed for minors does not alter the constitutional requirements or mandates laid down by the court regarding the necessity of a health exception.constitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the age of majority.minors,as well as adults,are protected by the constitution and possess constitutional rights.planned parenthood of cent.danforth,d.the state does not the court has never a state may constitutionally infringe on a minor ability to protect her health through an abortion,or that the health exception requirement either does not apply or applies differently to minors.
thus,the current state of the law is that state abortion regulations must provide an exception for the protection of the health of pregnant women where those regulations might otherwise infringe on their ability to protect their health through an abortion 
although facial challenges to statutes generally require the plaintiff to show that there are no circumstances under which the law could be valid,see united states salerno,d,the standard of review for facial challenges to abortion statutes is quite different.
we have followed the majority of other circuits in holding that casey altered the salerno standard in the context of abortion cases,with the casey undue burden test replacing the salerno no set of circumstances test.see jane bangerter,cir.review of state abortion regulations generally proceeds under casey,which prescribes a showing that the state abortion regulation operates,in a large fraction of the cases as a substantial obstacle to a woman choice to undergo an abortion.casey,at.the state concedes that the salerno standard is inapplicable and assumes that our review should proceed under the casey standard.
however,in stenberg the supreme court departed in yet another manner from salerno,relying on neither the salerno no set of circumstances test nor the casey undue burden test in striking down nebraska partial birth abortion ban for lack of a health exception.see stenberg,at.see also id.at.thomas,dissenting arguing that under the no set of circumstances test the nebraska statute should not be declared facially unconstitutional.without overruling or even citing salerno,the court instead held that in the absence of evidence that a health exception would never be necessary to preserve the health of women,the statute must be declared unconstitutional.stenberg,at.quotation omitted.the district court in this case implicitly reached this conclusion as well.see planned parenthood,d at concluding without discussing salerno that stenberg established a per se rule requiring a health exception.we will follow what the supreme court actually than what it failed to apply the standard for reviewing abortion statutes laid out in stenberg.planned parenthood miller,cir.
applying that standard,if we conclude that the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to the material fact that the pna will infringe on the ability of any pregnant woman to protect her health,we must hold the statute unconstitutional.plaintiffs need not show that all,or even most,pregnant women who will be covered by the provisions of the pna would have the right to protect their health infringed unconstitutionally by the pna.see women med.prof l voinovich,cir a abortion regulation which threatens the life or health of even a few pregnant women should be deemed unconstitutional.
with these preliminary matters resolved,we address whether the colorado statute meets the appropriate constitutional requirements.
we first conclude that the evidence presented by the parties before the district court mandates that the pna contain a health exception.we then reject the state argument that the pna may be interpreted to contain a constitutionally adequate health exception by reading into it a provision from colorado children code.that rejection is compelled because colorado principles of statutory interpretation do not allow us to consider such an interpretation and even if the pna and the children code arguably conflict,those principles of statutory interpretation would not allow us to read the children code as superseding the pna.
both parties agree that there are circumstances in which complications of a pregnancy may pose major health risks to the patient,including a threat to the patient life.planned parenthood,d at.app.at,appellants br.at.the parties also agree that these medical complications may require medical treatment during the mandatory waiting period of the pna,and that treatment may necessitate an abortion as defined in the pna.planned parenthood,d at.app.at id.at appellants br.at.medical experts deposed on behalf of both defendants and plaintiffs stated that delays required by the pna for the provision of an abortion to treat medical complications could result in significant harm to the health of a pregnant woman and that these medical complications could often arise in circumstances short of imminent death.planned parenthood,d at.app.at id.at,id.at id.at,id.at.consequently,the pna affirmative defense for imminent death would not be available to treating physicians in such situations.
stated more formalistically,the evidence before the district court at the time of plaintiffs summary judgment motion showed that there are circumstances in which pregnant minor women may be diagnosed by a physician with a pregnancy complication that could seriously threaten their health that such threatened harm may fall short of imminent death and that the delay required by the pna would interfere with the medically appropriate these women having carefully reviewed the record,we agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue as to the material fact that the pna infringes on the ability of pregnant women to protect their health.we thus conclude that a health exception to colorado parental notification act is constitutionally required.
although the state admits that w ithin its four corners,the act contains no express exception when an abortion is necessary for the minor health,it contends that such an exception should be imported from other provisions of colorado law.appellants br.at.in particular,the state points to of the colorado revised of the colorado children allows a state juvenile court to grant authorization for emergency medical treatment for a minor when reasonable effort is not sufficient to notify the minor parents.this provision of colorado law,the state claims,effectively creates a health exception to the pna that satisfies constitutional requirements in analyzing the state argument,we rely on colorado principles and laws of statutory construction to interpret the pna and other colorado statutes as the colorado state courts would interpret them.phelps hamilton,cir 
we agree with the district court that the language of the pna is clear and unambiguous.no abortion shall be performed without written notice and the delay.emphasis added.as noted earlier,the statute provides two,and only two,exceptions to the notice and waiting period requirements no notice is required if the parent or parents certify in writing that they have been notified,id.a,and no notice is required if the pregnant minor the attending physician she is a victim of abuse or neglect,b.in addition,the pna provides for two,and only two,affirmative defenses to prosecutions under the act the physician reasonably relied on the representations of the pregnant minor regarding information necessary to comply with the pna,id.a,or an abortion was necessary to prevent the imminent death of the minor child and there was insufficient time to provide the required notice,b thus,the pna provides for a rule that abortions are not to be performed on minor children unless notice is provided and the waiting period has expired.
we further agree with the district court that where a statute is clear and unambiguous,the colorado supreme court refuses to apply any rules of statutory construction.see,nicholas people,en banc where the language is clear and unambiguous,we need not resort to rules of statutory construction.quotation omitted.thus,the state argument that we should use the doctrine of in pari materia,a rule of statutory construction,to interpret the children code provision as providing a health exception to the pna is unavailing 
the state urges us to apply the maxim that whenever possible statutes should be construed to avoid serious doubts as to their constitutionality.see,communications workers of am.beck,d discussing federal statutes.ground water comm eagle peak farms,en banc discussing colorado statutes.if we chose to interpret the children code judicial approval provision as remaining in effect with respect to abortion,and if the children code provision met the constitutional requirements for a health exception,then this interpretation would save the pna from unconstitutionality.however,as the supreme court of colorado has noted,w e must give full effect to the language used by the general assembly even if to do so results in a determination that the statute violates constitutional criteria.people thomas,en banc see also phelps,at the federal courts do not have the power to narrow a state law by disregarding plain language in the statute just to preserve it from constitutional attack.the language of the pna is clear that there is no health exception therefore,the maxim does not apply.
we perceive only one way that would allow us to consider the state children code argument in light of the plain language of the we first concluded that the children code judicial approval provision and the pna were in conflict.in such a circumstance,we would be required to attempt to reconcile the two statutes.scholz metro.pathologists,en banc w hen two statutes apparently conflict,a court will strive to read them harmoniously so as to give effect to both.however,following colorado principles of statutory interpretation,we nonetheless conclude that,even if a conflict exists,the pna has superseded the conflicting provisions of the children code.
arguably,the pna and the children code conflict.the pna by its terms requires compliance with its notice requirements and with its waiting period except for specified exceptions and affirmative defenses.in contrast,the children code authorizes judicial approval of emergency medical as an the parents can not be contacted.a conflict exists when one provision authorizes what the other forbids or forbids what the other authorizes.bickel city of boulder,en banc ray city county of denver,en banc.
in the case of a conflict,we look to see how the courts of colorado would construe the pna and the children code judicial approval provision in order to reconcile them.as discussed above,the pna has a clear and unambiguous prohibition against the performance of abortions on minors absent compliance with the notice and waiting period requirements,subject to specified exceptions and affirmative defenses.moreover,the pna is specific in its notification requirements,laying out precisely who may deliver the notice.a,the manner of delivery of the notice including the language to be placed on the envelope containing the notice,b,and how to maintain the records for the written return of service of the notice,d.
in contrast,the children code broadly authorizes the provision of medical services on an emergency basis,as required only by the best interest of the child,upon authorization by a judge.id.a.notice to parents is necessary only if reasonable effort allows such notice in an emergency situation.b.there are no procedural requirements for the provision of notice.
the parties in this case have,explicitly or implicitly,suggested to us only two options for reconciling the pna and the children code.first,we could read the judicial approval provision of the children code as remaining in force with respect to abortions,effectively carving out an additional exception from the pna.this exception would theoretically apply whenever a doctor obtains permission from the juvenile court to provide a minor with an abortion when there is a medical emergency and when notice without the procedural requirements of the pna can not reasonably be provided to the parent.this is the alternative that the state urges upon us.second,we could read the pna as carving an exception from the children essence requiring parental consent for all abortions,irrespective of the judicial approval provision of.in other words,for all medical procedures except abortion the judicial approval provision would remain,but for abortion the new and more stringent parental notice requirements of the pna would apply.this is the interpretation implicitly supported by plaintiffs.
our options are thus limited to choosing which statute overrides the other,because regardless of which provision we conclude the legislature intended to effectuate,the result will by necessity abrogate the other statute in part.if we hold that the pna carves an exception from the children code,then we have recognized a narrow exception to a statute of broad applicability.for almost all medical services,the provisions of the children code will continue to apply,but for abortions only,there will be a specific rule with more stringent parental notice requirements.on the other hand,if we hold that the children code was not superseded by the pna and therefore remains effective in the abortion context,then we have recognized an additional exception to a statute of narrow applicability.the pna parental notice requirements will not apply any time a medical emergency requires provision of an abortion to a minor where parental notice can not be made with reasonable effort.instead of only the four specific and enumerated exceptions and affirmative defenses to the pna,there would also be a fifth.
we,of course,have no desire or authority to draft is simply not our constitutional prerogative to do so.we therefore choose the option that best gives effect to both the pna and the children code,and we hold that the pna has superseded the children code.under this interpretation the strict parental notice requirements of the pna would stand and not infringe on the children code provisions in the vast majority of medical emergencies.zaner city of brighton,adopting an interpretation of a constitutional amendment because it allows the amendment to be effective while preserving other conflicting constitutional provisions to the greatest degree possible,aff.the result of this conclusion,of course,is that the pna must be held unconstitutional because it lacks a health exception.
this conclusion is consistent with colorado statutory construction principles,which dictate that if two statutes irreconcilably conflict,then the later,more specific statute prevails.see,see also martin people,en banc.the pna is more specific than the children code provisions because it addresses the specific issue of parental notification for abortions by minors rather than the larger issue of children medical emergencies in general.the pna was also enacted well after the relevant provisions of the children code.thus,if there is a conflict,because these statutes are irreconcilable we conclude that the provisions of the pna supersede with regard to the provision of notice to parents about abortions 
other general principles of colorado statutory construction support this conclusion first,as a general rule of statutory construction,the enumeration of exclusions from the operation of a statute indicates that the statute should apply to all cases not specifically excluded.nicholas,at quotation omitted.following the state argument would result in recognizing a new exception to a statute that contains a list of specific exceptions this is a form of statutory interpretation that the colorado courts have avoided.see id.at holding that a exception can not be read into a statute requiring the presence of a parent when a juvenile is interrogated by the police because the statute already has enumerated exceptions.
moreover,the drafters of the pna were aware of the potential for interaction with the children code and cited relevant provisions where necessary.see.b referring to the provisions of the children code for abuse or neglect in order to explicate the exception to the notice requirement in the pna.clearly,the drafters knew how to reference the children code where the pna was intended to be coordinated with these provisions if the medical emergency procedures of were intended to have been preserved by the pna,it would have been a simple matter to refer to them in the act.see common sense alliance,at the electorate,as well as the legislature,must be presumed to know the existing law at the time they amend or clarify that law.
nor does the state argument that statutes should be construed whenever possible to avoid serious doubts as to their constitutionality alter our conclusion.again,the language of the pna is clear that there is no health exception,and the state proposed interpretation of the pna and the children code would require us to ignore other equally relevant colorado statutory interpretation principles.we are only to consider interpretations of statutes that are fairly possible,communications workers of,at,and the state suggested interpretation is not fairly possible.
we conclude that the pna is unconstitutional because it fails to provide a health exception as required by the constitution of the united states the judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed

this article shall in no way be construed as either ratifying,granting or otherwise establishing an abortion right for minors independently of any other regulation,statute or court decision which may now or hereafter limit or abridge access to abortion by minors.
as of this writing,a woman fundamental constitutional right to abort a fetus undue interference from the settled.see stenberg carhart,d stevens,concurring d uring the past years,the central holding of roe wade,d,has been endorsed by all but of the justices who have addressed the issue.at the same time,supreme court justices remain divided over state regulation of abortion,including regulation pertaining to minors.see matheson,d powell,concurring noting the divisive nature of questions over state statutes intended to encourage parental involvement in a minor decision to have an abortion.in a stream of opinions over the past three decades,the justices have struggled to articulate meaningful standards for lower courts to apply.see,planned parenthood casey,d rehnquist,dissenting in part w hen confronted with state regulation of abortion,the court has become increasingly more divided.citing cases.justice white accurately predicted the future a quarter century ago in roe wade this court recognized a right to an abortion free from state prohibition.the task of policing this limitation on state police power is and will be a difficult and continuing venture in substantive due process.planned parenthood danforth,d white,dissenting in part.true to justice white words,state lawmakers continue to test the limits of roe and courts continue to police those limits with no foreseeable end to the struggle.
given supreme court precedent,i have little quarrel with the legal proposition that a state may not infringe on a woman ability,regardless of her age,to obtain an abortion in a timely manner where medically necessary to proscribe a serious health risk.see court op.at stenberg,at.state may promote but not endanger a woman health when regulating abortion i do not agree,however,with the court conclusion that the voter initiated and approved colorado parental notification act.thru cpna,when construed under colorado state law,necessarily infringes on the ability of pregnant women to protect their health.court op.at.nor do i agree with the court conclusion that the cpna is unconstitutional in its entirety simply because it may infringe on the ability of any pregnant woman to protect her health.court op.at emphasis in original.in my opinion,the court is much too eager to apply its view of colorado state statutory interpretation to strike on its face,not a single prohibitory statute like that at issue in stenberg,but a act directly approved by the voters of colorado.see court op.at.the court declares the cpna unconstitutional because it fails to address the availability of emergency medical procedures in the rare instance where a pregnant minor health but not life is threatened and that minor can not or does not wish to notify an unknowing parent 
resolution of the narrow issue in this case,and the possible validity of the cpna,unquestionably turns on the court application of colorado state law granted the court application of that law might be correct in whole or in part.but the cpna,in my view,is susceptible of a construction by the state judiciary which might avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication,or at least materially change the nature of the problem.bellotti baird,d internal quotations omitted.consequently,the colorado supreme court,which has had no occasion to consider application of the cpna,seems better suited than a federal court for that application in the first instance.accordingly,i believe the preferable approach at this stage is to abstain from deciding the cpna constitutionality and to certify to the colorado supreme court,pursuant to the certification procedure outlined in,questions of colorado state law which may be determinative of this cause 
in bellotti,a district court held a massachusetts parental consent statute unconstitutional.because the statute constitutionality turned on questions of state law,a unanimous supreme court vacated the district court judgment and directed the court to certify to the state highest court appropriate questions concerning the meaning of the statute and the procedure it imposes.bellotti,at.in abstaining,the court explained 
it is sufficient that the statute is susceptible of the interpretation offered by the state,and we so find,and that such an interpretation would avoid or substantially modify the federal constitutional challenge to the statute,as it clearly would.indeed,in the absence of an authoritative construction,it is impossible to define precisely the constitutional question presented.
id.at.see also akron akron center for reproductive health,d,dissenting arguing that despite the absence of a certification procedure,the court should have abstained from declaring a parental consent provision of a municipal ordinance unconstitutional but see stenberg,at.declining to employ a state certification procedure where a nebraska statute banning partial birth abortion outright was not fairly susceptible to a narrowing construction 
we must assume that the colorado supreme court,if given its rightful opportunity,would seek to construe the cpna consistent with constitutional requirements.where fairly possible,courts should construe a statute to avoid a danger of unconstitutionality.ohio akron center for reproductive health,d internal quotations omitted.the colorado supreme court abides by this rule.in construing a statute chilling the fundamental right of speech,the court recently stated if a limiting construction or partial invalidation that confines the statute to sufficiently narrow applications can be applied,the court should construe the statute in light of that limiting construction.people hickman.this is especially true where a statute constitutionality is in question a court has a responsibility to apply a limiting construction or partial invalidation if doing so will preserve the statute constitutionality.id.
despite this responsibility,the court side steps the state belated but perhaps most forceful argument,namely that.e ii,a part of the colorado criminal code,provides the necessary health exception to the cpna.see court op.at.that section,which applies to criminal offenses generally,exempts from criminal responsibility medical personnel performing emergency procedures on minors 
the use of physical force upon another person which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal under any of the following circumstances 
e a duly licensed physician,or a person acting under his direction,may use reasonable and appropriate physical force for the purpose of administering a recognized form of treatment which he reasonably believes to be adapted to promoting the physical or mental health of the patient if 
ii the treatment is administered in an emergency when the physician reasonably believes that no one competent to consent can be consulted and that a reasonable person,wishing to safeguard the welfare of the patient,would consent.
given the court insistence to decide the cpna constitutionality,i can not understand the court decision,based largely on procedural grounds,to shirk its responsibility to come to grips with e ii.to be sure,this court does not ordinarily review issues raised for the first time in a reply brief.stump gates,cir emphasis added.but the ordinary rule is subject to exception,and this is no ordinary case.headrick rockwell int l,cir citing herbert national academy of sciences,t here do exist circumstances in which a court may consider,or even raise sua sponte,arguments ignored or left undeveloped in the first round of briefing.a federal court decision to declare a state legislative act unconstitutional on its face is most invasive of state sovereignty.because such a decision extends far beyond the immediate parties,a federal court,in my opinion,should reach such a decision only after the utmost consideration.this seems especially true where the court bases its decision solely upon an arguably erroneous application of state law principles.
the court states that i t would be unfair to rule on the state argument based on without providing plaintiffs an opportunity to respond.court op.at.of course,certifying the appropriate state law questions to the colorado supreme court would give plaintiffs ample opportunity to answer all the state arguments.moreover,because the state has agreed to refrain from enforcing the cpna until entry of a final judgment,planned parenthood owens,d,plaintiffs stand to suffer no discernible injury if we employ colorado certification procedure.
without unduly analyzing each of the acceptable possibilities,i believe the colorado supreme court could render a reasonable limiting construction of the cpna to preserve it consistent with its intended applications.as the district court noted,nothing in the record suggests that colorado voters in supporting the cpna initiative intend ed to place a pregnant minor health at risk contrary to the minor best interests see owens,d at compare thornburgh american college of obstetricians and gynecologists,d we necessarily conclude that the pennsylvania legislature failure to provide a exception was intentional,overruled in part on other grounds by casey,at.opinion of.
in the end,the court concludes that a saving construction of the cpna is not fairly possible.court op.at.i disagree.i am not convinced that,if called upon to construe the voter initiated and approved cpna,the colorado supreme court would refuse to narrow its application and construe it in a constitutional manner.compare matheson,at.parental notification law which did not explicitly exempt pregnant minors with emergency health care needs did not give the court any reason to assume that a minor in need of emergency treatment will be treated in any way different from a similarly situated adult rust sullivan,d rejecting a facial challenge to federal regulations barring a federal project from referring women to abortion providers where the regulations did not explicitly exempt cases of imminent peril to the mother life.
today,the court prematurely and perhaps unjustifiably thwarts the will of the colorado electorate.due to the lack of reasonable certainty as to how the cpna will operate in its application or how the cpna interacts with other colorado laws,legislative or judicial,our scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments counsels against unnecessary and premature interference by the federal courts with proper and validly administered state concerns,a course so essential to the balanced working of our federal system.akron,at,dissenting.
accordingly,i dissent.
the full text of the pna is set out in the appendix to this opinion.
the statute also provides that a ny person who counsels,advises,encourages or conspires to induce or persuade any pregnant minor to furnish any physician with false information concerning the minor age,marital status or any other fact or circumstance to induce the physician to perform an abortion without written notice can be found guilty of a class five felony.
the suit was originally filed in colorado state court but was removed to federal court by defendants.planned parenthood of rocky mountains servs.owens,d.
hereinafter,we refer to defendants collectively as the state.
plaintiffs other claims were that the pna violates the federal constitution by failing to provide a judicial bypass for the parental notification provision for mature,abused,or best interest children that the existing judicial bypass provision in the pna does not adequately protect federal constitutional rights that the pna violates state due process rights that the pna violates state separation of powers and that the pna definition of abortion violates the federal constitution by requiring parental notification for the use of contraception by minors.planned parenthood,d at.plaintiffs contraception claim was dismissed after the district court granted the state motion for partial summary judgment pursuant to a joint motion by the parties.id.at.because relief was granted to plaintiffs on the health exception claim,the district court did not address the other federal constitutional claims.the state constitutional claims were dismissed without prejudice by the district court.id.
even before the supreme court affirmed the existence of the requirement in casey and stenberg,the court was filling in the substance of that requirement in a series of cases.see thornburgh am.coll.of obstetricians gynecologists,d invalidating a requirement that a second physician be present for all abortions where viability is possible because there was no health exception to the requirement,overruled in part on other grounds by planned parenthood of southeastern casey,d planned parenthood ass of.city ashcroft,d upholding a missouri statute requiring two physicians to be present for abortions because the statute could be interpreted to create a health exception to that requirement see also harris mcrae,d i t could be argued that the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy for health reasons does in fact lie at the core of the constitutional liberty identified in roe.although casey overrules in part thornburgh,thornburgh essential holding regarding the health exception requirement was reaffirmed by casey.see jane bangerter,cir.
the state argues that the analysis of whether a health exception is required for a particular state abortion regulation must proceed using the undue burden test laid out in casey,a test that generally applies to state regulation of abortion.casey,at.joint opinion of,kennedy,and souter,jj.however,the stenberg court implicitly concluded that the undue burden test does not apply to the determination of whether a health exception is required,and that the lack of a health exception is a separate,independent ground upon which a state abortion regulation may be invalidated.stenberg,at.holding that the nebraska statute is unconstitutional for at least two independent reasons,the lack of a health exception and the imposition of an undue burden emphasis added.the proper analysis is thus to determine whether a health exception is necessary given the restrictions imposed by the pna.see id.at.our analysis,based on the facts conceded by the state and contained in the record,shows that a health exception is necessary.
the state disputes whether a form of pregnancy pregnancy,where the fertilized egg is located somewhere other than the be covered by the pna,and whether termination of an ectopic pregnancy would be an abortion for purposes of the pna.as the district court noted,however,there are a number of other pregnancy complications the parties agree could pose major risks to the health of the pregnant minor,treatment for which may require an abortion as defined by the pna and for which the waiting period of the pna or any delay at all could endanger the health of the pregnant minor.planned parenthood,d at.thus,we need not address the ectopic pregnancy issue to resolve this case.
the following state laws which require parental notice or consent for a minor to obtain an abortion also provide a medical exception where the minor life or health is at risk.see requirements do not apply where medical emergency exists.requirements do not apply where physician certifies immediate abortion necessary to avert death or serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function of minor cal.health safety code consent not required if medical emergency exists ann.tit,requirements do not apply when medical emergency exists.stat.ch.notice not required when medical emergency exists and immediate abortion necessary to avert death or serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function of minor ann.requirements do not apply where medical emergency exists idaho code consent not required where medical emergency exists.comp.stat.notice not required where medical emergency exists requirements do not apply where continuation of pregnancy provides immediate threat and grave risk to life or health of minor iowa code requirements do not apply where physician determines medical emergency exists.stat.ann.notice not required where emergency exists that threatens health,safety,or of minor.requirements do not apply when medical emergency exists.ann.provisions do not apply where medical emergency exists and continuation of pregnancy poses immediate threat and grave risk to life or permanent physical health of minor.i minor has same capacity as adult to consent if physician determines life or health of minor would be affected adversely by delay.comp.laws requirements do not apply if abortion performed pursuant to medical emergency ann.requirements do not apply when physician determines medical emergency exists ann.notice not required if physician certifies medical emergency exists.notice not required if physician certifies immediate threat and grave risk to life or health of minor.notice not required if life or health of minor is in immediate danger.requirements do not apply when physician determines medical emergency exists.consent not required in case of medical emergency laws requirements waived where emergency exists ann.consent waived where physician determines medical emergency exists involving life of or grave physical injury to minor codified laws consent not required where delay would threaten minor life or health ann.requirements do not apply when physician determines medical emergency exists.ann.notice not required when physician determines immediate abortion necessary to avert minor death or avoid serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function of minor requirements do not apply where emergency exists which constitutes immediate threat and grave risk to life or health of minor.stat.requirements do not apply where physician determines medical emergency exists.
the state also argues that a physician is relieved of the waiting requirements of the act by notifying the parent and either receiving permission to proceed or by reporting the child as neglected.appellants br.at.however,the plain language of the pna excludes the first if a parent is notified and provides permission,the delay is only waived if the permission is provided in writing.the writing requirement could create substantial delay that might harm a pregnant woman health in a medical emergency situation.moreover,this exception is only operative if the parent can be contacted at the time of the medical second a parent as abusive or seem to be an unwarranted response to a medical emergency where the difficulty of obtaining parental consent is due not to the refusal of a parent to consent,but rather to an inability to contact the parent during the minutes or hours within which a doctor must respond to a medical emergency.such a situation does not appear to be what the colorado legislature had in mind when it defined child abuse or neglect in the children code to include physical violence,id.a i,sexual assault or molestation,a ii,failure to provide the care that a prudent parent would provide,a iii,emotional abuse,a iv,or abandonment,a v.it also does not appear to be what the legislature had in mind when it established a requirement that all reports of abuse or neglect be forwarded to appropriate government or law enforcement authorities,id,and that those authorities undertake an assessment of the situation,id.a,with the possibility of criminal charges or removal of the child from home,id.b.
the fact that the pna was adopted by initiative,rather than by the colorado legislature,does not alter the approach to statutory interpretation relied upon by colorado courts.see common sense alliance davidson,en banc citing bickel city of boulder,en banc,for the proposition that the general rules of statutory construction apply when interpreting measures.
the state does not argue that the imminent death provision provides an adequate health exception for the pna.we independently conclude that this provision is not an adequate health exception,as the supreme court has held that exceptions solely to protect the life of the mother are not constitutionally sufficient.see roe,at.
under the doctrine of in pari materia,a court will interpret a statute by examining other statutes dealing with the same subject as the statute being construed.norman singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.
bickel dealt with a potential conflict between a statute and a constitutional provision.see bickel,at.however,in colorado rules of constitutional interpretation may be utilized in developing rules of statutory interpretation.see common sense alliance,at citing previous colorado constitutional interpretation cases for interpretation principles to be applied in the statutory context.
while it is true that repeals by implication are not favored in colorado,if there is a manifest inconsistency between a later and an earlier statute a repeal by implication will be held to have occurred.people james,en banc.we are not faced with a case where a general statute is being interpreted to repeal by implication a specific situation in which colorado courts have required a showing of clear and unmistakable intent,martin,at en banc see also people smith,en banc.instead,this is a case where a specific statute,the pna,is interpreted to have established an exception to a general statute,the children code judicial approval provision.moreover,colorado does not require that the later statute expressly state that it is repealing the previous statute.state beckman,en banc a specific legislative declaration that a later law repeals any provisions of an earlier law in conflict with the later law is superfluous since a later law automatically repeals an earlier law which conflicts with it.
the state urges that we to give deference to its interpretation of the statute because it is the construction provided by the colorado attorney general,the chief officer in charge of enforcing the statute.however,as noted by the supreme court in stenberg,such an interpretation is not to be taken as authoritative or to have controlling weight when the interpretation does not bind the state courts or local law enforcement authorities.stenberg,at.quotation omitted.the state has given no indication that the attorney general opinion might have controlling weight either with local law enforcement or in state court,other than a citation to c of th
