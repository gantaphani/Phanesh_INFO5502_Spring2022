back in albert price was driving his truck and struck a pedestrian and then slammed into the back of another vehicle,causing a four car.he leapt out of his truck swinging a machete and injured three passersby before he was disarmed.he was convicted by a jury in a wisconsin state court of attempted murder and other crimes,and was sentenced to years in prison.the jury rejected his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity,primarily it seems on the basis of testimony by vincent giannattasio,a psychiatrist called as a witness by the state.two other psychiatrists testified walter mcdonald,price expert,testified that price was indeed insane robert drom,a expert,was unable to form an opinion about price mental condition.the prosecution did not tell price lawyer and apparently did not know that the federal government had indicted giannattasio for medicare fraud.the indictment had been dismissed,but the government appeal from the dismissal was pending during price trial.the dismissal was reversed after the trial,united states giannattasio,cir,but the government later dismissed criminal charges against giannattasio,instead successfully suing him in a civil case for fraud.
price appealed his conviction to the wisconsin court of appeals,arguing that the failure of the prosecution to disclose the indictment was a brady violation.the court disagreed.state price,wl,at,per curiam.it ruled that since under wisconsin law of evidence an indictment can not be used to impeach a witness credibility,state reynolds,see also state cathey,state raether,compare.stat,the information about giannattasio indictment was immaterial.there is no obligation to turn over immaterial evidence to a defendant,united states,cir united states jones,cir,unless it is apparent that it might lead to the discovery of material evidence.united states perez,cir bradley nagle,cir east johnson,cir.in the alternative,the court held that any brady error was harmless,because the medicare fraud was unrelated to giannattasio testimony about price sanity and therefore could not have affected the jury decision.
before appealing his conviction,price had initiated a state postconviction proceeding complaining about the effectiveness of his trial lawyer.after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the trial judge rejected the complaint,as did the wisconsin court of appeals on price appeal from his conviction.having exhausted his state remedies,price petitioned for federal habeas corpus he was denied relief,without a hearing.
he contends that his right to confront giannattasio was infringed because he could not tell the jury not having been informed by the prosecution that giannattasio had been indicted for fraud.a jury might rationally discount the testimony of a witness who had committed a crime involving fraud.a united states chevalier,cir united states,cir see also state gary.but no more than wisconsin evidence law do the federal rules of evidence permit impeachment by an indictment,as distinct from a conviction.michelson united states.united states chance,cir dowthitt johnson,cir,and we can not believe that this limitation infringes the right of confrontation.
of course,under federal as under wisconsin law,specific instances of the conduct of a witness,in the discretion of the court,if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness,can be inquired into on concerning the witness character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.b see.stat.see also lindh murphy,cir united states machado,cir united states collins,cir,though it can not be proved by extrinsic evidence.united states dabney,cir united states thomas,cir.stat.state sonnenberg.so the trial court could have allowed price lawyer to ask giannattasio whether he had committed medicare fraud had the lawyer known about the prosecution,though if as is quite probable price had answered no the lawyer could not have presented evidence to prove the fraud and the effort at impeachment would have fizzled.
this suggests a basis for a finding of harmless error,but one different from that of the wisconsin court of appeals.evidence need not,as that court thought,be relevant to any issue to be usable to impeach a witness all it need do is undermine his credibility,as is obvious when a witness criminal record is used to impeach his credibility under.in a case in which he is not a party.harmlessness aside,price did not argue in the wisconsin court of appeals that he should have been told about the indictment so that he could impeach giannattasio not with the indictment but with the alleged medicare fraud that had given rise to it.he argues the point in this court,by a different lawyer,but it is too late.see b boerckel,d simpson battaglia,cir.
price had suggested another way in which he could have used the pending federal charges to impeach giannattasio by showing that giannattasio had a motive to testify favorably to the state in price case because if he did so the state prosecutors might put in a good word for him with their federal counterparts.that quite a stretch,but in any event the argument has been abandoned in this court.and since it seems that no one on the prosecution team knew about giannattasio indictment and it was a matter of public record readily accessible to price lawyer,unlike the circumstances of boss pierce,cir united states payne,cir,and united states perdomo,cir,the prosecution had no obligation to disclose it to the defense.united states tadros,cir united states young,cir matthews ishee,cir united states infante,cir united states delgado,cir.
as for ineffective assistance of counsel,price complains not about his trial lawyer failing to discover the indictment of giannattasio but about the lawyer waiving a hearing on price mental competence to stand trial and withholding essential information from the expert who testified about price mental state when he committed the.drom,the expert who could not make up his mind about price sanity.thus there are two issues relating to the lawyer handling of the issue of price sanity whether price was mentally competent to stand trial and whether he had been insane when he committed the crimes for which he was being tried.
price had a long history of mental disease,and had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and his original lawyer had succeeded in getting the judge to agree to conduct a competency hearing.stat.b.but his new lawyer the one about whom he is complaining,who had been appointed just minutes before the hearing was scheduled to begin,asked for a adjournment and when it was up told the judge that price was waiving the hearing.the wisconsin court of appeals first said that the lawyer had made this decision,state price,supra,at,but later said that it had been made jointly by the lawyer and price,id.at raises the question whether the judge should have accepted the waiver without first determining price competence.the lawyer did not recall having discussed competence with price,but he thought that probably he had and that in any event there was any doubt in my mind that price was competent,and he felt the same way.robert miller,whom the court had asked to report on price competence to stand trial,had reported that he was competent,but price lawyer had failed to give him all the documents that the lawyer possessed concerning price mental history.
concerning price mental condition when he committed the crimes,his lawyer had amassed a number of reports concerning the traffic accident and the mêlée that had ensued,as well as medical records including the ones he had not shown miller at the time of the inquiry into price competency to stand trial.he gave some of this material to the expert witness at trial,drom,but not all.he especially neglected to give drom the reports of persons who had observed price in the days preceding the machete attack and medical reports of price previous bouts of mental illness.he did give drom an oral summary of the witness reports,but drom was unwilling to offer an opinion on price mental condition on the basis of those summaries.
at the state postconviction hearing,a new expert retained by price,john marshall,examined the full record and concluded that it was not,in my opinio
