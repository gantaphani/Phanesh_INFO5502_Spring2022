mark and diane albrecht,et the albrechts appeal the district court decision to grant judgment on the pleadings in favor of brian treon,et hereinafter,defendants.the albrechts brought a claim pursuant to,alleging that they were denied due process of law when the defendant coroner performed an autopsy on the albrechts son remains and removed the brain during the procedure.when the body was returned to the albrechts,they were not informed that the coroner had retained the brain for further study and that it would be destroyed once the investigation was complete.the albrechts claim that the retention and destruction of their son brain,without their knowledge,deprived them of the right to dispose of their son brain,in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the albrechts base this claim on their purported property interest in their son entire body,including his brain.the albrechts also brought common law tort claims against defendants,over which the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction.
the district court was faced with the question of whether the albrechts had a constitutionally protected property interest in their son brain after it was removed and retained for legitimate investigative purposes.as this was a question of first impression in ohio,the district court certified the question to the ohio supreme court.the ohio supreme court answered the question in the negative,stating that there is no constitutionally protected property interest in human remains retained by the state of ohio for criminal investigation purposes.the district court consequently held that the albrechts had no property interest in the brain,and,thus,defendants were entitled to judgment on the pleadings.the albrechts argue that the sixth circuit ruling in brotherton cleveland,cir,holding that a spouse had a protected property interest in her husband corneas,which were removed for donation purposes,should rule this case,as opposed to the ohio supreme court answer to the certified question.
for the reasons which follow,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the coroner for clermont county,ohio,performed an autopsy on the albrechts son remains.the autopsy required examination of their son brain.in order to examine and dissect a human brain more effectively,the organ must be soaked in a formol saline solution for ten to fourteen days,a process referred to as fixing the brain,which firms the brain tissue for dissection.due to the lengthy process of fixing the brain,it is the usual practice of the coroner to return the remains to next of kin for disposition without the brain.the coroner did not inform the albrechts that he retained their son brain upon return of the body to them.when the examination of the brain was completed,it was destroyed in accordance with the coroner usual practice.the coroner did not notify the albrechts that the brain was going to be destroyed.the albrechts learned that their son body was missing the brain when they received the autopsy report months later,long after burying their son.the albrechts filed suit,claiming a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and common law tort liability.the suit was certified as a class action,and the albrechts represent a class of plaintiffs whose deceased family members bodies were returned to them missing tissues or organs that the coroner retained for further study in the course of a criminal investigation.

iii.discussion 
ohio supreme court ruling in albrecht ii 
the albrechts argue that under brotherton cleveland,f d cir,and whaley county of tuscola,cir,they had a constitutionally protected property interest in their son discarded brain.in brotherton,the plaintiff objected to the donation of her deceased husband organs at the hospital.this objection,however,was not conveyed to the county coroner,who removed the decedent corneas pursuant to an ohio statute which permitted a coroner to remove the corneas of autopsy subjects without consent,provided that the coroner has no knowledge of an objection by the decedent,the decedent spouse,or the person authorized to dispose of the body.brotherton cleveland,at.we reversed the district court dismissal of the plaintiff claims,finding that the plaintiff had the right to possession of her husband body for the limited purpose of lawfully disposing of it.id.at issue in brotherton,however,was part of ohio adoption of the uniform anatomical gift act,which expressly granted next of kin the right to dispose of a relative remains there is no similar statute at issue in this case.
whaley is a direct progeny of brotherton and arose under similar facts.the plaintiffs in whaley were the next of kin of persons whose bodies were the subject of autopsies and whose corneas or eyeballs were removed,either without the consent of the next of kin,or after the objection of their next of kin.the whaley court held that under michigan law,the have a legitimate claim of entitlement and thus a property interest in a dead relative body,including the eyes.whaley county of tuscola,cir.the albrechts maintain that brotherton and whaley control the outcome in this case,arguing that their right to their son brain is constitutionally equal to the plaintiffs rights in brotherton and whaley to their relatives eyeballs or corneas.defendants claim that brotherton and whaley are distinguishable from the facts in this case,because removal and retention of tissue or organ for donation purposes,as in brotherton and whaley,serve little function for the state,and,thus,the relatives have greater property interest in the body parts.however,removal and retention of tissues or organs for forensic analysis in furtherance of a criminal investigation serves an important state function,which is paramount to the albrechts right to possess their son body in its entirety.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits states from depriving any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.in order to establish a procedural due process claim,a plaintiff must show that he had a life,liberty,or property interest protected by the due process clause he was deprived of this protected interest and the state did not afford him adequate procedural rights prior to depriving him of the property interest.women med.prof l baird,cir citation omitted.property interests are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state board of regents of state colleges roth.although property rights are principally created by state law,whether a substantive interest created by the state rises to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest is a question of federal constitutional law the due process clause only protects those interests to which one has a legitimate claim of entitlement.waeschle dragovic,cir.
the issue on appeal is whether the albrechts had a constitutionally protected property interest in their son brain after it was removed during the autopsy.as noted above,o
