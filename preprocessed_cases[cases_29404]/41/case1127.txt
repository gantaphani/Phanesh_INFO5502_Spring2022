thomas wenner was the chief operating officer of orchid manufacturing group orchid when he suffered a heart attack.he sought disability benefits from sun life assurance company of canada sun life under his employer disability benefits plan and,for a time,received them.in,sun life discontinued the benefits,having determined that wenner was no longer disabled.wenner challenged sun life decision in state and then federal court.he argued,inter alia,that sun life failed to notify him of the specific reasons for its decision as required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.
the district court rejected sun life decision for a different reason.it concluded that sun life determination that wenner was no longer disabled was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by the administrative record.although we do not necessarily agree with that determination,we will affirm the district court judgment on the separate ground that sun life violated the notice requirements of erisa.
background 
suffering from acute inferior myocardial infarction,wenner successfully underwent heart bypass surgery in january.before the surgery wenner could walk for only ten minutes at a time after the surgery wenner could walk over a mile and a quarter without any kind of symptoms.physician notes,ja.by march,wenner had returned to work at orchid on a basis,and by january,he was working approximately workdays,with of those hours spent at orchid plants or corporate headquarters and the remainder working from home.he also engaged in a number of other common daily activities,including walking for thirty to minutes four times a week.nevertheless,he continued to experience shortness of breath and claimed that he was not able to cope well with any personal or stress.see claimant activity questionnaire,ja.
sun life initially approved wenner claim for disability benefits following his surgery,and began issuing monthly payments of about in early.the benefits plan required that wenner periodically submit to sun life updated medical and personal activity information.in october,sun life made such a request by letter,but sent the letter to the wrong address.when wenner failed to respond,sun life followed up with a voicemail message and a second misaddressed letter.when wenner again did not respond,sun life sent a third letter which terminated his disability benefits.its stated reason for the termination was that the materials requested have not been received.sun life letter to wenner,february letter,ja.the february letter further provided 
if you disagree with our decision,you may request in writing a review of the denial within days after receiving this notice of denial.
you may submit written comments,documents,records or other information relating to your claim for benefits 
we will review your claim on receipt of the written request for review,and will notify you of our decision within a reasonable period of time 
you have the right to bring a civil action under erisa following an adverse determination on review.
id.although the february letter also was wrongly addressed,wenner received it and appealed the termination to sun life,as provided for in the letter.he claimed that he had not received sun life other written and voicemail requests.he then submitted the requested information.
sun life reviewed wenner claim and updated information.it referred wenner updated medical records to two doctors.they both determined that wenner was no longer physically incapable of doing the work of a corporate executive.for example,one of the doctors,a cardiologist,said that wenner medical records reflected the health of a man capable of doing the work of a lumberjack or heavy laborer.
based on this information,sun life affirmed its termination of disability benefits.sun life did not rest its termination of benefits on the ground stated in its february letter,that the materials requested ha d not been received.instead,it determined that wenner was not disabled by his cardiac condition.see sun life letter to wenner april,april letter,ja.the april letter further stated 
therefore,based on the medical information provided by your treating physician,the comprehensive review by our independent physician reviewers,and the fact that you have been performing the duties of your own occupation on a basis as needed,you do not meet the policy definition of disability as outlined elsewhere in this letter.therefore,no further benefits are payable,and your claim will remain closed.
all administrative remedies have been exhausted and your file will remain closed.
you have the right to bring a civil action under erisa 
at ja.the april letter,unlike the february letter,did not provide for any means of appeal to sun life of the determination that wenner was no longer disabled.indeed,on at least three separate occasions thereafter when wenner attempted to appeal this determination to sun life,it expressly denied him any right to appeal and referred him to his rights under erisa.see decoff letter to johnson,ja prior letter to johnson june,ja prior letter to johnson june,ja.
finally,on september,wenner filed a judicial complaint against sun life in the chancery court of davidson county in nashville,tennessee.the complaint prayed for a decree awarding the total value of disability income benefits that sun life had denied him.sun life removed the action to the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee campbell,basing federal jurisdiction on erisa preemption of wenner claims.see dist.ct mem,at april,ja noting that wenner claim is preempted and governed by erisa.
following the parties cross motions for judgment on the administrative record,the district court held that sun life decision to terminate the benefits was arbitrary and capricious.the court agreed with wenner that where sun life had the letters requesting updated information,the failure to provide such information could not serve as a basis for sun life denial of benefits.sun life does not appeal this finding.see appellant br.at dismissing the district court finding in this regard because i n any event sun life ultimately did receive and render decision on the requested information.
the court further concluded that sun life determination that wenner was not disabled was not supported by the administrative record.sun life appeals this finding,arguing that the district court failed to abide by the appropriate standard for reviewing a plan administrator determination under erisa and improperly imposed on sun life the burden of proving cessation of wenner disability.
discussion 
it is that this court review s de novo the decision of a district court granting judgment in an erisa disability benefit action based on an administrative record,applying the same legal standard as does the district court.glenn metlife,cir citing whitaker hartford life accident ins,cir,and wilkins baptist healthcare,cir.here,the correct legal standard to apply to sun life denial of benefits is the arbitrary and capricious standard.see dist.ct mem,at april,ja noting that it is undisputed that the benefits plan clearly indicates that the arbitrary and capricious standard applies to review of the plans administrator benefits determination see also firestone tire rubber bruch,d glenn,at.however,this court reviews de novo the legal question whether sun life in denying wenner claim complied with the notice requirements of erisa.mccartha national city,cir citing kent united omaha life ins,cir.
it is clear from the record that sun life failed to comply with the notice requirements of erisa.erisa,codified at,provides 
in accordance with regulations of the secretary,every employee benefit plan shall 
provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,and 
afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.
