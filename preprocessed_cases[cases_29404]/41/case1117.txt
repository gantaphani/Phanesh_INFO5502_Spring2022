the fortunes of the general motors corporation and the ford motor company,two of the world largest auto makers and two of this country largest employers,have risen and fallen many times over the last years.their most recent economic challenges stem from a variety of factors,including the emergence of vigorous international competition,the preferences of the american consumer and the fiscal strain of maintaining healthcare benefits for retirees well in excess of those provided by their foreign competitors.
in,gm and ford tried to address one of these issues by reducing retiree healthcare benefits,only to be challenged by the international union,united automobile,aerospace,and agricultural implement workers of america the uaw,which represents hourly workers at both companies and which negotiated these healthcare benefits in the first place.insisting that the retirees healthcare benefits had vested and could not be modified without the retirees consent,the uaw filed this action and eventually proposed a class of retirees from gm and ford to defend its position.through two similar agreements,the companies,the uaw and the classes proposed to settle their differences.a small percentage of retirees from each company less than one half of one percent objected to the proposed settlements and,when the district courts rejected their objections after a fairness hearing,appealed to our court.we have consolidated the appeals and now affirm.
retiree healthcare benefits provided by the two companies.for more than years,the uaw has been negotiating with gm and ford over retiree healthcare benefits for hourly retirees.starting in,gm gave retirees what now sounds like a quaint option they could purchase hospital and medical coverage,but gm would not subsidize the cost of this coverage.ford followed suit three years later.in,gm and ford agreed to pay half the healthcare premiums for retirees and to extend these benefits to hourly workers who had retired under previous collective bargaining agreements.at the same time,gm offered coverage to retiree dependents at full cost,while ford assumed half the cost of dependent coverage.
by,gm and ford had assumed the entire cost of retirees healthcare benefits,including the benefits for dependents.the car companies added other healthcare benefits for retirees over the next years coverage in dental and coverage in and comprehensive vision coverage in.gm extended coverage to substance abuse in and mental health in.because each agreement encompassed all hourly retirees,not just those who had retired after each new collective bargaining agreement was made,gm and ford now provide healthcare coverage for all eligible retirees,their spouses and is to say people in gm case and people in ford case.
these benefits are not inexpensive.accounting for active and retired workers and their families,gm provides healthcare to people,making it the single largest private purchaser of health care in the united states,with yearly expenditures of billion in and with the lion share nearly billion in going to retiree benefits.gm ja.ford tells a similar story.it spent billion to cover people in,with billion going to retiree benefits.in,these aggregate healthcare expenditures added on average to the cost of every gm vehicle and to the cost of every ford vehicle.but for the legacy retiree healthcare costs per vehicle at gm and ford would be and,respectively.their japanese rivals spend an average of per vehicle for all healthcare costs,in other words for the healthcare benefits of active workers and retirees.
no participant in this that party agrees with the settlement or any reason to believe these healthcare benefits will become cheaper over time,the car companies capacity to pay them will become less burdensome in the future or the differential between what these american car companies pay in healthcare costs per vehicle and what their rivals from japan which has universal healthcare pay will change any time soon.gm accumulated healthcare obligations increased from billion in to billion at the end of ford faced billion in accumulated obligations in,an increase of billion since.by the end of,gm accumulated obligations amounted to almost seven times its market value by the end of,ford obligations amounted to almost three times its market value.making these obligations increasingly more difficult to meet are a growing ratio of retirees to active employees four to one at gm in and two to one at ford in and rapidly increasing healthcare costs.see,gm ja absent the settlement,gm accumulated obligations were expected to increase between and ford ja retirees accounted for of the increase in ford healthcare costs between and.
declining market share.once the world largest automotive manufacturer and still michigan largest employer with residents on its payroll,gm has seen its share of the north american market decline from to over the past years.ford share has declined from in to ten years later.over the last decade,profits at the two companies have declined and in some years disappeared.in,gm automotive division posted a loss of billion ford automotive division lost billion.
these problems have not been lost on the financial markets.in early,both companies credit ratings declined to grade status junk status,in part due to gm burdensome postretirement benefit obligations,gm ja,and ford massive unfunded retiree medical liability,ford ja internal quotation marks omitted.gm stock,priced at at the end of,fell to over the next two years its market capitalization slid from billion to billion.ford stock price decreased from a share in to by the end of its market capitalization fell from billion to approximately billion during that time.
gm recovery strategy and the proceedings below.to address these fiscal challenges,gm has sought to scale back production and cut costs across the board.in,gm closed or idled assembly plants in maryland,michigan and new jersey to reduce excess capacity.gm ja.in addition,gm announced plans to close twelve assembly plants or facilities,to lay off salaried employees and hourly workers,to cut the salaries of senior leadership,to place caps on healthcare expenditures for salaried employees and retirees and to reduce its annual dividend to shareholders.
a central feature of gm recovery strategy included reducing the burden of its accumulated healthcare obligations to hourly retirees.when the uaw refused to discuss the possibility of modifying hourly retirees healthcare benefits in,gm responded that it would unilaterally reduce the benefits.although no retiree filed a lawsuit to block gm action,the uaw stepped in and agreed to negotiate changes to retiree benefits on the condition that the company postpone any cuts until negotiations had concluded and that it fully open its books and share its complete financial data with the uaw.gm ja.an independent financial consultant,lazard freres,llc,reviewed this data for the uaw and concluded that gm had not embellished its fiscal woes.
on october,gm and the uaw announced an agreement that would permit the company to modify its retiree healthcare benefits.because the two entities had no authority to act on behalf of the retirees,the uaw approached two hourly retirees each of whom had been elected to a local retired workers chapter about filing a class action against gm.at the uaw suggestion,the retirees retained william payne as lead class counsel.among other qualifications,payne had practiced law for years and had litigated approximately retiree healthcare class actions.on october,the uaw and the retirees jointly filed a class action lawsuit against gm under the employee retirement income security act of and the relations act.see.the action sought a declaration that the retiree health care benefits set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreements may not be unilaterally terminated or modified by gm.gm ja.on october,the uaw notified retirees of the class action,informed them of the potential settlement with gm and explained that retirees would have an opportunity to object to any aspect of the proposal.gm ja.
over the next two months,the class representatives through class counsel reviewed all of the financial data gm had provided to the uaw and hired their own independent consultant to analyze the data.although class counsel recognized that there was a framework for this settlement already in place the day the complaint was filed,gm ja,he became involved in negotiations while the settlement was still being drafted,gm ja.on december,the consultant reported that gm is experiencing significant financial strain without cost sharing,and other measures,gm ability to continue to provide retiree health benefits in the future could be endangered.gm ja.on december,gm,the uaw and the class representatives agreed to a settlement.
on december,the district court certified a class of 
all persons who,as of november,were a hourly employees who had retired from gm with eligibility to participate in retirement in the gm health care program for hourly employees,or b the spouses,surviving spouses and dependents of hourly employees,who,as of november,were eligible for or surviving spouse health care coverage under the gm health care program for hourly employees as a consequence of a hourly employee retirement from gm or death prior to retirement.
gm ja.the court appointed payne as class counsel and preliminarily approved the settlement.the court also directed payne to notify all class members people of the proposed settlement.class members received a notice explaining their rights,a complete copy of the settlement agreement and a cover letter from payne and the uaw.
on march,the district court held a fairness hearing,at which it considered the objections to the settlement from retirees.the court admitted declarations from gm,the uaw and the class in favor of the proposed settlement and declarations from gm retiree leroy mcknight opposing it.mcknight called class members who opposed the settlement as witnesses.the court certified the class and approved the settlement.
ford recovery strategy and the proceedings below.ford has taken a similar route to return its north american automotive operations to profitability,ford ja the company plans to close manufacturing facilities by,intends to cut billion a year in material costs such as steel by,has reduced officer ranks by,has eliminated salaried positions and has curtailed the pension and fringe benefits of the company salaried employees.
ford also announced in early that it intended to cut retiree healthcare benefits.the uaw started negotiations with ford,and ford disclosed its confidential financial projections to the uaw.after the uaw financial consultant concluded that ford prospects were at least as dire as the company insisted,the uaw presented ford with a package of proposed modest cuts to retiree health benefits a package consistent with the framework it had negotiated with gm.ford ja.after further negotiations,ford agreed to the framework.
the uaw approached several ford hourly retirees about filing a class action against ford,suggesting that payne serve as class counsel.on december,the uaw and several hourly retirees filed a class action against ford,seeking a declaration that the healthcare benefits provided to retirees under the collective bargaining agreements had vested.after learning of the negotiations between ford and the uaw,ford retiree lawrence bronson filed an independent class action on behalf of ford hourly retirees on january,using the same law firm that represented mcknight.
on february,ford,the uaw and the proposed class moved to certify the class and to appoint payne as class counsel.one week later,they agreed to a final settlement.as with the gm litigation,the class representatives hired a financial consultant to review ford financial data and instructed class counsel to conduct a thorough analysis of relevant law before approving the deal.
on february,the district court certified a class consisting of 
all persons who,as of december,were a hourly employees who had retired from ford with eligibility to participate in retirement in the ford program plan,or b the spouses,surviving spouses and dependents of hourly employees,who,as of december,were eligible for or surviving spouse health care coverage under the plan as a consequence of a hourly employee retirement from ford or death prior to retirement.
ford ja.the court also appointed payne as counsel for the class,preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and ordered the parties to notify the class of the settlement agreement.
the ford litigation suffered several fits and starts on its way to a fairness hearing.on march,the district court judge who had presided over the case up to that point recused himself,as did the next judge assigned to the case.after the action landed on the desk of a third judge,bronson moved the court to revisit a number of issues,claiming that the class representation was inadequate,that the settlement was unfair,that certain declarants needed to attend the fairness hearing,that the notice of settlement provided to class members was inadequate and that the objection period should be extended.the court rejected each contention.
on may,the district court held the fairness hearing,allowing all parties to submit declarations,testimony and other evidence,as well as briefs and oral argument.it also reviewed the objections of class members to the settlement.the district court certified the class and approved the settlement agreement.
the settlement agreements.the two settlement agreements share a similar framework.they replace the current and plan offered to retirees with two options a modified plan comprised of modest monthly premiums and substantial benefits or a catastrophic plan with no monthly premiums but higher deductibles,higher emergency room,and higher prescription drug payments.gm ja ford ja.in the long run,gm expects to reduce its annual healthcare expenditures by billion and shed some billion of its accumulated retiree healthcare obligations ford expects to shave more than billion from its accumulated retiree healthcare obligations.
the modified plans impose several specific and new costs on retirees a monthly premium of for individuals,for families a yearly deductible of for individuals,for families and a obligation for healthcare services.retirees also must assume part of the cost of prescription drugs for generics and for drugs when purchased at retail.all of these costs,according to the plans,may not be raised by more than per year for the life of the agreement.
not all retirees must assume these new costs.retirees entitled to an annual pension of less than gm retirees and about ford substantially the same benefits they had before the settlement agreement.
and the retirees who must pay these new costs will not be required to pay all of them.under the agreements,a substantial percentage of these costs will be paid for through a trust set up for that the parties call a defined contribution voluntary employees beneficiary association trust,a trust for short if not for elegance.gm ja.gm will contribute billion in cash to its trust through,along with at least million a year in payments from through and additional payments based on increases in gm stock price.ford has promised million in cash to its trust through,along with additional payments triggered by the appreciation of ford stock.the uaw also has agreed to fund the trusts by deferring negotiated wage and adjustments and contributing those negotiated increases to each company respective all about a year in contributions from each active employee.in gm case,these foregone wages should add billion to the trust over the next years.
an independent committee administers the two trusts,using the funds generated by the trusts to reduce participant expenses.the trust funds will reduce monthly premiums to for individuals and for families,and pocket maximums will be limited to for individuals and for families for health services.as a result,individual retirees can expect to pay a maximum of and families a maximum of a year for complete healthcare coverage during the first year of the plan.the trusts also will pay for retiree dental coverage.although the modified plan does not guarantee any future level of cost reduction,estimates suggest that both trusts will be able to continue these reductions for at least years.
the modified plan also attempts to reduce the overall cost of retiree healthcare benefits for the companies.the plan imposes a on visits to the emergency room unless the retiree is admitted to the hospital.it requires higher and maximums for the use of healthcare services.it requires retirees who voluntarily choose an provider to pay any charges above those deemed reasonable and customary in the industry.gm ja ford ja.and it coordinates benefits with medicare,attempting to take advantage of the government coverage without reducing the benefits offered to retirees.
although the settlement agreement contains no formal end date,the companies and the uaw have the right to terminate each agreement at any time after september.should gm or ford terminate its respective agreement after that date,each has agreed that the case law as of the effective date of the settlement shall be treated as the applicable body of judicial decisional law for subsequent litigation regarding the vesting of retiree healthcare this provision does not apply to legislative,regulatory,or administrative developments after the effective date.gm ja ford ja.
the arguments of the objectors,be they retirees of ford or gm,fall into four general categories that the class representation was not fair and adequate.a that the notice of the class settlement was not reasonable.e b that the settlement agreements are not fair,reasonable,and adequate.e c and that the objectors should have been given additional discovery.each of these decisions by the district court receives review.see olden lafarge,cir class certification franks kroger,cir settlement class notice clark equip.int l union,allied indus.workers of,cir settlement approval bowling pfizer,cir discovery.
before a court may certify a class,it must ensure that the class satisfies each of rule a requirements and that it falls within one of three categories permitted by rule b.see sprague motors,cir en banc.because rule is designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions,a district court must give undiluted,even heightened,attention to its protections before certifying a formed just for the purpose of settlement,not for litigation.amchem,windsor,d.
many of rule demands require little discussion here.as to gm the class,consisting of retirees and dependents,is undoubtedly so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a because the claims of all retirees stem from the collective bargaining agreements negotiated between gm and the uaw,they share common questions of law or fact.a the claims of the class the retirees healthcare benefits are vested under erisa and the are typical of the claims of every other member of the class.a and gm has threatened to modify all retiree healthcare benefits unilaterally,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.b.mcknight does not challenge any of these findings on behalf of the gm objectors,and we see no reasonable basis upon which he could have done so.the same is true of the ford class.
both objectors instead start by targeting two related class representatives ability to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a,and the adequacy of class counsel.g b c.class representatives are adequate when it appear s that they will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel,senter motors,cir,which usually will be the case if the representatives are part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.motor freight,rodriguez,d internal quotation marks omitted.because named class members must act through class counsel,adequacy of representation turns in part on the competency of class counsel and in part on the absence of conflicts of interest.of sw.falcon,d see.g c.
even after accounting for the undiluted,heightened attention that rule a procedural safeguards receive in the context of classes,amchem,at,the district courts did not abuse their discretion in certifying these classes and in determining that absent class members would be adequately represented.the named representatives are part of each class,and because all class members share a common the retirees healthcare benefits have vested under the collective bargaining legal interests parallel the named representatives interests.see.motor freight,at.the gm and ford retirees had another reason to trust these representatives the retirees previously elected all but one of the named class members to represent them in another capacity.
william payne was competent to represent each class and did not have a conflict of interest.payne has practiced labor law for almost years,has litigated almost retiree healthcare class actions at the trial and appellate levels,has authored numerous articles on the law of retirement benefits,has contributed to bna treatise on employee benefits and heads the american bar association subcommittee for benefit claims and individual rights.in view of payne background,both classes would have been hard pressed to find someone with greater experience in handling class actions and claims of the type asserted in the action or an attorney with more knowledge of the applicable law.g c i.not only was payne qualified,he also was prepared,if need be,to prosecute these cases he had six attorneys plus substantial support staff ready to assist him he retrieved and reviewed boxes of materials from gm and ford,including all of the financial information the two companies shared with the uaw,gm ja ford ja he hired an independent financial consultant to analyze the fiscal health of the companies and by all appearances he thoroughly investigated the potential claims of both classes under erisa and the lmra.payne,in brief,was willing to,and indeed did,commit substantial resources to representing the class es.g c i.
more,payne involvement in the negotiations was an essential check on the process,safeguarding the rights of absent class members.unaffiliated with the uaw or the companies,both professionally and financially,payne had every incentive to press the classes claims and,if appropriate,to reject the settlement framework proposed by gm,ford and the uaw.payne remained free to recommend the proposed framework to the classes and free to negotiate the terms of the final settlement,which was still being drafted,gm ja,on behalf of the classes.and payne did both of these in a few discrete instances with gm and the uaw and ultimately recommending a settlement to the gm retirees because,in payne considered judgment,the burdens and expense of litigation,the risks and uncertainties associated with protracted trials and appeals,and the risks and uncertainties of recovering from a potentially insolvent entity outweighed the relatively small burden which the class would absorb by the acceptance of.gm ja.payne had similar discretion in the ford litigation and made the same considered recommendation to the ford retirees.
the objectors counter that the representation was inadequate because,during the negotiations,the uaw lack ed the authority to take measures that would impair the retirees rights without their consent.mcknight br.at bronson br.at.but the uaw lack of authority to diminish retirees benefits without their consent,see cleveland illuminating utility workers union of,cir,does not speak to the adequacy of class counsel representation.while the uaw no doubt insisted that the car companies respect the rights of the retirees during the initial negotiations,it did not purport to bind the retirees in the negotiations.that was payne job.he evaluated the options of retirees on their behalf,and the decision to accept or reject the settlement was left to the named class representatives.
the objectors suggestion that the uaw compromised the vested benefits of the retirees suffers from the same flaw.the uaw had no such authority and never purported to exercise it.in the final analysis,the named class the the retirees of each company,removing the risk of any conflict between the interests of the uaw and the retirees.
the objectors next contend that the uaw exercised undue influence in selecting the named class members and class counsel,undermining the structural assurance of fair and adequate representation.amchem,at.see also reynolds beneficial bank,cir warning that,if given free reign,the opposing party will choose the most ineffectual class lawyers to negotiate a settlement.but the uaw several potential class representatives to payne,see gm ja ford ja not suffice to condemn the class.for one,the uaw had little choice but to get involved.when gm and later ford announced that it would unilaterally reduce retiree healthcare benefits,no retiree filed suit.when the uaw blocked that action and negotiated with the car companies for the next six months,no retiree filed suit.and when the uaw and the companies were ready to negotiate with the retirees,no one retiree had authority to negotiate on behalf of the other retirees.at that point,the uaw and the companies had no choice but to seek potential class they limited their involvement to referring already trusted members of the class to an experienced and independent counsel.if this limited and necessary involvement constituted undue influence,what would not rutter wilbanks shell oil,cir rejecting collusion argument that would lead to the conclusion that no settlement could ever occur in the circumstances of parallel or multiple class actions internal quotation marks omitted.
for another,courts customarily demand evidence of improper incentives for the class representatives or class as a promise of excessive attorney fees in return for a,expedited abandoning the presumption that the class representatives and counsel handled their responsibilities with the independent vigor that the adversarial process demands.see,in re cmty.bank of,cir noting the special danger of collusiveness when the attorney fees were negotiated simultaneously with the settlement reynolds,at weinberger great nekoosa,cir.no such problem exists here,as the settlement does not determine payne fees erisa does,and it says that a district court may in its discretion allow a reasonable attorney fee.g.without more,we must afford payne and the class representatives the normal they handled their responsibilities independently and zealously.
the objectors add that,even if payne tried to represent the class vigorously,he lacked the power to do so because he had no practical ability to request changes to the proposed settlement.mcknight br.at see bronson br.at.to the extent the objectors mean to suggest that payne was legally precluded from litigating the case disarmed from pressing for a better offer in the words of amchem products,at.is wrong because payne appeared to represent a coherent class that could have proceeded to trial but did not,unlike the sprawling class action in amchem products that never could have proceeded to trial in the first place,id.at.
to the extent the objectors mean to complain that,as a practical matter,payne had little hope of altering the proposed settlement agreements by the time he entered the picture,that also does not show the inadequacy of his representation.the question is whether payne had authority to reject the settlement on behalf of the class or insist on modifications,not whether payne was likely to succeed if he took that course.
the record,moreover,confirms that payne exercised this authority in a reasonable way.in his considered view,the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the value of any remedy that litigation might produce.notably,the companies and the known historically as congenial negotiating to the same view about the same risks would the retirees or the car companies win the vesting argument and even if the retirees won the vesting argument,would the car companies be able to make good on these benefits obligations without entering bankruptcy and if the car companies sought chapter relief,what kinds of benefits would retirees receive in the end the settlements also offered something that the retirees could never have obtained on their contributions to the trusts from existing employees and a modification to the collective bargaining agreements that the uaw alone could negotiate,both of which helped to address the problem of ensuring a future funding stream for these benefits.
yes,the car companies and the uaw told the retirees and payne that the settlement agreements were being offered on a basis.but there is no way of knowing whether they meant it.surely this would not have been the first time that a party insisted that it would never consent to additional changes to a proposed then consented.the question is whether each class had the right to reject that offer each did.and the question is whether payne acted reasonably as class counsel in recommending that class members approve the settlement as is he since the uaw at that point already had convinced active employees to make substantial contributions to the trust and since any additional changes to the settlement would have required a new ratification by active workers,the same workers who barely approved the settlement the first time least in ford case.see gm ja ford memorandum of understanding passed by to margin.
the objectors maintain that the terms of the settlement created improper intraclass that the district court as a result should have divided the class into subclasses based on age and income.see mcknight br.at bronson br.at accord.c b.in support,they point out that a class representative with a pension significantly above the threshold would have little incentive to ensure that the financial burdens of the settlement are fair to those retirees receiving pensions just above the threshold.mcknight reply br.at see bronson reply br.at.no doubt,the district courts could have drawn additional class lines,but they did not abuse their discretion in choosing not to do so.other,equally tenable lines could have been drawn with equal force between retirees living alone and those with dependents between retirees needing drugs,those using generics and those who rarely if ever use pharmaceuticals between retirees whose preferred physician is in the network and those who frequent doctors between those with significant dental costs and those with none and so on.yet if every distinction drawn or not drawn by a settlement required a new subclass,class counsel would need to confine settlement terms to the simplest imaginable or risk fragmenting the class beyond repair.see in re cendant.sec,cir i f subclassing is required for each material legal or economic difference that distinguishes class members,the balkanization of the class action is threatened.internal quotation marks omitted clark,at subclassing is appropriate only when the court believes it will materially improve the litigation and is not always necessary because subclassing often leads to more complex and protracted litigation.neither the federal rules of civil procedure nor the supreme court requires that settlements offer a pro rata distribution to class members instead the settlement need only be fair,reasonable,and adequate.e c see ortiz fibreboard,d although f air treatment in the older cases was characteristically assured by straightforward pro rata distribution of proceeds of the litigation amongst the class,equity in such a simple sense may be unattainable in complex cases.
before ratifying a proposed settlement agreement,a district court also must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the settlement.e b.the notice should be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane cent.hanover bank trust.see also in re tire rubber.sec,cir upholding notice that described the terms of the settlement,the reasons for class representatives decision to settle,the legal effect of the settlement and the rights of the class members to voice their objections.
the district courts did not abuse their discretion in approving either class notice.the notice in the gm case clearly explained its purpose,discussed the nature of the pending suit and proposed class and accurately summarized the settlement agreement and incorporated exhibits in a little over four pages.also enclosed with the notice was a copy of the settlement agreement,ensuring that retirees would have full access to the very document the district court would examine at the fairness hearing.the ford class notice was equally satisfactory.
the objectors insist that the notice was misleading because it did not say that retirees could challenge the proposed class certification as well as the settlement.but the applicable rule contains no such requirement.while an class action under rule b must meet stringent notice requirements,see.c b,a district court need not provide any notice before certifying a mandatory class action under rule b,see.c a for any class certified under rule b or,the court may direct appropriate notice to the class.emphasis added.no less importantly,rule e grants members the right to object to a proposed settlement.e a,not the right to object to certification.and while we have inferred that class members might object to the settlement because the class should not have been certified in the first place,see in re telectronics pacing,cir accord.c c,there is no textual warrant for requiring a notice to lay out every reason a class member might object to the settlement.see.e b requiring the court only to direct notice in a reasonable manner.
also unavailing is the objectors suggestion that the notice was misleading because it repeatedly implied that the proposed settlement was the product of arm length negotiations and failed to inform class members that the uaw had a serious conflict of interest.mcknight br.at see bronson br.at.again,rule e does not require the notice to set forth every ground on which class members might object to the even every reason that mcknight or bronson do object.all that the notice must do is fairly apprise the prospective members of the class of the terms of the proposed settlement so that class members may come to their own conclusions about whether the settlement serves their interests.grunin int l house of pancakes,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the objectors add that other communications between class representatives and class members tarnished the original notice.a letter sent to retirees of both car companies,however,merely spelled out the reasons why the class representatives and the uaw thought the settlement was appropriate,see gm ja ford ja,but it did not purport to come from the district court and thus did not alter the neutrality of the class notice.while some retirees may not have objected to the settlement out of respect for the uaw judgment which seems to be the objectors primary concern,this letter could not have been the underlying source of that concern.the class notice itself informed class members that the uaw supported the settlement.
before approving a settlement,a district court must conclude that it is fair,reasonable,and adequate.e c see.e a.several factors guide the inquiry the risk of fraud or collusion the complexity,expense and likely duration of the litigation the amount of discovery engaged in by the parties the likelihood of success on the merits the opinions of class counsel and class representatives the reaction of absent class members and the public interest.see granada,dwg,cir williams vukovich,cir.
the fairness of each settlement turns in large part on the bona fides of the parties legal dispute.although this inquiry understandably does not require us to decide the merits of the case or resolve unsettled legal questions,we can not judge the fairness of a proposed compromise without weighing the plaintiff likelihood of success on the merits against the amount and form of the relief offered in the settlement.carson am.brands,d see in re tire rubber,at.the retirees claims rest on one question do the agreements vest former union workers with their healthcare benefits upon retirement as the parties see it,two lines of sixth circuit cases offer competing answers.
the retirees and the uaw point to the line of cases as support for their position that the retirees healthcare benefits vested upon retirement.see int l union,united,aerospace agric.implement workers of am,cir holding that there was sufficient evidence of intent to vest retirees with benefits in the language of the agreement itself see also int l union,united,aerospace agric.implement workers of am.bvr liquidating,cir smith abs,cir.consistent with these cases,they argue,both collective bargaining agreements contain the requisite vesting language the health care coverages an employee has at the time of retirement shall be continued.gm ja see also ford ja the continued coverage to which eligible retired employees are entitled will be the aid coverages as described above.
gm and ford invoke the sprague line of the effect that an employer commitment to vest must be stated in clear and express language in the plan documents.sprague motors,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.consistent with these cases,they argue,a reservation of rights to modify retiree healthcare benefits is inconsistent with the claim that those benefits have irreversibly vested,see maurer joy,cir bvr liquidating,at,and note that the two companies retiree healthcare plans contain such a reservation,see gm ja any rate of payment by the enrollee and any other terms and conditions of the program may be changed at any time by the corporation.ford ja it is understood that the provisions herein are agreements between the company and the union and,although they set forth intended arrangements involving third parties,they shall not be relied upon by any such third party as establishing any right for it against the company or the union.ford ja from the summary plan description the company reserves the right to end,suspend or amend these plans,subject to the applicable collective bargaining agreement if changes are made,you will be notified.
our task is not to decide whether one side is right or even whether one side has the better of these arguments.otherwise,we would be compelled to defeat the purpose of a settlement in order to approve a settlement.the question rather is whether the parties are using settlement to resolve a legitimate legal and factual disagreement.a brief review of the above language from the collective bargaining agreements and these cases proves that is the case.
what makes these settlements particularly sensible,moreover,is that,even if this merits question favored one party over the other,the retirees still would have had ample reason to control the resolution of this dispute through negotiation today rather than litigation tomorrow.if we decided for the sake of argument that the retirees were likely to lose the sprague debate,little would stand in the way of the car companies reducing or even eliminating the retirees healthcare benefits in the future.if we decided for the sake of argument that the retirees were likely to win the debate,any such victory would run the risk of being a pyrrhic one because the cost of insisting on irreversible healthcare benefits might well indeed almost certainly would continuing downward spiral of the companies financial position.if gm automotive divisions lost billion in while spending billion to pay retiree healthcare benefits and ford division lost billion while spending billion on retirees,it takes little imagination to picture the future financial toll this burden would place on the two companies.while we need not embellish the point by raising the prospect of bankruptcy,it is well to remember that the federal government pension benefit guaranty corporation,which provides pension guarantees for the employees and retirees of financially distressed companies,has no sister agency that provides the same guarantees for retiree healthcare benefits.
in view of the risks the retirees faced from losing and winning the debate,it is no wonder that payne recommended settlement to the class representatives no wonder that the named representatives consented to each settlement no wonder that less than one half of one
