petitioner wolf creek collieries appeals from a decision and order of the united states department of labor benefits review board the board affirming the administrative law judge denial of a request for modification of his award of black lung survivor benefits to respondent evelyn stephens,and the board subsequent denial of petitioner motion for reconsideration.the arguments presented by petitioner to justify further review by this court are,first,that the alj improperly gave automatic preference to the treating physician opinion,and second,that the alj opinion is erroneously based on the treating physician diagnosis which lacks both substantial evidence and an articulated rationale,and relies on incomplete or invalid data.because we find that petitioner arguments lack factual and legal merit,we affirm the benefits award.
factual and procedural background 
on august,evelyn stephens applied for survivor benefits under the black lung benefits act,et,following the december,death of her husband,andrew stephens stephens death certificate identified the cause of death as respiratory pneumonia due to or as a consequence of coal workers.see.stephens had worked for years in the coal mines of kentucky,the last nine years of which he worked as an electrician foreman for petitioner wolf creek collieries wolf creek.the department of labor the dol identified wolf creek as the responsible coal mine operator liable for any benefits awarded.
on february,a district director of the office of workers compensation programs of the dol denied stephens claim,ruling that she had not proven that her husband suffered from,or died due to,pneumoconiosis.a request for reconsideration of the claim was also denied on june.stephens then requested that the case be forwarded to the dol office of administrative law judges for a hearing before an administrative law judge alj to appeal the district director decision.
the initial hearing before the alj 
a hearing was held on stephens claim before alj robert hillyard on june.after reviewing the evidence of record,alj hillyard found that stephens had pneumoconiosis which contributed to or hastened his death and,accordingly,awarded stephens survivor benefits payable by wolf creek.
the medical evidence of record reviewed by the alj included evidence,hospital records,and the reports and testimony of a number of physicians.three,broudy and that stephens suffered a severe pulmonary impairment,but disagreed as to what caused the impairment.two of the physicians,broudy and wright,who had each examined stephens only one time eight years before his death,concluded in that his respiratory impairment resulted from an extensive smoking history.and.hieronymus also examined stephens in but diagnosed coal workers pneumoconiosis.hieronymus was stephens primary care physician and he continued for eight years after to treat stephens until his death in.
charles hieronymus is board certified in family medicine and was classified as an certified reader of.hieronymus testified that he diagnosed stephens pneumoconiosis based on his reading of an initial chest roentogram study,a history of coal mine work and presenting symptoms of dyspnea,orthopnea and nonproductive cough.he testified that stephens presented with decreased breath sounds and expiratory wheezes.his nail beds showed marked clubbing and were cyanotic.hieronymus described stephens chest as showing nonspecific interstitial pulmonary disease throughout all zones,justifying an ilo classification of the doctor stated that stephens was a light smoker,with only a smoking history.
in addition to hieronymus records of his initial examination of stephens,the alj was presented with hospital records from showing stephens ongoing treatment by hieronymus.
during,the year of his death,andrew stephens was hospitalized many times for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and respiratory failure.hieronymus treated stephens throughout the year.hospital records reviewed by the alj showed an ongoing diagnosis from at least february,through december,of coal workers pneumoconiosis,in addition to copd,congestive heart failure,bronchitis and pneumonia.see.stephens died at the hospital on december.as the alj noted,hieronymus recorded the cause of death as respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia due to coal workers pneumoconiosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
as noted,the alj also considered the reports of two other examining physicians,broudy and wright,who diagnosed respiratory conditions unrelated to coal dust exposure.ballard wright examined stephens one time on march,and recorded a underground mining history and a smoking history that was reportedly reduced at that time to five to six cigarettes per day.noting a severe aerobic impairment,wright diagnosed stephens as suffering from emphysema with a severe obstructive component.he concluded that stephens lung impairments were not related to his coal mine work and that he did not have symptoms of pneumoconiosis.
bruce broudy also examined stephens only one time,on october,and recorded a coal mining employment history of years and a smoking history of a,which reportedly by then had been reduced to per day.broudy read the evidence as negative for any evidence of coal worker pneumoconiosis.tests,including spirometry and arterial blood gas studies,showed severe respiratory impairment and led to a diagnosis of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases secondary to chronic bronchitis and emphysema.he reported that his findings did not support a diagnosis of coal worker pneumoconiosis rather,he attributed the respiratory impairment to cigarette smoking.
based upon his review of all of the evidence,the alj concluded that evelyn stephens had established that her husband death was due to pneumoconiosis.he explained his reasoning in his march decision and order 
the record contains medical reports by broudy,wright,hieronymus and the medical records from highland medical center.broudy and wright examined the miner in.broudy was of the opinion that the miner did not have coal workers pneumoconiosis but did have bronchitis and emphysema resulting from his long smoking history.he said that the miner did not have the respiratory capacity to perform underground coal work.wright diagnosed emphysema with a severe obstructive component unrelated to coal mine work.
hieronymus was the miner physician from until he died in and was the attending physician at his death.hieronymus performed a pulmonary evaluation of the miner in.he saw and treated the miner several times each year.hieronymus treated the miner during his numerous hospitalizations in.hieronymus diagnosed coal workers pneumoconiosis and stated that death was due to pneumoconiosis or complications thereof,and opined that the respiratory failure and all other problems were probably related to coal workers pneumoconiosis.
the hospital records are numerous and leave no doubt that the miner had a severe pulmonary impairment.broudy and wright agreed that the miner had a severe pulmonary impairment although they do not agree on the cause.
the most recent medical evidence is from hieronymus and the hospital records.hieronymus saw and treated the miner many times a year from to.i find troubling the fact that hieronymus noted the miner as a light smoker with a smoking history of approximately five years.the evidence establishes a smoking history of about years however,this is not sufficient to discredit hieronymus opinions.because hieronymus treated the miner for over nine years up until his death and there are no contrary medical reports more recent than,i give the most weight to the opinion of hieronymus.based on his opinion,i find that the claimant has established that the miner death was due to and that pneumoconiosis contributed to and hastened the miner death.
accordingly,the alj awarded stephens survivor benefits payable by wolf creek.
wolf creek request for modification 
wolf creek subsequently requested a modification hearing on the award.that request was granted and on november,alj hillyard conducted a second hearing.in this second hearing,the alj reviewed newly submitted medical evidence as well as his prior decision and failed to find a mistake in any determination of fact.
in the modification hearing,in addition to reviewing the evidence that the alj had reviewed in the initial hearing,alj hillyard also reviewed new physicians reports.this new evidence included two letters written by steven kraman.kraman never examined stephens but reviewed his medical history and records at the request of the dol and,in a very brief statement,without citation to any specific findings,summarily stated that he found no evidence that stephens suffered from,or died as a result of pneumoconiosis.
the alj also reviewed the june reports of james castle and joseph renn.these two doctors reviewed stephens medical records and the other evidence of record from the initial hearing and disagreed with hieronymus opinions and diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.they believed that stephens respiratory condition resulted from smoking rather than coal dust exposure and that his death was not related to coal mine employment.while castle was emphatic in his opinion that stephens did not have pneumoconiosis,renn offered his conclusions with a reasonable degree of medical certainty,but he did not state his conclusions were unequivocal.
although the newly submitted physician reports of castle and renn again called attention to hieronymus error documenting the miner smoking history,the alj again accorded nine years of treatment greater weight than the examinations conducted by broudy and wright in.the alj accorded even less weight to the consultative reports of renn and castle and to the unsubstantiated summary statement of kraman because these doctors never actually examined stephens.finding no basis for a ruling of mistake,the alj denied the employer modification request on april,explaining 
to pass the threshold test in its request for modification,the employer must show a mistake in determination of fact in the prior decision 
i have reviewed my prior decision dated january,and the medical evidence considered at that time and find no mistake in determination of any fact.hieronymus examined the miner on numerous occasions between and december,the date of the miner death.the most recent examinations by broudy and wright were in.as the miner treating physician,hieronymus was best suited to make an assessment of the miner condition over a period of time.i find his opinion entitled to more weight than the other doctors of record.see tussey island creek coal,cir more weight may be accorded to the conclusions of a treating physician because he is more likely to be familiar with the miner condition.kraman never examined the miner and his two letters do not explain the bases of his opinions.due to the lack of support and detail in his letters,his opinions are entitled to little weight.see risher office of workers compensation program,cir stating that an administrative law judge may disregard medical opinion that does not adequately explain the basis for its conclusion.the consultative reports of renn and castle also fail to establish a mistake of fact.although they correctly point out that hieronymus relied on an erroneous smoking history,i considered this fact in my prior decision.the reliance on an erroneous smoking history is troubling but does not overcome the advantage hieronymus had in treating the miner over the period from to.renn and castle never examined the miner and their opinions are entitled to less weight than the opinions of hieronymus 
the employer,wolf creek collieries,has not shown a change in conditions or a mistake in determination of fact and,therefore,its modification request must fail.
wolf creek appeal to the benefits review board 
wolf creek subsequently appealed to the benefits review board seeking to overturn the alj decision.just as it now argues before this court,wolf creek only argument before the board was that the alj erred in crediting the medical opinion of hieronymus as stephens treating physician.the board found no merit in wolf creek argument,explaining 
employer contends that the administrative law judge erred in crediting the opinion of hieronymous sic as his report is inaccurate as to the length of smoking history,and that the administrative law judge blindly credited this opinion without examining its substance.employer also asserts that the administrative law judge refused to consider the merits of the highly qualified physicians renn and castle,and thereby violated the administrative procedure act apa.we disagree.the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit,wherein jurisdiction of this case lies,has repeatedly held that treating physicians are entitled to greater weight although the administrative law judge may discredit the opinion of a treating physician in light of the factors noted by employer,he is not required to do so.in the instant case,the administrative law judge fully considered the fact that hieronymous sic noted an inaccurate length of smoking and therefore committed no error.therefore,we affirm the administrative law judge decision to accord greater weight to the opinion of hieronymous sic,and affirm his finding that employer failed to establish a mistake in determination of fact.furthermore,we reject employer argument that the administrative law judge decision does not comply with the apa,as the administrative law judge properly addressed the relevant evidence and provided a sufficient rationale for his findings.
accordingly,the decision and of request for modification of the administrative law judge is affirmed.

the board denial of wolf creek motion for reconsideration 
the board its decision upholding the alj decision in its subsequent decision and order denying wolf creek motion for reconsideration.in so doing,the board rejected out of hand wolf creek contention that by crediting and relying upon hieronymus opinion,the alj and the board had created a treating physician preference 
t he administrative law judge did what the case law of the sixth circuit permits him to do,namely,examine the treating physician opinion on its merits and make a reasoned judgment as to its credibility.none of the cases cited by employer require the administrative law judge to discredit a treating physician opinion indeed,they uphold the rule that these opinions are generally entitled to greater weight.the board decision and order correctly noted that the controlling cases of brown and tussey do not require the administrative law judge to consider other factors,and concluded that the administrative law judge fully considered the fact that hieronymous sic recorded an inaccurate smoking history but nonetheless provided an adequate rationale for according the opinion greater weight 
employer also directs the board attention to the director proposed rules as published in the federal register.proposed regulation d provides that the medical opinion of the treating physician may be entitled to controlling weight and that the administrative law judge must take into consideration the following factors the nature and duration of the relationship,the frequency and extent of treatment,and the credibility of the opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation.however,as these rules are not yet in effect,neither the board nor the administrative law judge is bound by them.regardless,the administrative law judge did precisely as they require,in that he considered the nature,duration,extent,and frequency of the relationship by noting that hieronymous sic was the treating physician for the miner pulmonary condition for a period of nine years and often attended claimant in a hospital setting.in addition,the administrative law judge assessed the adequacy of the reasoning and documentation underlying hieronymous sic conclusions.therefore,the administrative law judge properly considered all of the factors contemplated by the proposed regulation 
contrary to employer contention,the board has not created a preference for a treating physician that is inconsistent with tussey and brown.therefore,the board rejects employer contention.
as employer has not demonstrated any error on the part of the administrative la
