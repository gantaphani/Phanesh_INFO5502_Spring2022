the alj discussed each of the violations found by the state surveyors,beginning with the death of.died,in part,the alj concluded,because fairfax did not have in place a policy for the monitoring of residents following an episode of respiratory distress.this lack of a policy and later failures to comply with the new policy posed severe risk to the health and of the patients.the alj found that all but one of the surveyors reported violations constituted a risk to patients at the immediate jeopardy level.the alj emphasized the repeated monitoring failures and the threat those failures posed to the residents.the alj found that there is not only a prima facie case of noncompliance here,but the preponderance of the evidence is that petitioner was not complying substantially with the regulations governing the proper care of residents.at.finally,the alj found that the amount of the cmp was reasonable.
department appeals board,appellate division decision 
fairfax appealed the alj decision to the dab appellate division.fairfax argued that the alj erred following the appellate division earlier ruling in hillman and assigning the ultimate burden of proof to fairfax.it further contended that the alj applied the wrong legal standard,linked together unrelated incidents and that the amount of the cmp was punitive,rather than remedial.
with respect to the burden of proof,cms submitted that fairfax had waived the issue by not raising it before the alj.the appellate division took note of this objection,but decided the issue on the merits.the appellate division first concluded that the burden of proof was irrelevant because the evidence was not in equipoise.the appellate division nevertheless reaffirmed hillman and rejected fairfax argument.the appellate division also rejected fairfax other arguments,determining that the alj applied the proper legal standard,that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence and that the amount of the cm
