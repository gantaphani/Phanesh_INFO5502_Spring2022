michigan surgery investment,llc and its affiliates appeal the dismissal of this civil action with prejudice after the plaintiffs had moved for voluntary dismissal without prejudice under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.because the district court did not give the plaintiffs notice of its intention to dismiss with prejudice,along with an opportunity to withdraw the request for voluntary dismissal,the court should not have dismissed with prejudice.
this case arises out of a power struggle between doctors and investors for control of the dearborn surgery center,an outpatient surgery center in dearborn,michigan.plaintiffs are three affiliated indiana businesses,collectively referred to here as michigan surgery.defendants are two affiliated michigan corporations,collectively referred to here as oakwood,and individual physicians.
michigan surgery filed this suit against oakwood and the physicians on november,alleging various state law claims including breach of contract,breaches of fiduciary duty,and oppression of members of the dearborn surgery center.count iii of the complaint sought a declaration that an agreement between oakwood and the physicians was invalid as against public policy because the consideration paid to the physicians violated the federal act,b.michigan surgery asserted there was federal question jurisdiction on the theory that its right to have the agreement between oakwood and the physicians declared invalid depend ed on the validity,construction,or effect of federal law,under mikulski centerior energy,cir.
the physicians responded by filing a parallel action against michigan surgery in wayne county circuit court on december,alleging breach of contract,conversion,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and civil conspiracy.the physicians also filed a timely rule b response to michigan surgery complaint,arguing that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because michigan surgery claim that the agreement between oakwood and the physicians was invalid failed to raise a federal question under u.
on january,michigan surgery filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against the physicians,seeking to enjoin them from activities that allegedly amounted to breach of contract.the motion was denied the following day.at the hearing,the district court expressed some reservations about whether there was jurisdiction and whether michigan surgery had sued the proper parties.however,the court did not consider the physicians rule b motion to dismiss.
on february,michigan surgery filed a motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice under rule a.michigan surgery argued that the parallel action filed by the physicians was currently pending in wayne county circuit court,and that the cases should be consolidated in state court i n the interest of judicial efficiency and economy.in their response to michigan surgery motion for voluntary dismissal,the physicians argued that if the district court granted michigan surgery motion,dismissal should be with prejudice.on march,michigan surgery and oakwood stipulated to a dismissal without prejudice of all claims against oakwood,leaving only the claims against the physicians.
on march,the district court,with a different judge now assigned to the case,held a hearing to consider the parties pending motions to dismiss the physicians rule b motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,and michigan surgery rule a motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court dismissed the case with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction,and entered a minute entry that denied michigan surgery motion for voluntary dismissal and granted,with prejudice,the physicians motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.the minute entry was followed by a march,written order to the same effect.
on march,prior to the entry of the written order,michigan surgery filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,arguing that the court could not dismiss with prejudice an action for which it lacked jurisdiction.michigan surgery asked the court to change its order granting the physicians motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction from being with prejudice to being without prejudice.on april,the district court entered an amended order different from its earlier order.the amended order granted with prejudice michigan surgery rule a motion for voluntary dismissal and denied the physicians rule b motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.michigan surgery now appeals.
the only issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion by entering an order of voluntary dismissal with prejudice,without first giving michigan surgery notice or an opportunity to withdraw the motion and proceed with the litigation.see bridgeport music,music,cir stating the scope of review.reversal is required here because michigan surgery was entitled to such notice and an opportunity to withdraw the motion before accepting a voluntary dismissal with prejudice.
the district court improperly converted michigan surgery motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice into a dismissal with prejudice because the court did not give michigan surgery notice of its intention to dismiss with prejudice.see united states v.one tract of real property,cir.one tract laid out three factors that must be considered in determining whether a court abused its discretion when it dismissed a complaint with prejudice in response to a plaintiff request for dismissal without prejudice 
first,the district court must give the plaintiff notice of its intention to dismiss with prejudice.second,the plaintiff is entitled to an opportunity to be heard in opposition to dismissal with prejudice.third,the plaintiff must be given an opportunity to withdraw the request for voluntary dismissal and proceed with the litigation.this third requirement is essential because,unlike a dismissal without prejudice,a dismissal with prejudice operates as a rejection of the plaintiff claims on the merits and res judicata precludes further litigation.
at citations omitted.in one tract,the district court had dismissed with prejudice a civil forfeiture action brought by the united states after the government had moved for voluntary dismissal without prejudice under rule a.on appeal,we doubted the government assertion that it did not have notice of the court intention to dismiss with prejudice,because the government knew that the opposing party had asked for dismissal with prejudice and the opposing party had argued for dismissal with prejudice at the hearing on the government motion.however,it was unnecessary to decide whether the first two requirements were satisfied,because the third the plaintiff be given an opportunity to withdraw the motion and proceed with the not been met.id.at.
the physicians argue that the notice requirement was satisfied here because michigan surgery was well aware that the district court was considering dismissal with prejudice,since the physicians response to the plaintiffs rule a motion specifically requested that if the court granted the motion,that it dismiss with prejudice.although we reversed in one tract based on the lower court failure to meet the third requirement,rather than the notice requirement,the notice and opportunity to withdraw requirements logically work together.the government in one tract did not have a meaningful opportunity to withdraw its request for voluntary dismissal because it had no notice of the court intention to dismiss with prejudice.stated differently,at least where dismissal with prejudice is the condition,an opportunity to withdraw a request for voluntary dismissal is meaningful only after the plaintiff has been given notice of the terms on which the district court intends to condition a voluntary dismissal.
one tract requirement of notice of the court intention to dismiss with prejudice thus means that the district court must inform the plaintiff that the court intends to grant a rule a motion with prejudice.see id.at.it is not enough that the plaintiff is aware that dismissal with prejudice is possible under rule a,or even that the defendant has requested that any grant of a rule a motion
