los angeles biomedical research institute at medical center biomed appeals the entry of judgment resulting from a jury verdict in favor of defendant geoffrey white in a contract dispute over ownership of a patent.biomed alleges that the jury instructions contained a number of prejudicial errors.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse and remand for a new trial.
backgroundfactual background 
biomed is a medical research institute that allows visiting researchers to use its equipment and facilities.researchers wishing to use the facilities are generally required to sign a patent and copyright agreement p c agreement.in,white became an assistant professor of surgery at medical center and signed biomed p c agreement.the p c agreement states in pertinent part 
this agreement is made by me with medical center,a corporation,hereinafter referred to as the institute,in part consideration of my employment my utilization of institute research facilities.
i understand and agree that every possibly patentable device,process,or product hereinafter referred to as invention,which i conceive reduce to practice while employed by the institute,or during the course of my utilization of any institute research facilities,shall be examined by the institute to determine rights and equities therein in accordance with the institute patent and copyright policy.
i further agree that,in the event any such invention work shall be deemed by the institute to be patentable and the institute desires to seek patent protection therein,i shall execute any documents and do all things necessary to assign to the institute all rights,title and interest therein and to assist the institute in securing patent protection therein 
emphasis added.
conceive and reduce to practice as used in the p c agreement are terms of art used in patent and inventorship law.because these terms are of central importance to understanding the facts and analysis of this case,we define them at the outset.
conceive means,the formation in the mind of the inventor,of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention.burroughs wellcome barr,internal quotation marks omitted.conception is complete only when the idea is so clearly defined in the inventor mind that only ordinary skill would be necessary to reduce the invention to practice,without extensive research or experimentation.id.
in order to establish reduction to practice,the inventor must prove that he constructed the invention and he determined that the invention would work for its intended purpose.cooper goldfarb.
white continued to work at medical center until,when he returned to australia where he is a native and citizen.there,he began exploring endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.an aortic aneurysm is the ballooning of the aorta that if untreated typically results in rupture and death.endovascular surgery repairs such aneurysms without invasive surgery by delivering a fabric tube referred to as a graft from an incision in the upper thigh through the femoral artery to the location of the aneurysm,where the graft essentially replaces the ballooning section of the aorta.
by,white,and his colleague weiyun yu,had begun to eventually new device that would make it easier precisely to place a graft into the aorta.the device,referred to generally as a graft attachment device gad,allows a surgeon to adjust the length of a graft within the aorta by placing one graft inside another and then simply adjusting the overlap between them.
at trial,and now on appeal,the parties hotly disputed when the patented gad was conceived and reduced to practice by white and yu.what seems to be agreed on is that the doctors worked on the development of a gad in australia until october when they first attempted,unsuccessfully,to place a version of it into a patient in sydney.white then arranged for him and yu to have access to biomed facilities during december and january to do certain bench tests and to build and implant miniature versions of the gad into dogs.yu was not asked to and did not sign a p c agreement at that or any other time.this fact became part of white defense.
besides performing the aforementioned tests and experiments,during those two months white also did other testing of the gad at the va long beach and uc irvine hospitals.the two doctors then returned to australia and continued to work on the gad development until october,when white returned to the va long beach hospital and successfully implanted an overlapping into a human.
without notice to biomed,white and yu filed for two patents on the gad in.the patents were issued to them in.see patent filed may,issued june,patent filed,issued.these patents include a number of drawings illustrating the distinct features of the gad.see,patent.as part of the process for obtaining these patents,white filed in a sworn declaration with the patent and trademark office the pto declaration,which described the progression of the gad development.it stated in pertinent part 
between and i began to develop,with weiyun yu,the gad.
in i came to the united states and disclosed to samuel wilson the types of materials that could be used to make the graft,how the graft was to be assembled and how the aspects of the graft design would function together i believe that the disclosure made to wilson was of sufficient detail that it would have enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to make an endovascular graft having such features.
in december of i undertook bench testing of an endovascular graft having features disclosed in the patent application.this bench testing occurred at biomed.the bench testing included placing an endovascular graft inside another graft and balloon expanding the endovascular graft therein.the grafts used were made by weiyun yu and me,at my instruction,and had the features of a wireform supported prosthesis which could be overlapped with another similar prosthesis.more than twenty grafts were tested and the bench tests indicated that one graft could be supported within another.
in september of i performed a procedure in sydney,australia,wherein i repaired a patient aortic aneurysm using an endovascular graft 
on october,i performed an endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm utilizing an endovascular graft having the features of a wireform supported prosthesis which could be overlapped within another prosthesis 
procedural background 
this suit arose out of patent infringement litigation that began after the patents issued.during the infringement litigation,biomed intervened in the case when it learned of white pto declaration claiming conclusive testing at its facilities.the district court stayed that litigation until the ownership issues were resolved.
thus,the trial from which this appeal arises became a contract dispute over the ownership of the gad patents.specifically,the issues were whether the p c agreement continued to apply to white in and and,if so,whether he had conceived reduced to practice the patented gad while at biomed.at issue also were the legal implications of yu involvement in the process.
biomed argued that during december and january,while at biomed,white and yu conceived,built,and successfully tested a gad device that was materially different from an earlier gad design developed in australia.biomed claimed that,while using its facilities,white conceived reduced to practice the patented version of the gad by inventing and testing four new,distinct features that were central to the ultimate operative invention,which biomed refers to as the gad device.accordingly,biomed argued that white was obligated by the p c agreement to assign his patent rights to the gad to biomed.
white,on the other hand,argued that he had no obligation under the p c agreement,even if it still applied to him,because by october of,he had already conceived,in australia,the gad device with the same features that biomed contended were conceived and tested at biomed.specifically,he argued that while at biomed,he and yu only rebuilt identical or miniature versions of the gad already conceived in australia and repeated tests they had already performed in australia.he argued also that the gad was reduced to practice when he successfully implanted it into a patient at the va long beach hospital in october of.
both parties submitted numerous versions of their proposed jury instructions.after hearing the parties on the proposed instructions,the district court issued its final jury instructions.the relevant final instructions there,and now at issue on appeal,are those entitled work of yu,conceive,and reduce to practice cumulatively,the disputed instructions.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned a special verdict in favor of white.although it found that the p c agreement existed between biomed and white at all relevant times,the jury found also that biomed had failed to prove that white had conceived or reduced to practice the gad during the course of his utilization of biomed research facilities.the district court entered judgment on that verdict.
discussiona.standard of review.
the standard of review on appeal for an alleged error in jury instructions depends on the nature of the claimed error.dang cross,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review de novo whether the instructions misstated the law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we review a district court formulation of jury instructions in a civil case for abuse of discretion.id.here,review is de novo because biomed alleges misstatements of law.
where an error in instructing the jury is found,prejudice is presumed and the burden shifts to the appellee to demonstrate that it is more probable than not that the jury would have reached the same verdict had it been properly instructed.galdamez potter,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
b.the application of agency law to the exclusion of patent law in the disputed instructions was prejudicial error.
at trial,evidence and testimony pertaining to yu efforts in developing the gad created questions about whether and to what extent his work at biomed facilities could be used to show a breach of the p c agreement by white.part of white defense was that absent evidence of agency between white and yu,biomed had no right to claim any rights in the patented devices that they later conceived or reduced to practice at biomed.biomed proposed that no agency instruction be given and that the conceive instruction should contain a paragraph summarizing the patent law principle of,that an invention can be conceived jointly where each inventor makes a significant contribution to its conception.biomed proposed further that the reduce to practice instruction include a paragraph summarizing the similar patent law principle that a cts related to reduction to practice that are performed by a should be considered as if they had been performed by the inventor himself.biomed stated also in its proposed instructions that,in the alternative,if any agency instruction was given,a model agency instruction should be given.white proposed a long instruction that applied agency law.
the district court eventually decided to give the model agency it work of yu and not to include the proposed language in the conceive and reduce to practice instructions.the district court opined at the charge conference that the model agency instruction was the best method for dealing with yu contributions to the invention of the gad because it seems to capture the points that both sides want to argue without unduly restricting the jury and giving them some structure.
biomed preserved its objections to the disputed instructions.
as an initial matter,white argues that biomed waived any objection to the disputed instructions either by failing to object at the charge conference or by later acquiescing to the district court final instructions.
for an objection to a jury instruction to be valid,the objection must be made on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.fed.civ.c.in its proposed jury instructions biomed stated clearly its position that no agency instruction should be given as an agency instruction is irrelevant and confusing.biomed submits that the effect of yu and white collaboration is more appropriately addressed in biomed proposed conception and reduction to practice instruction s.at the charge conference,biomed counsel distinctly stated her objection to the application of agency law,instead of patent law,in both the work of yu and reduce to practice instructions.thus,biomed preserved for appeal its objection to these two instructions.
white argues also that biomed waived its objection by acquiescing to the conceive instruction when its counsel responded at the charge conference,i think that fine,after the district court read the version that was ultimately presented to the jury.although t his court has enjoyed a reputation as the strictest enforcer of rule,we recognize a limited exception w here the district court is aware of a party concerns and further objection would be unavailing.glover bic,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the exception is available when throughout the trial the party argued the disputed matter with the court,it is clear from the record that the court knew the party grounds for disagreement with the instruction,and the party offered an alternative instruction.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
at trial,after biomed submitted its proposed instructions but prior to biomed alleged acquiescence,the district court had rejected the language from the conceive instruction.specifically,the court stated,i was concerned when i was reading some of the proposed instructions on this issue that we were kind of slopping over into inventorship,which is a totally different body of law that this jury is not going to be considering.thus it is clear that the district court was aware of biomed disagreement with the conceive instruction and that further objection at the charge conference would have been unavailing therefore,we conclude that biomed objection to the conceive instruction was preserved.see id.
the disputed instructions were given in error because the p c agreement required the application of patent law.
biomed argues that the district court erred by not including the language in the jury instructions because the dispute is over the ownership of a patent and is rooted in a contract that dictates that patent and inventorship law should control its interpretation.biomed correctly points out that under the settled law of inventorship,each who makes a significant contribution to an invention owns an undivided interest in the corresponding patent.see,ethicon,surgical,fina oil,at.biomed thus argues that the agency instruction was given in error because the issue was not whether yu acted as white agent,but whether white made a substantial contribution to the conception of an invention while using its facilities.
white,on the other hand,argues that giving an instruction applying agency law was perfectly appropriate in this breach of contract case where the contract at issue pertains only to inventions white conceived reduced to practice while utilizing biomed facilities.
we first acknowledge that issues of patent ownership are distinct from questions of inventorship.israel g project amgen,hereinafter ibep.additionally,we recognize that the california court of appeal has held that the trial court correctly applied contract principles in resolving a dispute over a patent agreement nearly identical to the p c agreement.shaw regents of of,th,d.
in shaw,a professor sued the university of california when it instituted a new patent policy that reduced the percentage of net royalties payable to him under the patent agreement he signed when he began his employment.id.at.one of the central issues was whether the district court erred in applying contract law rather than the standard of review for a mandamus action.id.at.california court of appeal found that contract law applied and looked to the language of the contract to determine the meaning and effect of the patent agreement.id.at.
thus,we turn to the language of the p c agreement to determine whether the parties intended for the rules of inventorship or the rules of agency to apply.
first,we note that this contract employed a number of terms t
