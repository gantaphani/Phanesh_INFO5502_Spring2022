indian health program,appeals the district court order enforcing national labor relations board nlrb subpoenas.challenged the nlrb jurisdiction,but the district court held that jurisdiction was not plainly lacking.we agree,and affirm.
teamsters local teamsters,which sought,but was denied,leave to intervene in the district court solely to support the nlrb position that its subpoenas should be enforced,also appeals.given that we uphold enforcement of the subpoenas,its appeal is moot.
is a tribal organization under the indian act isda.l.it is authorized under a sanctioning resolution made by the rumsey indian rancheria,a federally recognized tribe,to contract with indian health services ihs on behalf of the rumsey tribe to provide free health services to qualifying native americans in a area in northern california.is controlled by a board of directors,none of whom is a member of the rumsey tribe.there are rumsey tribe members on its health advisory committee.operates four facilities,all located off tribal land.approximately of the patients it serves are american,and of staff members are american.in addition to the federal money it receives from ihs pursuant to the isda,receives payment for its services through medical and from private insurers.
on october,the teamsters petitioned the nlrb for certification to represent auburn and grass valley medical support staff.asserted that the nlrb lacked jurisdiction because has sovereign immunity and because is an extension of the united states government as an isda contractor.meanwhile,the teamsters filed unfair labor practice charges against with the board.on august,the nlrb issued a consolidated administrative unfair labor practice complaint based on the union charges,which answered by raising a number of defenses,including the board lack of jurisdiction.asked the board to sever and decide the jurisdictional issue prior to considering the merits of the complaint.the alj denied motion.
the nlrb issued a subpoena duces tecum to,a subpoena ad testificandum to carol ervin,chief executive director,and a subpoena ad testificandum to susan thorne,a member of management staff.at the teamsters request,the board also issued a subpoena duces tecum to.filed a petition with the alj to revoke the subpoenas on the ground that the nlrb lacked jurisdiction.the alj concluded that the board assertion of jurisdiction was proper pursuant to health,wl,and sac fox industries,wl.
when,ervin,and thorne refused to comply with the subpoenas,the nlrb sought enforcement in the district court pursuant to.the teamsters sought,but were denied,leave to intervene.the court held that the board jurisdiction was not plainly lacking,and ordered the subpoenas enforced.
and the teamsters timely appealed.
both parties agree that the standard that applies at the enforcement stage is whether the nlrb plainly lacks jurisdiction.eeoc karuk tribe housing,cir.as we noted in karuk tribe,
j udicial intervention prior to an agency initial determination of its jurisdiction is appropriate only where there is clear evidence that exhaustion of administrative remedies will result in irreparable injury the agency jurisdiction is plainly lacking and the agency special expertise will be of no help on the question of its jurisdiction.
id.at quoting marshall burlington,cir there can be no serious dispute that the irreparable injury and lack of expertise prongs are met,karuk tribe,at,therefore we turn to the jurisdictional issue.
contends that the national labor relations act,nlra,is not a statute of general applicability and does not apply to indian tribes because the nlra has exemptions.but exemptions alone are not dispositive.the issue is whether the statute is generally applicable,not whether it is universally applicable.we have previously held that other federal statutes that contain exemptions are nevertheless generally applicable.see,donovan coeur tribal farm,cir the occupational safety and health act osha lumber indus.pension fund warm springs forest prods,cir the employee retirement income security act erisa united states baker,cir the contraband cigarette trafficking act ccta.regardless,argues that we should follow the tenth circuit decision in nlrb pueblo of san juan,cir,which held that the nlra did not preempt tribal governments from enacting a ordinance.however,pueblo of san juan is not persuasive because the court there expressly noted that the general applicability of federal labor law is not at issue.id.at.in any event,the nlra is not materially different from the statutes that we have already found to be generally applicable.its exemptions are relatively limited points only to the fact that the nlra exempts public sector employers and has been construed not to apply to and operated schools and it is clear that the statute reach was intended to be broad.nlrb reliance fuel oil,d congress intended to and did vest in the board the fullest jurisdictional breadth constitutionally permissible under the commerce clause.we conclude that just as osha,erisa and ccta are statutes of general applicability,so too is the nlra.
even if the nlra is a statute of general application,argues that it still would not apply to indian tribes or to their tribal organizations because the statute does not expressly state that it does.however,the supreme court held in federal power commission tuscarora indian nation,d,that general acts of congress apply to indians in the absence of a clear expression to the contrary.dismisses this as dicta,but we have explicitly adhered to the tuscarora rule in coeur,at,and karuk tribe,at,although we recognize exceptions to it.also relies on special canons of construction,which require that statutes be construed for the benefit of indian interests,in support of its position that even a statute that is generally applicable does not apply to indian tribes when the statute is silent on the subject.this reliance is misplaced for the same reason.to accept position would be effectively to overrule coeur,which,of course,this panel can not do.see hart massanari,cir issue resolved by panel is binding unless overruled by en banc court or supreme court.
under coeur,a statute that is silent with respect to its applicability to indian tribes applies to indian tribes unless 
the law touches exclusive rights of in purely intramural matters the application of the law to the tribe would abrogate rights guaranteed by indian treaties or there is proof by legislative history or some other means that congress intended the law not to apply to indians on their reservations in any of these three situations,congress must expressly apply a statute to indians before we will hold that it reaches them.
coeur,at quoting united states farris,cir.as the nlra is silent,coeur controls.even so,argues that the statute does not apply to it under both the first and third coeur exceptions.
maintains that meeting the health care needs of tribal members is purely intramural,as the issue is of great concern and requires the exercise of the informed discretion of the tribe governing body.it argues that the governing body of the rumsey rancheria chose to designate as the tribal organization entitled to receive ihs funds in lieu of those services being provided directly by ihs.in view,how health care services are provided is at least as intramural as the employment practices that we held were purely intramural in karuk tribe.further,submits,it should not matter that as well as indians are served rather,the important thing is how the organization is controlled and what its purposes are.as to these issues,maintains that it is governed by a board which the isda requires to be composed wholly of tribal indians,and that it is funded solely by virtue of the sponsoring resolution of the rumsey indian rancheria for the purpose of providing health care to its members.finally,it suggests that to hold otherwise,just because voluntarily use the health project services,would jeopardize the rumsey rancheria ability to assure access to free healthcare for tribal members.
we have considered coeur first exception in several cases,finding it sufficient in one instance but not in others.in coeur i
