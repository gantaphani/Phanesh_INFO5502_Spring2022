on april,megan annes,a child protection caseworker with the utah division of child and family services,removed rebekah gomes from rebekah home and placed her in protective custody.annes decision was based on a linear skull fracture that rebekah treating physician had reported to child and family services four days earlier.in september,the division of child and family services found that protective custody was no longer warranted and returned rebekah to her family.
rebekah and her parents,shauna and domingo gomes,then filed this action against annes,kerri ketterer and tess blackmer annes supervisors,and assistant attorney general deborah wood.the gomeses alleged that the removal of rebekah from their home without prior notice and a hearing violated their due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.
the district court granted summary judgment to all the defendants.relying on carey piphus,d,the court reasoned that the state affording the gomeses a hearing on may,foreclosed their claims for damages for failing to provide a hearing.the court also indicated that it likely would have reached the same result on alternative emergency circumstances justified removal without a hearing and that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.aplts app.at dist.order,filed july.
we disagree with the district court application of carey to these facts,but we affirm its decision for a different reason we hold that because annes did not violate clearly established law of which a reasonable official would have known,she and the other defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.
background 
a.the removal of rebekah 
on april,shauna gomes took rebekah to her pediatrician,brent knorr.she told knorr that rebekah had injured her head on the previous day when she fell off the bed.she reported that rebekah had slept a lot since the fall and was cranky and clingy.aplts app.at.
knorr examined rebekah and found a large amount of swelling.an revealed a parietal fracture on rebekah skull.however,there was no depressed significant finding because such fractures are more likely to injure the brain.the fracture was linear,not,which suggested to knorr that it had been caused by a blunt trauma.
knorr found gomes explanation of the injury possible but suspicious.id.at.he stated that the shape of rebekah fracture was consistent with a fall on a flat object.id.at.however,in deposition testimony,he explained that he had seen many children who had fallen from beds,or objects of similar heights,but had not suffered the kind of fracture that he had seen on rebekah.knorr was also concerned that gomes had waited until the day after rebekah injury to seek medical attention.to knorr,the delay in seeking care was one of the warning signs that maybe t on par with what i was told.id.at.
knorr prescribed motrin.he told gomes that he was required to report the fracture and gomes explanation of it to the division of child and family services.nevertheless,he sent rebekah home and told gomes that he was comfortable doing so.
knorr then reported the incident to child and family services by telephone.the intake caseworker responded that,because the matter did not appear to be an emergency,an investigator would call him back on the following day.
on april,gomes returned to the doctor office with rebekah.she was concerned that rebekah had been vomiting.knorr was out of the office,but his partner examined rebekah and concluded that the vomiting was caused by the stomach flu and not by the head injury.
on april,gomes again returned to knorr office for a visit.she asked him if he had contacted child and family services,noting that no one had contacted her.evidently,no one had contacted knorr either,as he responded that he would follow up with the agency.he concluded that rebekah was doing well,and he again felt comfortable leaving the child in her mother care.id.at.
on the same day,knorr spoke by telephone with the defendant megan annes,a caseworker in the division of child and family services.he told her that the mother explanation was possible but suspicious but that he felt comfortable leaving rebekah in her mother care.id.at.
after speaking with knorr,annes met with her supervisors,tess blackmer and kerri ketterer who are also named as defendants in this case.they advised annes that it might be necessary to take rebekah into protective custody first conducting a hearing.blackmer indicated that there were substantial reasons to believe that there was a substantial danger to rebekah physical health and safety.id.at.blackmer based that conclusion on the severity of rebekah skull fracture,knorr suspicions regarding gomes explanation of the fracture,the gomeses apparent delay in seeking medical treatment for the fracture,rebekah young age,and the possibility that further medical treatment for the skull fracture might be delayed.id.ketterer added that she did not find gomes explanation of rebekah injury to be credible.see id.at stating that b ased on my training and experience i did not believe it was possible for a child to receive a skull fracture from a fall off a bed because of the softness of a baby skull bones.both supervisors advised annes to investigate further and to seek legal advice.
annes then telephoned the defendant deborah wood,an assistant attorney general for the state of utah in the child services division and the fourth defendant in this case.wood also concluded that rebekah physical health and safety were in substantial danger.id.at.wood and annes agreed that annes should conduct a home visit.wood advised annes that if annes concluded there was substantial cause to believe that placing rebekah gomes into protective custody was necessary to protect her from a substantial danger to her physical health and safety,the decision would comply with the applicable state statutes.id.at.wood added that she would support the removal by filing a petition in the juvenile court seeking an placement.id.
on the following day,april,annes contacted a police detective and proceeded with him to the gomeses home.they arrived at but discovered that no one was there.
on april,annes and another police officer returned to the gomeses home and interviewed them there.annes asked how rebekah had been injured.after gomes offered the same explanation that she had given to knorr,annes inspected the bed and the floor where gomes maintained that rebekah had fallen.her inspection confirmed her view that gomes explanation was not plausible.annes was also concerned because gomes told her that she had not noticed the fracture until the day after the fall.accordingly,annes decided to take rebekah into protective custody and removed her from the gomeses home.
on may,assistant attorney general wood filed a petition for custody in the utah county fourth district juvenile court.the petition recited the facts surrounding rebekah skull fracture,alleged that there was a substantial danger to rebekah health and safety,and requested the court to award custody to the division of child and family services for care and placement.the court conducted a hearing on the same day.the gomeses were represented by counsel,and they agreed that rebekah could be placed in the temporary custody of the division of child and family services.rebekah remained in state custody until september,when the division of child and family services determined that the circumstances warranted returning her to her family.
b.the gomeses section action 
in september,the gomeses filed this action against annes,ketterer,blackmer,and wood.they asserted that taking rebekah into state custody without prior notice and a hearing violated their due process rights under the fourteenth amendment,and they sought actual damages for this alleged constitutional violation.
the gomeses and the defendant state officials each moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment to all the defendants.the court reasoned that the state court finding after a hearing that rebekah should remain in state custody foreclosed the gomeses claim for damages arising out of failure to provide a rehearing.according to the district court,t he supreme court had made clear that where an adverse action would have nevertheless been taken had the plaintiff received adequate due process,the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover damages to compensate her for the adverse action.aplts app.at discussing carey piphus,d.in such circumstances,the failure to accord procedural due process could not properly be viewed as the cause of the adverse action and to award damages for injuries caused by such action would constitute a windfall,rather than compensation.id.at quoting carey,at.
the district court also concluded that it would likely reach the same result on two alternative grounds.first,the court stated,there were emergency circumstances posing an immediate threat to rebekah safety.as a result,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment did not require a hearing.id.at citing roska peterson,cir second,the court suggested that the defendants might be entitled to qualified immunity because they had relied on a a state statute,utah code ann,that authorized removal without a hearing if there was a substantial danger to the physical health or safety of the child and b the advice of assistant attorney general wood.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the gomeses first argue that the district court erred in ruling that their claims were foreclosed by the findings at the may,hearing that the removal of rebekah was justified.they then contend that they were entitled to notice and a hearing before rebekah was removed from their home on april,and that they should be allowed to recover damages for this violation of their due process rights.
in response,annes,ketterer,blackmer,and wood defend the district court reliance on the state court findings.they also argue that the district court grant of summary judgment may be affirmed on the alternative ground that they are entitled to qualified immunity.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as employed by the district court.steel of,cir.we review the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.id.when,as here,there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute,we review the case to determine if the district court correctly applied the substantive law.gamble,simmons,cir.
we begin by reviewing the requirements of the due process clause when the state seeks to remove children from the home.then,we proceed to the parties arguments regarding the significance of the hearing and the defense of qualified immunity.
removing children from the home in emergency circumstances 
under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,parents have a protected liberty interest in the care,custody and control of their children.troxel granville,d.that interest is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by the supreme court.id.citing pierce soc.of sisters.meyer nebraska.see also wisconsin yoder,d,the history and culture of western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children.this primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring american tradition.as a result,state officials may not remove children from the home,through either temporary seizures or the permanent termination of parental rights,without providing due process of law.santosky kramer,d roska ii,at.
nevertheless,the parents liberty interest is not absolute.states have a parens patriae interest in preserving and promoting children welfare,santosky,at,including a traditional and transcendent interest in protecting children from abuse,washington county,cir quoting maryland craig,d.
as a result,when a state agency seeks to remove children from the home,due process requires that the parents receive prior notice and a hearing,except in extraordinary situations where some valid governmental interest is at stake that justifies postponing the hearing until after the event.spielman hildebrand,cir quoting smith org.of foster families for equal.reform,d.these extraordinary situations include e mergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of a child.hollingsworth hill,cir.however,the mere possibility of danger is not enough to justify a removal without appropriate process.roska ii,at quoting tenenbaum williams,cir.
importantly,even when such a removal is justified,the state must act promptly to provide a hearing.see county of crow wing,cir once a child is removed from parental custody without a court order,the state bears the burden to initiate prompt judicial proceedings to provide a post deprivation hearing.brokaw mercer county,cir d ue process guarantees that the judicial review of a child removal be prompt and fair.campbell burt,cir stating that f ederal procedural due process guarantees prompt judicial review in child custody cases weller dep t of soc.servs.for baltimore,cir e ven if it is constitutionally permissible to temporarily deprive a parent of the custody of a child in an emergency,the state has the burden to initiate prompt judicial proceedings to ratify its emergency action.
our cases have not offered a precise definition of emergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of a child.hollingsworth,at.however,in several instances we have concluded that the requisite emergency circumstances did not exist.most recently,in roska ii,at,we held that the parents of a boy who had been removed from their home without prior notice or a hearing had sufficiently alleged a violation of their due process rights.despite evidence indicating that a mother might be suffering from munchausen syndrome by proxy a disorder where an individual,usually a mother,inflicts physical harm upon a child to gain the sympathy and attention of medical personnel,id.at,t here was nothing particularly unusual about the boy condition at the time he was removed,id.at.moreover,the boy physician had stated that it would be a mistake to remove him from the home.we also observed that state officials had not even attempted to obtain an ex parte order authorizing the removal.accordingly,no evidence indicate d that the boy was in immediate threat of death or severe physical harm.see also malik arapahoe county dep t of social,cir finding no extraordinary circumstance dangerous to the child based on the uncle of a girl having taken nude photographs of her during a visit five months before the removal hollingsworth,at concluding that the record contains no evidence that the plaintiff actually endangered the welfare of her children prior to their removal 
other courts have provided a somewhat more precise formulation of the standard required under the due process clause to remove a child from the home without prior notice and a hearing.the first circuit has concluded that a majority of circuits addressing this issue have held that a case worker may place a child in temporary custody when he has evidence giving rise to a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the child has been abused or is in imminent peril of abuse.hatch dep t for children,youth,their families,cir citing brokaw mercer county,cir croft westmoreland county children youth,cir gottlieb county of orange,cir and manzano,dep t of soc,cir see also hatch,at adopting the reasonable suspicion standard thomason scan volunteer,cir explaining the justification for the reasonable suspicion standard by stating that w here a treating physician has clearly expressed his or her reasonable suspicion that abuse is occurring in the home,the interest of the child as shared by the state as parens patriae in being removed from that home setting to a safe and neutral environment outweighs the parents private interest in familial integrity as a matter of law.
the ninth and eleventh circuits have formulated the standard somewhat differently,requiring reasonable or probable cause of imminent danger.see wallis spencer,cir stating that o fficials may remove a child from the custody of its parent without prior judicial authorization only if the information they possess at the time of the seizure is such as provides reasonable cause to believe that the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and that the scope of the intrusion is reasonably necessary to avert that specific injury emphasis added doe kearney,cir indicating that a state may not remove a child from parental custody without judicial authorization unless there is probable cause to believe the child is threatened with imminent harm emphasis added.
notably,the eleventh circuit has indicated that this circuit has adopted the probable cause standard.see kearney,at citing roska i,at.we do not read our roska opinions in that way.in those opinions,we stated that the mere possibility of danger does not justify a warrantless removal.roska ii,at roska i,at internal quotation marks omitted.however,we added that emergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of a child may do so.roska ii,at quoting hollingsworth,at roska i,at quoting hollingsworth,at.we did not specify whether the state must have a reasonable suspicion of such circumstances or must establish probable cause that they exist.
in determining whether emergency circumstances exist,there is also some disagreement as to the significance of another state officials lacked sufficient time to obtain judicial authorization for the removal without jeopardizing the safety of the child.the second circuit has reasoned that 
while there is a sufficient emergency to warrant officials taking a child into custody without a prior hearing if he or she is immediately threatened with harm,the converse is also true.if the danger to the child is not so imminent that there is reasonably sufficient time to seek prior judicial authorization,ex parte or otherwise,for the child removal,then the circumstances are not emergent there is no reason to excuse the absence of the judiciary participation in depriving the parents of the care,custody and management of their child.if,irrespective of whether there is time to obtain a court order,all interventions are effected on an emergency basis without judicial process,procedural due process for the parents and their child evaporates.
tenenbaum,at emphasis supplied internal citations and quotations omitted.
the eleventh circuit has criticized the second circuit sole focus on whether there is time to obtain a court order.kearney,at.in the eleventh circuit view,due process is a flexible where the of children is deciding what process is due in any given case requires a careful balancing of the interests at stake,including the interests of parents,children,and the state.id.this kind of subtle balancing,the court reasoned,can not be properly accomplished when courts blunt the inquiry by simply asking whether there was time to get a warrant.id.at.
in our view,the reasonable suspicion standard appropriately balances the interests of the parents,the child,and the state.the failure to act when a child is in danger may have unthinkable consequence s.jordan jackson,cir.as a result,social workers should be afforded some discretion when they seek to protect a child whose safety may be at risk.see hatch,at thomason,at.following the majority approach,we conclude that state officials may remove a child from the home without prior notice and a hearing when they have a reasonable suspicion of an immediate threat to the safety of the child if he or she is allowed to remain there.we emphasize again that even in these instances in which emergency removal is justified,the state must afford the parents a prompt hearing.see county of crow wing,at brokaw,at campbell,at weller,at.
as to whether state officials have time to seek judicial authorization for the removal,we agree with the eleventh circuit that this consideration should not be the single focus of the inquiry.kearney,at.in many instances,it may not be entirely clear either how long it would take to obtain judicial approval or whether this period of delay would jeopardize the safety of the child.nevertheless,we also agree with the second circuit observation that,if we do not give any consideration to whether state officials might obtain judicial authorization of the removal without additional risk to the child,then the definition of an emergency may be broadened to such an extent that due process rights are eroded.tenenbaum,at.
accordingly,we conclude that in determining whether state officials have a reasonable suspicion of an immediate threat to the safety of the child,we must consider all relevant circumstances,including the state reasonableness in responding to a perceived danger,as well as the objective nature,likelihood,and immediacy of danger to the child.kearney,at emphasis added.ordinarily,the question of whether state officials had time to seek and obtain judicial authorization for the removal without jeopardizing the safety of the child will be an important consideration,and the failure to establish that judicial authorization was impracticable will undermine the contention that emergency circumstances existed.however,neither this factor,nor any other single factor,is necessarily dispositive.
we now turn to the particular arguments raised by the parties in this appeal.
b.the effect of the hearing on the gomeses claim for damages 
as we have noted,the district court concluded that it was not required to fully decide the issue of whether emergency circumstances existed to justify rebekah removal.aplts app.at.the court did state that it believed that the defendants have adequately established that rebekah faced an immediate threat,especially in light of the state court conclusion that she did.id.at however,the court concluded that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on an alternative ground.
in particular,the court observed that the state had provided an adequate hearing and that the gomeses did not challenge the state judge decision that rebekah remain in state custody.as a result,it concluded,the gomeses could not prevail on their due process challenge to the removal.we agree with the gomeses that the district court erred in relying on carey piphus,d,for this conclusion.
in carey,the supreme court held that when a procedural due process violation occurs and adverse action results,damages for injuries caused by the adverse action may not be recovered if the defendant can prove the action would have been taken even absent the violation.see id.at.stating that in such a case,the failure to accord procedural due process could not properly be viewed as the cause of the adverse action.significantly,however,the court also concluded that a plaintiff may recover nominal damages and actual damages arising not from the deprivation of liberty or property but from the denial of procedural due process itself.as to the latter category of damages,the court emphasized that the plaintiff is still required to prove causation 
in sum,then,although mental and emotional distress caused by the denial of procedural due process itself is compensable under,we hold that neither the likelihood of such injury nor the difficulty of proving it is so great as to justify awarding compensatory damages without proof that such injury actually was caused.
id.at.see also mcclure.sch.dist,cir stating that i n a proper case,however,a plaintiff may recover such damages by producing evidence that mental and emotional distress actually was caused by the denial of procedural due process itself quoting carey,at.
here,the gomeses have not contested the state judge finding that the removal of rebekah was justified moreover,they have not sought nominal damages.accordingly,they may only recover damages arising from the denial of due process itself.on this issue,the district court stated that the only damage the gomeses claim to have suffered is the emotional damage that resulted from rebekah removal.aplts app.at.
in our view,the district court read the gomeses allegations too narrowly.we acknowledge that the line drawn by the supreme court in a damages arising from the deprivation of liberty or property and b damages arising from the denial of procedural due process be a fine one.moreover,in many instances,plaintiffs may offer the same evidence to support both classes of damages claims.
nevertheless,the gomeses have alleged that they have suffered damages from the denial of procedural due process itself and thus recoverable under carey.in particular,rebekah gomes mother,shauna gomes,answered a deposition question about the damages that she had suffered as follows 
q could you describe those damages for me,please.i understand you talked about pain and anguish earlier,so is there anything in addition that you suffered 
a yes.it i compare it to being attacked by a terrorist.i mean they come in and take something that is of most value to you,and i was able to get that thing back.
however,it always there i wonder when they going to strike again.i wonder what could happen.i have no control over it,they could come at any time.it does depend upon my actions.
i had dreams from the trauma i went through,when my child gets hurt with an accident or something,it just makes me sick to my stomach to have to take him in to the doctor.who knows what might happen 
aplts app.at.
viewing the record in the light most favorable to the gomeses,this testimony concerns,in part,the manner in which rebekah was removed,without prior notice and a hearing,and not merely the fact that she was removed.gomes statement that they could come at any time and her analogy to being attacked by a terrorist concern damages for the violation of procedural due process itself her testimony addresses both the lack of notice and the randomness with which the gomeses experienced the removal.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred in ruling that the hearing and the findings by the judge precluded the gomeses from seeking damages for their due process claim 
qualified immunity 
in light of its conclusion that carey forecloses the gomeses claims for damages,the district court did not definitively resolve the merits of their due process claim.see id.at stating that the court need not fully decide this issue.however,in the district court proceedings and in this appeal,the defendant state officials have argued that they are entitled to summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.they focus on the removal decision made by annes,but they argue that because annes is entitled to qualified immunity,the other defendants who advised her regarding the removal decision are also entitled to the same immunity.upon de novo review of this legal question,see maldonado city of altus,cir,we agree.see id.at stating that we have discretion to affirm on any ground adequately supported by the record so long as the parties have had a fair opportunity to address that ground internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
general principles 
qualified immunity generally shields from liability for civil damages government officials performing discretionary functions insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the supreme court has identified three purposes underlying this grant of immunity.first,qualified immunity protect s the public from unwarranted timidity on the part of public officials.richardson mcknight,d.second,the doctrine helps to ensure that talented candidates are not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.id.internal quotation marks omitted.third,qualified immunity reduces the chance that lawsuits will distract from the performance of public duties.the doctrine seeks to balance the protection of constitutional rights and the substantial social costs of imposing liability on public officials.anderson creighton,d.
in analyzing the qualified immunity defense,this court has adopted a inquiry.first,we ask whether the plaintiffs allegations,if true,establish a constitutional violation.lawrence reed,cir.if the allegations do not meet that standard,we must dismiss the claim.
second,if the plaintiffs have alleged a constitutional violation,we examine whether the law was clearly established at the time the alleged violations occurred.roska ii,at.the law is clearly established if a reasonable official in the defendant circumstances would understand that her conduct violated the plaintiff constitutional right.moore guthrie,cir.recently,the supreme court has shifted the qualified immunity analysis from a scavenger hunt for prior cases with precisely the same facts toward the more relevant inquiry of whether the law put officials on fair notice that the described conduct was unconstitutional.pierce gilchrist,cir discussing hope pelzer,d.thus,government officials must make reasonable applications of the prevailing law to their own circumstances,currier doran,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and they can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.hope,at.however,the defendant official may demonstrate that she neither knew nor should have known of the relevant legal standard because the law was not clearly established at the time she acted.harlow,at.if the law is not clearly established,we do not require officials to anticipate its future developments.lawrence,at.
finally,if the law was clearly established,we proceed to the third part of the inquiry.we ask whether,in spite of the fact that the law was clearly established,extraordinary circumstances such as reliance on the advice of counsel or on a statute so prevented the official from knowing that her actions were unconstitutional that she should not be imputed with knowledge of a clearly established right.roska ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.w here the right is clearly established,a defendant should only rarely be able to succeed with a qualified immunity defense.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
application 
existence of a constitutional violation 
we begin with the threshold inquiry of whether the gomeses allegations,if true,state a constitutional violation.under the due process principles we have outlined,we must determine whether ms annes had a reasonable suspicion of emergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of a child,hollingsworth,at,when she removed rebekah from the home.because the defendant state officials raised the qualified immunity defense in their motion for summary judgment,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the gomeses.saucier katz,d noting that,under the first part of the qualified immunity inquiry,the question is whether a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions simkins bruce,cir stating that t he threshold inquiry is whether the alleged facts or,on summary judgment,the evidenced facts taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff show a constitutional violation.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to them,genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the defendants had reasonable suspicion to remove rebekah before holding a hearing.first,although it was rebekah pediatrician,knorr,who reported her injury to the division of child and family services,his testimony may be plausibly read to conclude that there was not an immediate threat to rebekah safety.in particular,knorr stated that the shape of rebekah fracture was consistent with a fall on a flat object,aplts app.at,and thus supported the gomeses statements that she had fallen onto the floor from a bed.moreover,in his initial telephone call to the division of child and family services on april,and again in his second call to the agency on april,knorr reported that he was comfortable allowing gomes to take rebekah home.id.at.knorr added that i never was highly suspicious that rebekah had been the victim of child abuse,and i never told anyone at dcfs,or anyone else,that i was highly suspicious that the child had been abused.id.at.that testimony is supported by the statement of the intake worker who answered knorr initial call and who told him that the circumstances did not sound like an emergency.
the gomeses own conduct also offers some support for their allegations.gomes took rebekah to the doctor on three successive days,and she now contends that these visits demonstrate that she was quite concerned about rebekah welfare.that behavior is at least arguably
