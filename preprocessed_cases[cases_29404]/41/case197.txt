background 
orta began her employment with merck in caguas,puerto rico in december.a year later,on december,orta became the standard operating procedures sop coordinator at the company and worked in the quality operations department.as sop coordinator,orta worked with the company pharmaceutical manufacturing operation.among her responsibilities,she oversaw the standard operating procedures for the company,served as the custodian of the company regulations,maintained documents related to the manufacturing process,and worked with merck forms system.orta was the only employee assigned to the sop unit.
in,orta worked under the supervision of antonio nieves nieves,head of the quality operations department.quality operations,in turn,was supervised by operations manager carlos montoyo montoyo.toward the end of,montoyo suspected that an unannounced audit by the food and drug administration fda was imminent and was concerned with some deficiencies that he had noticed in the sop unit.to address the deficiencies and prepare the sop unit for the fda audit,montoyo placed orta under the supervision of validation engineer rosa lugo lugo on october.montoyo decision was based on his belief that lugo was good with systems and that she had the necessary skills to analyze the unit problems and get it in proper working order.montoyo gave lugo express instructions to address the deficiencies in the sop unit to prepare it for the eventuality of an fda audit.
orta and lugo had a prior history at merck.they had first met back in when orta began work at the company.in april,before lugo became orta supervisor,they had an incident related to an fda visit to the plant.in preparation for the visit,orta had to update a procedure document in a binder located in lugo office.although orta inserted the new document in the binder,she failed to remove the old one because it was marked with a post it,and orta believed that lugo was reading it.lugo told orta that the document was her orta responsibility,and that she lugo could not assume responsibility for something that was not part of her job description.orta felt uncomfortable with lugo comment and the way she said it with a raised tone.this incident was discussed with nieves,who met with both orta and lugo.although orta said that she did not know why lugo was angry with her,she later stated that lugo anger may have been caused by stress associated with the upcoming fda visit.orta stated that she did not know of any other reason that lugo would be mad at her.
a few days before lugo officially became orta supervisor,lugo asked orta to produce various documents and information pertaining to the sop unit.the information that lugo requested was under orta control.the work associated with this request prompted orta to talk with montoyo.orta complained about the work pressure she felt and about the fact that lugo was constantly changing her requests and not providing any additional time to comply.orta also told montoyo that lugo requests made her nervous and that she thought lugo behavior was related to the binder incident.
as a consequence of the stress she felt,orta went to visit the infirmary at merck to receive medical attention.furthermore,in november,orta sought medical treatment from a psychiatrist,celia,who diagnosed that orta was suffering a major depression and should be out of work for three months.as a result,orta was on leave from november,to february.upon taking this leave,orta was advised about benefits such as temporary disability insurance and disability.
when orta returned to work on february,she discovered that her office had been moved from the second floor to the first.nieves,her former supervisor,told her that she had been moved to the first floor to be closer to lugo,her supervisor,and because books and other work materials were on the first floor.orta found her new work area uncomfortable mainly because of the size of her desk.however,the desk was soon changed,and orta was more comfortable.
on march,lugo sent orta an addressing a series of tasks that she had failed to perform and requesting a meeting to discuss the problem.orta explained to lugo at the meeting how,when she returned from her leave,the paperwork had been in disarray,that the person who substituted for her did not do what was required of her,and that she orta had to make up for what had not been done.before the meeting ended,orta told lugo that she needed to go to the infirmary.lugo accompanied orta to the infirmary and waited for her until she came out.lugo and orta then met with montoyo.during this meeting,lugo restated what she had discussed with orta regarding her responsibilities.montoyo listened and then asked orta whether she had anything else to say.at this point,orta requested a private meeting with montoyo.during her meeting alone with montoyo,orta indicated how nervous she was.she said that many of lugo requirements were related to previous years when she was not present,that the person who had substituted for her had not complied with some requirements,and that she now had to make up for these oversights,in addition to continuing with her daily work.according to orta,montoyo promised her that he would help her by speaking with lugo,told her not to worry,and requested that she work as best she could.
on april,orta took a second medical leave for major depression upon the advice of her doctor,rodríguez.however,sometime between may and july,rodríguez moved to the continental united states.as a result,orta had to find a new doctor,and she began to be treated by edgardo.on july,prieto provided merck with a certificate stating that orta was suffering from a severe depressive condition that prevented her at that time from doing work and recommending that orta medical leave be extended until december.this recommendation was accepted,and orta leave was extended.
nevertheless,on november,orta received a call from merck human resources department informing her of a position available in technical services for which she was qualified.orta informed the human resources official who had called her that she was on medical leave until december,and could not go to the company for anything.orta admitted that she was not bothered by this call.
on december,prieto certified to orta that she could return to work at merck in january,if the following accommodations were provided she had to work only four hours a day for the first two weeks she had to be relocated and be placed outside the supervision of lugo and she had to continue visiting her psychiatrist every two weeks.orta sent prieto certification along with a letter to félix amador,a merck plant manager.
orta also discussed prieto recommendations with marilyn maldonado of the human resources department and signed a document dated january,that was related to her request for accommodation.the document acknowledged merck acceptance of the recommendations made by prieto and the actions to be taken by merck in order to comply with the recommendations.specifically,the january,memo acknowledged 
a that pursuant to prieto recommendations,orta would return to work on january,as an administrative assistant in the engineering department,at the same level and with the same salary rate.
b that instead of reporting to lugo,orta would report to jesús martínez,head of the engineering department in caguas and 
c that orta would enjoy a work schedule,from to noon,until she returned to her regular schedule after january.
to implement the substantive provisions of this accommodation,orta was assigned to work in a trailer outside the merck office facilities.she,however,found the trailer dirty,depressing,and isolating.such a working environment led her to apply for other positions within the company.for example,she applied for a secretarial position in the quality control department.she,however,was denied the position.orta alleges that she was told by an unidentified human resources does not recall the person she was not given the position because of her absenteeism.however,there may have been another reason for her rejection if orta was given the position,she would have had contact with lugo,who was part of the quality control department,and such a placement would have been contrary to prieto express recommendation.
on may,as a direct consequence of an incident inside the trailer with the person who replaced her in the position of sop coordinator,orta visited lillian serrano,a psychiatrist.she could not visit her usual psychiatrist,prieto,because merck medical plan had changed,and it no longer listed prieto as an approved medical provider.serrano placed orta on leave as of may,and orta provided merck with a certificate from serrano to this effect.despite being under the care of serrano at this time,orta,on may,visited prieto at the insistence of her husband.after examining her,prieto put orta on medical leave until december.this medical leave was later extended until april.certificates documenting this additional leave were also provided to the company 
as of may,orta had not returned to her employment with merck.on may,orta received a letter dated may,from abigail pérez,merck director of human resources.the letter stated that because orta had been absent for a illness since may,and because more than the days required by law for her employment to be reserved had elapsed,her employment with merck was terminated.
on june,orta and her husband filed an employment discrimination action against merck.they alleged,inter alia,violations to orta rights under the ada,the fmla,and puerto rico law.after the parties engaged in discovery,merck filed a motion for summary judgment,which orta and her husband opposed.
on april,the district court issued its opinion and order,in which it granted merck summary judgment motion.the court then dismissed the plaintiffs federal claims with prejudice and their commonwealth law claims without prejudice.orta and her husband now appeal these rulings.

this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see,cir eeoc unión independiente de la autoridad de acueductos y alcantarillados,cir.
sworn statement under penalty of perjury 
before reaching appellants federal and puerto rico claims,we must address a preliminary issue.in assessing merck summary judgment motion,the district court disregarded orta sworn statement under penalty of perjury statement,an affidavit submitted in support of the appellants opposition to summary judgment.the court disregarded the statement because it was in conflict with the answers orta had given in her deposition and because the appellants had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the subsequent change in her testimony.for two reasons,the appellants now argue that the district court erred in disregarding orta statement.first,they claim that the court failed specifically to enumerate the contradictions in her testimony.second,they contend that orta provided a wholly satisfactory explanation for the change in testimony.
this court review s the district court decision as to the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion for summary judgment only for a clear abuse of discretion.lennon rubin,cir quoting eeoc green,cir.
with regard to the appellants first ground for error,we can find no authority whatsoever for the proposition that a district court must specifically enumerate the contradictions that lead it to disregard a given piece of evidence.orta second asserted ground is similarly baseless.the appellants claim that they provided a satisfactory explanation for the change in orta,the fact that orta was having trouble with her memory,and after reviewing certain documents she was able to recall events that she did not recall during her deposition.we,however,do not find this explanation to be satisfactory.rather,we believe that the district court was warranted in finding the explanation to be an attempt to manufacture an issue of fact in order to survive summary judgment.see colantuoni alfred calcagni sons,cir when an interested witness has given clear answers to unambiguous questions,he can not create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory,but does not give a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony is changed.
several factors lead us to this conclusion.first,the statement was executed only after merck had filed its motion for summary judgment,thus suggesting that the statement was made solely to create an issue of fact for the purpose of surviving summary judgment in both colantuoni,at,and torres dupont de nemours,cir,we found such a chronology to be probative of the fact that the was merely attempting to create an issue of fact.second,orta deposition was taken on two different occasions.the first session was on january,and the second session on april.at both sessions,she was accompanied by her attorneys.at no point did they suggest that she was having trouble with her memory.see colantuoni,at noting that plaintiff attorney was present at the deposition,and had the opportunity to clarify any incorrect impressions.orta memory problems seem to have developed only after merck filed its summary judgment motion.the district court could well find incredible this sudden,retroactive bout of amnesia.we therefore accept the district court conclusion that orta proffered explanation was not satisfactory and find here that the district court did not abuse its discretion in disregarding orta statement.
ada claims 
we now turn our attention to the more substantive arguments made by the appellants.first,they argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under the ada because there were genuine disputes of material fact that precluded summary judgment.more specifically,the appellants state that three distinct ada claims were dismissed in error a discriminatory discharge claim a disability harassment claim and a failure to accommodate claim.we address these in turn.
we first look at the discriminatory discharge claim.for the appellants to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ada,they were required to prove 
a that orta was disabled within the meaning of the act 
b that orta was able to perform,with or without reasonable accommodation,the essential functions of her job and 
c that orta was discharged or adversely affected,in whole or in part,because of her disability.
see dichner liberty travel,cir.in this case,there is no controversy that the appellants produced sufficient evidence to satisfy the first two elements.the district court,however,held that the appellants could not establish the third,and final,that orta was discharged or adversely affected,in whole or in part,because of her disability.the court found that the uncontested material facts demonstrate d that merck decision to terminate orta from her employment was based on her failure to return from a leave of absence for a condition after the three hundred and sixty five days period provided by law ended,and not on her disability.the court specifically noted that the appellants did not provide any evidence to establish that orta termination was because of her disability.
on appeal,we find the same deficiency.in their brief,the appellants cite only to the information contained in orta statement to demonstrate that orta was discharged because of her disability.more specifically,they cite to orta comment in the statement that her medical leave commenced on may,and was to last until may.such a comment,if accepted,might create a genuine factual controversy as to the reason orta employment was terminated.on the one hand,there would be merck proffered explanation that orta was fired because she had failed to return from leave as expected on may.on the other hand,there would be orta,that her leave was supposed to last until may,and that merck,by ending her employment prior to that date,fired her because of her disability.
as discussed above,however,we agree with the district court decision to disregard orta statement.in the absence of any other evidence that merck terminated orta because of her disability,we are compelled to agree with the district court that merck decision to terminate orta from her employment was based on her failure to return to work by a particular date.the district court correctly found that the appellants had failed to satisfy the third element of their prima facie case.accordingly,summary judgment on the appellants discriminatory discharge claim was proper.
next,we turn to the appellants disability harassment claim.on appeal,they argue that orta was the victim of a hostile working environment as a result of her disability.this claim is easily disposed of,as we can find no evidence that it was raised before the district court.this court has long held that an issue not raised in the district court can not be raised for the first time on appeal.see waterproofing,cir tobin liberty mut.ins,cir roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir.
finally,we examine the appellants failure to accommodate claim under the ada.as the district court correctly noted,a failure to accommodate claim has a different set of requirements from the discriminatory discharge claim.a plaintiff in a failure to accommodate case must 
a furnish sufficient admissible evidence that she is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ada 
b establish that she worked for an employer covered by the ada 
c demonstrate that the employer,despite its knowledge of the employee limitations,did not accommodate those limitations and 
d show that the employer failure to accommodate the known limitations affected the terms,conditions,or privileges of the plaintiff employment.
higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir.although merck conceded that the appellants produced enough evidence to meet the first two elements,the district court found that the appellants failed to establish either of the last two elements.the court therefore held that summary judgment was proper on the appellants failure to accommodate claim.
on appeal,the appellants acknowledge the district court conclusion that merck had reasonably accommodated orta because the company had,for instance,provided her with a number of medical leaves.they contend,however,that there were many ways in which merck did not properly accommodate orta.for example,they assert that the company only complied in form and not in substance with prieto december recommendations.we,however,do not find this argument to be persuasive.prieto made three specific recommendations that orta work for four hours for the first two weeks upon returning from leave that she have no contact with lugo and that she be allowed to be absent one afternoon every two weeks to see prieto.from our reading of the record,we believe merck complied with these recommendations to the letter,whether viewed from the perspective of either form or substance.we fail to see how the factors cited by the example,that orta was placed in a dirty and depressing trailer,that orta was not given a job description for her new position,and that orta was not at all relevant to whether orta was in fact allowed to work only four hours each day upon returning from leave,whether merck removed orta from lugo supervision,or whether orta was allowed to be absent an afternoon every two weeks to be able to see her psychiatrist.
the appellants also argue that the district court erred because it failed to consider several reasonable accommodations requested by orta between february and march.first,they point to the fact that in february,orta requested the relocation of her office from the first to the second floor.even if this is true,we do not see how such an accommodation is related to orta claimed disability.see assocs.of,cir noting that under the ada,requests for accommodation must be linked to a disability.second,the appellants cite to a number of instances in which orta purportedly requested to be removed either from lugo supervision or the trailer that she found depressing.under the ada,requests for accommodation must be express,see,and we can find no evidence that orta explicitly made either of these requests.the district court came to the same conclusion,noting that orta only made two requests a written request to have merck implement prieto recommendations and a verbal request to have her desk changed because it was uncomfortable.see reed lepage bakeries,cir t he ada reasonable accommodation requirement usually does not apply unless triggered by a request quoting henry perrett,americans with disabilities act handbook,at ed.third,the appellants point to how orta request to be transferred to a secretarial position was denied.the district court,however,fully considered this request for accommodation and concluded that merck was fully within its rights to deny orta the position,since in that position orta would have had contact with lugo,in contravention of prieto very specific recommendation that she not have any contact with her former supervisor.
finally,the appellants argue that merck failed to properly accommodate orta because the company terminated her employment while she was on medical leave.there is,however,no evidence that orta was terminated while she was on leave.the only proof offered by the appellants demonstrating that orta was on leave on may,the date of her termination,was orta statement,which we and the district court have disregarded.there is ample evidence,however,to support the proposition that by may,orta leave had elapsed.for example,there are the sworn statements of merck employees giselle olmo and abigail pérez,which state unequivocally that orta leave was to end on may.even more important is the district court finding that orta herself had submitted a certificate from her doctor stating that she was on leave beginning may.this demonstrates to us that orta leave had indeed elapsed by may,and that merck,in releasing orta on that date,did not terminate her while she was on medical leave.therefore,the district court was correct in granting summary judgment on the appellants failure to accommodate claim.
fmla claim 
the appellants next argument is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their fmla claim.more specifically,they take issue with the district court resolution of their claim that orta was discriminated and retaliated against under the fmla because she was denied the position of secretary in the quality control department due to her absences under the fmla.the district court found that the appellants had not proffered any significantly probative evidence to sustain their allegation that orta was denied the position because of her absences.
we agree with the district court.as the court correctly stated,to establish their retaliation claim,the appellants were required to establish their prima facie case by showing that orta had availed herself of a protected right under the fmla orta was adversely affected by an employment decision and there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action.hodgens dynamics,cir.only the third prong of this test is at issue in this appeal.
in the parties briefs,there is some dispute about the precise date that orta applied for the position of secretary in the quality control department.merck claims that orta only applied for the position in january,after prieto had made his december recommendation that orta should be placed outside lugo supervision.the company argues that orta was not named to the secretarial position because,as noted above,in that position she would have had contact with lugo,who at the time was a supervisor in the quality control department.the appellants,however,contend that orta applied for the position not in january,but in march.they point out that,at that time,lugo was not a supervisor in the quality control department.therefore,there would have been no reason for not placing orta in the secretarial position.they allege tha
