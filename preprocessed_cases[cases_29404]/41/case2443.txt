parents,whose deceased children corneas were removed by the los angeles county coroner office without notice or consent,brought this action alleging a taking of their property without due process of law.the complaint was dismissed by the district court for a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we must decide whether the longstanding recognition in the law of california,paralleled by our national common law,that next of kin have the exclusive right to possess the bodies of their deceased family members creates a property interest,the deprivation of which must be accorded due process of law under the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.we hold that it does.the parents were not required to exhaust post deprivation procedures prior to bringing this suit.thus,we hold that they properly stated a claim under.

history of common law interests in dead bodies 
duties to protect the dignity of the human body after its death are deeply rooted in our nation history.in a valuable history of the subject,the supreme court of rhode island recounted 
by the civil law of ancient rome,the charge of burial was first upon the person to whom it was delegated by the deceased second,upon the scripti haeredes to whom the property was given,and if none,then upon the haeredes legitimi or cognati in order the heirs might be compelled to comply with the provisions of the will in regard to burial.and the pontifical college had the power of providing for the burial of those who had no place of burial in their own right.

in century england,and in much of europe,duties to bury the dead and protect the dignified disposition of the body,described as flowing from a right of burial,a person right to be buried,id.at accord in re johnsons estate,misc,explaining that in century england,a man had a right to the decent interment of his own body in expectation of the day of resurrection were borne primarily by churches,which had a duty to bury the bodies of those residing in their parishes.pierce,at.these duties,and the explanation of their genesis in the rights of the dead,carried over into new england colonial practice where i n many parts the parish system prevailed,and every family was considered to have a right of burial in the churchyard of the parish in which they lived.id.at.
the roman practice of including duties to protect the body of the dead in civil law had no parallel in the early english common law because burials were matters of ecclesiastical cognizance.id.thus,blackstone explained that though the heir has a property interest in the monuments and escutcheons of his ancestors,yet he has none in their bodies or ashes nor can he bring any suit or action against such as indecently,at least,if not injuriously,violate and disturb their remains,when dead and buried.bessemer land improvement jenkins,so,quoting bl.comm.see also in re johnson estate,at discussing lord coke assertion that buriall of the cadaver is nullius in bonis,and belongs to ecclesiastical cognisance.
a change in the common law in england can be traced to the case of rex stewart,ad.in that case,the socially recognized right of the dead to a dignified disposition,previously enforced only through ecclesiastical courts,was interpreted as creating enforceable common law duties.the question before the court was whether the hospital in which a pauper died or the parish in which she was to be buried was under a duty to carry the body to the grave.id.at.the court expressed extreme difficulty in placing any legal foundation for either rule,but stated it was unwilling to discharge the case considering how long the practice had prevailed,and been sanctioned,of burying such persons at the expense of the parish,and the general consequences of holding that such practice ha d no warrant in law.id.at.it stated the premises that,under tradition,e very person has a right to christian burial that implies the right to be carried from the place where his body lies to the parish cemetery and bodies carried in a state of naked exposure to the grave would be a real offence to the living,as well as an apparent indignity to the dead.id.at.from these traditional understandings,the court concluded that t he feelings and interests of the living require that the common law cast on some one the duty of carrying to the grave,decently covered,the dead body of any person dying in such a state of indigence as to leave no funds for that purpose.id.at.that duty,it held,was imposed on the individual under whose roof a poor person dies he can not keep him unburied,nor do any thing which prevents christian burial he can not therefore cast him out,so as to expose the body to violation,or to offend the feelings or endanger the health of the living and for the same reason,he can not carry him uncovered to the grave.id.at.
many early american courts adopted blackstone description of the common law,holding that a dead body is not the subject of property right.bessemer land,so.at.the duty to protect the body by providing a burial was often described as flowing from the universal right of sepulture,rather than from a concept of property law.wynkoop wynkoop,wl.as cases involving unauthorized mutilation and disposition of bodies increased toward the end of the century,paralleling the rise in demand for human cadavers in medical science and use of cremation as an alternative to burial,see in re johnson estate,at describing an outpouring of such cases,courts began to recognize an exclusive right of the next of kin to possess and control the disposition of the bodies of their dead relatives,the violation of which was actionable at law.thus,in holding that a city council could not seize upon existing private burial grounds,make them public,and exclude the proprietors from their management,the supreme court of indiana commented that the burial of the dead can not be taken out of the hands of the relatives thereof because we lay down the proposition,that the bodies of the dead belong to the surviving relations,in the order of inheritance,as property,and that they have the right to dispose of them as such,within restrictions analogous to those by which the disposition of other property may be regulated.bogert city of indianapolis,over a decade later,the rhode island supreme court relations as property to a report by the honorable samuel ruggles,described the nation common law as bestowing upon next of kin a duty towards the dead,and we may also say a right,to protect from violation and a duty on the part of others to abstain from violation a dead body may therefore be considered as a sort of quasi property.pierce,at.
interests in dead bodies in california law 
in,the same year pierce was decided,california enacted penal code,imposing a legal duty on next of kin to bury the deceased.see code west,historical and statutory notes.in,the california supreme court held that duty required recognition of exclusive rights of possession,control and disposition vesting in those with the duty.slack,cal.these rights,it explained,were by law protected,and for a violation of which next of kin are entitled to indemnification.id.
at issue in was a probate court order that a third party stranger in blood be charged with removing body to his desired grave in ireland.his wife,who was too sick to move the body immediately,objected that only she had the right to accompany the body and refused to consent to anyone else being given that charge.relying heavily on the reasoning of pierce,the california supreme court explained 
the duty of the burial of the dead is made an express legal obligation by penal code but aside from the obligation,there is a right,well defined and universally recognized,that in disposing of the body of deceased the last sad offices belong of right to the next of kin this right had its origin in sentiment,in affection for the dead,in religious belief in some form of future life.it therefore early became a subject of cognizance by the ecclesiastical courts.but,while thus having its origin in affection and religious sentiment,it soon came to be recognized as a strictly legal right and the next of kin,while not,in the full proprietary sense,owning the body of the deceased,have property rights in the body 
id.the court annulled the order of the probate court,holding the next of kin rights of possession and control of the body exclusive of others.id.at.
one year later,in enos snyder,cal,the california supreme court upheld the interests of next of kin in relation to dead bodies.in that case,enos had directed in his will that his burial be according to the wishes and directions of snyder,with whom he was living when he died.id.at.his wife and daughter,as next of kin,sued snyder for possession and control of the body for its disposition.thus was raised the question did the respondents,as next of kin,have the right to the possession of the body of the deceased for the purpose of burying it,as against the appellants,who claim that right under the will id.the court resolved the question in favor of the next of kin.in doing so,it held in the absence of statutory provisions,there is no property in a dead body,that it is not part of the estate of the deceased person,and that a man can not by will dispose of that which after his death will be his corpse.id.
the holding of enos that a person can not by will dispose of his corpse was abrogated by statute.see in re henderson estate,d.the explanation that there is no property in a dead body has been modified by most courts addressing the subject.following and pierce,california courts commonly use the term quasi property to describe the rights of next of kin to the body of the deceased.see holm superior court,d,sinai temple kaplan,d,cohen groman mortuary,d,overruled on other grounds,christensen superior court,cal d,d.
in,the exclusive rights of possession,control and disposition of the corpse recognized in,together with the duty previously contained in penal code,were codified in health and safety code california has at all times recognized these rights as exclusive of others.thus civil litigants have no right to demand an autopsy,walsh caidin,d,holm.at,and friends of the deceased have no right to attend the burial,ross forest lawn mem l park,d,over the objection of next of kin.violation of the correlative duty of others to refrain from disturbing the body is subject to an action for tortious interference with a right to dispose of a decedent remains.sinai temple.at christensen,d,at permitting action for unauthorized harvesting of corneas and other organs by mortuary palmquist standard acc.ins,permitting action for unauthorized retention of organs after an autopsy.
c.the right to transfer body parts 
the first successful transplantation of a kidney in led to an expansion of the rights of next of kin to the bodies of the dead.in,the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws approved the uniform anatomical gift act uaga,adopted by california the same year,which grants next of kin the right to transfer the parts of bodies in their possession to others for medical or research purposes.cal.health safety code et.the right to transfer is limited.the california uaga prohibits any person from knowingly,for valuable consideration,purchas ing or sell ing a part for transplantation,therapy,or reconditioning,if removal of the part is intended to occur after the death of the decedent,cal.health safety code,as does federal law,prohibiting the transfer of any human organ for valuable consideration finley atl.transport,t here is no right of property in a dead body as understood in the commercial sense.larson chase,a dead body is not property in the common commercial sense of that term.
in the and,medical science improvements and the related demand for transplant organs prompted governments to search for new ways to increase the supply of organs for donation.see national organ transplant act,stat establishing task force on organ transplantation and the organ procurement and transplantation network,at,reprinted in,discussing major advances in the science of human organ transplantation,and the need to encourage organ donation to meet a supply far short of demand.many perceived as a hindrance to the supply of needed organs the rule implicit in the uaga that donations could be effected only if consent was received from the decedent or next of kin.erik jaffe,she got bette davis eyes assessing the nonconsensual removal of cadaver organs under the takings and due process clauses,colum,at discussing estimates that organs are recovered from fewer than percent of people who die under circumstances that make them suitable donors.in response,some states passed presumed consent laws that allow the taking and transfer of body parts by a coroner without the consent of next of kin as long as no objection to the removal is known.jaffe,supra at california government code,enacted in,was such a law 
iii.due process analysis 
t o provide california eye banks with an adequate supply of corneal tissue,com.sb cal,a authorized the coroner to remove and release or authorize the removal and release of corneal eye tissue from a body within the coroner custody without any effort to notify and obtain the consent of next of kin if t he coroner has no knowledge of objection to the removal.the law also provided that the coroner or any person acting upon his or her request shall not incur civil liability for such removal in an action brought by any person who did not object prior to the removal nor be subject to criminal prosecution.b 
in analyzing whether the implementation of that law by the coroner deprived the parents of property,we define property as the group of rights inhering in the citizen relation to the physical thing,as the right to possess,use and dispose of it in other words,it deals with what lawyers term the individual interest in the thing in question.united states general motors.accord phillips washington legal,d perry sindermann,d explaining that property denotes a broad range of interests.to have a property interest a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for the thing in question,h e must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it it is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.roth,at.
in two decisions the sixth circuit,the only federal circuit to address the issue until now,held that the interests of next of kin in dead bodies recognized in michigan and ohio allowed next of kin to bring actions challenging implementation of cornea removal statutes similar to california.whaley county of tuscola,cir michigan brotherton cleveland,cir ohio.the sixth circuit noted that courts in each state had recognized a right of next of kin to possess the body for burial and a claim by next of kin against others who disturb the body.whaley,at brotherton,at.those common law rights,combined with the statutory right to control the disposition of the body recognized in each state adoption of the uaga,was held to be sufficient to create in next of kin a property interest in the corneas of their deceased relatives that could not be taken without due process of law.whaley,at brotherton,at.
the supreme courts of florida and georgia,however,have held that similar legal interests of next of kin in the possession of the body of a deceased family member,recognized as quasi property rights in each state,are not of constitutional dimension.georgia lions eye bank,lavant,state powell,so d,commenting that a ll authorities generally agree that the next of kin have no property right in the remains of a decedent.the florida supreme court recently rejected the broad implications of the reasoning in powell,distinguishing that decision as turning on a balance between the public health interest in cornea donation and the infinitesimally small intrusion of their removal.crocker pleasant,so d,allowing a action to go forward for interference with the right of next of kin to possess the body of their son because in florida there is a legitimate claim of entitlement by the next of kin to possession of the remains of a decedent for burial or other lawful disposition 
we agree with the reasoning of the sixth circuit and believe that reasoning is applicable here.under traditional common law principles,serving a duty to protect the dignity of the human body in its final disposition that is deeply rooted in our legal history and social traditions,the parents had exclusive and legitimate claims of entitlement to possess,control,dispose and prevent the violation of the corneas and other parts of the bodies of their deceased children.with california adoption of the uaga,cal.health and safety code,it statutorily recognized other important rights of the parents in relation to the bodies of their deceased right to transfer body parts and refuse to allow their transfer.these are all important components of the group of rights by which property is defined,each of which carried with it the power to exclude others from its exercise,traditionally one of the most treasured strands in an owner bundle of property rights.loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d see thomas merrill,property and the right to exclude,discussing the primacy of the right to exclude jeremy bentham,the limits of jurisprudence defined charles warren everett,stating that t o give a man a property interest in a thing,there must be a mandate prohibiting persons at large from meddling with it.thus,we hold that the parents had property interests in the corneas of their deceased children protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
our holding is not affected by california labeling of the interests of the next of kin as quasi property,a term with little meaningful legal significance although the underlying substantive interest is created by an independent source such as state law,federal constitutional law determines whether that interest rises to the level of a legitimate claim or entitlement protected by the due process clause.memphis light,gas and water div.craft,d.as the sixth circuit correctly recounted in whaley and brotherton,the identification of property interests under constitutional law turns on the substance of the interest recognized,not the name given that interest by the state.see whaley,at explaining that courts must look beyond the law nomenclature and to its substance brotherton,at holding that rights of next of kin in ohio form a substantial interest in the dead body,regardless of ohio classification of that interest.thus in brotherton,the interests created by ohio law were recognized as constitutionally protected property interests despite ohio courts not characterizing the rights of next of kin to dead bodies as right s,as have a majority of the courts confronted with the issue.brotherton,at.similarly,in whaley,the court recognized that next of kin in michigan possessed constitutionally protected property rights to the corneas of deceased relatives even though michigan has repeatedly emphasized that recovery for violation of the rights of next of kin is not for the damage to the corpse as property.whaley,at quoting keyes konkel.our holding similarly turns on the substance of the rights california recognizes,not on the label given to them.
nor does the fact that california forbids the trade of body parts for profit mean that next of kin lack a property interest in them.the supreme court has never held that a physical item is not property simply because it lacks a positive economic or market value.phillips,at.int l news service press.holmes,dissenting property,a creation of law,does not arise from value.
because the property interests of next of kin to dead bodies are firmly entrenched in the background principles of property law,based on values and understandings contained in our legal history dating from the roman empire,california may not be free to alter them with exceptions that lack a firm basis in traditional property principles.phillips,at.holding that state could legislatively exempt income only trusts and community property from long established rule that interest follows principle because those exceptions have a historical pedigree accord washington legal found.legal found.of washington,cir en banc schneider,at pruneyard shopping center robins,d marshall,concurring t here are limits on governmental authority to abolish core commonlaw rights.we need not,however,decide whether california has transgressed basic property principles with enactment of because that statute did not extinguish california legal recognition of the property interests of the parents to the corneas of their deceased children.it allowed the removal of corneas only if the coroner has no knowledge of objection,a provision that implicitly acknowledges the ongoing property interests of next of kin 
the effect of was to remove a and request for consent prior to the a opportunity to seek redress for the deprivation in california courts.a state may not evade due process analysis by defining p roperty by the procedures provided for its deprivation.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.while the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest,once conferred,without appropriate procedural safeguards.id.citations omitted.with,california eliminated procedural safeguards but retained the interest.
when the coroner removed the corneas from the bodies of the parents deceased children and transferred them to others,the parents could no longer possess,control,dispose or prevent the violation of those parts of their children bodies.to borrow a metaphor used when the government physically occupies property,the coroner did not merely take a single strand from the bundle of property rights it chop ped through the bundle,taking a slice of every strand.loretto,at.this was a deprivation of the most certain variety.
at bottom,p roperty rights serve human values.they are recognized to that end,and are limited by it.state shack.the property rights that california affords to next of kin to the body of their deceased relatives serve the premium value our society has historically placed on protecting the dignity of the human body in its final disposition.california infringed the dignity of the bodies of the children when it extracted the corneas from those bodies without the consent of the parents.the process of law was due the parents for this deprivation of their rights.
iv.postdeprivation process 
the scope of the process of law that was due the parents is not a question that we can answer based on the pleadings alone.this question must be addressed in future proceedings.
the coroner argument that,as a matter of law,process is sufficient and the parents should therefore be required to exhaust postdeprivation procedures must fail t he state may not finally destroy a property interest without first giving the putative owner an opportunity to present his claim of entitlement.logan zimmerman brush,d.the timing of a hearing depends upon the accommodation of competing interests including the importance of the private interests,the length or finality of the deprivation and the magnitude of governmental interest.mathews eldridge,d.but,absent extraordinary situations,boddie connecticut,d,such as the necessity of quick action by the state or the impracticality of providing any predeprivation process,the deprivation of property resulting from an established state procedure does not meet due process requirements without a predeprivation hearing.logan,at.quoting parratt,at.accord hudson palmer,d p ostdeprivation remedies do not satisfy due process where a deprivation of property is caused by conduct pursuant to established state procedure,rather than random and unauthorized action.the coroner removal of corneas was in accordance with the state procedures established by a.whether extraordinary situations justify the failure of the coroner to afford a predeprivation hearing turns on issues of fact that can not be properly examined at this stage of the litigation.
we do not hold that california lacks significant interests in obtaining corneas or other organs of the deceased in order to contribute to the lives of the living.courts are required to evaluate carefully the state interests in deciding what process must be due the holders of property interests for their deprivation.logan,at.mathews,at.an interest so central to the state core police powers as improving the health of its citizens is certainly one that must be considered seriously in determining what process the parents were due.see cruzan,at.explaining that states have an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life.but our constitution requires the government to assert its interests and subject them to scrutiny when it invades the rights of its subjects accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of the parents complaint and remand for proceedings in which the government justification for its deprivation of parents interests may be fully aired and appropriately scrutinized.
the dismissal of the parents claim is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
i dissent because i do not believe that the asthenic legal interest in a decedent body,which california confers upon relatives and others,should be treated as a puissant giant for federal constitutional purposes.
to begin with,it has always been true in california that absent a statute there is no property in a dead body.enos snyder,cal.for that reason,no action for conversion will lie against someone who is said to have damaged or taken a part of the body.see gray pac,d.to the extent that any right exists,it is,in general,merely a right to possession.id.that right exists solely for the limited purpose of determining who shall have its custody for burial.sinai temple kaplan,d.
of course,any civilized state desires that the bodies of its deceased members be disposed of in an appropriate way,on grounds of decency,consideration for others,and pragmatism.and it should be done with reasonable haste and without undue acrimony.
california statutory scheme reflects all of that.it decidedly does not confer a property right upon anyone.assuming that a decedent has not made his own arrangements for disposal of his own earthly remains the state makes sure that somebody else will both do so and pay for it.to that end,california has provided that t he right to control the disposition of the remains of a deceased person vests in,and the duty of disposition and the liability for the reasonable cost of disposition of the remains devolves upon,a list of individuals.cal.health safety code a.thus,this right is actually in the nature of a duty and expense designed to assure that the remains will not simply be left about,but will be quickly interred.and the state has created something like a table of intestate succession for the purpose of assuring that the right and duty land firmly on a defined group.first comes the person who has a power of attorney for healthcare.cal.health safety code a.then comes the spouse.id.at a.then adult children,then parents,then next of kin.id.at a.at the end is the public administrator,but he only gets the right if there are sufficient assets to allow him to discharge his duty.id.at a.this somewhat remarkable list surely shows just how peculiar it is to dub what we are dealing with a constitutionally protected property right.is not it interesting that the holder of a power of attorney comes before the closest relatives,and equally interesting to see that the public administrator may wind up with the right or is it essentially a duty 
i rather think that it is really a duty rather than a right,and because a duty in one person must mean that a right is lodged in someone else,it seems pellucid that the state holds the right to demand that someone on the list bear the burden of disposing of the de
