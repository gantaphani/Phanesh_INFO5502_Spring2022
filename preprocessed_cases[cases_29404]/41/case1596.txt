mary campbell campbell appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of davol,bard,surgical sense,surgical sense,and medical products corporation medical products.on appeal,campbell argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of bard,and davol,because purchase of the assets of surgical sense amounted to a continuation of surgical sense business.campbell also argues that the district court erred in determining that was not liable under a failure to warn theory of liability.finally,campbell asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of surgical sense and medical products because sale and ultimate dissolution was merely a fraudulent transfer to avoid liability for a defective product.this court affirms the district court grant of summary judgment.
in,campbell had breast cancer and underwent a right mastectomy.on may,she had breast reconstruction surgery.the surgery involved a tram flap procedure,a method by which excess abdominal fat is harvested and fashioned into a prosthetic breast.after the procedure,campbell surgeon placed a kugel hernia patch,a polypropylene surgical mesh device used for hernia repair,in her abdomen.
the kugel hernia patch was originally manufactured and distributed by surgical sense,which was incorporated under texas law on march.in january,bard,and its subsidiary davol,entered into an asset purchase agreement with surgical sense,through which acquired substantially all of surgical sense assets,including the kugel line of hernia repair products.the asset purchase agreement provided that 
is not assuming and will not perform,any obligations or liabilities not specifically described in section hereof or any of the following obligations and liabilities any obligation or liability of surgical sense resulting from any claim,legal or equitable action,proceeding or investigation pertaining to or relating to or arising from circumstances,events,conditions,acts or omissions occurring or existing on or prior to the closing date.
the asset purchase agreement also established that surgical sense was retaining all obligations and liabilities that were not expressly assumed by.
upon becoming the owner of the kugel hernia repair product line,repackaged the remaining inventory of patches,in order to include the bard name on the packaging.then began production on its version of the hernia patch,the bard kugel hernia patch,which was essentially the same as the original kugel hernia patch.doug inman and keith biggers,the sole directors and officers of surgical sense at the time of the asset sale,were temporarily employed by to ease the product line transition.several other former surgical sense employees were hired by during the transition period,but most of these employees were sales representatives,and none served in any managerial positions.
immediately after the asset sale,and pursuant to the asset purchase agreement,surgical sense filed articles of amendment with the texas secretary of state,changing the legal name of the business entity to medical products.medical products maintained the same corporate officers and directors as surgical sense,and at all times,surgical sense and medical products were the same legal entity.after january of,medical products ceased its business operations,and the company limited its activities to paying off liabilities and managing the proceeds of the asset sale.in april of,the board of directors of medical products voluntarily filed articles of dissolution with the texas secretary of state,and the company was officially dissolved on april.
according to the allegations set forth in her complaint,campbell developed chronic and unexplained abdominal pain at some point after her breast reconstruction surgery.she states that she developed chronic and severe infections in her abdominal area,which required hospitalizations,surgeries,and months of treatment.campbell claims that the pain and infections were caused by the malfunction of the kugel hernia patch that was inserted into her abdomen after the surgeon who performed her breast reconstruction surgery completed the tram flap procedure.
on july,campbell filed suit in the circuit court of benton county,arkansas,and the matter was removed to the united states district court for the western district of arkansas on august.filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that it is a dissolved entity that lacks the capacity to be sued under texas law.the district court converted motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment,and eventually granted summary judgment in favor of.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of,finding that did not succeed to the liabilities of,that the continuation of business exception was not applicable,that arkansas has not recognized a failure to warn claim,and that the facts do not support a failure to warn claim.campbell timely appealed the district court order.

successor liability of 
campbell first argues that a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether succeeded to the liabilities of surgical sense,as a result of the asset purchase.the general rule in most states,including arkansas,is that a corporation which purchases the assets of another corporation does not succeed to the liabilities of the selling corporation.swayze smith.however,this general rule is subject to several exceptions 
where the transferee assumes the debts and obligations of the transferor by express or implied agreement where there is a consolidation or merger of the two corporations where the transaction is fraudulent or lacking in good faith and where the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the selling corporation.
id.while campbell recognizes that the first two exceptions are not applicable in this case,she asserts that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the asset purchase in this case lacked good faith,and as to whether was a mere continuation of surgical sense.
as pointed out by in its appellees brief,and confirmed upon thorough review by this court,campbell lack of good faith argument is presented for the first time to this court on appeal.it is old and law that issues not raised in the trial court can not be considered by this court as a basis for reversal.morrow greyhound lines,cir see also pub.water supply dist.of laclede county,city of lebanon,cir.campbell vaguely alleges in her reply brief that the lack of good faith argument was implied in her arguments to the district court regarding whether was a mere continuation of surgical sense.this court has not seen any evidence that the argument was made at the district court level,and campbell has not cited to anything in the record suggesting otherwise.more importantly,the issue was not fully developed in the trial court,and considering the issue on the appellate level would implicate the rationale behind the rule preventing this court from considering new arguments 
the rationale for the rule is twofold.first,the record on appeal generally would not contain the findings necessary to an evaluation of the validity of an appellant arguments.second,there is an inherent injustice in allowing an appellant to raise an issue for the first time on appeal.a litigant should not be surprised on appeal by a final decision there of issues upon which they had no opportunity to introduce evidence.a contrary rule could encourage a party to sandbag at the district court level,only then to play his ace in the hole before the appellate court.
