john proctor appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of united parcel service ups on his claims that ups terminated him in retaliation for filing administrative charges of disability discrimination in violation of the american with disabilities act ada,a,and for filing workers compensation claims,in violation of kansas law.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
proctor was employed by ups as a package car driver,a position that requires an employee to lift,lower,leverage,and manipulate packages weighing up to seventy pounds and to work extended hours when necessary.in february,he underwent surgery on his wrist for a injury and eventually returned to work.in october,he sustained a injury to his back,after which he was examined by fevurly,ups doctor,who released him to return to work with no restrictions on november.one week later,he suffered another injury to his back.proctor pursued workers compensation claims based on his injuries,filing the latest of these claims in november.
the following month,in december,proctor returned to ups for a brief period after fevurly released him to return to work with a lifting restriction of thirty pounds.his last day working at ups was december.from january to july,proctor was examined by fevurly several times.in july,fevurly concluded that he had reached maximum medical improvement and imposed a permanent lifting restriction.
according to proctor,he was subject to medical restrictions that prevented him from performing his job duties until january.during this time,proctor continued to be treated by his own physicians in addition to seeing fevurly.his back doctor,prostic,released him to return to work with no restrictions on february,and his wrist doctor,ketchum,issued a full release on april.when ups did not allow proctor to return to work despite his doctors releases,he filed a grievance against ups for violating the collective bargaining agreement cba between ups and proctor union,the international brotherhood of teamsters,local union union.under the cba,after an employee presents ups with a doctor slip,the company doctor must examine the employee within three working days.after proctor filed the grievance,the company doctor,fevurly,examined proctor and did not release him to return to work,concluding that his work status was to be determined.
under the cba,when ups doctor,fevurly and an employee doctor disagree,ups and the union must agree on a third doctor whose decision is final and binding on the employer,the union,and the employee.pursuant to this provision of the cba,on april,brown,the doctor selected by ups and the union,examined proctor and imposed a lifting restriction of forty pounds.in addition,in his medical evaluation,brown specifically stated i do not recommend that he return to package car driving at united parcel service.following brown evaluation,ups continued to deny proctor requests to return to work.
a few months later,in july,proctor requested an accommodation under the ada.in august,ups asked fevurly to clarify his opinion regarding proctor ability to perform the essential functions of a package car driver.in response,fevurly stated that proctor is not qualified to perform the essential functions of his job,including the frequent lifting of seventy pounds as specified in the written description of the job essential functions.in march,ups notified proctor by letter of its decision to deny his request for an accommodation,stating b ased upon the medical information that we have received,we are unable to conclude that you are eligible for a reasonable accommodation pursuant to the americans with disabilities act.the letter also directed proctor to call the district workforce planning manager with any questions concerning his entitlement to benefits or his employment status at this time.
a few days later,on march,proctor was examined by poppa,a doctor retained by ups insurance carrier to provide an independent medical evaluation in connection with proctor workers compensation case.in his evaluation,poppa noted that proctor had reached maximum medical improvement with respect to all injuries and was therefore able to return to work with restrictions,including occasional lifting from floor to knuckle of pounds occasional lifting of knuckle to shoulder height at pounds occasional lifting from shoulder to overhead of pounds and occasional carrying pounds at feet.
that same month,in march,proctor filed an administrative charge with the office of federal contract compliance program ofccp,alleging disability discrimination for ups failure to accommodate him and return him to work.the following may,he filed a similar charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,and in september,he filed a charge with the kansas human rights commission khrc.
in june,an administrative law judge awarded proctor benefits on his workers compensation claims,which ups appealed to the appeals board for the kansas division of workers compensation.in july,proctor attended the last local hearing regarding his grievance against ups for not returning him to work.during the hearing,proctor union representative telephoned monica sloan,a district occupational health manager for ups,to check on the status of settlement negotiations concerning proctor workers compensation claims and to ask whether ups was going to permit proctor to return to work.according to proctor,sloan responded w e going to pay him a work comp settlement and as far as i concerned he can go eat shit and die.
by december,all three administrative agencies the ofccp,eeoc,and khrc had issued findings of no probable cause on proctor charges of disability discrimination,as well as letters.proctor did not,however,file suit based on these letters.in addition,on december,the appeals board for the kansas division of workers compensation issued its decision,resolving ups appeal of proctor benefits award.
on january,sloan notified proctor union representative by letter that ups had closed all proctor workers compensation claims and that proctor would be separated from employment with ups as of january.this letter is the only documentation of proctor termination in the record.according to sloan testimony,the termination letter resulted from ups policy and practice of terminating an employee who has not returned to work once the employee workers compensation claims are resolved.
the following may,proctor filed a questionnaire with the eeoc,which the agency treated as a second charge of discrimination.on may,the eeoc issued a letter,and on august,proctor filed suit against ups in federal district court,asserting claims of discrimination and retaliatory discharge in violation of federal and state law.although he alleged that ups violated federal and state law in failing to grant his request for a reasonable accommodation for his disability the only claims on appeal are those involving his termination.he asserts that ups violated the ada by terminating him in retaliation for filing administrative charges of disability discrimination and that ups violated kansas law by terminating him in retaliation for filing workers compensation claims.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of ups on both claims,finding that proctor had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the merits of either claim.the court also indicated that proctor ada claim could be dismissed as untimely because he failed to file a timely administrative charge challenging ups unlawful retaliation for the reasons specified below,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment in ups favor on both claims.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of a summary judgment motion de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.stover martinez,cir.in reviewing the record,we view all evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.we will affirm a district court grant of summary judgment unless the evidence in the record demonstrates a genuine issue of material fact.see also haynes level commc ns,llc,cir an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence allows a reasonable jury to resolve the issue either way and is material when it is essential to the proper disposition of the claim.quotations omitted.we may affirm the district court decision for any reason supported by the record.stover,at quotation omitted.
timeliness of retaliation claim under the ada 
for proctor retaliation claim under the ada to be timely,he must have filed an administrative charge within days of the challenged employment action and have filed suit in federal court within ninety days of receiving the agency letter.see a incorporating title vii enforcement provisions,including administrative filing requirements under e,f see also haynes,at noting a plaintiff must file an administrative charge within days of discriminatory action before filing a civil suit under the ada.in general,a cause of action accrues on the date the employee is notified of an adverse employment decision by the employer.haynes,at quoting davidson am.online,cir.an employee receives notice of an adverse employment decision when a particular event or decision is announced by the employer.hulsey kmart,cir.
the district court concluded that ups notified proctor of its decision not to return him to work by march.by this time,proctor had notice of brown final and binding decision recommending he not return to work as a package car driver and of ups decision to deny his request for an accommodation.although proctor filed administrative charges in march alleging disability discrimination based on ups failure to accommodate him,he did not file a civil suit on this basis after receiving letters.moreover,because the district court found that proctor had notice by march that he would not be returned to work,it found the administrative charge filed in may to be untimely and concluded that proctor civil suit based on this charge may be dismissed.
to determine whether proctor ada claim should be dismissed as untimely,we must identify precisely the unlawful employment practice of which he complains.delaware state college ricks,d.although proctor purports to challenge his termination,announced in the january,letter,ups argues that he had previous notice that he would not be returned to work based on brown final and binding decision under the cba and the company determination that he was not entitled to an accommodation.citing the supreme court decision in ricks,ups characterizes proctor termination in as a delayed,but inevitable,consequence of these earlier decisions.id.at.in ricks,the supreme court held that the limitations period for filing an administrative complaint began to run when a professor was denied tenure,rather than when his terminal contract ended,because the eventual loss of a teaching position was a delayed,but inevitable,consequence of the denial of tenure.id.
notably,in ricks,as well as in the supreme court most recent decision on this issue,ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,d,the plaintiff did not assert that the employer acted with unlawful intent during the charging period,within the days prior to the filing of an administrative charge rather,the plaintiff argued that the challenged action gave effect to discriminatory acts that occurred outside the charging period.see id.at rejecting the argument that it is sufficient that discriminatory acts that occurred prior to the charging period had continuing effects during that period ricks,at.holding that plaintiff could not rely on a discriminatory act occurring outside the charging period to file a complaint based on a consequence of the act.specifically,in ledbetter,the plaintiff argued that an employment practice committed with no improper purpose and no discriminatory intent is rendered unlawful nonetheless because it gives some effect to an intentional discriminatory act that occurred outside the charging period.at.the court rejected this argument and held that the plaintiff claim was untimely.id.but unlike the plaintiffs in ledbetter and ricks,proctor claims that ups acted with unlawful intent during the charging period,within the days prior to the filing of the administrative complaint upon which his lawsuit is based.he does not argue that his termination was a delayed effect of alleged acts of discrimination occurring outside the charging period.
in addition,unlike the court in ricks,we can not conclude that ups notified proctor of his eventual termination prior to the charging period.ricks,at.noting that the plaintiff had received explicit notice that his employment would end after a period.even if we assume that proctor termination in january was an inevitable consequence of earlier employment decisions,the record does not support the conclusion that ups notified proctor of this inevitability.the record contains evidence that he was notified of brown decision recommending he not return to work as a package car driver and of ups decision to deny his request for an accommodation.the record does not,however,contain evidence that ups notified proctor that these decisions would inevitably lead to his termination.indeed,in the march letter denying proctor request for an accommodation,ups did not notify him that the denial would result in his discharge instead,ups instructed him to call the district workforce planning manager with any questions about his employment status.id.at.holding that the limitations period for filing an administrative charge began to run when the alleged discriminatory act occurred and was communicated to the employee emphasis added.
in short,the argument that proctor discharge inevitably followed from previous employment decisions is ups argument,not proctor,and is therefore properly resolved on the merits.because proctor asserts that ups acted with retaliatory intent during the charging period and the record does not indicate that he received notice of his eventual discharge prior to this period,we conclude that proctor ada claim is timely.
retaliation claim under the ada 
we next consider proctor claim that ups violated the ada,a,by discharging him in retaliation for filing administrative charges of disability discrimination.when,as in the case before us,the plaintiff does not offer direct evidence of retaliation,we analyze a retaliation claim under the framework delineated in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see anderson coors brewing,cir.following this framework,if proctor establishes a prima facie case of retaliation,the burden shifts to ups to assert a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.piercy maketa,cir.if ups provides a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its decision,the burden shifts back to proctor to show that ups proffered reason is a pretext masking discriminatory animus.id.
in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,proctor must show that he engaged in protected opposition to discrimination,that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,and that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.argo blue cross blue shield of,cir citing burlington santa fe ry.white,d proctor clearly engaged in protected activity when he filed administrative charges with the ofccp,eeoc,and the kansas human rights commission alleging disability discrimination based on ups failure to accommodate him and return him to work.see stover,at there is no dispute that the plaintiff eeo complaints are protected activity.anderson,at by filing an eeoc claim,plaintiff engaged in protected activity.in addition,a reasonable employee would certainly find ups termination of proctor a materially adverse action.see argo,at.hence,only the third element concerning causation is at issue.
to establish that a causal connection exists between the filing of administrative charges and his discharge,proctor may proffer evidence of circumstances that justify an inference of retaliatory motive,such as protected conduct closely followed by adverse action.haynes,at quotation omitted.proctor filed his last administrative charge on september,and received his termination letter over four months later on january.four months is too large a time gap to establish a causal connection.see piercy,at noting that we have found a proximity of three months insufficient to support a presumption of causation anderson,at w e have held that a period,standing alone,is insufficient to establish causation.citing richmond oneok,cir.in an attempt to establish causation by temporal proximity,proctor argues that he engaged in protected activity until the last administrative agency,the ofccp,issued its finding of no probable cause and its letter on december.according to proctor,because ups and the ofccp were dealing with his complaint until december,he engaged in protected conduct until the agency issued its decision.not surprisingly,the supreme court has characterized this argument as utterly implausible.clark county sch.dist.breeden,d noting that the court of appeals rejected respondent utterly implausible suggestion that the eeoc issuance of a action in which the employee takes no a protected activity of the employee.proctor took no part in the agency determination.he engaged in protected activity when he filed the administrative charge on september,after which more than four months passed before his discharge.
because a time period does not support an inference of retaliatory motive,proctor must present additional evidence to establish the necessary causal connection.see piercy,at t he passage of time does not necessarily bar a plaintiff retaliation claim if additional evidence establishes the retaliatory motive.haynes,at standing alone,temporal proximity between the protected activity and the retaliatory conduct must be very close in time.otherwise,the plaintiff must offer additional evidence to establish causation.quotation omitted.the other evidence proctor proffers in support of causation is evidence he claims demonstrates the weakness of ups proffered reason for his discharge,thereby creating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether ups reason is a pretext for retaliation.although this kind of evidence is typically considered during the third phase of the mcdonnell douglas inquiry,proctor correctly notes that we have considered evidence of pretext in the prima facie stage of a retaliation claim.see wells.dep t of,cir considering evidence of pretext in analyzing the causation element of a prima facie case of retaliation under title vii.
ups proffers a reason for proctor discharge based on the application of neutral employment policies.the company claims that proctor was terminated because brown issued a final and binding decision under the cba that he was unable to perform the essential functions of his job and the company was under no legal duty to accommodate him with a different position based on these determinations,ups did not return proctor to work,leading to his termination in january in accordance with its policy of terminating employees who have not returned to work when their workers compensation claims are resolved.proctor concedes that ups proffered reason is a facially legitimate,nonretaliatory reason,but contends that two pieces of evidence suggest that the reason is unworthy of belief and therefore a pretext for retaliation.see stover,at.to establish pretext,proctor must present evidence of such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.argo,at quotations omitted.
as evidence of pretext,proctor asserts that the fact that ups allowed him to return to work in with a lifting restriction of thirty pounds suggests that ups later refused to return him to work with a higher lifting restriction in retaliation for filing administrative charges.see simms oklahoma,cir noting that plaintiff may use evidence concerning prior treatment to demonstrate pretext.but his return to work was a temporary arrangement.brown the doctor agreed upon by ups and the union under the cba did not evaluate proctor and recommend that he not return to work until april.when ups permitted proctor to return to work in december,it was still waiting for him to reach maximum medical improvement,at which time ups could determine whether to return him to work on a permanent basis.hence,proctor return to work with a temporary accommodation in can not support an inference that ups acted with retaliatory intent in discharging him in 
in addition,we note that,to establish that ups terminated him with retaliatory intent,proctor may not rely on prior acts of alleged discrimination occurring outside the charging period,as these constitute discrete and actions.see passenger morgan,d.in arguing that ups treated him differently by refusing to allow him to return to work with higher lifting restrictions in january,proctor is actually challenging ups earlier denial of his request for an accommodation.but proctor did not file suit based on administrative charges alleging ups discriminated against him in failing to accommodate his disability.because ups denial of his request for an accommodation constitutes a discrete act of alleged discrimination,it is not actionable unless he files suit based on this act.see id.he can not impute the alleged intent behind a act to ups decision to discharge him based on a neutral policy of relying on the cba procedure and of discharging employees not at work at the close of workers compensation claims.see haynes,at an employee can not use an employer alleged intent in performing discrete actions to attach discriminatory intent or pretext to a termination decision based on a neutral policy.
as further evidence of pretext,proctor argues that poppa medical evaluation in april calls ups asserted reason for his termination into question.he contends that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that ups asserted reason,reliance on brown medical evaluation is unworthy of belief based on poppa later and in his view more favorable medical evaluation.as ups points out,however,poppa was not evaluating proctor ability to perform the essential functions of his job.instead,he was examining proctor to assess his workers compensation disability rating.in addition,as the district court noted,poppa did not state that proctor can perform the job essential functions indeed,the doctor findings suggest that proctor may not be able to perform these functions,lifting seventy pounds above shoulder level.
moreover,in the context of a retaliation claim,the crucial question is not whether proctor can in fact perform the essential functions of his job.the relevant question is whether proctor can show that ups motive for taking adverse action was its desire to retaliate for the protected activity.wells,at.in other words,we must determine whether ups treated proctor differently because he filed administrative charges of disability discrimination,id.at,not whether ups correctly concluded that he could not perform the essential functions of his job.as we have cautioned,the relevant inquiry is not whether the employer proffered reasons were wise,fair or correct,but whether the employer honestly believed those reasons and acted in good faith upon those beliefs.stover,at quotation omitted see also piercy,at even a mistaken belief can be a legitimate,reason for an employment decision.proctor has failed to offer any evidence that suggests ups based his discharge on a retaliatory motive,rather than on its neutral employment policies.notably,he does not challenge ups policy of terminating an employee based on a final and binding doctor decision under the cba once all workers compensation claims are resolved.he does not argue,for example,that ups does not uniformly apply this policy.see haynes,at noting that employee who failed to establish causation element of retaliation claim did not allege that her employer applied employment policy in discriminatory manner.nor does he argue that ups used the policy itself to discriminate against a class of employees.see piercy,at noting that plaintiff need not prove discriminatory motive when employment policy is discriminatory on its face see also ledbetter.at noting that an employer who adopts a facially discriminatory pay struc
