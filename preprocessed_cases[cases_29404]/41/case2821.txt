after humberto gaviria underwent five surgeries to repair jaw problems resulting from a altercation with the police,he filed a medical malpractice action against nine oral surgeons surgeons who participated in the surgeries.acting pro se after the withdrawal of his attorney,gaviria was unable to substantiate his claims with expert testimony as required by district of columbia law,and the district court granted summary judgment for the surgeons.on appeal,gaviria contends through amicus curiae that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to appoint replacement trial counsel after gaviria appointed counsel withdrew and that the court further erred by refusing to appoint an expert witness pursuant to fed.evid.
the district court took adequate steps to assist gaviria in the development of his claims.gaviria benefitted from appointed trial explored gaviria claims with the help of an expert before he appointed mediation counsel,who worked to negotiate a settlement while helping gaviria,as did the district court itself,to collect discovery materials from third parties.by the time the district court granted summary judgment for the surgeons,it knew that neither a recent scan of gaviria head nor anything gaviria had presented contributed toward his burden to show that the surgeons caused or exacerbated the injuries to his jaw.because gaviria claims were given due consideration and because neither his pro se brief nor amicus demonstrates error by the district court,we affirm.
gaviria was injured in,when he was struck on the right side of his face and sustained a fractured jaw during an arrest in boston,massachusetts.in may,while in custody at the jail,he began to complain about severe headaches and severe problems on his right jaw.gaviria decl.at.he was taken to the general hospital where he was diagnosed with a deranged right temporomandibular joint tmj.a group of four surgeons performed a lengthy operation to alleviate gaviria pain on may.this operation failed to resolve gaviria condition,and four more surgeries were performed another in and three more in.when gaviria condition still did not improve,he filed this lawsuit on september,against general hospital and the surgeons.after over a year passed,the district court appointed counsel with gaviria consent,observing 
defendants have been unable to resolve the matter on threshold issues of jurisdiction.given the nature and complexity of the claims and the likelihood that the case will need to be resolved on the merits,the court finds that appointment of counsel would be in the interests of justice.
order of,citing civ.a b amended.patrick malone,of the law firm stein,mitchell mezines entered an appearance as appointed counsel.malone requested gaviria medical records from the surgeons and forwarded the available records and films to jeffrey gittleman,a dentist specializing in oral surgery including tmj problems,for his preliminary review.after gittleman reported to malone that he did not see anything unusual in the medical records of gaviria first two surgeries and that problems like gaviria are frequently never cured,malone reported these findings in a letter to gaviria and withdrew from the case.the district court then granted gaviria request to proceed pro se.
in subsequent filings,gaviria reconsidered his decision to represent himself and sought additional counsel.in september,the district court appointed counsel for the limited purpose of mediation.one of the two mediation lawyers spoke spanish,gaviria native tongue.in march,gaviria requested that his mediation counsel be converted to permanent counsel,but the district court refused because mediation counsel had not consented.at the same time,the district court declined to appoint another pro bono attorney pending the outcome of mediation and discovery.after mediation failed and counsel withdrew in september,gaviria renewed his request for appointed counsel.in december,the district court conclude d that a reappointment was not warranted because the court itself had assisted gaviria in obtaining the records of his surgeries from the government,mediation counsel also had assisted with discovery,there was no indication that there were remaining discovery issues,and a lawyer with whom gaviria had communicated had not consented to an appointment.order of.
meanwhile,gaviria made several requests for the district court to appoint an independent expert witness.on each occasion,the district court refused.despite gaviria professed difficulty with the english language and lack of knowledge of the law,the district court concluded that gaviria situation and case d id not present the type of compelling circumstances to justify the exercise of any such discretionary authority.order of july.in further explanation,the district court remarked that the first appointed counsel utilized the services of an expert,who apparently could not render an opinion in support of plaintiff case,and that medical records of recent tests have been produced by the bureau of prisons which do not appear to support his claims.order of.the recent tests included a noncontrast enhanced ct scan of gaviria head at the university of texas medical branch hospital in galveston from which harish jhaveri reported that b oth temporomandibular joints are normal.gaviria own attempts to find an expert proved unfruitful.at a march status conference,he told the district court that he had consulted too many potential experts and they say,i sorry,they feel for my case,but they say it impossible.discovery closed on may.
on august,the surgeons filed a motion for summary judgment.in granting the motion,the district court acknowledged that expert testimony is an essential element of a prima facie case of medical malpractice under district of columbia law and stated 
plaintiff has not proffered a sworn statement or any other evidence from the doctors at the fort worth facility to support his claim pertaining to causation.nor does he claim that they can provide expert testimony on the applicable standard of care.plaintiff bare representations are insufficient to create a triable issue.
gaviria,civ,mem.op.at.gaviria appeals.
no civil litigant is guaranteed counsel,willis fbi,but district courts are authorized by statute to request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel,e.this court concluded in willis that local civil rule a b was the appropriate metric for evaluating appointment of counsel and that the district court decision would be vacated only for abuse of discretion.at.the local rule underwent a minor amendment and renumbering in but is substantively the same as relevant to this appeal and remains,therefore,an appropriate framework for our review 
amicus contends that the district court erred in refusing to reappoint counsel for gaviria by providing scanty reasoning that was speculative and irrelevant brief of amicus curiae at.in particular,amicus maintains that the district court should have set forth the four factors of local civil rule b and explained how they were implicated in gaviria case.however,in light of the record of the proceedings,the district court articulation sufficed to demonstrate that it did not abuse its discretion.
after acknowledging that rule was controlling,the district court concluded that a reappointment was unwarranted because gaviria had competently prosecuted his case with the assistance of the district court.the district court noted that gaviria had contacted private counsel but that the attorney had not entered an appearance.further,the district court noted that neither the response by the expert consulted by gaviria first appointed counsel malone nor the recent ct scan results supported the merits of gaviria claims.concluding that it had worked to ensure gaviria a full and fair hearing on his complaint,the district court denied gaviria request for reappointment of counsel.order of.
despite its brevity,the district court discussion shows that it considered each of the four factors of rule b and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.to the contrary,considering the factors independently,it is clear that the balance of factors in the
