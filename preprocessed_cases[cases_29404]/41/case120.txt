in this appeal,administration for child support,a unit of the department of the family of the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico,seeks review of a decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the united states department of health and human services hhs or agency in a proceeding under the administrative procedure act apa pursuant to c.puerto rico brought this action to challenge the agency assessment of a financial penalty against certain federal grant money used to fund puerto rico child support enforcement programs,after hhs determined that puerto rico had failed to satisfy data reporting requirements,or meet performance benchmarks,in consecutive fiscal years.
puerto rico contends that hhs acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it refused to accept data submitted days after the regulatory deadline,and failed to provide adequate notice of its intent to assess the penalty.it asserts that both of these actions were predicated on the agency unreasonable reading of applicable regulations.the district court rejected these contentions,concluding that the agency interpretation of its regulations was reasonable and entitled to deference.after careful review,we affirm.
background 
statutory and regulatory framework 
puerto rico participates in the temporary assistance to needy families,or tanf,program,which is administered by hhs pursuant to title of the social security act.the tanf program provides block grants,also known as state family assistance grants,to eligible states.see a a central purpose of these grants is to lend a hand to states which provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own home or in the homes of relatives.id.eligibility for tanf grants is predicated on the state operation of child support enforcement is,programs designed to locate parents,establish paternity,and obtain child and spousal accordance with title of the social security act.see see also a.
title enforces strict performance standards and reporting requirements on states as a condition of funding.under this regime,states may qualify for incentive payments based on the relative effectiveness of their performance in five areas paternity establishment,child support order establishment,current collections,average collections,and cost effectiveness.b.each fiscal year,eligible states must submit complete and reliable data to demonstrate their performance in each of these areas.b b see also id.g i j.data is considered reliable if it meets a standard of reliability as determined by the secretary of hhs,i,and complete if it includes all reporting elements necessary to compute performance levels and is submitted within the proper timeframe,id.j hhs regulations set the deadline for submitting this data as the december following the end of each fiscal year,the end of the first quarter following the conclusion of the fiscal year.see f.
based on this data,hhs calculates the amount of each state incentive payments.b.if the secretary determines that the data submitted by the state is reliable and complete,he will determine how the state performed with respect to each of the five performance measures as compared to other eligible states incentive payments are then allocated to each state as a share of a fixed i ncentive payment pool set aside by congress for each fiscal year.id.however,if the secretary determines that the state has submitted unreliable or incomplete data for any particular performance indicator,or has failed to satisfy applicable performance benchmarks,the state will not receive an incentive payment for that indicator for that financial year.see id.
states are also subject to penalties based on their performance in three of these areas paternity establishment,support order establishment,and current collections.see.when in a given fiscal year a state fails to either submit complete and reliable data or satisfy substantive performance measures,the next fiscal year automatically becomes a corrective action year in which the state is required to improve its performance or face penalties.id.a a,a b.that is,when a state in consecutive fiscal years fails either the data reporting requirement the substantive performance requirement including a reporting failure in one year and a performance failure in the other,it is subject to a penalty under the tanf program.
as is relevant here,states must establish a paternity establishment percentage,or pep,for each year in order to qualify for an incentive payment for that performance indicator g a.if a state pep falls below this threshold,however,it may still satisfy this performance requirement by demonstrating a certain level of improvement over the previous fiscal year pep.id.g b f a.when a state fails to satisfy the pep performance reporting criteria in two consecutive years,it is subject to a penalty.the penalty assessed is a certain percentage of the tanf grant the first failure is penalized by a reduction,but subsequent failures may be penalized by as much as.a b c.when a penalty is imposed,a state must expend its own funds to make up the difference.e.
hhs is required to notify the state in writing when it determines that a state is subject to a penalty.the notice must inform the state of the deficiency which is the basis for the penalty,as well as the reasons for,and amount of,the penalty assessed.b.the penalty is imposed in the fiscal year following the agency final decision.c.states may appeal to the hhs departmental appeals board dab within sixty days of receipt of such notice.b.
facts and proceedings below 
the basic facts are not in dispute.on february,hhs notified puerto rico that its auditors had determined that puerto rico fiscal year fy pep data was deficient.as hhs explained,puerto rico had submitted pep data covering its performance over an period from january,to june,rather than the proper period from august,to july.thus,hhs determined that puerto rico fy pep data was not accurate because it included data prior to the reporting period,and was incomplete because it was missing data for july 
puerto rico attempted to submit corrected data on february.however,in a letter dated march,hhs informed puerto rico that it would not accept the corrected pep data for purposes of calculating incentive payments because the december,deadline set forth in f had passed.hhs explained that a point is necessary for us to make the required performance determinations and calculations on a timely basis because payments of incentives can not be made to any state until the entire process has been completed for all states in a given fiscal year.puerto rico thus received no pep incentive payment for fy.however,because fy data was used both to compute incentive payments for fy and to qualify for fy incentives based on improved performance,hhs indicated that it would accept the corrected pep data covering fy for the limited purpose of determining whether puerto rico qualif ied for incentives on the basis of improved performance in fy.the corrected fy data showed a pep of.
for fy,puerto rico submitted data which showed a pep of.this pep fell below the minimum threshold of and did not demonstrate an improvement over the previous fiscal year pep of.thus,puerto rico had failed for two consecutive years to submit reliable pep data fy or meet substantive pep performance targets fy.accordingly,hhs notified puerto rico on november,that it would be penalized by on its fy tanf grant.hhs ultimately assessed a penalty of.
puerto rico appealed this decision to the dab and argued that the agency had erred both by failing to accept its corrected data in february,and by notifying puerto rico in an untimely fashion of its penalty.puerto rico claimed that each of these actions was based on an unreasonable interpretation of applicable regulations.the dab rejected both contentions and upheld the penalty.puerto rico then filed this apa action in the district court challenging the agency final decision.the district court,adopting a magistrate judge recommendation,agreed with the dab and granted summary judgment in favor of hhs.this appeal followed.
