peter rost filed this whistleblower action against pfizer,and its subsidiary pharmacia corporation under the federal false claims act fca,et,and analogous state statutes.the suit alleges that pharmacia misconduct in marketing a human growth hormone,genotropin,for uses unapproved by the food and drug administration led to claims for reimbursement to the united states for unreimbursable,drug prescriptions.
the district court rejected defendants argument that the suit be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under e,but granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that rost complaint failed to meet the pleading requirements for allegations of fraud under federal rule of civil procedure b.united states ex rel.rost pfizer,d.
rost appeal urges reversal of that holding.pfizer,supported by two sets of amici,agrees that rost complaint fails the pleading standard of rule b but claims error by the district court in deciding the threshold issue of whether one of the fca jurisdictional bars,see e,applies to rost suit.the united states,appearing as amicus,argues for affirmance on the jurisdictional ground and notes that the rule b ruling is consistent with the law of this circuit.the jurisdictional bar issue raises questions of statutory interpretation unresolved in this circuit.
we affirm the decision of the district court that e does not bar rost suit.we also agree that the complaint fails to meet the heightened pleading standard for fca claims,but remand so that the district court may consider rost request for leave to amend,which it did not address.
genotropin is a brand of synthetic human growth hormone originally marketed by pharmacia.the fda has approved genotropin only for the treatment of three specific pediatric disorders and of adult growth hormone deficiency.physicians may prescribe genotropin for indications,but the food,drug cosmetic act fdca,et,prohibits pharmaceutical companies from marketing drugs for such uses.in addition,medicaid generally does not reimburse patients for prescriptions.see i,k,k there is a wide and lucrative market for uses of human growth hormone.one such use is to slow the effects of aging in adults.also,some parents request the drug to boost the growth of short children,even absent a hormonal deficiency.sales to the domestic market for uses significantly enhance the profitability of synthetic human growth hormone.
rost joined pharmacia in as vice president of marketing in the company endocrine care unit.among his responsibilities was oversight of global marketing for genotropin.rost soon became concerned that subordinates in charge of marketing genotropin within the united states were utilizing problematic tactics.pharmacia sales representatives received incentive payments for each new patient prescribed genotropin,whether for on or uses.
rost also suspected pharmacia of using a genotropin study program to funnel improper payments to doctors for prescribing the drug.every doctor that prescribed genotropin became eligible to participate in the program,which collected data about patients with growth disorders who took genotropin.participating doctors would receive a cash payment for every patient to whom they prescribed genotropin and enrolled in the study.doctors participating in the study program also received trips to conferences at luxury resorts where,among other topics,doctors would discuss uses of the drug.
in addition,rost discovered that pharmacia granted financial incentives to distributors targeting the market for human growth hormone.these discount pricing contracts and rebates benefitted clinics,vendors,and others unlikely to dispense genotropin for its uses.rost feared these incentives subsidized the market for genotropin.
the company hired physicians and others as independent consultants to promote genotropin for uses.for instance,pharmacia retained a company in canada to create marketing materials touting genotropin uses.pharmacia also made substantial payments to the director of several clinics in florida.
rost believed these practices ran afoul of the fdca.see,prohibiting interstate distribution of drugs that have not undergone fda approval process id.providing criminal penalties for such distribution.rost also believed these practices were suspect under the statute,b,which criminalizes the payment of kickbacks,bribes,or other inducements to doctors in an effort to influence decisions about prescriptions that are reimbursed by a federal health care program.
rost reported his concerns up the chain of management at pharmacia.the company initiated an internal investigation and cut back on the problematic marketing activity.rost,however,remained skeptical of some continuing practices.
in july,pfizer announced it would acquire pharmacia.in meetings with pfizer personnel during october and november of,rost and other pharmacia employees aired their concerns about genotropin marketing.rost also wrote to a pfizer marketing executive in early regarding pharmacia sale and marketing of genotropin.
pfizer completed its acquisition of pharmacia on april.pfizer immediately initiated an internal investigation into the legacy marketing practices of its new subsidiary.it also moved quickly to inform the relevant federal authorities about potential problems.
on may,pfizer contacted two separate offices within the department of health and human services hhs regarding pharmacia problematic marketing practices.one was the fda division of drug marketing,advertising,and communications ddmac,to which pfizer wished to disclose information regarding the marketing and distribution of genotropin.pfizer followed up on may,with a confidential letter to the ddmac and the fda office of chief counsel.the letter summarized pharmacia past sales to doctors and clinics,referring to the improper discount contracts and to sales representatives who focused their marketing efforts on the market.the letter also described remedial measures taken by pharmacia and pfizer.
pfizer also contacted on may,the hhs office of inspector general oig,which is charged with investigating and preventing fraud in federal health care programs such as medicare and medicaid.the oig administers a voluntary disclosure program to encourage health care providers to inform the office of fraudulent conduct,and pfizer sought to enter the program.pfizer representatives met with oig officials on may,to discuss the marketing of genotropin and various forms of improper payments to prescribing physicians.the oig officials informed pfizer that an investigative agent had been assigned to the matter and invited pfizer to submit a letter requesting admission into the voluntary disclosure program.in another confidential letter sent to the oig on june,pfizer identified three areas of potential misconduct related to pharmacia promotion of genotropin first,payments made to physicians in the form of consulting contracts and professional or educational junkets second,payments for participating in the genotropin study program,which the letter acknowledged may have been motivated by sales and marketing concerns and third,pharmacia engagement of outside entities to provide product support services for genotropin to physicians.pfizer sent a copy of the letter to the civil fraud section of the department of justice.
pfizer continued its internal investigation into pharmacia former marketing practices after its correspondence to the hhs but did not make any public announcement regarding genotropin at that time.pfizer first disclosed problems with genotropin marketing in a publicly available document on march,in materials appended to a form filed with the securities and exchange commission.that document states that pfizer recently was notified that the department of justice is conducting investigations relating to the marketing and sale of genotropin pfizer is cooperating in these investigations.
in april,the attorney office for massachusetts announced that pfizer would plead guilty and pay a fine in response to a criminal charge for violating the statute through payments to doctors.pfizer simultaneously entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government as to a criminal information charging the company with one count of violating the fdca for promotion and distribution of genotropin.pfizer paid the government a total of million to resolve investigations conducted over four years by the hhs,doj,and fbi.
rost had begun considering a false claims act lawsuit in late.rost filed his qui tam complaint on june,in camera and under seal pursuant to b.the fca requires a private plaintiff bringing a claim under the act to file a complaint under seal and serve the government with the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information underlying the complaint,a procedure designed to allow the government to decide whether to intervene in the action.b see also united states ex rel.karvelas,cir.
the united states spent more than two years investigating the allegations in rost complaint and considering whether to intervene in the action.on november,the united states notified the district court that it would not intervene.two days later,the court ordered rost complaint unsealed and served on the defendants.
the complaint pleads claims for damages under the fca and the statutes of ten states and the district of columbia rost bases those claims on marketing practices that he previously brought to the attention of pharmacia and pfizer management encouraging sales representatives to promote genotropin for uses,making payments and other inducements to doctors through the genotropin research program,granting discounts and rebates to distributors known to target the market,and hiring physicians as independent consultants to promote and prescribe genotropin for uses.the complaint alleges that pharmacia knew a significant portion of its sales were for uses because it maintains a database containing information on patients prescribed genotropin.that information includes the identity of the prescribing doctor,the primary and secondary diagnosis,and the dosage prescribed.the complaint alleges that the database reveals that approximately sixty percent of all adult and percent of all pediatric sales of genotropin were for uses.
the complaint does not allege pharmacia itself ever submitted false claims.it alleges that pharmacia knowingly caused the submission of fraudulent claims by others to the government in the form of claims for reimbursement for prescriptions of genotropin.the complaint does not identify any false claim presented by others to any government health program or any particular entity or person who actually submitted such a claim.instead,the complaint pleads that t he false claims were presented by thousands of separate entities,across the united states,and over many years.rost has no control over or dealings with such entities and has no access to the records in their possession.
pfizer moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to meet the rule b pleading requirements for allegations of fraud.on the first point,pfizer argued that its communications with government officials constituted public disclosures triggering the jurisdictional bar of e a,and that rost did not qualify as an original source for the information in his complaint so as to exempt him from the bar,see id.e b.
the district court held that pfizer confidential disclosures to the hhs and doj were not public disclosures that would trigger the fca jurisdictional bar but granted dismissal on the rule b grounds.rost,d at.
the false claims act prohibits the knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment,or causing the submission of such claims,to the federal government and prescribes fines and treble damages to penalize offenders.a violations of the act may be enforced by civil actions initiated by either the attorney general,id.a,or a private person,id.b.in the latter category of qui tam actions,the act affords the government an opportunity to evaluate the relator complaint and decide whether to assume primary responsibility for prosecuting the action.id.b,b,c.a private relator is entitled to a portion of any proceeds from the suit,whether the united states intervenes as an active participant in the action or not.if the government intervenes,the act grants between and of the government damages or settlement amount to the relator.id.d.if the government does not intervene,as here,the relator is entitled to between and of the recovery.id.d.in either case,the act requires defendants to pay attorneys fees for a successful qui tam plaintiff.id.d.
the qui tam provisions of the fca supplement federal law enforcement resources by encouraging private citizens to uncover fraud on the government.karvelas,at.the qui tam mechanism has historically been susceptible to abuse,however,by parasitic relators who bring fca damages claims based on information within the public domain or that the relator did not otherwise discover.see united states ex rel.prawer fleet bank of,cir summarizing history of fca litigation and legislative amendments.congress has tailored the fca to walk a fine line between encouraging and discouraging opportunistic behavior.id.at quoting united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.the current act contains a series of jurisdictional bars designed in part to mediate that fine line.see e.
the act does not create a cause of action against all fraudulent conduct affecting the government.karvelas,at.rather,fca liability attaches to a false or fraudulent claim for payment or to a false record or statement made to get a false or fraudulent claim paid by the government.a see also karvelas,at evidence of an actual false claim is the sine qua non of a false claims act violation.quoting united states ex rel.clausen lab.of,cir.fca liability does not attach to violations of federal law or regulations,such as marketing of drugs in violation of the fdca,that are independent of any false claim.
jurisdictional bar 
the threshold question in a false claims act case is whether the statute bars jurisdiction.rockwell int l united states,d.the relevant bar,contained in e a and b,provides 
a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
our case turns on the public disclosure language of e a.pfizer asserts that its to hhs and doj,the appropriate investigative bodies,constitutes public disclosure of allegations in an appropriate government investigation setting under e a and thus bars the action.
analysis of e a requires several inquiries whether there has been public disclosure of the allegations or transactions in the relator complaint if so,whether the public disclosure occurred in the manner specified in the statute if so,whether the relator suit is based upon those publicly disclosed allegations or transactions and if the answers to these questions are in the affirmative,whether the relator falls within the original source exception as defined in e b.we reach only the first question.our case law has not previously defined the term public disclosure.
the question here is whether made by a private party only to government agencies,without further disclosure,is public disclosure.in our view,a public disclosure requires that there be some act of disclosure to the public outside of the government.the mere fact that the disclosures are contained in government files someplace,or even that the government is conducting an investigation behind the scenes,does not itself constitute public disclosure.our construction of the term public disclosure does not turn on the fact that pfizer requested or assumed that its disclosures to the investigating agencies would be held confidential.the united states has taken the litigation position in this action that public disclosure does not include the disclosure from pfizer to the government that occurred here 
pfizer reading is inconsistent with our understanding of the language,structure,and history of the act.the plain language of the statute cuts against pfizer interpretation of the public disclosure bar for several reasons.this court has already held that the logical reading is that the public disclosure subsection serves to prohibit courts from hearing qui tam actions based on information made available to the public during the course of a government hearing,investigation or audit or from the news media.united states ex rel.leblanc raytheon,cir.what pfizer did was to make confidential disclosures to the government,which triggered an investigation.but the statute does not bar jurisdiction over qui tam actions based on disclosures of allegations or transactions to the government it does so only for actions based on qualifying disclosures made to the public.if providing information to the government were enough to trigger the bar,the phrase public disclosure would be superfluous.
pfizer reading also equates the government with the public this is inconsistent with the rest of the statute.government may be of the people,by the people,and for the people,but that does not mean the government and the public are the same.as the united states,in opposing pfizer reading,notes,the ordinary understanding of the term public means something apart from the government itself.br.for united states as amicus curiae supp.appellant see also black law dictionary ed defining public as.relating or belonging to an entire community,state,or nation.open or available for all to use,share,or enjoy.the statute itself uses the term government numerous times and does not once equate the government with the public.see,e b o riginal source means an individual who has voluntarily provided the information to the government emphasis added.see generally id.delineating rights and responsibilities of the government under the fca.if congress had wished to equate to the government with disclosure to the public,it easily could have done so.
to the extent there is any material ambiguity in the term public disclosure on these facts,we find that pfizer reading is contrary to the structure of the statute as a whole,the legislative history,and the policy objectives congress articulated at the time it enacted the language.prawer,at interpreting ambiguous provision of the fca with reference to legislative history and congressional intent.the legislative history of the statute,particularly the amendments,see false claims amendments act of,stat,shows that pfizer reading is contrary to the legislative intent in several respects.
the amendments sought to achieve the two goals of discouraging parasitic or qui tam suits while also encouraging productive private enforcement suits.springfield terminal,at.pfizer reading furthers neither purpose.
with the amendments,congress deliberately removed a previous provision that barred jurisdiction whenever the government had knowledge of the allegations or transactions in the relator complaint.the version of d provided that courts had no jurisdiction over qui tam actions based on evidence or information the government had when the action was brought.see leblanc,at.in practice,the government knowledge bar proved too restrictive of qui tam actions,resulting in of the fca.see prawer,at.thus,in,congress shifted the examination away from the information in the government possession and instead looked to whether there was public disclosure of information given to the government.congress thus changed the focus of the jurisdictional bar from evidence of fraud inside the government overcrowded file cabinets to fraud already exposed in the public domain.united states ex rel.findley employees club.
the effect of pfizer argument would be to reinstate exactly what congress government knowledge bar.it is an insufficient response to argue,as pfizer does,that the government knowledge bar created by its reading is a very limited one and applies only where the government official receiving the disclosure is the appropriate investigatory official.only one court has adopted such a reading.see united states ex rel.mathews bank of farmington,cir.we find no support in either the language or the history of the statute for such a reading.indeed,pfizer argument runs directly contrary to our reasoning in prawer,where we held that congress has explicitly deemed a notice regime insufficient to protect the government against false claims indeed it was precisely such a regime that congress sought to abandon in enacting the amendments at.
the amendments broadened the universe of potential qui tam plaintiffs,with only four exclusions enumerated in e.leblanc,at.congress amended the statute to encourage more private enforcement suits.id.quoting,at,reprinted in,internal quotation marks omitted.yet pfizer reading would create a new exclusion not articulated in the text.that is inconsistent with the second goal of encouraging productive private enforcement.
pfizer interpretation is also contrary to another legislative purpose reflected in the amendments it was the congressional intent,through the requirement of public disclosure,to help keep the government honest in its investigations and settlements with industry.once allegations are made public,the government can be forced to act by public pressure.see findley,at.
not only would pfizer argument recreate problems congress sought to eliminate in,but it fails to further congress purpose of discouraging parasitic qui tam actions.prawer,at.if information that could form the basis of a qui tam action is kept confidential and confined to a limited circle of government officials,there is no real danger that a private citizen who does not have direct and independent knowledge of that information,see e b,will bring an opportunistic qui tam suit based upon the information in the government possession 
our conclusion is also consistent with the majority view among the circuits.the tenth circuit has held the public disclosure requirement clearly contemplates that the information be in the public domain in some capacity and the government is not the equivalent of the public domain.kennard comstock,cir accord united states ex rel.schumer hughes aircraft,cir i nformation that was disclosed in private between government and defendant company has not been publicly disclosed.united states ex rel.williams nec,cir even if a government investigation was pending at the time the relator filed his qui tam complaint,such fact would not jurisdictionally bar the fca claim.see also springfield terminal,at requiring information to be in the public eye for bar to apply.
only one circuit has held that mere disclosure to the government is a public disclosure,though cabining its holding to disclosures made to appropriate investigative officials.see mathews,at.we simply disagree with mathews for the reasons already stated and as lucidly set forth in the district court opinion.see rost,d at.
two amici,industry groups for the pharmaceutical and hospital industries,argue that unless pfizer participation in hhs program and cooperation with the government are fully protected from qui tam suits by adopting pfizer reading of public disclosure,the fca reduce fraud on the be undercut.the argument is misplaced and should be addressed to congress.hhs administrative efforts at encouraging corporate disclosure and cooperation are a more recent development,see publication of the oig provider protocol,and were not the object of congress concerns in adopting the amendments.
rule b requirement 
the district court ultimately held that rost failed to plead his fraud claims with sufficient specificity under federal rule of civil procedure b.we affirm.
rule b requires that i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.the particularity requirement means that a complaint must specif
