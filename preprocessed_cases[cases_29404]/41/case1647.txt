bobby joe rylee died after an altercation with police officers in russellville,arkansas,and a period of detention in the pope county detention center.sandy krout,individually and as administratrix of rylee estate,brought an action under against five russellville police officers and four pope county correctional officers in their individual capacities.she alleged that the police officers used excessive force against rylee,in violation of the fourth amendment,and that the correctional officers deprived him of adequate medical care,in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the defendants moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,and the district court denied the motions.all nine defendants appeal.we dismiss in part for lack of jurisdiction,affirm in part,and reverse in part.
viewed in the light most favorable to krout,the relevant facts are as follows.at around on july,in russellville,arkansas,sarah lowrey walked into a gas station and asked the clerk to call the police.she said that she was driving around in a truck with a man named bobby joe rylee,and that although rylee had not threatened her,he was agitated,needed sleep,and had a knife.lowrey returned to the truck and rylee continued driving.in the meantime,the clerk called,and a police dispatcher issued a broadcast to local law enforcement concerning the situation.lee goemmer,an officer of the russellville police department rpd who was driving nearby,heard the broadcast and observed a truck that matched the dispatcher description cross the center line.goemmer signaled for the truck to pull over.rylee,who was driving the truck,drove into the parking lot of an exxon gas station,which was adjacent to a waffle house restaurant.goemmer followed behind,parked his patrol car,and ran toward rylee truck.
as goemmer approached,rylee began reversing his truck.goemmer yelled at him to stop,saying that rylee was going to back into the patrol car.rylee eventually stopped,at which point goemmer instructed him to exit the truck.rylee did not get out,so goemmer attempted to arrest him.as goemmer tried to gain control of rylee left hand,a scuffle ensued.officer bobby stevens of the rpd arrived on the scene shortly thereafter and ran toward rylee and goemmer,yelling at rylee to get on the ground.after goemmer attempted unsuccessfully to pull rylee out of the truck,stevens performed a hip toss maneuver,causing rylee,goemmer,and stevens to fall to the pavement at the same time.goemmer and stevens remained on the ground with rylee,attempting to gain control of his hands.
after the hip toss,rpd officer keith spears arrived on the scene,followed seconds later by another rpd officer,terry cobb.arkansas tech security officer greg mccuin and rpd officer todd winesburg arrived thereafter.
once rylee was on the ground and no longer resisting,several patrons and employees of the waffle house witnessed two officers assault him.harriet stone witnessed one officer knee rylee in the lower back four to six times while he was not moving,and saw another officer punch rylee five or six times in the area.jeff munhall saw one officer knee rylee in the back while a second officer punched him in the head while rylee did not move or resist.at one point,munhall saw the officer who was kneeing rylee walk away,only to return moments later and continue kicking and hitting rylee.darlene shoptaw,another waffle house witness,saw one officer drop down on rylee three or four times with his knees from a standing position,while the other officer struck him with his fist near the head area.she also saw several other police officers standing around,not doing or saying anything to stop the officers who were assaulting rylee.like shoptaw,crystal jones saw one officer punch rylee in the back while a second officer fell on him with his knees from a standing position at least three or four times.according to jones,between six and eight total officers were there while the knee drops occurred.
the altercation lasted for five minutes.when it ended,spears and mccuin lifted rylee under his arms,dragged him to cobb patrol car,and placed him in the back seat.while he was dragged,rylee was totally limp,with his head dangling and his feet not moving.winesburg opened the rear driver side door of cobb patrol car and pulled rylee into the vehicle.cobb then transported rylee to the pope county detention center.
they arrived at the detention center shortly before upon their arrival,cobb removed rylee from the patrol car and deposited him face down on the floor of the entryway,also known as the sally port.cobb left rylee in the custody of two correctional officers,chris ketcherside and kevin hill.hill and ketcherside offered to lift rylee up,but rylee said that he could not stand up,that his back and legs were broken,and that he could not feel his legs.they then picked him up and pulled him into the booking area.as they transported rylee inside,they noticed a cut on his right eye,a bump on his face,and some blood in his right ear.neither officer smelled alcohol,but hill thought rylee was on drugs.
luke sawdy,the supervisor for the midnight to shift,was in the booking area when rylee was brought inside.rylee stated that he could not stand up,and that he thought his legs were broken.sawdy briefly looked at rylee from ten feet away and thought he was drunk and uncooperative for refusing to stand up.without asking rylee any questions or meaningfully examining him,sawdy instructed hill and ketcherside to put rylee in an isolation cell,and to check on him every fifteen minutes.hill and ketcherside took rylee to the cell,removed his handcuffs,and left him lying on the floor on his stomach.rylee stated that his back was hurting,but when ketcherside asked him if he wanted to see a doctor,rylee said no.
fifteen minutes later,per sawdy orders,ketcherside returned to the cell to check on rylee,who was still lying in the same position.ketcherside asked him how he was feeling,and rylee responded that he was doing fine.ketcherside returned fifteen minutes later and again saw rylee in the same position.ketcherside asked rylee if he was feeling better,and rylee said that his arms were improving.
ketcherside continued to check on rylee every fifteen minutes afterward,each time noticing that he was lying in the same position in which he was placed fact which he relayed to sawdy.
at approximately,rpd officer spears arrived at the detention center to take photographs of rylee.spears asked rylee if he needed any medical treatment or if he wanted to go to the hospital,and rylee said no.once spears finished photographing rylee,spears suggested to sawdy that rylee be examined by emergency medical services ems personnel,who were located in the same complex as the detention center.at around,rylee was placed in a wheelchair and brought from the isolation cell to the booking area for observation.he sat in a slumped position in the wheelchair,with his head down.
a short time later,ems technicians richard haley and chris vick arrived.they examined rylee in the booking area where he was seated,and noticed an abrasion and some bruising on his face,as well as a small amount of dried blood around his right ear.rylee stated that his neck hurt,but haley did not notice anything unusual about his neck other than some minor tenderness,and did not find any abnormalities in his neuromuscular function.haley asked rylee twice if he wanted to go to a hospital,but rylee refused,stating that he was not the one who had requested medical attention.at around,haley and vick left the detention center.
at approximately,rylee,who remained slumped in the wheelchair in the booking area,asked for help to lift his head,saying that he could not do so by himself.michael floyd,a correctional officer who is not a party to this lawsuit,helped rylee reposition his neck three times so he could breathe more easily.as floyd repositioned his neck,he asked rylee if he needed help,but rylee said no.
at around,sawdy noticed that rylee was having difficulty breathing,so he asked ketcherside to help him reposition rylee neck.because rylee could not hold his neck up on his own,sawdy and ketcherside shifted his body in the wheelchair to prop up his head.this appeared to ease rylee breathing.at,the shift ended,and sawdy,hill,and ketcherside left the detention center.before departing,they noticed that rylee was conscious and breathing.chris johnston,another correctional officer,came on duty at.he was informed that there had been an altercation between police and rylee,that ems personnel had examined rylee,and that rylee did not want to go to the hospital.johnston saw rylee slumped in the wheelchair,noticed that he was breathing,and assumed that he was passed out or sleeping.about twenty minutes later,as johnston made his way to the property room,he again saw rylee breathing.
just after,however,a corporal on duty yelled out to call because rylee was not breathing.johnston called ems,and during the call,the ems dispatcher asked johnston several times if anybody at the detention center wanted to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr,and offered to guide officers through the process.johnston relayed the question to the corporal,but the corporal was afraid that no staff member was trained in cpr.thus,johnston and the staff at the detention center waited for ems personnel to arrive.
ems technicians pam logan and haley,the same technician who previously had examined rylee,initiated cpr on rylee at,just under five minutes after he was found not breathing by the corporal.when logan and haley arrived,rylee had no pulse and was in the last stages of cardiopulmonary arrest.logan and haley continued cpr,restored rylee pulse at approximately,and transported him to the hospital.rylee never regained consciousness,and he died five days later.the cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries with complications the principal factor was a neck fracture and spinal cord injury.
krout brought an action under against rpd officers goemmer,stevens,spears,cobb,and winesburg,and pope county correctional officers sawdy,hill,ketcherside,and johnston,all in their individual capacities she alleged that the rpd officers used excessive force against rylee or permitted others to use excessive force against him.she also alleged that the correctional officers deprived rylee of adequate medical care when they knew or should have known that he was in critical condition at the detention center.
all nine officers filed motions for summary judgment,but the district court concluded that none was entitled to qualified immunity,and denied the motions.the district court analyzed krout excessive force claim under the fourth amendment.the court determined that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding who was involved,to what extent they used force,and whether the hip toss or subsequent actions taken by the officers caused rylee death.the court assessed krout claim under the eighth amendment deliberate indifference standard.the court concluded that questions of fact remained regarding rylee condition upon entry at the detention center,the extent of the officers medical screening,and the appropriateness of the officers further conduct.these and other questions,the court determined,precluded a grant of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.
ordinarily,we have no jurisdiction to hear an immediate appeal from a district court order denying summary judgment,because such an order is not a final decision.see crow montgomery,cir.we do have limited authority,however,to review the denial of qualified immunity through an interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine.johnson jones,d.our jurisdiction in such cases extends only to abstract issues of law,id.at,not to determination s that the evidence is sufficient to permit a particular finding of fact after trial.id.at.thus,a defendant entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.id.at.in this case,the district court identified few genuinely disputed facts in its order denying qualified immunity.accordingly,to resolve some aspects of the appeals,we must undertake a cumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,likely assumed.id.at.
qualified immunity shields a government official from liability when his conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.to determine whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,we ask whether the facts alleged or shown,construed in the light most favorable to krout,establish a violation of a constitutional or statutory right,and whether that constitutional right was clearly established as of july,such that a reasonable official would have known that his actions were unlawful.see pearson callahan,d see also saucier katz,d,overruled in part on other grounds by pearson.at.unless the answer to both of these questions is yes,the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.we review a district court qualified immunity determination on summary judgment de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to krout and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.howard kansas city police dep t,cir.
we consider first the claims of the rpd officers,starting with goemmer and stevens.their sole argument on appeal is that rylee death was caused by the hip toss,and not by any of the punches or blows allegedly administered by goemmer and stevens after rylee was on the ground.they further contend that the hip toss was an objectively reasonable use of force under the fourth amendment,and that they are entitled to qualified immunity on that basis.
the district court ruled that genuine issues of material fact remained as to what caused rylee maneuver or subsequent actions of the city officers.in miller schoenen,cir,this court explained that if the issues raised on appeal relate to whether the actor actually committed the act of which he is accused,or damages,or causation,or other similar matters that the plaintiff must prove,we have no jurisdiction to review them in an interlocutory appeal of a denial of a motion based on qualified immunity.id.at emphasis added.in pool sebastian county,cir,we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction that portion of a qualified immunity appeal in which the defendants argued that there was no proof that they proximately caused any compensatory damages.id.at.in view of these authorities,which apply the supreme court direction in johnson jones,we lack jurisdiction to review the contention of goemmer and stevens that there is insufficient evidence of causation to hold them liable for rylee death.
the next three officers,spears,cobb,and winesburg,argue that only two officers allegedly struck rylee after he was taken to the ground,and there is no evidence that any of them ever administered force against him.our review of the record discloses one witness who averred that two or three officers participated in striking rylee,although the identity of the officers involved is not clear.we need not resolve whether spears,cobb,and winesburg should remain in the lawsuit based solely on allegations of striking rylee.krout advances an alternative theory that these officers violated rylee fourth amendment rights by failing to intervene to stop the allegedly unconstitutional use of force.on this point,we conclude that the record supports the district court denial of qualified immunity for spears,cobb,and winesburg 
as of july,it was clearly established that a state actor may be liable for an unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment if he fails to intervene to prevent the unconstitutional use of excessive force by another official.in putman gerloff,cir,this court held that a prison guard could be liable under if he was present and saw another correctional officer hit an inmate several times with a gun,but did nothing to stop the assault.id.at.the court quoted byrd brishke,cir,for the proposition that one who is given the badge of authority of a police officer may not ignore the duty imposed by his office and fail to stop other officers who summarily punish a third person in his presence or otherwise within his knowledge.id.at.this duty of a police officer to intervene to prevent the excessive use of the officer is aware of the abuse and the duration of the episode is sufficient to permit an inference of tacit also recognized in numerous appellate decisions as of,without any serious dispute from other quarters.see,cir priester city of riviera beach,cir ensley soper,cir mick brewer,cir gaudreault municipality of salem,cir per curiam krzeminski,cir bruner dunaway,cir per curiam.other decisions from this circuit have applied the general proposition in various contexts.see williams mueller,cir buckner hollins,cir arnold jones,cir webb hiykel,cir.
taking the facts in the light most favorable to krout,the evidence supports a finding that spears,cobb,and winesburg violated rylee clearly established rights under the fourth amendment by failing to intervene when they had a duty and opportunity to do so.there is a submissible case that other officers used excessive force against rylee.waffle house witnesses testified that while rylee was on the,and no longer officers kicked and punched him several times.according to shoptaw and jones,one officer forcefully dropped down on rylee back from a standing position three or four times,while a second officer punched him in the back or head area with his fist.according to stone,one officer kneed him in the lower back four to six times while another officer punched him five or six times in the area.and according to munhall,one officer kneed him in the back while a second officer punched him in the head area.it was clearly established that the use of this type of gratuitous force against a suspect who is handcuffed,not resisting,and fully subdued is objectively unreasonable under the fourth amendment.see henderson munn,cir phelps coy,cir.
there is also evidence from which a jury could find that spears,cobb,and winesburg observed this use of excessive force and had an adequate opportunity to intervene and stop it,but unreasonably failed to do so.while rylee was punched and kicked,jones recalled seeing between six and eight officers at the scene,and shoptaw observed several officers standing around,not saying or doing anything to stop the attack.all three officers admit that they were on the scene at various times during the incident,and a reasonable jury could thus conclude that they were among the six to eight or several officers who were observed by the witnesses.
shoptaw testified that the assault lasted for a good five minutes,a period which a jury could find sufficient to afford the onlooking officers an opportunity to intervene.the assault lasted for at least as long as it took munhall,who observed the two officers kicking and punching rylee from inside the restaurant,to conclude that the officers were going overboard,to run outside to try to get some badge numbers,and to continue watching until the assault stopped.there was sufficient time for shoptaw,who was seated at a booth inside,to learn from a friend that a fight was ongoing,to turn around to see the two officers kneeing and punching rylee,to stand up from the booth,and to sit back down after determining that she had a better view from the booth.based on these facts,a jury reasonably could find that spears,cobb,and winesburg violated rylee clearly established rights by failing to intervene and stop the ongoing assault.accordingly,they are not entitled to qualified immunity on krout fourth amendment claim.
we turn finally to the claims of the four pope county correctional officers sawdy,hill,ketcherside,and johnston.they argue that even accepting the facts likely assumed by the district court regarding rylee medical care,they did not violate rylee clearly established rights under the fourteenth amendment.specifically,they claim that they did not act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of physical harm,because they took affirmative action in response to his medical needs.they also contend that even if we assume sufficient evidence to establish a violation of rylee constitutional right,they are entitled to qualified immunity.pearson.at.we have jurisdiction to review these abstract issue s of law relating to qualified immunity.behrens,at.quoting johnson,at.
deliberate indifference to an inmate serious medical needs violates the eighth amendment ban against cruel and unusual punishments.farmer brennan,d.the eighth amendment does not govern the treatment of pretrial detainees like rylee,but under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,deliberate indifference is the appropriate standard of culpability for all claims that prison officials failed to provide pretrial detainees with adequate medical care.hartsfield colburn,cir internal quotation omitted.
to establish deliberate indifference,krout must show that rylee suffered from one or more objectively serious medical needs,and that the correctional officers acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind,farmer,at.internal quotation omitted,namely,that they actually knew of,but deliberately disregarded,rylee medical needs.id.at.hartsfield,at butler fletcher,cir.under this subjective prong,the evidence must show that the officers recognized that a substantial risk of harm existed and knew that their conduct was inappropriate in light of that risk.rich bruce,cir see gregoire class,cir.
the showing of actual knowledge is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways,including inference from circumstantial evidence.farmer,at.thus,a factfinder may conclude that an officer knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.id.but i t is not enough merely to find that a reasonable person would have known about the risk,or that the officer should have known about the risk.id.at.similarly,the obvious inadequacy of a response to a risk may support an inference that the officer recognized the inappropriateness of his conduct.
even if krout satisfies the subjective awareness prong,the officers may be found free from liability if they responded reasonably to the risk,even if the harm ultimately was not averted.farmer,at.it does not follow,however,that an unreasonable,a negligent sufficient to establish liability.even if an official acts unreasonably in failing to take particular measures to improve conditions at a jail facility,for example,reasonableness is a negligence standard,and negligence can not give rise to a deliberate indifference claim.crow,at internal quotation omitted see gregoire,at.in the context of medical care,d eliberate indifference may include intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care,or intentionally interfering with treatment or medication that has been prescribed,but a showing of deliberate indifference is greater than gross negligence and requires more than mere disagreement with treatment decisions.pietrafeso lawrence county,cir internal quotations and brackets omitted.the plaintiff must show that the officers were deliberately indifferent in their response to the perceived risk.see hare city of corinth,cir en banc we reject the suggestion that the proper measure of the duty to respond of persons with the requisite knowledge ought to revisit negligence.under that view,negligence tossed out the front door through the back.
krout argues that rylee suffered from several objectively serious medical needs.she contends that he could not walk or feel his legs,that he had abrasions on his face and ear,and that later in the morning,he had difficulties breathing and could not hold his head upright on his own.krout asserts that notwithstanding these objectively serious medical needs,sawdy,hill,and ketcherside placed rylee in an isolation cell without assessing his condition,and failed to call medical personnel when his breathing became noticeably worse later in the morning.as for johnston,who came on shift at,krout contends that he too ignored rylee breathing problems,and that after rylee was found not breathing,he declined to perform cpr,even though the ems dispatcher offered to guide him through the process.
we assume for purposes o
