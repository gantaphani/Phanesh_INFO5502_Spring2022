john baucom,baucom,sued his employer,holiday companies and holiday stationstores,holiday,for discrimination,retaliation,and hostile work environment under the americans with disabilities act ada,a,the age discrimination in employment act adea,a,and the equivalent minnesota statute,the minnesota human rights act mhra,subd.c.the district court granted holiday motion for summary judgment,and baucom appeals the decision except with regard to his hostile work environment claim.because baucom failed to show his slight reduction in hours,his negative performance reviews,and his allegations of being treated differently than younger employees amounted to adverse employment actions as a matter of law,we affirm the district court.
background 
the facts relevant to this appeal are as follows baucom,a man who suffers from chronic back and heart problems,is an assistant manager at a convenience store owned by holiday.baucom alleges his store manager,at the direction of holiday district manager,cut baucom working hours in from his regular hours per week range.the district manager allegedly told the store manager baucom age and health were a hindrance,and the store manager should reduce baucom hours in order to force baucom to quit.baucom complained about his hours upon returning from a vacation in october,and holiday temporarily restored his hours in november.baucom alleges his hours again were reduced throughout to consistently less than hours per week.
in late and early,baucom store manager called baucom a slow old man and said his grandmother could move faster and she has been dead for over seven years.baucom overheard his store manager telling other employees,because of baucom age and disability,he wanted to find a way to make baucom quit.the store manager changed baucom schedule from working mornings with sundays off to working evenings and weekends.the store manager also sent baucom an message criticizing his performance.
on may,baucom filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission and the minnesota department of human rights alleging age and disability discrimination.four days later,holiday gave baucom four corrective action notices for events from earlier dates in.holiday also informed baucom he had failed a tobacco sting when he neglected to request identification from a young person purchasing tobacco,and as a result,baucom had to undergo remedial training.baucom alleges the district manager often had telephoned other employees to warn them of impending sting operations.in august,holiday gave baucom another corrective action notice for failing to provide adequate documentation for medically related work absences.baucom alleges he had provided adequate notice.
on october,baucom served holiday with his complaint initiating this lawsuit.in november,baucom store manager reviewed baucom performance and rated him below standard.following additional training,the store manager noted improvement and granted baucom a pay raise.baucom remains in holiday employ.
ii.discussion 
our standard for reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment is a familiar one.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.mclaughlin esselte pendaflex,cir.we will affirm the summary judgment if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to baucom,demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and holiday is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.there is no genuine issue of material fact if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for baucom.anderson liberty lobby,d.baucom may not rely on mere allegations,but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.furthermore,summary judgment must be entered against baucom if he fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to his case,and on which he bear s the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,d.
without direct evidence of discrimination,ada,adea,and mhra claims are evaluated under the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting framework.mcdonnell douglas green,d chambers metro.prop.cas.ins,cir longen waterous,cir.under this framework,the employee bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at.the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employer actions.id.if the employer articulates such a reason,the burden returns to the employee to show the employer justification is a pretext.id.at.
under the ada,adea,and mhra,a necessary element of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination is setting forth facts demonstrating the employee suffered an adverse employment action.chambers,at longen,at.an employee suffers an adverse employment action when there is a tangible change in duties or working conditions constituting a material employment disadvantage.burchett target,cir citation omitted.our decision in kerns capital graphics,cir,provides 
the adverse employment action must be one that produces a material employment disadvantage.termination,cuts in pay or benefits,and changes that affect an employee future career prospects are significant enough to meet the standard,as would circumstances amounting to a constructive discharge.minor changes in duties or working conditions that cause no materially significant disadvantage do not meet the standard of an adverse employment action,however.

baucom argues his hours were cut in and from his normal hours per week range to hours now consistently less than hours per week,resulting,because of overtime pay baucom was earning for his hours worked over per week,in a cut in take home pay.baucom argument fails for two reasons.first,baucom fails to set forth any facts demonstrating holiday decreased his hours rather than baucom himself decreasing them as a result of his voluntarily taking vacation and sick leave.second,even if such facts were present in the record,the slight decrease in hours does not constitute as a matter of law an adverse employment action,because the decrease did not produce a material employment disadvantage.
the record regarding baucom average hours worked in and shows a fluctuating schedule with a slight overall decreasing trend.the trend shows neither a break point when baucom had been working over hours then suddenly he began working significantly less than,nor does it show a steady decrease over the two years.rather,the data reflects a normal retail employee schedule,with many peaks and valleys and rarely the same hours worked in consecutive weeks.baucom hours worked per week in august and september are indicative of this fluctuation.by comparison,the months of march and april,before baucom relevant claim period,show similar fluctuation.
holiday asserts,and baucom does not deny,baucom took several medically related absences in,including instances in february,april,may,september,and october.these absences account for most of the valleys in baucom hours and explain the slight overall average decrease.holiday also explains it instituted a company wide policy to decrease labor costs affecting all employees,including baucom.these two explanations best fit in the second step in the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis holiday legitimate nondiscrimatory reasons for baucom decreased hours nevertheless,they do illuminate the muddled record regarding baucom average hours worked.see united states postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d the prima facie case method established in mcdonnell douglas was never intended to be rigid,mechanized,or ritualistic.rather,it is merely a sensible,orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.internal quotations omitted.on this limited record,we can not conclude baucom has met his burden of setting forth specific facts demonstrating he suffered an adverse employment action.
even if baucom could set forth facts demonstrating holiday decreased his hours,the slight decrease is not materially significant.see
