marilyn brosnahan appeals the district court order affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits.in her july application,brosnahan alleged disability since april from a back injury,fibromyalgia fatigue,and depression,irritability,and concentration and sleeping difficulties.the issues on appeal are whether brosnahan is disabled under the listing for affective disorders,see pt,subpt.p,app,the administrative law judge alj properly discounted the opinion of a psychologist about brosnahan residual functional capacity,and the alj credibility findings are supported by substantial evidence.we reverse as to the issue of credibility findings.
according to brosnahan testimony at a may administrative hearing,she was almost and had earned a ged.she had last worked in april as a provider,although she had had pain since a june job injury.by the time of the hearing she had widespread pain,stiffness and soreness,depression,memory and concentration problems,problems using her arms and hands,insomnia,and fatigue her symptoms varied in frequency and intensity.her medications included two analgesics,which she used according to her pain level,and two antidepressants she believed they had caused her to have problems with vision,to lose her balance,and to feel dopey.
brosnahan further testified that her functional ability was unpredictable.she had perhaps twenty good days a month.occasionally,on bad days,she could get out of bed only to use the bathroom and to take medicine.she napped several hours most days,and she drove some,although at times she had to pull over to rest or to have someone else drive.she tried to get out of the house,but at times her fatigue,pain,and weakness had caused her to cancel two doctor appointments,after which she had hesitated to reschedule.she liked being around people,and had taken a trip,but if she did not feel well she wanted to be alone.she tried to walk each day,and had on occasion walked two miles without resting.she also had used a treadmill and exercise bike,but after doing so for a couple of days she ended up in bed.her family helped with household chores she had problems reaching and bending,and it bothered her to lift even thirteen pounds.however,she did cook simple meals,grocery shop and vacuum a little,and she did do dishes and laundry when she could.although she had asked her doctors in if she could try using her lawn mower,and she had tried to do so,she stopped after mowing only for a little while.
the medical records reflect that in june,brosnahan reported to an internist that she suffered shoulder and back pain after lifting a client.despite prescription medications,injections,and physical therapy,brosnahan continued to complain of back pain,which had worsened by the time she quit her job in april.throughout brosnahan continued to seek care for her back pain from the internist and from rehabilitation specialist brett lawlor.she twice reported an inability to cope with her pain,and she also reported sleep dysfunction,swelling in her back,and anxiety.the physicians found multiple tender areas and spasms,and after an mri showed minimal disk problems,the physicians diagnosed fibromyalgia,for which they prescribed physical therapy,exercise,a nonsteroidal,antidepressants,and counseling.meanwhile,in fall brosnahan saw a psychologist for pain management he diagnosed adjustment disorder with depressive features.
in january brosnahan first saw rheumatologist james englebrecht,who noted blood tests for arthritis had been normal,found multiple consistent and reproducible tender points,and prescribed a different.brosnahan also underwent a functional capacity evaluation fce,which indicated that she could occasionally bend,stoop,squat,climb,crouch,and kneel could frequently balance,walk long distances,and crawl could sit for four to five hours,and stand for four hours at forty to intervals and could walk for five to six hours.the lifting,carrying,pushing,and pulling restrictions were up to pounds occasionally and up to pounds frequently,and brosnahan was limited to using her upper extremities in hourly intervals for a total.lawlor,who was treating brosnahan for her mechanical pain,opined that the fce findings were appropriate,noting they were not related to her fibromyalgia,which could cause more marked limitations.
about monthly during the remainder of,brosnahan saw englebrecht for fibromyalgia and lawlor,reporting at times some improvement and at times a of pain,fatigue,joint stiffness,aching,and variable sleep patterns,as well as medication ineffectiveness.medication changes were made twice due to gastrointestinal symptoms.in august englebrecht noted clinical control of the fibromyalgia,despite finding multiple tender points.brosnahan counsel sent her to psychologist leslie fiferman and to a rehabilitation consultant.based on testing,a examination,and interviews,fiferman assessed to average intelligence social withdrawal some memory,attention,concentration,and problems mild anxiety and mildly impaired judgment and insight.she diagnosed recurrent and severe major depression,and dementia from chronic pain syndrome.fiferman opined brosnahan was moderately to severely disabled,as her emotional function was moderately to severely impaired,and her cognitive and social functions were moderately impaired.assessing anxiety,depression,concentration and attention difficulties,and pain behaviors,the rehabilitation specialist opined that brosnahan was limited to,insubstantial,or sporadic employment due to her physical inability to work consistently.
social security administration physicians and psychologists determined,based on august and october record reviews,that brosnahan mental impairments were not severe,and that she could lift,carry,push,or pull twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently could sit,stand,or walk six hours in a workday and could occasionally climb,balance,stoop,kneel,crouch,or crawl.in december englebrecht noted that increasing exercise within the fce restrictions would help brosnahan fibromyalgia the most.
in brosnahan saw englebrecht twice and lawlor once,and she had a diagnostic test in september which indicated that an intervertebral disk was not the source of her pain.in april brosnahan reported increased generalized discomfort and sleeping difficulties,and englebrecht found more tender points and encouraged exercise.in august brosnahan told lawlor her comfort varied and her medications were reasonably effective,but her pain had increased after a long walk.that same month,englebrecht found her persistent fibromyalgia under control,but noted decreased energy.
in brosnahan complained to englebrecht in january of the unpredictability and variability of her achiness,stiffness,and fatigue.he nevertheless found she was doing reasonably well considering the gravity of her condition.in april lawlor noted brosnahan mechanical pain had resolved but she had developed tendonitis in her shoulder after falling.brosnahan told him she was not taking medication regularly and she was exercising more.fiferman conducted additional tests in june which revealed scores in the fifth to percentile on thirteen areas,and moderate to severe depression.she recommended psychotherapy as she had in august,and opined that brosnahan was unemployable as her symptoms worsened unpredictably,and that while her impairments in memory and most other psychological areas were mild to moderate,impairments in most of her remaining functional domains were moderate to severe.
at the hearing,the alj posed the following hypothetical to a vocational expert ve.he described a claimant of brosnahan age and education who could perform light or sedentary work with the following limitations and capabilities postural shifts only occasional stooping,crouching,and repetitive movement,but frequent interaction with others,and frequent grasping requiring fine dexterity no climbing,balancing,twisting,kneeling,driving,or crawling no exposure to heights,dangerous machinery,or temperature extremes and moderate ability to function satisfactorily restrictions in attention,concentration,and capacity to follow work rules.the ve opined such a claimant could work a
