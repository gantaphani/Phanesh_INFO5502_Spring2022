this suit arose in accordance with the provisions of the act,codified at e and j.the patent at issue is united states patent the patent,owned by and related companies collectively sanofi,and covers the pharmaceutical product having the common name clopidogrel bisulfate and the brand name plavix.the product has the property of inhibiting the aggregation of blood platelets,and is used to treat or prevent events such as heart attacks and strokes.we affirm the district court ruling sustaining patent validity.
background 
clopidogrel is the common name of the dextrorotatory isomer of the chemical compound named methyl thienopyridyl acetate.claim of the patent is in suit 
hydrogen sulfate of the isomer of methyl thienopyridyl acetate substantially separated from the isomer.
the patent was issued on july,with priority from an application first filed in france in.approval of the product by the united states food and drug administration fda was received in.
apotex,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda in november for fda approval to sell clopidogrel bisulfate,stating,pursuant to j a vii iv,that it believed the patent to be invalid.such paragraph iv certification is defined as an act of infringement for litigation purposes,e,in order to facilitate legal challenge by the producer of a generic form of a patented pharmaceutical product.in accordance with the statutory procedures sanofi duly filed suit for infringement,and apotex counterclaimed that the patent is invalid on several grounds and unenforceable.the suit initiated a stay of fda approval of apotex anda,as provided by j b iii.a proposed settlement was not achieved,the statutory stay expired,the fda approved the apotex anda,and apotex commenced sale of its generic clopidogrel bisulfate product on august.sanofi then moved in the district court for a preliminary injunction,asking that apotex be enjoined from marketing its infringing product while the litigation was pending,noting that infringement was conceded by apotex.
the district court found that sanofi was likely to succeed on the merits of the validity and enforceability of the patent,and that the equitable factors of the balance of harms,the probability of irreparable harm,and the various public interests,favored granting the injunction.apotex,d,sanofi i.this court affirmed the district court rulings,while explaining that the record on the substantive issues was necessarily incomplete and that the district court could review all aspects at trial.see apotex,sanofi ii holding that the patentee was likely to succeed on the merits,and that the balance of hardships and public interest supported the injunction.a bench trial was held from january to february,following which the district court ruled that the patent is valid and enforceable.apotex,d,sanofi iii.
this appeal is focused on the question of patentability of this dextrorotatory isomer in view of its known racemate described in earlier sanofi patents,specifically,sanofi united states patent the patent and canadian patent the patent.both reference patents are derived from the same french priority filing and are prior art against the patent.
the activities that led to the product in suit are discussed in the earlier opinions,and are summarized as relevant herein in sanofi scientists were seeking products that might have improved properties,and in the course of this work discovered that certain compounds of the class known as thienopyridines compounds having a thiene ring fused to a pyridine ring have the property of inhibiting blood platelet aggregation.sanofi scientists,led by maffrand,pursued this direction of research.the record states that they initially synthesized and evaluated several hundred chemical modifications and derivatives of thienopyridines,seeking optimum aggregation properties with minimal undesirable effects.they eventually selected for development the compound having the following structural formula 
sanofi gave this compound the common name ticlopidine.after lengthy development,including animal and human trials,in ticlopidine was approved in the united states for use as an agent.this approval,however,was accompanied by required warnings concerning possible adverse effects,for reports had been received of rarely occurring but serious blood disorders,neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,associated with prolonged usage of ticlopidine.thus sanofi continued its search for a product that would have the therapeutic benefits of ticlopidine but without the adverse properties.
sanofi synthesized and evaluated several hundred additional thienopyridine derivatives,including a class of compounds having the following general structure,wherein one of the hydrogen atoms on the bridge carbon atom marked with an asterisk,is replaced with an ester,carboxylic acid,or amide group.this class is the subject of the patent and the counterpart canadian patent,and is shown as follows 
x and y can be any of a number of substituents,as identified in the patents the district court found that there are possibilities for x and choices for y.the patents state that compounds of this class exhibit good aggregation properties and are well tolerated.focusing on the patent,the specification includes examples of specific compounds,including a compound designated as pcr,which sanofi synthesized in july.in pcr the substituent attached to the bridge carbon is the methyl ester group,and x is chlorine in the,as follows 
this compound has the chemical name methyl thieno pyridyl acetate,with the acronym mattpca.pcr as the hydrochloride salt was selected for commercial development as a potential replacement for ticlopidine in light of its improved platelet inhibition and toxicity profile.
however,pcr still raised toxicity concerns,for at very high doses it caused convulsions in laboratory animals.thus the research efforts continued,concurrently with the clinical and commercial development of pcr.sanofi states that about compounds in this general class were synthesized,of which about,including pcr,were chiral thienopyridines.chiral is defined as describ ing asymmetric molecules that are mirror images of each other,they are related like right and left hands.such molecules are also called enantiomers and are characterized by optical activity.richard lewis,hawley condensed chemical dictionary ed.
enantiomers are spatial isomers,also called stereoisomers,wherein the isomeric compounds have the same chemical formula and the same chemical structure,but differ in their orientation in space.such stereoisomers can exist for all molecules that contain an asymmetric carbon atom.an asymmetric carbon is a carbon atom to which four different substituents are attached,whereby,due to the tetrahedral structure of carbon bonds in three dimensions,the spatial orientation of substituents attached to a carbon atom varies.when there is only one asymmetric carbon atom in the molecule and thus only two stereoisomers,these isomers are called enantiomers.
enantiomers are identified and distinguished by their optical characteristics when a purified solution of the separated isomers is exposed to light.one enantiomer will rotate light to the right and thus is called the dextrorotatory or d or isomer,and the other rotates light to the left called the levorotatory or l or isomer.for the compounds here at issue,the asymmetric carbon is at the bridge between the thienopyridine and the benzene components of the molecule,as marked with an asterisk in the drawings shown ante.enantiomers generally are formed in equal amounts,to produce what is called a racemate the racemate is optically neutral.
in the district court,experts for both sides explained the difficulty of separating enantiomers,for they are identical except for the spatial arrangement at one of the carbon atoms.sanofi scientists had previously separated the enantiomers of two thienopyridines,and had found that the separated enantiomers showed no advantage over the racemates.the first such separation was conducted in for a compound designated pcr,which had a methyl group in place of one of the hydrogen atoms on the bridge carbon of ticlopidine,and whose maleate salt was found to be more potent than ticlopidine in antiplatelet activity but had undesirable side effects.on separation,it was found that one of the enantiomers of pcr was more biologically active but also more neurotoxic than the racemate.thus,separation offered no benefit for pcr.
about three years later,sanofi separated the enantiomers of a compound designated pcr,which had an ethyl group on the bridge carbon,and was more effective in antiplatelet activity than ticlopidine.however,neither of the separated enantiomers differed in activity from the racemate,and thus separation offered no benefit for pcr.sanofi witnesses testified to their belief that there was no advantage to separation of the enantiomers of thienopyridines,and no other racemates were separated until,in november,maffrand decided to study the enantiomers of pcr.
the separation for pcr was assigned to alain badorc,the chemist who had separated the enantiomers of pcr and.it was explained in the district court that such separations are complex and,for enantiomers are identical except for the spatial orientation about one carbon atom,and tend to have identical or almost identical chemical and physical properties.the district court received testimony that although the chemical literature shows at least ten separation techniques that might be tried,it can not be known in advance which,if any,technique might work.
the record shows five months of experimentation by badorc,and eventually the successful separation using a technique called diastereomeric salt formation.this procedure,which originated with louis pasteur,is based on the trial of diverse compositions and conditions,in the hope of coming upon a lucky combination of reagents that will preferentially select one of the enantiomers and crystallize from the solution in optically pure form.in badorc successful experiment,he prepared thirty compositions of pcr and various resolving acids at various concentrations and in various solvents,and after about one month crystals formed in the composition containing camphorsulfonic acid and pcr in a ratio,dissolved in acetone.this combination eventually yielded the pure levorotatory enantiomer,and isolation of the pure dextrorotatory enantiomer followed,as discussed by the district court in sanofi iii,d at.
sanofi then determined the biological properties of the enantiomers of pcr,and found that they had the rare characteristic of absolute stereoselectivity the dextrorotatory enantiomer provided all of the favorable antiplatelet activity but with no significant neurotoxicity,while the levorotatory enantiomer produced no antiplatelet activity but virtually all of the neurotoxicity.the experts for both sides agreed that while it was generally known that enantiomers can exhibit different biological activity,this degree and kind of stereoselectivity is rare,and could not have been predicted.the experts explained that in the usual case,if one enantiomer is more biologically active than the other,that activity includes the adverse as well as the beneficial properties.
in view of these results,in april sanofi terminated commercial development of the racemate pcr,which had been proceeding since and had reached phase i human trials at a cost stated to be tens of millions of dollars.more years of development ensued for the dextrorotatory enantiomer,to which sanofi gave the common name clopidogrel.sanofi also found that the hydrochloride salt,which had been suitable for processing and tabletting the racemate prc,was not suitable for clopidogrel.after further research,sanofi found that the hydrogen sulfate salt also called the bisulfate was suitable for tabletting.fda approval of clopidogrel bisulfate was achieved in the united states in,allowing introduction of the product plavix.
sanofi filed a patent application directed to clopidogrel and certain salts and pharmaceutical compositions,in france on february,and then in the united states and other countries.the united states patent is the patent in suit.the specification explains that the racemate of the same chemical formula was described in the earlier french patent,which corresponds to the earlier patent.the patent discusses the unusual stereoselectivity of the biological properties as between the dextrorotatory and the levorotatory enantiomers.the united states patent examiner,who had also examined the patent,allowed the claims after requiring that the claims make clear that the dextro and levoenantiomers are substantially separated.
apotex stipulated that claim of the patent is literally infringed by its product.the district court,after full trial including extensive expert testimony provided by both sides,ruled that claim is valid and enforceable.apotex appeals the court rulings on the issues of anticipation and obviousness the rulings in sanofi favor on the issues of unenforceability and double patenting are not appealed.
anticipation 
claimed subject matter is anticipated when it is not new that is,when it was previously known.invalidation on this ground requires that every element and limitation of the claim was previously described in a single prior art reference,either expressly or inherently,so as to place a person of ordinary skill in possession of the invention.see schering geneva,continental can.usa monsanto.an anticipating reference must be enabling that is,the description must be such that a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention can practice the subject matter based on the reference,without undue experimentation.see amgen hoechst marion roussel,elan,mayo found.for med.educ.research.anticipation is a question of fact,and the district court finding of this issue is reviewed for clear error.see merck teva pharms.usa.
the district court identified the limitations stated in claim of the patent as the bisulfate salt of the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the compound mattpca substantially separated from the levorotatory enantiomer.the references on which apotex relied were the patent or its canadian counterpart.apotex argued that either reference not only shows the racemate pcr,but also its addition salts and enantiomeric forms.the district court discussed that these references show pcr only as the racemate,and do not show the separated enantiomer or the bisulfate salt thereof.the district court found that although the racemate is in the prior art,the dextrorotatory enantiomer and salt in claim of the patent are not described,either explicitly or inherently,in any reference.
the court heard expert witnesses for both sides,who agreed that persons of ordinary skill in this field would have known that compounds that contain an asymmetric carbon atom have enantiomers.the specification states these compounds having an asymmetrical carbon may exist in the form of two enantiomers.the invention relates both to each enantiomer and their mixture.patent,lines.however,as the witnesses agreed,all of the compounds in the patent are racemates,and neither the specific examples nor any other part of the specification shows their separation into enantiomers.the district court reasoned that a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention would not have been guided to either the dextrorotatory enantiomer of pcr or its bisulfate salt.
apotex argues that the district court erred in law,and that it suffices that the reference shows the specific racemate pcr and states that the compounds in the reference have enantiomers and that the enantiomers are included in the invention.apotex states that the separation of enantiomers is routine,even if or requiring some experimentation,and thus that that the separation need not have been performed or described in the reference.apotex states that the properties of the enantiomers of pcr are inherently and necessarily present in its known racemate,such that when the enantiomers are separated the previously observed properties are immediately recognized in one or the other enantiomer.
apotex stresses that the patent example is specific to pcr,and the claims refer to addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids and both enantiomeric forms or their mixture.the counterpart canadian patent states that when the desired structure is obtained it is isolated and,if desired,its enantiomers are separated it is salified by mineral or organic acid action.apotex concedes that the references do not show any separated enantiomers or describe how to separate them,but argues that such detail is not required because persons of ordinary skill would know the existing techniques for separating enantiomers.
apotex thus argues that the dextrorotatory enantiomer of mattpca can not be deemed novel,as a matter of law.however,as the district court recognized,that is not the correct view of the law of anticipation,which requires the specific description as well as enablement of the subject matter at issue.to anticipate,the reference must not only disclose all elements of the claim within the four corners of the document,but must also disclose those elements arranged as in the claim.net moneyin,verisign,quoting connell sears,roebuck,see also,in re arkley,the reference must clearly and unequivocally disclose the claimed invention or direct those skilled in the art to the invention without any need for picking,choosing,and combining various disclosures not directly related to each other by the teachings of the cited reference emphasis in original.
the district court analyzed the question as whether a generic disclosure necessarily anticipates everything within the genus,and recognized that the answer depends on the factual aspects of the specific disclosure and the particular products at issue.see,atofina great lakes chem,it is well established that the disclosure of a genus in the prior art is not necessarily a disclosure of every species that is a member of that genus.in in re ruschig,the court declined to find the disclosed genus anticipatory of everything within its scope,when the description of the genus would not lead a person of ordinary skill to a small recognizable class with common properties.in this case the district court correctly declined to find that the references general statements that these compounds consist of enantiomers constituted an anticipating disclosure of the separated dextrorotatory enantiomer of pcr.
the district court discussed the cases on which apotex particularly relied in re petering,and in re schaumann,ccpa.the court pointed out that in petering and schaumann the generic disclosure in the reference identified specific preferences,which were met by the species.we discern no clear error in the district court finding that the references herein contained no such specific preferences.pcr is shown in the references as one of several compounds with desirable biological properties,but the district court did not clearly err in finding that the reference disclosure would not have led one of ordinary skill to recognize either an explicit or an inherent disclosure of its dextrorotatory enantiomer,as well as the bisulfate salt.
apotex also relies on in re adamson,where the court held that although the reference did not state that the disclosed compound was a racemate,it would have been known to one of ordinary skill that synthetically produced chiral compounds are racemic.sanofi does not dispute this statement of stereochemistry,but points out that knowledge of the existence of enantiomers is not a description of a specific enantiomer substantially separated from the other,as in claim of the patent.the district court cited in re may,ccpa,which is explicit that the novelty of an optical isomer is not negated by the prior art disclosure of its racemate.id.at.also,adamson and may were addressing rejections for obviousness,and neither case stated or suggested a previously unseparated and unknown enantiomer might be deemed anticipated by the known racemate.
the district court did not clearly err in finding that the statements in the patent and its canadian counterpart that the products therein consist of enantiomers are not a description of the specific dextrorotatory enantiomer clopidogrel or a suggestion of its unusual stereospecific properties.the knowledge that enantiomers may be separated is not anticipation of a specific enantiomer that has not been separated,identified,and characterized.the district court correctly held that neither the patent nor its canadian counterpart contains an anticipating disclosure of the subject matter of claim of the patent.
the parties also debated the question of enablement with respect to anticipation.the district court found that the asserted references are not enabling,for they contain no guidance as to how to separate the enantiomers of pcr.based on the evidence adduced at trial,the court concluded that absent such guidance,undue experimentation would be required.
apotex argues that it is entitled to a presumption of enablement because the asserted references are patents,which are presumed to be enabling because they are presumed valid,citing amgen hoechst marion roussel,we hold that an accused infringer should be similarly entitled to have the district court presume the enablement of unclaimed and claimed material in a prior art patent defendant asserts against a plaintiff.apotex argues that the presumption should be particularly strong here,because the prior art patents belong to sanofi.thus apotex argues that the general statements in the reference patents concerning enantiomers are presumptively enabling of the separate enantiomers of pcr.apotex states that it is irrelevant whether the separation of this specific enantiomer is shown in the references,because a person of ordinary skill in this field would know all of the existing techniques for separating stereoisomers,and would presumptively succeed in this particular separation.apotex points out that the method that was eventually used by sanofi was a method,even if it involved some experimentation.
any presumption of enablement of prior art does not exclude consideration of whether undue experimentation would be required to achieve enablement.see,elan pharms,at the reference must teach how to carry out the invention without undue experimentation.the factors relevant to whether experimentation is undue are discussed in,in re wands,and include the quantity of experimentation that was actually needed,the amount of guidance provided in the reference,the presence or absence of actual examples of the experimental procedure,the state of the knowledge already available concerning the subject matter at issue,and the predictability or unpredictability in the specific area of science or technology.the patent reference states only that if desired,its enantiomers are separated,and similarly for the canadian counterpart.the district court found that these references contain no description of how to separate the enantiomers of pcr,and that d iscovering which method and what combination of variables is required is sufficiently arduous and uncertain as to require undue experimentation,even by one skilled in the relevant art.sanofi iii,d at.this finding has not been shown to be clearly erroneous.in forest laboratories,ivax pharmaceuticals,this court recognized the known difficulty of separating enantiomers and the unpredictability of their properties,and held that a reference that stated that a compound has enantiomers did not enable the separation of those enantiomers,where the reference did not teach how to obtain the enantiomer.id.at.we discern no clear error in the district court finding herein that the reference patents would not have enabled a person of ordinary skill to obtain clopidogrel substantially separated from the levorotatory enantiomer.
the district court ruling that claim of the patent is not invalid for anticipation is affirmed.
obviousness 
the determination of obviousness is a matter of law based on findings of underlying fact,wherein the factors identified in graham john deere,d,guide the inquiry 
under,the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved.against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.such secondary consider
