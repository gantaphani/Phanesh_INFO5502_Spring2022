arthur dale was committed as a sexual psychopathic personality and sexually dangerous person to the custody of the minnesota sex offender program offender program.brought this action against the commissioner of the minnesota department of human services,other officials of the department,and employees of the offender program,alleging violations of federal and state law for being placed in isolation,receiving inadequate medical attention,and being retaliated against.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,and appeals.we affirm.
in was indefinitely committed as a sexual psychopathic personality and sexually dangerous person,pursuant to minnesota statute,subds,and was placed in the custody of the offender program the offender program operates at two minnesota sites,one in peter and the other in moose lake.defendant michael tessner is the chief executive officer of state operated services,the department of human services division that administers and oversees the offender program.
the offender program is responsible for providing treatment to several hundred patients in the state of minnesota who have been committed to its custody.a patient is committed to the offender program if the state district court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is a sexual psychopathic personality and sexually dangerous person evidencing an utter lack of power to control sexual impulses and who is likely to engage in acts of harmful sexual conduct,subds,subd.patients can seek release from the program by filing for provisional or full discharge to a special review board that makes recommendations to the commissioner of human services,subds.a patient aggrieved by the commissioner decision may petition a judicial appeal panel for rehearing,subd,and later the minnesota court of appeals,subd.
the offender program has promulgated minnesota sex offender program procedures to govern patients committed to its custody.if a patient is suspected of breaking a rule,an operational team of at least two staff members meets to determine whether a violation has occurred and what consequences to impose.a patient facing behavioral restrictions is permitted to attend the operational team meeting.operational teams impose level b restrictions for rule violations that do not have the potential to harm the patient or others and level a restrictions for conduct that does have the potential to cause harm.a patient on level b restrictions is restricted from walking to outer portions of the facility,visiting other rooms,purchasing outside food,or using non essential community items.patients on level a restrictions receive additional limitations on telephone calls and areas they can visit.patients can file grievances challenging the imposition of their restrictions to the unit director,patient advocate,and director.patients can also seek review by the advisory hospital review board.
the department of human resources has promulgated minnesota rule to authorize offender program staff to place patients in protective isolation as a way of defusing or containing dangerous behavior that is uncontrollable by any other means.subp.the use of protective isolation is never to be used for the convenience of staff or as a substitute for programming,and treatment must be available during protective isolation to the extent that the person behavior and condition make treatment possible.id.at subps.the rule limits protective isolation to hours unless there is a statement from a treatment team to the medical director that continued protective isolation is necessary and the medical director has consented to continued placement in protective isolation.id.at subp.a patient in protective isolation is permitted to seek review of the decision by a panel of at least three persons who were not participants in the decision to impose isolation and to request that the chief officer of the facility review the review panel decision.id.at subp.a patient is permitted to present to the review panel evidence and argument to explain why protective isolation is unwarranted.id.at subp.
the offender program has implemented its own minnesota sex offender program procedure governing the use of protective isolation.in addition to the requirements of rule,the internal procedures require that a patient receive a copy of a protective isolation assessment report within hours of being placed there,that a protective isolation review panel and clinical director approve any decision by the assessment team to keep a patient for more than hours,and that use of protective isolation for more than days must be approved by the clinical director prior to the end of each day period.patients are permitted to appeal a review panel decision to the program director who is to appoint an appeal panel consisting of two objective persons.the internal procedures also require that protective isolation be limited to consecutive days unless the use of isolation is reviewed by the hospital review board.formal rules of evidence do not apply to the hospital review board meeting,but the patient is permitted to question any person appearing before the board.the clinical director is required to respond in writing to the review board recommendation and state in writing the reasons for modifying or rejecting any recommendation.
the offender program has also formulated a grievance procedure enabling patients to express and resolve complaints.the procedure allows patients to file grievances and requires staff to respond to all grievances as soon as possible and generally within business days.patients seeking further review of their grievance may forward their grievance to the patient advocate who can forward it to the hospital review board,office of the ombudsman for mental health and retardation,office of health facility complaints,or the department of human rights.patients also maintain the right to contact the hospital review board,the office of the ombudsman,the office of health facility complaints,and the department of human services civil rights department.
prior to being admitted to the offender program in,had been incarcerated in a state prison for criminal sexual conduct.in he was returned to prison after being convicted of fraud and theft crimes committed while he was a patient in the offender program.when he was released from prison in may,he returned to the offender program facility in peter for continuing treatment.
at the time was readmitted to peter,he reported with a number of medical conditions,including coronary artery disease,hypertension,and hemorrhoids.on august,he told a nurse that he had been experiencing chest pains and that a nitroglycerin tablet taken at had not helped.the nurse gave him additional tablets and notified a doctor,who requested that an ambulance take him to the hospital.at staff could not locate a pulse,but they were able to resuscitate him with oxygen.the ambulance arrived at and took him to the hospital.he was then airlifted to minneapolis where he was given a coronary and left ventricular angiogram.the results were negative,and he was taken back to peter that day.
committed numerous disciplinary infractions at peter.on january,he was found in violation of offender program regulations which limit the amount of money a patient can possess to he had given a taxi driver to deliver to a bondsman.as a result,an operational team meeting was convened and staff searched his room.they found marijuana and a cell phone,both of which were prohibited by offender program policies.after tested positive for marijuana use,an operational team imposed days of level a restrictions in addition to the days that had been imposed because of the other rule infractions 
in the summer of staff grew concerned that he had been financially exploiting an elderly patient patient x,and unit director gary grimm decided to transfer patient x to a different room to reduce his contact with.was a member of the resident advisory council,and he organized other patients in resistance to the transfer,relying on a provision in the minnesota patients bill of rights that requires health care facilities to provide patients days notice of a room transfer unless the transfer is done for circumstances outside of the facility control.because of the patient resistance grimm decided to delay the room transfer.six days later he was assaulted when he was asleep at his home and beaten with a baseball bat.
because of staff fears that had been taking financial advantage of patient x and that he had ordered the assault on grimm,he was transferred to the offender program facility in moose lake on october.he did not receive notice prior to being transferred,and staff discovered among his belongings a power of attorney document giving him control of patient x financial affairs and a will naming him as patient x residual beneficiary.the will had been notarized by his father,dale.during the transfer to moose lake,removed his restraints and threatened the transport officers by telling them that people get hurt and burned as a consequence of their behavior one of the transport officers had previously been burned by hot oil poured on him by another patient.
upon his arrival at moose lake,initially refused to consent to a strip search.staff later observed him having lengthy conversations on two telephones simultaneously and giving sealed envelopes to other patients.an operational team met with him on october,to review the circumstances leading to his transfer.although the team imposed days of level a restrictions and limited his use of the mails,he was permitted to make four outgoing calls per day and to communicate with his attorney.attempted to circumvent the restrictions by filing change of address notices which listed his father address as his own and by asking other patients to receive and make phone calls for him.
was placed in protective isolation on october,and within hours received notice of the basis for his placement.michael tessner,the chief executive officer of the division administering the offender program,had determined that presented an imminent risk to the safety of staff and other patients.tessner was aware that was subject to ongoing criminal investigations into his involvement with patient x finances and the assault on grimm,and he made the decision to place in isolation after a video conference with larry tebrake,the offender program site director in moose lake,jerry zimmerman,the chief operating officer of the offender program,and other officials.
a review panel consisting of at least two of the offender program officials who had been present for the video conference met the following day with and discussed the placement.after that meeting the review panel approved the placement.on october tessner circulated a memorandum stating that the conditions of protective isolation could also be used to ensure that a patient suspected of criminal activity not have the ability to continue it or to cause harm to other patients,staff,or the public.the memorandum gave the site director the discretion to determine whether imposition of isolation is necessary and to decide when it is safe to remove a patient from isolation.remained in isolation pursuant to this memorandum.
while was in isolation he had at least five hearings before the hospital review board,and he and his attorney appeared before the board at each meeting on october the board approved the use of isolation for ten additional days.later the board recommended that the use of isolation be discontinued on october,december,january,and february,and no written response was issued by offender program officials.throughout this period was able to contact his attorney as well as the ombudsman for mental health and mental retardation.he was also able to file grievances,and a review panel of offender program staff met with on two additional occasions to determine whether isolation should be continued.
shortly after was placed in isolation,staff learned that other patients had received calls and letters from him.a facilities wide search was conducted on october.staff discovered a cell phone in the isolation unit mattress and a charger in room.after staff located and removed the phone,reacted with violent kicks to the door of his room,twice triggering the door alarm.eventually he called staff to complain that he had broken his leg.since he was not visible to staff from the window in the top half of the room door,they were afraid to enter the room or to open the cuff port a rectangular opening in the bottom half of the door.after crawled to the other side of the room where he could be seen,staff entered and ordered an ambulance to take him to the hospital where he had surgery on his leg on november.he was then returned to the moose lake facility with a knee brace.
also experienced problems with an anal cyst in november.he was prescribed keflex and hot packs,but he complained to the duty nurse that they did not ease his pain and asked that she lance the cyst.she declined so he lanced it himself.the following day a staff member met with him to discuss his behavior and the grievance procedure.between october,and november,had filed grievances regarding his care.he was referred to a surgeon regarding the cyst in december of,and it was removed in february.
offender program officials gradually decreased the severity of the restrictions,granting additional access to television and the courtyard and allowing him to purchase items from the canteen and to call his children on christmas eve.he also was given access to treatment materials and therapy in the latter period of isolation.he declined to take part in therapy because he did not want to speak to the counselor assigned to him,and he did not attend group therapy because he was restricted from complaining there about the circumstances leading to his isolation.
was removed from isolation on march.according to tebrake,the moose lake site director,he was released because he,tessner,and steve huot,the clinical director of the offender program,had learned that no criminal charges were going to be filed against for the peter incidents and because he had not violated any offender program policies since october.after his release officials continued to limit his phone,internet,mail,and visiting privileges to prevent contact with patient x.he was also placed on days of level a restrictions on april for passing items to other patients without prior approval and two additional days for verbally abusing staff during the april operational team meeting.a team also imposed three days of level a restrictions on april for using the laundry room without prior approval.received more days of level a restrictions on april after he engaged in threatening behavior toward staff members.
was again placed in isolation on november,after a thirty count federal indictment was filed.the indictment charged him with creating fictitious entities and stealing social security numbers to commit tax fraud,and he was taken into federal custody on november.based on his guilty plea to five counts of filing false tax claims and one count of conspiracy to defraud the federal government,he was sentenced to months imprisonment.state authorities meanwhile charged him with additional offenses for making transfers to his credit card from patient x checking account while in federal custody 
while was still a patient in the offender program,it assessed him a daily charge of for providing his care.responded with an affidavit stating that he had no monthly income,and that he possessed approximately in total assets.he also stated that he was unwilling to sign authorizations,consent forms,or financial information forms because they infringed on his statutory and privacy rights.the offender program has not collected any of the amount charged.
filed this lawsuit against named and two unknown defendants,including the commissioner and unknown employees of the minnesota department for human services,and offender program administrators and staff,alleging negligence and violation of the federal and state constitutions and state statutes.he seeks injunctive and declaratory relief as well as attorney fees and two million dollars in damages.defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that the measures taken in response to his conduct were necessary because of the risk to safety he posed,that they had exercised professional judgment in their decisions and treatment,and that in the alternative they were entitled to qualified immunity.countered that genuine issues of material fact precluded entry of summary judgment,relying on an affidavit of a certified sex therapist that placement in isolation for approximately days is substandard care and would not be accepted by the treatment community at large.
the district court granted the summary judgment motion,concluding that the defendants had not violated constitutional rights and that he had failed to comply with the requisite statutory requirements for bringing a medical negligence claim.his claims for injunctive and declaratory were moot the court decided,and the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because their care had not violated clearly established rights.
appeals,arguing that there are genuine issues of material fact supporting his claims that the decision to keep him in isolation without adequate process violated his right to due process,that the medical treatment he received was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs,and that the offender program officials had infringed on his rights to counsel and free speech.he also asserts that the appellees infringed on his due process rights by charging him for the costs of his treatment and that the district court failed to address this argument.finally,maintains that he satisfied the state law requirements for bringing a negligence action and that the district court erred by holding that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were moot.appellees respond that the treatment he received was reasonable given the risk he presented to other patients,that presented no evidence that his medical care was deliberately indifferent to his needs,and that he failed to present evidence supporting his other claims.they also counter that they are entitled to qualified immunity,that the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot because is currently in federal custody,and that he is liable by statute for the costs of his care.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the non moving party.larson kempker,cir.
asserts that his placement in isolation infringed on a protected liberty interest in violation of his procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment because he was not afforded adequate process when he was placed and kept in isolation.his complaint did not allege a violation of substantive due process rights,and counsel affirmed at oral argument that this is a procedural due process case.appellees assert that received adequate process,and in the alternative that they are entitled to qualified immunity because any right to additional procedures was not clearly established.
a procedural due process claim is reviewed in two steps.the first question is whether has been deprived of a protected liberty or property interest.dover elevator arkansas state,cir.protected liberty interests may arise from two due process clause itself and the laws of the states.kentucky dep t of corr.thompson,d.if he does have a protected interest,we then consider what process is due by balancing the specific interest that was affected,the likelihood that the offender program procedures would result in an erroneous deprivation,and the offender program interest in providing the process that it did,including the administrative costs and burdens of providing additional process.mathews eldridge,d.
since appellees concede that placement of in isolation and restricting his contact with others implicated a protected liberty interest,the basic issue is what process is due to protect that interest see parrish mallinger,cir a procedural due process claim focuses not on the merits of a deprivation,but on whether the state circumscribed the deprivation with constitutionally adequate procedures.
neither the supreme court nor this court has determined the extent to which the constitution affords liberty interests to indefinitely committed dangerous persons under the mathews balancing test.since has been civilly committed to state custody as a dangerous person,his liberty interests are considerably less than those held by members of free society.see wilkinson austin,d morrissey brewer,d.as compared to a prison inmate,however,was entitled to more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement.youngberg romeo,d.
the minnesota program for civil commitment of dangerous persons like to state custody and the accompanying curtailment of their liberty interests is constitutionally permissible.poole goodno,cir.the nature of liberty interest in being free from isolation must therefore be understood in the context of that commitment and its accompanying restrictions.see,wilkinson.at morrissey,at.argues that his interest in remaining within the general patient population had additional weight because he was deprived of treatment while in isolation which could have contributed to his eventual release from the custody of the offender program.see,mckune lile,d sandin conner,d.
not only was unreceptive to the treatment opportunities available to him during the latter period of his isolation,but he has not presented evidence that he would have been any more receptive to treatment when he was initially placed there also has not shown that treatment would have decreased the need for continued isolation,and there is no basis in the record to determine at what point he might be released from the offender program,regardless of whether he had treatment throughout his isolation period.added to that is the fact that he is currently serving time in federal prison.the possibility that his period of isolation could lengthen his stay in the offender program is too attenuated to invoke further due process protections.sandin,at.
the second and third mathews factors address the risk that could have been kept in isolation for improper reasons under the procedures used,the availability of additional safeguards that could have minimized the risk of such an occurrence,and the state interest in implementing the procedures utilized.bohn dakota county,cir.remained in isolation based on the determination of multiple offender program officials that it was necessary to provide for the safety and security of other patients and to allow the criminal investigations into his activities to progress without interruption.the safety of the facility is one of the key responsibilities of offender program officials,and judgment in this area relies heavily on subjective evaluations and predictions of future behavior.connecticut bd.of pardons dumschat,d.because the use of isolation is a discretionary decision based on subjective factors,it is unlikely that more formal,trial like procedures would aid the determination.see hewitt helms,d.moreover,federal courts are to give deference to state officials managing a secure facility,and offender program staff have a substantial interest in providing efficient procedures to address security issues.see sandin,at,youngberg,at.bell,at.
argues,nonetheless,that the procedures governing his placement in isolation were constitutionally insufficient because offender program officials created the policy governing his placement in isolation specifically for him.he also asserts that appellees violated statutes and regulations.these included those pertaining to his right to communicate with others and requirements that a review panel be comprised of individuals not involved in the original isolation decision,that officials respond in writing to the board recommendations,and that placement in isolation be periodically reviewed and approved by specific officials.
although state statutes and regulations can give rise to constitutionally required procedural protections in certain circumstances,see morgan rabun,cir,they can not dictate what procedural protections must attend a liberty a state created one.swipies kofka,cir.the requirements of due process are flexible and specific to each particular situation,mathews,at,and the fact that officials implemented a
