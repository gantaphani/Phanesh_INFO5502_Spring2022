tennessee protection advocacy,tp a is a independent agency that investigates allegations of abuse against the disabled.it appeals the district court holding that one of its clients,martin earle bentley,is not covered under the developmental disabilities assistance and bill of rights act dd act,and that therefore tp a has no statutory authority to obtain bentley records without the permission of his conservator.we hold that the plain meaning of the statutory definition of developmental disability covers individuals with bentley kind of traumatic brain injury,and we reverse the decision of the district court.
martin earle bentley,a truck driver,suffered a traumatic brain injury from an crash in,when he was years old.as a result,he was permanently disabled and must live in a nursing home because he is unable to care for himself.in light of bentley condition after the accident,the probate court of macon county,tennessee appointed attorney jon wells to be the conservator of bentley person and estate in.
in,bentley contacted tp a because he had concerns about both the handling of his financial affairs and restraints on his personal autonomy.in a conference call with tp a representatives,including a tp a staff attorney,bentley explained his grievances.in the staff attorney opinion,bentley demonstrated adequate cognitive ability to speak for himself,and expressed his wishes in an unequivocal consistent manner.bentley summed up his situation as follows a man of my age and ability should not be locked up in a nursing home.bentley authorized tp a to examine all the necessary records to advocate on his behalf.
tp a is the tennessee chapter of a network of independent agencies,known as the protection advocacy system,that congress funded in the dd act as part of the protection and advocacy for persons with developmental disabilities padd program.in order to receive funding under the act,each state must have in effect a system to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.a.for the state to qualify for funding,the agency must not be administered by the state council on developmental disabilities and must be independent of any agency that provides treatment,services,or habilitation to individuals with developmental disabilities.a f g.in general,the p a system serves individuals with a range of developmental disabilities by,among other things,investigating allegations of abuse the agency is authorized to take legal action on behalf of its clients if claims can not otherwise be resolved.see a giving full recitation of the agency powers.
following normal procedures,a case advocate with tp a faxed a letter to wells on december,asking to see bentley records and offering to help resolve any dispute between the two.she then called wells on december,when he informed her that he would only release bentley records in response to a court order.tp a also tried to secure the records through the king daughters and sons nursing home,where bentley is a resident,but met with the same response.the nursing home administrator also forbade his staff to discuss the litigation with bentley.
unable to obtain the necessary information to investigate bentley allegations,tp a filed suit in district court in september against wells,the nursing home,and its administrator,ronald arrison.tp a moved for summary judgment and a preliminary injunction wells for summary judgment.the nursing home did not respond to tp a motion for summary judgment.
in september,the district court granted wells summary judgment on the grounds that the dd act did not cover traumatic brain injury,bentley type of disability,and therefore tp a had no right to review bentley records.this appeal then followed.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.copeland machulis,cir per curiam.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence submitted shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the facts in this case are not disputed,and therefore one of the parties is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law,cir.
to demonstrate that it has legal authority to gain access to bentley records,tp a must show that he is covered by the dd act.et this case turns on whether the term developmental disability,as used in the act,can apply to those who suffer from traumatic brain injury,rather than being limited to those afflicted by some type of congenital or defect.the district court concluded that the clear language of the statute reflects that it is intended to cover individuals who have some physical or mental disability or condition as a result of natural causes.protection advocacy wells,at.emphasis added.the court invoked the rule of statutory construction that all words of the statute are intended to have meaning and no interpretation should be adopted that would render statutory phrases meaningless,redundant,or superfluous.ibid.citing united states holmquist,cir.to expand the definition further to include disabilities resulting from injury,would,according to the district court opinion,ignore the meaning of the word developmental,and therefore bentley was not qualified for protection under the act.id.at.
however,the statute in holmquist did not define the term in dispute.instead,the court had to solve an interpretive riddle presented by a customs statute.holmquist,at.in contrast,the dd act contains an explicit and definition of the term developmental disability,and that definition must govern the resolution of this case we are not at liberty to put our gloss on the definition that congress provided by looking to the generally accepted meaning of the defined term.babbitt sweet home chapter of communities for a great oregon,d pointing out that congress explicitly defined the operative term take in the endangered species act thereby obviating the need for us to probe its meaning united states smith,cir observing that when the meaning of a word is clearly explained in a statute,courts are not at liberty to look beyond the statutory definition.therefore,although it may not be intuitive to think of a brain injury that results from a vehicle accident when the victim is years old as a developmental disability,we must do so because bentley condition fits the definition that is provided in the statute.
tp a is not reading the term developmental out of the statute,but is asking us to follow the definition that congress crafted.according to the statute 
the term developmental disability means a severe,chronic disability of an individual that 
i is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical impairments 
ii is manifested before the individual attains age 
iii is likely to continue indefinitely 
iv results in substantial functional limitations in or more of the following areas of major life activity 
ii receptive and expressive language.
iii learning.
iv mobility.
vi capacity for independent living.
vii economic and 
v reflects the individual need for a combination and sequence of special,interdisciplinary,or generic services,individualized supports,or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
for the reasons below,we reject wells arguments that bentley does not have a developmental disability because he did not gradually acquire it his condition does not satisfy the medical definition of chronic and it did not manifest,or reveal,itself over a period of time.under a straightforward reading of the statute,bentley is covered.
nature of the disability 
the definition of developmental disability in the dd act is framed in terms of a person functional limitations and does not refer to any specific diseases or causes.earlier versions of the dd act defined the term by a list of specific conditions,such as mental retardation or cerebral palsy.congress consistently expanded the definition to include more diagnoses in,it amended the statute again,deleting all references to specific handicapping conditions and establishing a definition based on functional limitations.rehabilitation,comprehensive services,and developmental disabilities amendments of,stat,at,reprinted in.functional limitations,the result of the condition,govern the determination of whether a person falls under the act protection,not medical history,the cause.no one doubts that bentley meets the functional limitation requirements of the dd act the statute treats the words functional and developmental as essentially synonymous and we conclude that his disability meets the statutory definition.
chronic condition 
bentley brain injury resulted in a severe,chronic disability that is a result of physical impairment subsection i.chronic means persisting over a long period of time.dorland illustrated medical dictionary ed.the dd act does not define the term,but the family leave and medical act defines a chronic serious health condition as one which c ontinues over an extended period of time including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition and is characterized by a period of incapacity which is permanent or due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective examples include alzheimer,a severe stroke,or the terminal stages of a disease.perry jaguar of troy,cir quoting a.a severe stroke is also a condition that comes on suddenly,with devastating consequences,meaning that a chronic condition is not limited to those characterized by a slow and steady deterioration.the focus is on the prognosis for recovery,not on the cause or onset of the medical disorder 
furthermore,a chronic condition can result from an outside agent the black lung benefits act defines pneumoconiosis,the condition needed for an award of benefits,as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.b emphasis added.on one occasion,this circuit even described a series of suicide attempts as a chronic health problem.williams mehra,cir rev en banc,cir.therefore,neither congress nor this circuit has limited its understanding of a chronic medical problem to a condition resulting from natural causes.it is undisputed that bentley brain injury has resulted in permanent incapacity,which would qualify it under the general understanding of the term chronic,as used in a.
manifestation of the disability 
bentley disability manifested itself,that is became obvious,before age subsection ii.the dictionary defines manifest as c learly apparent to the sight or understanding obvious and manifested as t o show or demonstrate plainly.american heritage dictionary ed.black law dictionary uses the term in various legal contexts,consistently with the meaning of obvious,manifest injustice,defined as a n error in the trial court that is direct,obvious,and observable,black law dictionary ed manifest necessity is defined as a sudden and overwhelming emergency that precludes completion of a trial.id.at.
wells argues that manifest means revealed and therefore refers exclusively to the exposure of something that already existed but was hidden.bentley brain injury was not a condition that lay dormant,but rather was the instant result of his collision in the truck,leading wells to conclude that bentley injury did not manifest itself,as the statute requires.although reveal is one plausible meaning,it is not the only one.this circuit has consistently used the term manifest to mean be apparent am.ship,office of workers compensation programs,united states dep t of labor,cir stating a preexisting condition must have manifested itself either to the employer through observation or to a doctor from a medical examination for the company to qualify for special fund disability payments due to subsequent injury abbott sullivan,cir stating that an impairment must be taken into consideration under the guidelines for determining disability,even if it does not manifest itself as a limitation on strength emphases added.therefore,nothing in either the dictionary definition of manifest,the legal usage of the term,or the way that this circuit has used the word,suggests that it must refer to a condition that always existed and became obvious.we see no reason why manifest can not just as easily be used to describe something newly created that is now visible.it simply is another way of saying that a condition is readily observable.
end point of the developmental period 
nor is age a random point it is an eligibility requirement that resulted from policy,rather than medical judgments.in,congress revised the dd act and raised the eligibility age for assistance from to years,at,reprinted in.the initial objective was to include everyone with a severe disability within the purview of the statute.advocates for disabled children objected,however,fearing that universal coverage would spread the available resources too thinly.rehabilitation amendments of hearings before the subcomm.on human resources of the united states senate,cong,testimony advocating that the senate adopt the definition of development disability drafted by a task force that recommended an eligibility cut off at age.therefore,the eligibility age of represents the limitation that congress determined would provide the optimal balance between a general commitment to helping the disabled and funding realities.restricting eligibility further through the cramped reading of the statute that wells proposes would ignore both the plain meaning of the legislation and its intent.
in adjudicating disability claims,we must respect the eligibility requirements established by congress.for instance,the supplemental security income ssi program considers someone disabled if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.c a.however,to receive ssi disability payments for mental retardation evidenced simply by a low iq score,a claimant must demonstrate a significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period,the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age.cfr pt,subpt.p,app.emphasis added.this circuit has denied benefits to claimants who could not demonstrate mental deficiency before age.foster halter,cir denying claim because foster first iq test was done when she was years old and therefore she could not demonstrate that her subaverage intellectual functioning manifested itself before age brown sec y of health and human,cir remanding to determine if the claimant mental impairment was manifested during claimant developmental period or rather was a partial consequence of claimant history of heavy alcohol use after the age of.we accept the eligibility provision in the dd act at face value in order to be consistent with our interpretation of the same age requirement in the context of other public welfare legislation.
congress has determined that it is appropriate to consider a person developmental period to extend to age to assess eligibility for government assistance.however natural it would be to consider a old truck driver as a fully grown adult,it is law that when a statutory definition contradicts the everyday meaning of a word,the statutory language generally controls judges should construe legislation as it is written,not as it might be read by a layman.meese keene,d.only when following the literal language of the statute would lead to an interpretation which is inconsistent with the legislative intent or to an absurd result can a court modify the meaning of the statutory language.appleton first bank of ohio,cir.congress may not have had truck drivers with brain injuries in mind when it drafted the legislation,but bentley easily falls into the category of people whom congress intended to protect.cleland bronson health care group,cir clarifying that if the plain language of a statute leads to a broader result than congress might have anticipated,it is still not automatically tantamount to an absurd result.we have no basis on which to second guess the language that congress used bec
