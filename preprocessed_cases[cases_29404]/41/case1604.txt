background 
factual background 
in,sally nyrop began working as an elementary music teacher for the school district.she held this position through the school year.in,nyrop was diagnosed with nyrop claims when she was first diagnosed her left side was gone,and she had difficulty converging her eyes.the loss of nyrop left side sensation or feeling was temporary,and eye exercises and eyeglass prisms successfully minimized nyrop eye condition.in addition,nyrop experienced speech and swallowing problems,heat sensitivity,and lack of energy.nyrop doctor recommended the school district provide nyrop with an air conditioned environment and a headset microphone to help her project her voice,and the school district accommodated these requests.
during the school year,nyrop took sabbatical leave and completed an unpaid administrative internship at a high school within the school district.the internship was a requirement for nyrop to obtain her education specialist degree.during the summer of,nyrop applied for administrative positions and four teacher on special assignment tosa positions within the school district.she was not chosen for any of the positions and was set to return to her elementary music teacher position in the fall of.however,after an elementary school principal became ill,nyrop was chosen to fill an interim elementary school assistant principal position for the school year.
nyrop applied for thirteen administrative positions for the school year,but again was not chosen.when an elementary school principal unexpectedly left the school district,nyrop was hired to fill another interim assistant principal position.in,after nyrop unsuccessfully applied for ten administrative positions,she was hired as a tosa for the school year,which required her to perform both administrative and special education duties.nyrop was hired to fill the same tosa position for the school year after unsuccessfully applying for thirteen administrative positions.
for the school year,nyrop again unsuccessfully applied for thirteen more administrative positions.the school district planned to have nyrop work as a special education teacher at one school and to resume teaching music at another school.however,nyrop informed the school district she could no longer perform the duties of a music teacher and filed a charge of discrimination with the minnesota department of human rights and the equal employment opportunity commission,alleging disability discrimination.nyrop doctor wrote a letter to the school district,at nyrop request,informing the school district nyrop had neuromuscular limitations which made it difficult for nyrop to model her voice for students,instruct students in a loud voice,and sing with students.the school district attempted to find another position in which to place nyrop.when nyrop requested an administrative position,sarah kriewall,who worked for the school district,told nyrop this was not possible because an administrative position would be considered a promotion,and the school district was not required to promote her to accommodate her disability.nyrop declined placement in a paraprofessional position.she ultimately decided to reduce her contract to for the school year.in,nyrop was hired to fill a tosa position.
according to nyrop,she currently experiences the following transient ms symptoms a c harley horse in her tongue,a tremor in her voice,difficulty projecting her voice,impairment in her sensory capacity,pain in her eyes and across the top of her head,and continued fatigue and heat sensitivity.nyrop physician,randall schapiro,testified nyrop had done fairly well in terms of her ms and was walking and talking and functioning and living a fairly decent and normal life.schapiro testified nyrop had limitations with singing,mimicking speech,and fatigue.the school district expert,bruce van dyne,found nyrop had minimal,if any,objective abnormal findings,had a completely normal speaking or conversational voice,and was not substantially or materially impaired in any of the major life activities.
procedural background 
in november,nyrop filed a complaint in the district court,alleging the school district failed to reasonably accommodate her disability,refused to hire her for an administrative position based on her disability,and retaliated against her for filing a charge of discrimination,in violation of the ada,rehabilitation act,and mhra.the school district moved for summary judgment on all claims,arguing nyrop accommodation claim failed because she was not disabled under the ada,rehabilitation act,or mhra nyrop had no record of disability and had never been regarded as disabled and there was no evidence the school district had retaliated against her for filing a charge of discrimination.
the district court granted the school district motion and dismissed all claims.the district court first found nyrop failed to prove her physical impairment substantially limited a major life activity.the district court largely based this finding on nyrop own description of her limitations,observing,when asked what ms prevents her from doing,other than singing,nyrop responded that she could not go on a caribbean cruise because of heat and fatigue,and that she has difficulty lifting fifteen to twenty pounds.nyrop had submitted an affidavit in opposition to summary judgment,claiming all she did was sleep,eat,and work.the district court disregarded the affidavit to the extent it was inconsistent with her deposition testimony.
next,the district court determined nyrop failed to establish she had a record of disability.the district court noted nyrop continued teaching without significant interruption,her symptoms were intermittent and short in duration,and her early symptoms were ameliorated with accommodations.the district court also determined nyrop failed to show the school district regarded her as disabled because the school district continued to employ her in various positions without expressing concern for her the district court found an isolated comment from principal barbara winfield,who was not involved in any hiring decisions,expressing concern for nyrop stamina and health did not show winfield regarded nyrop as disabled,and,even if winfield did regard nyrop as disabled,her statement could not be attributable to the school district.similarly,the district court found kriewall statement that nyrop would not be given a promotion as an accommodation did not establish nyrop was regarded as disabled because that statement was merely an accurate characterization of the school district accommodation obligations.finally,the district court determined nyrop failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.because the district court found nyrop was not disabled,the district did not address the failure to accommodate claim.
the district court dismissed nyrop ada and rehabilitation act claims with prejudice and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over nyrop mhra claims,dismissing the claims without prejudice.nyrop appeals the district court adverse grant of summary judgment on her discrimination and failure to accommodate claims,and the school district,asserting alternative grounds for dismissal.
