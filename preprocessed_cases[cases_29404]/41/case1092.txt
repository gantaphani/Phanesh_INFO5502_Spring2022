ozy vaughn,a mentally disabled inmate,died from severe dehydration after being held for several days in a to degree observation room.a jury determined that david moskowitz deliberate indifference and medical malpractice caused vaughn death and awarded his estate million in compensatory damages later reduced to million and million in punitive damages.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
on friday,january,vaughn,an inmate in the riverside correctional facility in ionia,michigan,began acting strangely.concerned about his behavior,prison officials moved him from his prison cell to an observation room in the residential treatment program of the ionia facility.each inmate placed in an observation room is looked after by a treatment team,which includes a psychiatrist,team of nurses and other trained personnel.for reasons that the record does not fully explain,the temperature in the observation room exceeded degrees even though it was january in michigan and even though heating a prison is not cheap,whether in or today.
after moving vaughn to the observation room,prison officials placed david moskowitz,a psychiatrist,on vaughn treatment team.that friday,moskowitz met with vaughn,assessed his condition and proposed medication and help vaughn through the weekend.
when moskowitz returned to work on monday,he learned that vaughn condition had worsened.although moskowitz left open the possibility that vaughn might have a heat problem,ja,his plan on monday morning was to keep observing vaughn and to give the medication a little bit more time to work,ja.
vaughn condition continued to deteriorate on monday.at,paul foster,a prison guard,reported to the treatment team that vaughn vomited in the bathroom after trying to drink a large amount of water from the bathroom sink.by monday afternoon,vaughn room had reached degrees.at the end of his monday shift,moskowitz concluded that with cool temperature and more fluids vaughn could be taken care of and the dehydration could be prevented.ja.moskowitz plan was to give the medication still more time to work,to transfer vaughn to a cooler room and eventually to move vaughn to a psychiatric hospital.moskowitz did feel that vaughn status was life threatening.id.
he was wrong.vaughn never reached the psychiatric hospital,and by the time he made it to a cooler room on monday evening his condition had taken yet another turn for the worse.vaughn began vomiting and,both of which continued into the night until he died from dehydration early tuesday morning.
antoinette gibson,the representative of vaughn estate,filed this action against moskowitz and other defendants,alleging deliberate indifference in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendment and raising several state law claims.before trial,the district court dismissed seven defendants.the remaining defendants asserted qualified immunity,which the district court for nurse jill blankstrom,as to whom it granted qualified immunity on the deliberate indifference claims.the estate settled its claims against the remaining defendants,with the exception of moskowitz,for.the estate took its claims against moskowitz to trial,and the jury returned a verdict against moskowitz on the and the state law claims,awarding gibson million in compensatory damages,later reduced by to account for settlements with the other defendants,and million in punitive damages.
moskowitz first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,questioning whether it supports the jury finding that he acted with deliberate indifference to vaughn serious medical needs and whether vaughn death was a reasonably foreseeable result of moskowitz conduct.an inmate may bring a claim under the eighth amendment only where he can show that a state official acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs.foreback,cir internal quotation marks omitted.deliberate indifference requires more than mere mistreatment or negligence it requires the plaintiff to show that the injury was objectively serious and that the defendant subjectively ignored the inmate medical needs.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
was vaughn medical condition objectively serious while moskowitz concedes that vaughn medical needs had become serious by monday,january,he argues that they were not serious on friday,january officials moved vaughn to the observation room,when moskowitz began treating vaughn and when the jury ascribed initial liability to moskowitz.but drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the estate,as we must,williams nashville network,cir,we disagree.
here is what the jury was told about vaughn condition on january.at one point,he stood naked over his cellmate,holding his bible and talking about god.ja.when he finished preaching,vaughn tore up all the pages from his bible,threw the papers all over the floor and claimed that outside forces were controlling his actions.ja.vaughn was confused,refused to eat or drink and had difficulty following directions.and his condition only deteriorated after officials moved him to the degree observation room.
several experts testified that vaughn medication and the hot observation room,in combination,created a serious medical risk,and moskowitz himself admitted that he understood the potentially deadly combination.gerald shiener,the estate psychiatric expert,explained to the jury that the drugs moskowitz prescribed to treat vaughn schizophrenia also affect the part of the brain that regulates temperature.ja.when patients on this type of medication are put into a hot environment,they develop a positive feedback,which means they keep getting hot and they ca convect the heat or get rid of the heat and their body heats up out of control all of which leads to a very dangerous situation.ja.kathryn burns,another expert for the estate and the former chief psychiatrist for the department of rehabilitation and correction in ohio,corroborated shiener testimony.there is a condition among people who take psychotropic medication,burns said,where they ca deal with heat as well as other people can.it just impacts their heat dissipation center in their brains.ja.
scott jacobs,the estate medical expert,bolstered these accounts.jacobs a bsolutely believed that vaughn dehydration occurred over a period of days,ja,for three reasons vaughn phenomenally high sodium level of to go from a normal sodium level of to sodium of takes a long time it absolutely takes days and days,ja vaughn level,which measures the buildup of waste in the bloodstream and which was five times the normal level and most profoundly,vaughn weight loss of pounds over the several days leading to his death,which could not have happened in one day,could not have happened in two days.it had to have happened over a several day period.ja.a reasonable jury could find that vaughn medical needs were serious on friday the.
did moskowitz subjectively ignore vaughn medical needs moskowitz argues that he did not believe that a serious medical need existed,and specifically did not feel that vaughn was suffering from dehydration on january.br.at.the question,however,is not just whether the state employee has admitted the inmate faced an excessive and imminent health risk it is also whether circumstantial evidence,including the very fact that the risk was obvious,farmer brennan,d,shows the employee must have understood the nature of the risk.a reasonable jury could fairly conclude that moskowitz kn ew of and disregard ed an excessive risk to vaughn health or safety.id.at.
moskowitz own testimony goes part of the way to establishing the point.he knew vaughn observation room had heat problems,understood that the potential side effects of his prescribed medicine included thermoregulation problems,ja,and recognized that vaughn might be overheated,ja.nonetheless,he never asked that vaughn temperature be monitored over the weekend,and indeed it never was.
testimony from other prison officials also supports the jury finding.whether through vaughn charts or through conversation with other staff members,moskowitz knew that,over the weekend,vaughn had stood in the same position for hours,had sweated profusely,had babbled nonsense,had been unable to operate a wate
