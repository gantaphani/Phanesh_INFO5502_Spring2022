background 
hepp alleges that he has been disabled since january,due to spinal injuries and a torn rotator cuff in the right shoulder.he was covered for title ii disability benefits until march.
hepp was years old at the time of the administrative decision.he began experiencing lower back pain while serving in the navy as a parachute rigger.hepp retired from the navy in,with a ten percent disability rating.after his navy service,hepp worked seasonally in alaska as a crab steamer and a fish processor.as a crab steamer,he would lift large containers of cooked crab.as a fish processor,hepp received fish from boats and placed them in twenty,thirty,or one hundred pound totes.he then lifted the twenty and thirty pound totes and placed them on a conveyor belt.the hundred pound totes were transported with a forklift.both jobs required standing,stooping and bending for twelve to sixteen hours a day.in january,the processing plant laid hepp off.
on august,hepp filed an application for disability insurance benefits.prior to this filing,his last medical treatment from a physician for his back or shoulder occurred in.on october,the alj sent hepp to raymond west,for a consultative examination.hepp reported that he used aspirin and motrin for pain relief,and west claimed that o bjectively,there is little to account for hepp back distress.west concluded that hepp could sit for at least periods,could stand or walk for at least thirty minute periods,and could alternate these activities occasionally in the workplace during an average workday.also,hepp could occasionally,if not frequently,lift and carry twenty to thirty pounds for to feet and could bend,squat,kneel or crawl occasionally for short periods in the average workday.
throughout,hepp received a series of medical examinations at the veterans hospital.radiology and bone density tests indicated diffuse demineralization,degenerative changes through the spine,and osteoporosis.hepp was prescribed vioxx for pain relief.on may,hepp had a hearing before an alj.the alj denied benefits to hepp,and the commissioner appeals council refused to grant hepp request for review.hepp sought review in federal court.in january,the district court remanded the case back to the agency because the alj findings were not supported by substantial evidence.one of the district court chief concerns was that neither the alj nor west had reviewed the radiology and bone density tests,which required analysis by a qualified physician.
on may,the alj conducted a second hearing.hepp testified that he could carry twenty to thirty pounds,though not very far.he also indicated that he takes motrin for pain and fosamax for osteoporosis it appeared he no longer took vioxx.he helped around the house by vacuuming,mopping,sweeping,washing dishes,folding cloths,cooking,driving and mowing the lawn with a push mower.hepp stated that when he drives for over an hour,he must pull off the road and walk around because of the pain.a vocational expert characterized hepp previous employment as a parachute rigger as medium and skilled work,his job as a crab steamer as heavy and unskilled work,and his job as a fish processor as medium and unskilled work the alj then requested that hepp receive an orthopedic consultative examination.
in july,william blankenship,conducted a consultative examination of hepp.although hepp was inches in height throughout his time in the navy,blankenship nurse recorded that hepp was and a half inches tall.hepp admitted that it has been quite a while since his last treatment and that he took motrin for pain.based on,blankenship reported that hepp had a compression fracture at that had healed with a fifty percent loss of height.after testing hepp range of motion,blankenship concluded that hepp had no limitations with regards to lifting,carrying,standing,walking or sitting.blankenship report was submitted to the alj.
hepp disagreed with blankenship conclusions and requested the right to him.the alj agreed to schedule the by telephone.hepp objected to telephone and requested,but the alj denied the request.hepp also wanted to demonstrate that blankenship was biased against social security disability claimants by presenting depositions,hearing transcripts,and medical reports in other cases involving blankenship to discredit and impeach his testimony.however,the alj limited the scope of the to blankenship report concerning hepp medical condition and prohibited any questions related to any other cases or patients.
the alj conducted a third hearing on january,during which hepp blankenship by telephone.the doctor stated that he was not certain if he had received any bone density reports,but a bone scan which revealed dextroscoliosis only meant that there existed a curvature of the spine,which would not necessarily cause pain.blankenship also indicated that a loss of height does not necessarily indicate any functional limitations.upon further questioning,blankenship testified that the did not substantiate hepp claim of numbness in his right arm and leg.he also denied manipulating patients when conducting range of motion tests.finally,hepp testified that his examination with blankenship only lasted about fifteen minutes.
on april,the alj issued a decision denying disability benefits.the alj employed the process outlined in to determine whether hepp was disabled the alj determined that hepp had not performed gainful work since the alleged disability onset date and that he suffers from severe impairments which are not listed.the alj then employed the polaski factors to evaluate the credibility of hepp subjective claims of pain.see polaski heckler,cir.the alj found an absence of objective medical findings to support the allegations of disabling pain an ability to remain active in the performance of household activities a lack of consistent medical care a use of medication motrin for effective pain relief and a claim by hepp that he could lift fifty pounds occasionally.based on these findings,the alj determined that hepp subjective claims of pain lacked credibility.
at step four,the alj concluded that hepp retained the residual functional capacity for medium work activity.the alj opinion then contained a paragraph that was inconsistent with the remaining decision t he claimant has demonstrated that he is unable to perform his past relevant work.therefore,at step five,the burden of proof shifts to the commissioner of social security to establish that there are substantial numbers of jobs existing in the national economy that the claimant can perform with his particular limitations.however,later in the opinion and consistent with the earlier finding that hepp could perform medium work activity at step four,the alj held that hepp could perform his past relevant work as a fish processor as generally performed in the national economy.consequently,the alj concluded that hepp was not disabled under the social security act.
after the appeals council denied review,hepp again sought judicial review,arguing that the alj decision lacked substantial evidence and that the alj violated his due process rights by restricting to blankenship medical report of hepp.hepp also moved to remand the case to the alj in order to have new evidence considered.the new evidence consisted of a mri report dated january,and a letter from jon dodson,dated april.hepp then supplemented his motion to remand,claiming that the alj refusal to allow of blankenship violated his due process rights.the district court denied the motion.the court determined that the additional evidence was immaterial since it did not address he
