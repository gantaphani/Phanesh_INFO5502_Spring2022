rick plemmons was arrested on august,for allegedly failing to pay child support.plemmons was years old at the time.on august,plemmons was transferred to the pulaski county jail,where he was booked between and plemmons alleges he advised jailer michael gibbens he had a history of heart problems and had experienced two heart attacks.however,the intake form filled out by gibbens does not mention plemmons history of heart problems.according to plemmons,on the afternoon of august,he began suffering chest and arm pain and was sweating profusely.he stated he does not know the precise time his symptoms began,but he believes they started shortly before he claims his,john thompson,notified jail staff that plemmons was ill a number of times via a call box in their cell,and that mike,one of the jailers,came to check on plemmons around plemmons claims he told mike he was having heart trouble,but states the jailer left without doing anything.plemmons condition worsened,and he experienced increased chest pain and nausea.plemmons alleges that mike and an unidentified jailer came back minutes after mike first visit,and plemmons told them he thought he was having a heart attack.plemmons claims the two jailers then took him to the booking area and had him sit on a bench while they finished processing a prisoner.one of the jailers then called to have an ambulance dispatched,which plemmons claims was roughly ten to fifteen minutes after he was removed from his cell,and more than fifty minutes from the time the jailers were first notified of his condition.
in his deposition,thompson,plemmons,offered a slightly different version of events.according to thompson,plemmons became ill around thompson stated he believed plemmons was having a heart attack and tried to alert jailer ron jones by pushing the call box button in the cell,but received no response.thompson stated that about fifteen to twenty minutes later,jones walked by the cell and thompson told jones that plemmons was ill,but jones dismissed plemmons symptoms as an anxiety attack before walking away.when jones walked by a short time later,thompson told him plemmons was having a heart attack,and jones called to have an ambulance dispatched.
the defendants point out many of the assertions made by plemmons are contradicted by the jailers on duty that day.gibbens stated in his deposition he left work at on august and had no personal recollection of plemmons heart attack.jones stated he promptly went to plemmons cell after the jail trustee,charles eoff,notified him plemmons was having trouble breathing.he stated he then took plemmons to the front of the jail,where he immediately called to have an ambulance dispatched.jones denied he was notified of plemmons condition via the call box in plemmons cell and stated he did not know plemmons was having a heart attack,as he recalled plemmons complaining only of having difficulty breathing.jail trustee eoff corroborated jones statement that he eoff notified jones of plemmons illness and that jones promptly checked on plemmons,then summoned an ambulance 
dispatch records indicate an ambulance was called at and arrived at the jail at.one of the paramedics stated plemmons was in trouble when the ambulance arrived,and that plemmons stated he had been like this for minutes.plemmons suffered from a severe heart attack,and william woods observed in his deposition that damage to plemmons heart could have been minimized had he received medical care sooner.
plemmons also has submitted evidence indicating the jailers delay in calling an ambulance was influenced by sheriff roberts policy requiring jailers to notify him before an ambulance is summoned to transport an inmate to the hospital.the record indicates gary carmack,pulaski county ambulance district administrator,had previously criticized roberts for delaying inmate treatment and that carmack had ordered his paramedics to document the occasions when,as a result of roberts policy,patients at the jail were not permitted to be transported from the jail by ambulance against the medical advice of physicians.
plemmons also has submitted evidence indicating pulaski county failed to adequately train jones and gibbens to respond to plemmons heart attack,pointing out jones stated in his deposition he had never seen the jail policy and procedures manual and that it was not in use at the time of plemmons heart attack.neither jones nor gibbens had received training from pulaski county to assist them in identifying heart attack symptoms,and,according to plemmons,neither recognized symptoms obvious to a lay person.
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects governmental officials from civil liability when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.sexton martin,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.in ruling on a qualified immunity issue,courts must apply a inquiry.first,a court must determine whether t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.if a violation can be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the reviewing court must then ask whether the right was clearly established in light of the specific context of the case.id.for a right to be considered clearly established,the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.lawyer city of council bluffs,cir quoting anderson creighton,d.
we review a district court denial of summary judgment de novo.hudson norris,cir.ordinarily,a denial of summary judgment is not a final decision and thus is not immediately appealable.see.however,a denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity may be reviewed on interlocutory appeal when the issue presented is a purely legal one whether the facts alleged support a claim of violation of clearly established law.hudson,at quoting mitchell forsyth,d.because qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,hunter bryant,d,its availability ordinarily should be decided by the court long before trial.id.at.however,the nonmoving party is still given the benefit of all relevant inferences at the summary judgment stage,and if a genuine dispute exists concerning predicate facts material to the qualified immunity issue,the defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on that ground.hudson,at quoting pace city of des moines,cir see also.c.
here,the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity,stating,there are material facts in dispute that must be resolved by a jury.to affirm this conclusion,we must first find the evidence in the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to plemmons,would allow a reasonable fact finder to conclude the defendants engaged in a course of conduct that violated his clearly established constitutional rights.we must then find as a matter of law that no reasonable official could have thought that such a course of conduct was lawful.
we first ask whether the evidence in the record,viewed in the light most favorable t
