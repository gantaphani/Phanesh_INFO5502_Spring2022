in these consolidated appeals,michigan department of community health the department or state urges us to reverse the district court entry of summary judgment against it in two cases brought under on behalf of a class of michigan residents.the district court enjoined the department from enforcing a contract for all incontinence products to michigan medicaid recipients.on appeal,the department challenges the district court holdings that medicaid provision,a a,confers a private right on individuals enforceable under and the state contract violates the provision because incontinence products are not medical devices as that term is used in the relevant statute,a b.we agree that medicaid provision creates a private right that may be enforced under.but we disagree that the phrase medical devices is unambiguous and that the agency medical devices may include incontinence ineligible for chevron deference.we thus reverse the judgment of the district court.
a cooperative program,medicaid authorizes the federal government to provide funds to participating states to administer medical assistance to individuals whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.the state of michigan participates in medicaid and administers its program through the department.
at stake in these appeals is michigan method of supplying certain incontinence products through its medicaid program.the relevant incontinence products include adult,child,and youth diapers and briefs as well as disposable incontinence shields,liners and underpads as well as incontinence catheters,accessories,syringes,skin barriers and enema units.
in,the department and binsons home medical care signed a contract providing that binsons would be the sole provider of incontinence products for some of michigan medicaid recipients.
in,after undergoing a process,the department entered into a new contract designating j b medical as the provider of incontinence products to all of michigan medicaid recipients.
on june,dorothy harris filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,seeking certification of a class consisting of all individuals who,like her,are eligible for medicaid benefits in michigan and may require use of incontinence products.harris sought declaratory and injunctive relief under and claimed that the department contract violated medicaid provision.on july,another beneficiary,filed a similar complaint,after which the court consolidated the two cases.
on november,the district court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs.as pertinent here,the court held that medicaid provision creates private rights enforceable under.op.at.it then held that the provision,a a,requires states to allow eligible individuals to obtain medical assistance from any qualified provider.although the medicaid statute contains an exception to the provision for providers of medical devices,a b,the court held that this phrase does not include incontinence products.the department timely appealed.

in ascertaining whether congress intended to create a federal right in the provision,the court has directed us to look at three factors,see blessing freestone,d see also westside mothers haveman,cir.first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.blessing,at.in answering this initial inquiry,courts look for a statutory right or individual entitlement,gonzaga,at,that is unambiguously conferred,id.at,by the use of language,id.at.an aggregate focus unconcerned with whether the needs of any particular person have been satisfied,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,is insufficient the statute must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited,id.at,and use individually focused terminology,id.at.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.blessing,at.internal quotation marks omitted.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.id.at.
these three inquiries do not end the matter,however.even after a plaintiff demonstrates that the federal statute creates an individually enforceable right in the class of beneficiaries to which he belongs,there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under.city of rancho palos verdes.at internal quotation marks omitted.the defendant may defeat this presumption by demonstrating that congress did not intend that remedy for a newly created right by pointing to evidence of such congressional intent that may be found directly in the statute creating the right,or inferred from the statute creation of a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also wilder.hosp.ass n,d.
gauged by this test,medicaid provision creates enforceable rights that a medicaid beneficiary may vindicate through.a state plan for medical assistance,the provision says,
must provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance including drugs may obtain such assistance from any institution,agency,community pharmacy,or person,qualified to perform the service or services required including an organization which provides such services,or arranges for their availability,on a prepayment basis,who undertakes to provide him such services.
a emphasis added.
first,in giving any individual eligible for medical assistance a free choice over the provider of that assistance,the statute uses the kind of individually focused terminology that unambiguously confer s an individual entitlement under the law.gonzaga,at.and by saying that a state plan must provide this free choice,the statute uses the kind of,mandatory language,see westside mothers,at,that the supreme court and our court have held establishes a private right of action.it is also clear that the right is vested in the class of beneficiaries to which plaintiffs belong,city of rancho palos verdes.at,namely individuals eligible for medicaid coverage.the provision,in other words,gives recipients the right to choose among a range of qualified providers without government interference.town court nursing,d emphasis removed gonzaga,at.holding that the family educational rights and privacy act of ferpa does not confer enforceable rights under because u nlike the individually focused terminology of titles vi and ix no person shall be subjected to discrimination,ferpa provisions speak only to the secretary of education,directing that no funds shall be made available to any educational agency or institution which has a prohibited policy or practice blessing,at.holding that title of the social security act does not give individuals a federal right to force a state agency to substantially comply with its terms because the requirement that a state operate its child support program in substantial compliance with title was not intended to benefit individual children and custodial parents,and therefore it does not constitute a federal right enforceable under.
second,while there may be legitimate debates about the medical care covered by or exempted from the provision,the mandate itself does not contain the kind of vagueness that would push the limits of judicial enforcement.whether a state plan provides an individual with the choice specified in the provision is likely to be readily apparent,and the parties here do not dispute that the department contract fails to provide that choice.
third,the must provide language of the provision confirms that the statute is couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.blessing,at.the department does not argue otherwise.
nor do other provisions of the medicaid act explicitly or implicitly foreclose the private enforcement of this statute through actions.the medicaid act does not provide other methods for private enforcement of the act in federal court.smith robinson,d recognizing that a action would render superfluous most of the detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute middlesex county sewerage auth.sea clammers ass n,d w hen a state official is alleged to have violated a federal statute which provides its own comprehensive enforcement scheme,the requirements of that enforcement procedure may not be bypassed by bringing suit directly under.internal quotation marks omitted see also city of rancho palos verdes.at we have found unavailable to remedy violations of federal statutory rights in two cases sea clammers and smith.both of those decisions rested upon the existence of more restrictive remedies provided in the violated statute itself and in all of the cases in which we have held that is available for violation of a federal statute,we have emphasized that the statute at issue,in contrast to those in sea clammers and smith,did not provide a private judicial remedy or,in most of the cases,even a private administrative remedy for the rights violated.
that the federal government may withhold federal funds to states is not inconsistent with private enforcement.see wilder,at.holding that although the medicaid act authorizes the secretary to curtail federal funds to states whose plans are not in compliance with the act,t his administrative scheme can not be considered sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate a congressional intent to withdraw the private remedy of.neither is the act requirement that states grant an opportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the state plan is denied,a,inconsistent with a private action under,wilder,at.
our conclusion,moreover,comports with decisions of the supreme court,our court and other courts of appeals that have recognized privately enforceable rights under stemming from similar statutory language in the medicaid act.see,id.at.holding that a a requiring that a state plan for medical assistance must provide for payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan confers providers with an enforceable right under because it is expressly phrased in terms benefitting health care providers westside mothers,at holding that a b requiring states to provide certain periodic services for individuals who are eligible under the plan creates a cause of action under for eligible individuals sabree richman,cir holding that a requiring that a state medicaid plan must provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so,and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals creates an enforceable right under bryson shumway,cir same doe chiles,cir same.
in arguing to the contrary,the department urges us to follow two district court decisions.in the first of these decisions,betit,d,the court concluded that the freedom of choice provisions do not contain the unambiguous language of gonzaga without explaining why the language discussed above is not.because the district court did not explain why the mandatory must provide language,a,and the individual entitlement language of the provision,gonzaga,at,do not satisfy gonzaga requirements for a action,we do not find the court reasoning persuasive.also unpersuasive is the second decision,watson thorne,wl,dist.lexis.june,which is unpublished and which does not address the provision.
the department next argues that another provision of the act,a,shows that congress did not intend to create privately enforceable rights.a state,that provision says,shall not be deemed to be out of compliance with the requirements of the provision solely because it has taken various measures,including entering into arrangements through a competitive bidding process for the purchase of laboratory services or medical devices.a.that a carves out services and products otherwise covered by a,however,by no means establishes that the latter section does not create a right of action.one section a creates an individual statutory entitlement,namely freedom of choice the other creates exceptions to that right.compare gonzaga,at.holding that title ix of the education amendments of,a,creates individually enforceable rights with a creating several statutory exemptions from these rights.
the department next contends that even if a private right of action exists to enforce the provision,that right extends only to services and does not extend to items that a entity may use when providing services.dep t br.at emphasis added.o n its face,the department reasons,a guarantees the right to choose among providers of services and concludes that because suppliers of incontinence products are not providing services per se,congress did not intend individuals to have free choice among suppliers of incontinence items.dep t br.at.but as other provisions and regulations show,the dichotomy proposed by the department does not exist.the medical assistance to which freedom of choice applies does not extend only to services,as a says the provision applies to and includ es drugs.and the act defines medical assistance as payment of part or all of the cost of home health care services,a,which the regulations define as including medical supplies,equipment and appliances that are required for use in the recipient home,b.incontinence products that patients use in their homes under their physicians orders thus are fairly covered by a grant of freedom of choice over medical assistance.
finally,the department argues that caswell city of detroit housing commission,cir,compels a contrary conclusion.in caswell,we held that because no specific statutory provision in the relevant act,as opposed to a regulation implementing the act,conferred the individual right the plaintiff sought to enforce,he could not pursue his claim under.id.at.caswell also recognized that recent supreme court precedent particularly gonzaga and sandoval had cabined our prior holding that creates a federal cause of action for the violation of a federal regulation.id.at emphasis added see id.l anguage in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that congress through statutory text created,but it may not create a right that congress has not agencies may play the sorcerer apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.quoting sandoval,at.
seizing on this language from caswell,the department submits that because plaintiffs have supported their position that the term in the statute home health services,a includes incontinence products by pointing to a term in a regulation medical supplies,only the regulation establishes the necessary bridge between services and supplies,dep t resp.to dep t of health and human servs.hhs amicus br.at.the analogy is inapt.in caswell,neither the plaintiff nor the court could identify any statutory provision that conferred the right at issue.here,the authoritative regulation merely supplements the right identified in a specific statutory provision the provision,a a.a term in that provision,medical assistance,is further defined in another statutory provision,a,which states that medical assistance includes home health care services.plaintiffs claim thus is not based on alone that regulation simply confirms that these statutory terms include incontinence supplies.the problem at issue in sandoval,moreover,was that the regulations the parties sought to enforce did not simply apply statutory rights since they indeed forb ade conduct that the statute permit ted.at.consequently,the private right of action to enforce the statute did not include a private right to enforce the regulations,because a private plaintiff may not bring a suit based on a regulation against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of the statute,id.at.internal quotations marks and brackets omitted.
customarily,by contrast,regulations applying a statute ban on conduct are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section because s uch regulations,if valid and reasonable,authoritatively construe the statute itself,and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute.id.at.citations omitted see also ability ctr.of greater toledo city of sandusky,cir i f the regulation simply effectuates the express mandates of the controlling statute,then the regulation may be enforced via the private cause of action available under that statute.citing sandoval,at.because a congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well,sandoval,at,sandoval does not undermine enforcement here,see id.citing cases involv ing regulations of this type,including national collegiate athletic association.smith,d regulation defining who is a recipient under title ix and school board of nassau county.arline,d regulations defining the terms physical impairment and major life activities in of the rehabilitation act of.other courts,including this one,have reached a similar conclusion.see ability ctr.of greater toledo,at holding that because the regulation at issue effectuates a mandate of a statute,it is therefore enforceable through the private cause of action available under the statute hood,cir holding that because the language relied upon by the plaintiff is contained in the statute itself,because the regulations implementing the statute,and defining home health care services to include medical supplies,including are authoritative interpretations of the statute and are enforceable by and because hhs has interpreted the home health care services category as specifically including such supplies,the federal statutory right asserted by the plaintiff is enforceable under.
having resolved the threshold question against the state,we turn to the question whether the state permissibly treated incontinence products as medical devices under the exception to the provision,a b.a state,the exception says,shall not be deemed to be out of compliance with the requirements of the provision solely by reason of the fact that the state has entered into arrangements through a competitive bidding process for the purchase of laboratory services or medical devices if the secretary has found that adequate devices will be available under such arrangements.id.emphasis added.
chevron,natural resources defense council,d,sets forth a familiar inquiry for assessing an agency construction of a statute that it administers.first has congress directly spoken to the precise question at issue id.at.if it has,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.second is the agency answer based on a permissible construction of the statute id.at.if so and if congress has given the agency authority to interpret the statute,a federal court will defer to the agency interpretation.id.
congress,as an initial answer,has not directly spoken to the question at hand do medical devices include incontinence products in establishing an exception to medicaid provision for medical devices,congress did not define the phrase and thus did not use the most natural means for eliminating ambiguity about it.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d smiley citibank,d.
far from precluding incontinence products from coming within the exception to the provision,the ordinary and natural meaning,the limited,comm r,cir,of medical devices extends to incontinence products.medical means of,relating to,or concerned with physicians or with the practice of medicine often as distinguished from surgery or requiring or devoted to medical treatment.webster third new international dictionary.and a device means something that is formed or formulated by design and usu ally with consideration of possible alternatives,experiment,and testing something devised or contrived.id.at.because incontinence products may fairly be described as something devised for medical treatment,they come within the ordinary meaning of the phrase.
an analogous use of device in the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et,supports this view.that act defines device as an instrument,apparatus,implement,machine,contrivance,implant,in vitro reagent,or other similar or related article,including any component,part,or accessory.h.this broad definition of the term would itself cover incontinence products.confirming the point,the food and drug administration has promulgated regulations establishing that incontinence products like those at issue in this case are devices within the fdca definition.see a protective garment for incontinence is a device that consists of absorbent padding and a fluid barrier and that is intended to protect an incontinent patient garment from the patient excreta.emphasis added.in,when congress enacted a b,see,stat,and used the undefined phrase medical devices,it seems unlikely that congress meant to preclude an interpretation of the term that was consistent with a definition it had provided for device just six years before,when it enacted h of the fdca,see,stat.may,see also bragdon abbott,d when administrative and judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision,repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates,as a general matter,the intent to incorporate its administrative and judicial interpretations as well.
the medicare act points in the same direction.it contains a definition of medical devices that incorporates the definition of devices found in the fdca.see m b.
having failed to enact a definition of medical devices that precludes the phrase from covering incontinence products,having used a phrase that has a range of meanings,including one that naturally extends to incontinence products,and having deployed a phrase that it has used in analogous statutory and regulatory settings to cover incontinence products,congress can not be said to have limited the agency authority to include incontinence products within this provision.
as to step two of chevron,at least one of the natural meanings of medical devices includes incontinence products,and the agency interpretation therefore represents a permissible one entitled to deference.chevron,at.hhs has implemented its interpretation in three settings.on may,the agency responded to an inquiry from the department,stating that a medical device can be considered something used for a specific purpose in the practice of medicine and that adult diapers,catheters,qualify as medical devices because those items would be used to manage the medical condition of incontinence.ja.see lukhard reed,d plurality noting that authoritative expression of agency view in memoranda and letters is entitled to deference id.at.blackmun,concurring same.
after hhs expressed this view in its may letter,the department certified that michigan contract for incontinence products complied with statutory and regulatory requirements for an exemption to the provision.when hhs accepted the department certification,it was required to find that the amendment satisfied all statutory requirements,see b,including that the department contract for incontinence products complied with a b.in carrying out that responsibility,hhs was exercising congress express delegation of specific interpretive authority,united states mead,d,and accordingly the agency approval of the state plan amendment is entitled to chevron deference,see pharm.research mfrs.of am.thompson,holding that when the agency approves a state plan amendment under medicaid,the secretary decisions are entitled to chevron deference hood,at same see also,rosen goetz,cir holding that we
