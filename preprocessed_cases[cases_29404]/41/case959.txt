in october,a federal grand jury in the southern district of texas filed a indictment charging carrie hamilton,richard miles,alice miles,and harold miles with multiple crimes related to fraud on the medicare program.a jury acquitted harold miles,convicted richard miles of two mail fraud counts,and convicted alice miles and carrie hamilton of and counts,respectively the three remaining defendants appeal on a variety of grounds,the most significant of which challenge their convictions for money laundering promotion and illegal medicare kickbacks.we reverse the money laundering promotion and kickback counts.we also reverse the court sentencing finding that medicare is a financial institution within the meaning of b a.we otherwise affirm the convictions and remand for resentencing.
background 
affiliated professional home health apro was formed in in houston,texas by carrie hamilton,alice miles,and richard miles.richard miles,a of a high school,was married to alice miles,a registered nurse,and is the brother of both hamilton,also a registered nurse,and harold miles,an apro employee.when apro obtained certification from the texas department of health and a medicare provider number,the company began to treat patients and obtain reimbursement for visits to such patients.
medicare requires home health care providers to report their expenses and number of patient visits.in turn,medicare calculates a rate which it then uses to reimburse the home health provider over the next year.at the end of each year,providers are required to submit their actual expenses to medicare so that it can determine whether it has under or overpaid the provider for that year.the expenses reported by providers to medicare include the direct costs of patient care,including salaries and employee benefits as well as general operating expenses such as office rent and equipment.indirect costs may be expensed to medicare on a basis according to the proportion of medicare patients served by the provider.medicare also reimburses a wide variety of additional expenses incurred by home health care providers such as mileage incurred in travel to and from patient residences.the touchstone for reimbursement is that costs must be reasonable,related to patient care,and necessary for the provider business functions.see b v.
in an effort to promote efficiency despite the nature of reimbursement,medicare contracts with intermediary agencies to audit providers cost reports.further,because the medicare reimbursement system offers the criminal numerous avenues to defraud the federal government,intermediary agencies closely monitor provider reports for fraudulent activity.apro relationship with medicare was conducted through palmetto government benefits association palmetto,a subsidiary of south carolina blue shield.
in this case,the government presented evidence that the defendants,through apro,submitted cost reports that grossly inflated expenses for items ranging from mileage to employee salaries.for example,hamilton was reimbursed for a whopping travel miles from,a period when she also frequently visited louisiana casinos.alice miles,another avid gambler,was reimbursed for travel miles over three years,while her husband,whose primary job kept him occupied for most of the work day,was reimbursed for miles over four years.
apro also obtained reimbursement for costs that included personal expenses such as renovations to the hamiltons home,renovations to the miles parents residence,and various home appliances.eventually,the amount of money coming in to apro for fake charges became so large that in order to sustain the claimed level of expenses over the next that apro would not have to return overpayments to the federal apro principals began to use a variety of other methods to bilk medicare out of taxpayer funds.these methods included their writing checks to employees for expenses or back pay and then requiring the employees to cash the checks and hand the funds back to the apro principals.appellants billed expenses to medicare for two or three times the actual cost incurred.at times,they engaged in more intricate schemes involving the splitting of large reimbursement checks into smaller cashier checks which were then deposited into the apro principals bank accounts or used for personal expenses.on one occasion,hamilton split an apro check into cash and three cashier checks at one bank.she deposited two of the cashier checks into her own account at another bank and used a portion of the funds to obtain a fourth cashier check to purchase a new ford mustang convertible.the third cashier check from the original bank was cashed at the star casino.
beginning in may,palmetto,the health care financing administration hcfa and the texas department of health systematically uncovered apro extensive effort to defraud medicare.that october,medicare acted to stem the flow of federal funds to apro by suspending its provider number.apro filed a federal lawsuit alleging racial bias on the part of hcfa and the texas department of health.the district court preliminarily enjoined medicare to reinstate apro provider status pending the litigation,but this court reversed the grant of relief.see affiliated prof l home health care agency shalala,cir.in june,federal agents executed a search warrant at apro premises and seized various business records.the investigation and raid eventually led to the indictment filed against the four defendants and the convictions here at issue.
ii.discussion 
money laundering promotion convictions 
carrie hamilton and alice miles were convicted on counts of the indictment,which charged them with aiding and abetting money laundering promotion,a crime perpetrated by anyone who 
knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.
a a i.this statute criminalizes all financial transactions that involve funds or property that are derived from specified illegal activity,where the transactions are intentionally aimed at promoting specified unlawful activity.the counts at issue here involved specific payments made by apro for office rent counts and,payroll count,and payroll taxes counts,and.both hamilton and alice miles claim that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support their convictions under this statute.
standard of review 
in evaluating whether the evidence produced at trial is sufficient to support a jury conviction,this court examines whether a rational jury,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,could have found the essential elements of the offense to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states rivera,cir.in reviewing the evidence presented at trial,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury verdict.id.we do not evaluate whether the jury verdict was correct,but rather,whether the jury decision was rational.id.
discussion 
to sustain a conviction under the money laundering promotion statute,the government must show that the defendant conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction,which the defendant then knew involved the proceeds of unlawful activity,with the intent to promote or further unlawful activity.see united states delgado,cir.neither defendant argues on appeal that the financial transactions underlying counts were not in fact conducted,or that the funds used in these transactions were not,at least in part,the proceeds of unlawful activity.rather,both defendants contend that as the funds were used to pay apro ordinary business expenses,the transactions do not demonstrate an intent to promote or further the medicare fraud taking place at apro.
in examining the question of intent necessary for a money laundering promotion conviction,this court has held that the government must present either direct proof of an intent to promote such illegal activity or proof that a given type of transaction,on its face,indicates an intent to promote such illegal activity.see united states brown,cir.absent such proof,this court has held that a defendant may not be convicted where the proceeds of some relatively minor fraudulent transactions are used to pay the operating expenses of an otherwise legitimate business enterprise.id.at.in brown,this court reversed the money laundering promotion convictions of a defendant who deposited fraudulently obtained funds in the operating account of a generally legitimate car dealership and used the funds to pay for a variety of legitimate business expenses the brown court noted that a number of cases in this circuit have cautioned against allowing the money laundering statute to turn into a money spending statute.see id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.as a result,the court held that strict adherence to the specific intent requirement contained in the text of the money laundering promotion statute is important to ensure that only conduct that is really distinct from the underlying specified unlawful activity is punished under this provision.see id.brown emphasized that without such close scrutiny on the question of intent,the money laundering promotion statute would simply provide overzealous prosecutors with a means of imposing additional criminal liability any time a defendant makes benign expenditures with funds derived from unlawful acts.see id.such a result would be inconsistent with the overall statutory scheme created by congress to address money laundering.see id.at discussing,a separate money laundering statute,a,which sets a minimum on prosecutions for the mere expenditure of unlawfully obtained funds.
on the other end of the factual spectrum,however,are cases where,w hen a business as a whole is illegitimate,even individual expenditures that are not intrinsically unlawful can support a promotion money laundering charge.see united states peterson,cir.in peterson,this court upheld the money laundering promotion conviction of a defendant who used fraudulently obtained funds to pay the general operating expenses of a business whose only purpose was to engage in fraudulent transactions.id.at.the peterson court distinguished the real estate sales business in that case from the car dealership in brown because all of the property owners who paid fees to the real estate company were treated to fraudulent misrepresentations.id.at emphasis added.indeed,in peterson,fewer than one percent of the clients received any value for their fees.this court characterized the real estate business in peterson as a sham and a fraudulent telemarketing scheme.see id.at quoting united states reissig,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the question at issue here is whether a rational jury could find that apro,as a whole,was an illegitimate business,such that otherwise normal and legitimate payments for rent counts and,payroll count,and payroll taxes counts,and might properly be understood as evincing carrie hamilton and alice miles specific intent to promote money laundering.this case falls somewhere between brown and peterson in terms of the size and scope of the fraud in relation to apro legitimate business,but the particular payments for which the government indicted apro were quintessentially normal business expenditures.
it appears from the trial record that apro did not simply exist to bilk the federal government out of money.apro patients actually received the home health care services that medicare contracted with apro to provide.even the government indictment avers that the money laundering activities did not begin until august,nearly two years after apro was approved by medicare.given that apro was in business for four and a half years,from december through june,and that actual patients received actual health care services,a rational jury could not find that apro was a wholly illegitimate enterprise along the lines of the real estate scam in peterson.
at the same time,however,it is important to note that the scale and scope of the fraud taking place at apro certainly exceeded the relatively minor fraudulent transactions at issue in brown.see peterson,at.percent of apro patients were medicare beneficiaries,and an equivalent amount of its revenue during its entire existence derived from the medicare program.the apro defendants engaged in a wide range of activities that fraudulently overcharged medicare and netted them a substantial amount of illicit revenue.the appellants were held jointly and severally liable for restitution of over million in overcharges to medicare.
while this substantial level of fraud provided a good reason for the government aggressive prosecution of the apro principals,it does not suffice to prove their specific intent to promote the medicare fraud by means of rent,payroll and payroll tax expenditures.appellants prosecution for these payments falls far closer to the facts in brown than to peterson.in brown,as in this case,when a legitimate business pays customary,reasonable and legal operating expenses,neither it nor its principals should be subject to money laundering promotion for those payments.the crime of money laundering promotion is aimed not at maintaining the legitimate aspects of a business nor at proscribing all expenditures of gains,but only at transactions which funnel gains directly back into the criminal venture.to hold otherwise would be to ignore brown s warning that the money laundering statute is not a mere money spending statute.
this is not to suggest that the government can never hold the principals of a legitimate business responsible for money laundering promotion.the correct distinction,for purposes of inferring specific intent,is between payments that further or promote illegal money laundering with gains and payments that represent customary costs of running a legal business.see,brown,at noting that the government could have selected transactions such as the deposit of illegally obtained funds into a business account as the basis for a money laundering promotion charge rather than indicting appellant for the benign expenditures at issue there.
for these reasons,we reverse the convictions of carrie hamilton and alice miles on counts for money laundering promotion.
medicare kickback convictions 
carrie hamilton and alice miles were also convicted on counts of the indictment,which charged them with paying healthcare kickbacks in violation of b a,which provides that 
w hoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays any remuneration including any kickback,bribe or rebate directly or indirectly,overtly or covertly,in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program.
this statute criminalizes the payment of any funds or benefits designed to encourage an individual to refer another party to a medicare provider for services to be paid for by the medicare program.the appellants contend that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions on these charges.
the government case rested on evidence that apro paid johnnie and melvin jones,the owners of premier public relations premier,to distribute information regarding apro home health services to doctors in the houston area.the understanding between apro and premier provided that premier would deliver literature and business cards to local medical offices.the jones also occasionally distributed plates of cookies to doctors offices.when a physician determined that home health care services were needed for a patient,the physician office might contact johnnie jones,who would then furnish apro with the patient name and medicare number for billing purposes.apro paid premier for each medicare patient who became an apro client as a result of premier efforts.
according to the government,apro payments to premier constituted improper kickbacks under the medicare kickback statute.in order to obtain a conviction under this statute,the government must show that a defendant knowingly and willfully made a payment or offer of payment,as an inducement to the payee,t
