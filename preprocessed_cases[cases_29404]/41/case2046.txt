erineo cano,a former prison inmate,appeals from the district court judgment in his action alleging deliberate indifference to his mental health needs in violation of the eighth amendment count i,and violations of his right to freely exercise his religious beliefs and to have access to the courts,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments counts ii and iii.the district court granted summary judgment on count i,and dismissed counts ii and iii for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,pursuant to the prison litigation reform act plra,a.on appeal,cano challenges both decisions,as well as the district court rulings denying him appointment of counsel and in forma pauperis ifp status.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
cano filed his original district court complaint on december.cano alleged that while an inmate in a facility run by the arizona department of corrections az doc,he did not receive proper medical care for his mental illness,with the result that he became suicidal.although he was seen regularly by mental health care professionals at the prison where he was housed,he was unhappy with the quality of care he was offered,and disagreed with the types of medications he was prescribed.the record also indicates a diagnosis of malingering and violence,the latter of which along with and his own personal requests prohibited him from actively participating in the mental health program.
on may,cano filed a motion for leave to add claims and a first amended complaint fac.the fac added counts ii and iii for alleged violations of cano first and fourteenth amendment rights.count ii claimed that cano freedom of religion was violated because kosher food was not made available to him count iii argued that he was denied meaningful access to the courts because a litigation manual he had previously utilized had been removed from the prison library,and no other litigation manual ha d been substituted.
on september,defendant schriro,director of the az doc,filed a b motion to dismiss counts ii and iii as barred by a for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.cano argued that he exhausted administrative remedies.
the district court,however,dismissed counts ii and iii without prejudice on the grounds that the administrative appeals submitted by cano as to those counts were dated after the filing date of the initial complaint.thus,although the fac was filed after the administrative appeals for counts ii and iii were allegedly exhausted,the court,using the date of the original complaint,found that counts ii and iii were not administratively exhausted as required under the plra.because it found the date of the original complaint to be dispositive of the exhaustion issue,the district court did not reach the question of whether cano,in fact,had followed proper prison procedures in pursuing administrative remedies as to counts ii and iii.
cano filed a timely notice of appeal,and the appellate commissioner appointed counsel for purposes of this appeal only.during the pendency of this appeal,cano was released from prison.
appellees argue that cano release from prison renders his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief moot.
we have held that a prisoner claims for punitive and compensatory relief may remain viable after his release.mcquillion schwarzenegger,cir if the plaintiff is entitled to collect damages in the event that it succeeds on the merits,the case does not become moot even though declaratory and injunctive relief are no longer of any use.quoting z channel.home box office,cir see also rhodes robinson,cir i t is firmly established that claims for monetary damages survive a prisoner release from the officers custody.
here,cano sought not only preliminary and permanent injunctions,but also declaratory relief and punitive and compensatory damages.consistent with case law,cano claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are mooted by his release from prison,but his other claims may not be.
at best,cano claim regarding inadequate medical care amounts to a difference of opinion as to his medical treatment,which is not actionable.the supreme court has held that to show an eighth amendment violation a prisoner must typically show that a defendant acted,not just negligently,but with deliberate indifference.minneci pollard.in the instant case,there is no evidence that cano medical needs were treated with deliberate indifference.
rather,the record indicates that the defendants were very responsive to cano complaints.the record is replete with health need request forms filed by cano and the record indicates that cano was seen by mental health care employees regularly for his complaints.for example,cano was seen 
times by psychologist taylor in a period 
times by psychologist mertens between and 
by three psychiatrists and ten psychologists or psychology associates a total of approximately times in 
by one psychiatrist and fifteen psychologists or psychology associates a total of approximately times in 
by two psychiatrists and nine psychologists or psychology associates over times in 
by one psychiatrist and two psychologists five times in prior to his release in february of that year.
further,there is a great deal of evidence that his suicide threats were manipulative in nature.cano was placed on suicide watch times during months as a result of his statements that he was thinking of harming himself.the record indicates that during visits to his cell,cano chief complaint was boredom,and he sought a television and radio in his cell.for instance,cano repeatedly stated that he need ed a change of scenery or that he needed a tv or radio for diversion.that is what i would have gotten out of the mental health program.
further,cano was an uncooperative and difficult patient.the record indicates that cano repeatedly and regularly exhibited violent behaviors and therefore could not be placed in a lower custody part of the prison a unit other than the special management unit smu or the pod in the mental health unit because he was a danger to himself others.for example,the prison daily visit logs show statements by cano such as i feel like harming someone else.you fwith me,i get you.you fwith me,i mess you up.i feeling angry.i am not ready to go back today.get the faway from my face.i had an episode yesterday i punched my bunk for minutes.and i cut your head off.there are also documented refusals by cano to take his medication in the record there are countless forms in the record demonstrating by staff,including visits to check on cano mood,continuous progress reports,psychiatric,mental health treatment plans,and watch discharge summaries.
in short,the record indicates that prison mental healthcare professionals were incredibly responsive to cano needs and no reasonable trier of fact could find that there was deliberate indifference to cano complaints.therefore,the district court grant of summary judgment on count i is affirmed 
cano also appeals the district court denial of his request for appointed counsel.the decision to appoint counsel in a civil suit is one of discretion and a district court determination will be overturned only for abuse of that discretion.palmer valdez,cir.a district court must determine whether a there is a likelihood of success on the merits and b the prisoner is unable to articulate his claims in light of the complexity of the legal issues involved.id.none of these factors is dispositive rather they must be considered cumulatively.id.
in the instant case,there are no exceptional circumstances,because cano is unlikely to succeed on the merits,and cano has been able to articulate his legal claims in light of the complexity of the issues involved.therefore,we affirm the district court denial of cano request for counsel.
cano argues that the district court,in granting summary judgment as to count i and denying the appointment of counsel,improperly relied on hutchinson united states,cir,for the proposition that it was incumbent on him to provide an affidavit or deposition of an expert to establish the standard of care.it appears that the district court may have overstated the need f
