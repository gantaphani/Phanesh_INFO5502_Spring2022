after a trial,a jury found that michael salem,did not violate the standard of care during his performance of gastric bypass surgery on sharon boone henderson.appellant now seeks to overturn the jury verdict on the ground that the district court improperly excluded evidence that supported her claim that salem made a critical mistake during surgery.appellant claims further that salem surgical error both breached the applicable standard of care and caused her not to be able to achieve anticipated weight loss.the district court found that the disputed report relating to another patient of salem,along with related deposition limited probative value that was significantly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and the potential to confuse the jury.
we find that the district court greatly overestimated the potential for prejudice and confusion,and seriously underestimated the probative value of the disputed report in light of appellant need to impeach and rebut the case presented by appellees as well as to rehabilitate her expert witness.therefore,we vacate the jury verdict,reverse the judgment on the verdict,and remand the case for a new trial.
background 
henderson surgery 
sharon boone henderson weighed pounds by the time she was years old.after attempting and failing to lose weight by resort to numerous diets,henderson decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery.in the procedure,a small new stomach or pouch is surgically formed from the top portion of the existing stomach by using several rows of surgical staples to separate the pouch from the remainder of the stomach.after the pouch is formed,the small intestine is severed a few inches below the bottom of the original stomach and then attached to the pouch,thereby permitting food to bypass the main stomach chamber.
the new connection formed between the pouch and the small intestine is called an anastomosis.the anastomosis and truncated stomach pouch are designed to reduce food intake by creating a sense of fullness.surgery also restricts the ability of the digestive tract to absorb nutrients from the food being consumed.
henderson surgery was performed at george washington university medical center gw medical center by salem on december.within the first six weeks of her surgery,henderson lost to pounds.sometime during the following spring or summer,however,henderson began to notice that the small portions of food that were supposed to satisfy her appetite did not do so.despite feeling as if she was starving her self,trial tr.at,henderson nevertheless stuck to her small portion regimen through the remainder of.by the end of,her weight had dropped to pounds.
in early,however,henderson suddenly gained pounds.as a result,she attempted to contact salem to discuss her situation.when she called gw medical center,however,she was informed that he was no longer employed there.instead,she was referred to paul lin.
henderson met with lin in april,at which time he suggested that perhaps henderson stomach pouch had expanded.he noted that it might be possible to remedy this problem with a second procedure.henderson agreed to the surgery,which lin performed in october.during the procedure,lin reduced the size of henderson gastric pouch from to cubic centimeters,although he did not reduce the diameter of her anastomosis.
in,henderson had an endoscopy done to assess the effects of her second surgery.ahmed hegab,the gastroenterologist who performed the endoscopy,informed henderson that,in addition to having acid reflux disease,he believed that her anastomosis was too large for effective weight loss.he suggested the possibility of further surgery.at the time of trial,henderson had yet to pursue that course.
activities 
henderson,along with two,helen jones and janice grant,filed suit against salem and george washington university on february.jones and grant were also former patients of salem,undergoing their own surgeries on april,and february,respectively.the three plaintiffs together alleged that salem used improper surgical techniques,resulting in stomach pouches and anastomoses that were too large to permit them to achieve their desired weight loss.
in response to the complaint,appellees filed,inter alia,a motion to sever the three charges.on january,the district court found that,a lthough each trial will involve some overlap of expert testimony,the facts and circumstances of each plaintiff claim vary so substantially that the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure permissive joinder of not met.grant salem,ca,mem.op.at,joint appendix.thus,the court ruled that the three claims in this case are misjoined and shall be severed going forward.id.
by the time the motion to sever was decided,salem had already been deposed.the parties anticipated the court severance ruling,however,and thus agreed to segregate the deposition questions to the circumstances of each plaintiff wherever possible.nevertheless,one overlapping line of questioning involved a report prepared by paul steinwald,the surgical resident who worked with salem on the helen jones surgery jones report.the jones report stated,inter alia,that salem had created a anastomosis during the size that,if measured internally,is generally considered to violate the standard of care.during his deposition,salem conceded that he consistent ly made anastomoses the same size during each surgery.salem dep.at.he acknowledged that the characterization in the jones report was accurate,although he qualified his answer by suggesting that the report described the external anastomosis measurement salem speculated that the internal measurement was likely between a centimeter or more.id.at.
c.the trial 
recognizing the potential importance of the description in the jones report,henderson pressed from the beginning of trial to have salem deposition with attached exhibits,including the jones report,included in the record.appellees sought to exclude the jones report and the relevant deposition testimony of salem,arguing that those pieces of evidence would unfairly bootstrap the alleged negligence relevant only to the helen jones litigation into the case at bar.appellees also contended that appellant was attempting to omit deposition passages where salem explained that he made the external diameters of his anastomoses three centimeters,while the internal diameters were generally one centimeter.
at the outset of appellant case,the district court ruled that,given the early stage of the trial and therefore the court unfamiliarity with the depositions and the lines of inquiry to be pursued by the parties,it was appropriate to deny appellant request to admit the jones report and attached deposition testimony.in making that determination,the trial judge stated that he was concerned that something taken out of context could in some way unfairly prejudice the defendant and confuse the jurors.trial tr.at.more specifically,the judge stated 
now,the court is concerned,because this deposition preceded its ruling on severance,that any reference in the depositions to multiple cases could lead the jurors to the natural inference,to some degree,that the lawsuit initially was a lawsuit with regard to more than one case.and reasons which they,of course,are not privy to nor can be privy to,that they may be in some way,through their own natural inferences,prejudiced by thinking that,oh,there is more than one suit against this doctor this is only one of a series of suits,which was the very prejudice,in no small part,that this court was concerned about avoiding by granting the severance motion.
id.at.in an attempt to mitigate the effect of this ruling on henderson,the district court permitted her to ask questions about the contents of the jones report as hypotheticals.the district court said 
henderson counsel will be free,in crafting his hypotheticals,to use the same facts that are in the record as it related to the jones case,without identifying the jones case,but whatever the facts are that were in the jones case,he can put that into his,without specifically referencing the jones case.
id.at.the district court concluded by noting that it would be willing to revisit the issue after the testimony of appellant expert witness,james balliro.thus,the issue of what can be read from the depositions of can be read to this jury such that there is no danger of a prejudicial inference being drawn by the jury is still an open question.id.
following appellees of balliro,henderson again sought to admit the previously rejected jones report and relevant deposition testimony of salem.she noted that,during,appellees asked balliro a series of questions about how he arrived at his opinion in a report that salem had constructed a anastomosis.appellees noted specifically that there was nothing in henderson report to indicate the size of her anastomosis.according to henderson,this line of questioning unfairly undermined balliro credibility,because he was unable to state that,in part,he explicitly relied on the jones report in drawing the conclusion that henderson anastomosis was three centimeters.the district court again refused to admit the jones report,and instead stated that,to the extent what you are pointing out is something you can go into on redirect,you are going to have free reign to do it.you can rehabilitate.trial tr.at.
soon after this instruction,appellant asked balliro on redirect examination about his previous exchange with defense counsel on 
q thank you.now,you were asked some questions about what you relied on for the opinion that your report,that salem fashioned a anastomosis.
q and did you rely on salem deposition for that opinion 
q and did you rely on another operative report referred to in that deposition 
id.at.defense counsel objected before balliro could respond to the last question,and the parties conducted a bench conference on the record.henderson counsel indicated that he thought his line of questioning was rehabilitative and therefore had been sanctioned by the court.the trial judge had a different view,however,responding that rehabilitation did not include any drifting into this other operative report which could have unnecessary prejudicial effect on the defendant.id.at.
henderson attempted yet again to introduce the jones report following the defense direct examination of ronald chamberlain,gw medical center chief surgical resident at the time henderson original surgery was performed.chamberlain testified that he served as salem first assistant in approximately to surgeries,including henderson.he maintained that on each occasion they attempted to make the anastomosis between and centimeters in diameter.henderson used this testimony to renew her effort to admit the jones report,arguing that chamberlain was making a claim about salem standard practice that appeared to run counter to what was clearly stated in the report.the district court again denied henderson request,finding that chamberlain testimony was limited only to his experience with salem,and he was not the resident who assisted salem during the jones surgery.thus,the district court ruled that henderson must be limited to chamberlain experience working on surgeries with salem.
in a final attempt to convince the trial judge to admit the jones report,henderson argued that the admission of the evidence caused no prejudice to defendants,let alone unfair prejudice.she noted that salem deposition made no mention of other litigation,and,even if it did,the parties could craft curative language to ensure that no juror could infer that salem was subject to separate lawsuits.
the district court found this argument unavailing.the trial judge indicated that his ruling would not change,and added that the jones report was in no way crucial to henderson case.he specifically stated that henderson was pursuing a number of avenues to demonstrate that salem violated the standard of care,so that by denying the admission of these pieces of evidence,only a small portion of her case was affected.
following a trial,on january,the jury returned a verdict finding that salem had not breached the standard of care owed to henderson.henderson now appeals,seeking a reversal of the jury verdict and a remand for a new trial.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a trial court may prevent the introduction of evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.fed.evid.in considering a trial judge application of rule,the supreme court has stated the standard of review as abuse of discretion.see,old chief united states,d united states abel,d.the court has added no qualifiers.this court,however,has described the standard of review applicable to rule judgments as both abuse of discretion and grave abuse of discretion.compare united states king,abuse of discretion,and united states evans,same,with united states watson,grave abuse,and united states whitmore,same.it is clear that there is no material difference between abuse of discretion and grave abuse of discretion with respect to the standard of review relating to judgments rendered under rule.rather,under either formulation,the appellate court is extremely wary of the legitimate balancing of interests undertaken by the trial judge.we defer no more and no less under either characterization of the standard of review.grave abuse of discretion is nothing more than a shorthand expression of wariness.
and the court use of the word grave certainly does not suggest an insurmountable standard of review.in the watson decision,for example,we used the phrase grave abuse,and yet noted that,in applying rule,the district court must be cautious against excluding evidence where a party is seeking to impeach a witness whose credibility could have an important influence on the outcome of the trial.at.likewise,in united states cassell,which also employs the grave abuse language in describing the standard of review with respect to judgments under rule,the decision tellingly states that rule tilts,as do the rules as a whole,toward the admission of evidence in close cases.id.at quotation and citation omitted.in performing the balancing test required under rule,it is a sound rule that the balance should generally be struck in favor of admission when the evidence indicates a close relationship to the event charged.id.quotation and citation omitted.
in short,in all cases arising under rule,we assume that the trial judge generally is in the best position to balance the probative value of the disputed evidence against the risks of prejudice and confusion and,thus,retains broad discretion to decide the matter.we have never suggested,however,that the trial judge retains unfettered discretion in the application of rule.when the district court excludes admissible evidence based on an understatement of the probative value of the excluded evidence,a miscalculation of the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or an erroneous calculation of whether the probative value of the excluded evidence is substantially outweighed by these dangers or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence,then the trial court judgment under rule is subject to reversal.
b.the alleged dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the jury 
the district court maintained throughout trial that it was concerned that the admission of the jones report would unfairly prejudice appellees and potentially lead to jury confusion.the danger presented by those issues,it believed,would substantially outweigh any probative value offered by the jones report.in terms of unfair prejudice,the district court was of the opinion that the introduction of the jones report might undermine the court earlier decision to sever the henderson,grant,and jones malpractice claims.this was a possibility,according to the district court,because the admission of a report relating to someone other than henderson might lead the jurors to conclude that there was also another lawsuit pending against salem.as for jury confusion,the district court stated,with little explanation,that the jurors might have difficulty sorting through the distinct issues relevant to the jones and henderson surgeries.
appellant does not suggest that it would not be prejudicial for the jury to learn about the other lawsuits rather,her claim is that the danger of that outcome was quite small.at trial,appellant noted that nothing in the relevant portions of the jones report and in salem corresponding deposition testimony implied that there had been other litigation.in addition,appellant stated that,as a precaution,the trial court could have issued a curative instruction to temper any potentially prejudicial language in salem deposition testimony.
henderson argument is compelling.on the record at hand,there is little reason to believe that the admission of the jones report would have led to the outcomes feared by the district court.the introduction of the report would have been for the limited purpose of demonstrating that salem had in fact made a anastomosis in another surgery.nothing in the report refers to other litigation.moreover,in the relevant portions of the disputed deposition testimony,neither henderson counsel nor salem suggests that another lawsuit has been filed.neither the jones report nor the related deposition testimony offers the slightest hint that jones had filed a lawsuit against salem.
in short,the district court concern over unfair prejudice is unfounded.and appellees bald assertion that the introduction of the jones report and the discussion of it in salem deposition would lead jurors to unfairly prejudge salem is specious.the jones report undoubtedly would have assisted henderson in her cause of action against salem.but that is the function of probative evidence,and it surely is not the measure of unfair prejudice under rule.
the district court concern over possible jury confusion is equally misplaced.appellant made it clear that the jones report would be offered to make a limited,easily understood point relating to the size of the anastomosis described on page three of the report.there was no serious possibility that the jury would confuse the jones and henderson surgeries,because,as appellant made clear,the sole question posed by the jones report was whether the language used to document the jones surgery described a anastomosis measured internally or externally.
it is extremely unlikely,as appellees contend,that the admission of the jones report would lead to a trial within a trial.salem admitted that the jones report was dictated and recorded accurately,see salem dep.at,so appellees have raised no issue over the authenticity or veracity of the report.the only dispute raised by the report is whether it describes the internal or external diameter of the anastomosis.this is a matter about which experts testify all the time in jury trials.we assume that jurors will comprehend what they hear,especially as the issues are amplified by direct,cross,and redirect examination,jury instructions,and closing arguments.
appellees argue that if the jones report had been admitted into evidence,they would have been forced to call paul steinwald,the surgical resident who assisted salem during the jones surgery,as if to suggest that his testimony might be too complex for the jury to understand.this argument borders on frivolous.if called,steinwald testimony would have focused on the question of what the reference to three centimeters in the jones report was meant to convey.this certainly would not have been unduly confusing to the jury,any more than the other technical information offered by appellees to defend themselves against henderson claim.
finally,relying upon weil seltzer,appellees contend that evidence concerning a doctor treatment of former patients should be analyzed under rule b to see if it qualifie s for admission under rule b limited purposes.br.for appellees at.assuming,as the parties do here,that a physician prior conduct does not rise to the level of the nonvolitional,habitual type that ensures its probative value under rule as habit evidence,see weil,at,and speaking only with respect to the jones report,we agree.rule b provides that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,although former patient evidence may be admissible for other purposes,to show plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident,weil,at discussing rule b.in weil,the estate of a doctor former patient sued for wrongful death,because the patient had been given steroids for a prolonged period while having been led to be believe he was receiving antihistamines.id.at.five other patients testified that the doctor had also prescribed steroids for them while representing the drugs to be antihistamines or decongestants.id.at.after concluding that prescribing steroids did not amount to a habit under rule,we noted that the plaintiff was essentially trying to introduce bad acts testimony under rule b this evidence of the doctor treatment of the former patients was clearly an attempt to show that the doctor treated weil in conformity with his treatment of the five testifying patients.id.at.
if henderson only possessed and sought to introduce the jones report,given the specific content of that report,weil would control and this matter would be an easy one under rule b.in other words,henderson could not introduce the report to show that because salem improperly created a anastomosis in another patient,he must have done so in an unrelated surgery as well.see id.evidence that is not admissible under rule b would be undoubtedly prejudicial to the defense.what makes the issue of unfair prejudice more challenging in this case is,as we shall discuss,salem having tied the size of henderson anastomosis to the size of jones anastomosis.id.for the former patient testimony to be at all probative it must show that the doctor responded the same way with each patient as he did with the testifying patient.we need not,and do not,express any opinion,however,on whether,given salem testimony,appellees would suffer unfair prejudice with the admission of the jones report as part of henderson direct case,because the district court did not reach an evidentiary ruling considering rule b as part of its rule balancing,and regardless of whether our standard of review would permit reversal for keeping the jones report out as affirmative evidence,it most assuredly was an abuse of discretion to keep the report out as impeachment,rebuttal,and rehabilitative evidence in light of appellees subsequent conduct,as shall become clear.
in sum,there is very little to support the district court findings that admission of the jones report and the related deposition testimony would result in danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.the record in this case simply does not bear out the concerns raised by appellees and credited by the district court.the only remaining question,then,is whether the district court acted within its permissible discretion in finding that the probative value of the excluded evidence was so slight that it was substantially outweighed by the insignificant indications of possible prejudice and confusion to the jury.the record in this case clearly belies this conclusion.
probative value of the excluded evidence 
the district court found that the jones report had limited probative value,in large part,because it believed that henderson could achieve her evidentiary objectives by posing hypothetical questions based on the text of the report without mentioning the report existence.the district court further minimized the probative value of the jones report by suggesting that henderson had no great need to introduce the report.on this score,the trial court perceived that henderson had other evidence beyond the report to support her anastomosis theory,and also observed that an oversized anastomosis was just one of four theories of liability she furthered.
appellant contends that the district court apparently misunderstood the importance to plaintiff of being able to rely on the jones report itself,not merely hypothetical questions based on the text of the report.in other words,henderson forcefully argues that,in presenting her case to the j
