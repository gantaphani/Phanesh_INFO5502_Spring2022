background 
barker was employed as an itinerant resource specialist program teacher for students with disabilities within the alternative education program of the riverside county office of education from may,through august.indeed,barker was the most experienced special education teacher at the riverside county office of education.barker was regularly asked by other teachers to interpret educational test results,and she received three or four telephone calls per day from her colleagues requesting her opinion and assistance in regard to special education issues with students.
beginning as early as,barker voiced concerns to her supervisors that the special education services provided by the riverside county office of education to its disabled students were noncompliant with federal and state law.in may,barker and a coworker filed a class discrimination complaint with the department of education office for civil rights.the class discrimination complaint filed with the office for civil rights alleged that the riverside county office of education denied its disabled students a free appropriate public education that they are entitled to receive under federal and state law.
in june,barker supervisors at the riverside county office of education first learned that barker filed the class discrimination complaint with the department of education office for civil rights.in the constructive termination action now before us,barker alleges that her supervisors then retaliated against her throughout the following school year by 
intimidating barker for filing the class discrimination complaint with the office for civil rights 
failing to respond to barker emails and phone calls 
excluding barker from important staff meetings 
changing barker work assignments to sites further from her home 
reducing barker caseload even though the riverside county office of education alternative education disabled student population increased and 
refusing to allow barker to fill in for other teachers during their vacations.
barker further alleged that she was constructively terminated on august,because her supervisors subjected her to an intolerable work environment.
on july,barker submitted a written complaint to the department of education office for civil rights,alleging that the riverside county office of education retaliated against her for advocating on behalf of her students with disabilities and for filing a complaint with the office for civil rights.the office for civil rights subsequently conducted an investigation into barker complaint by gathering evidence through interviews with barker and fifteen current and former riverside county office of education staff and administrators,and reviewing documents and records submitted by barker and the riverside county office of education.
on june,the office for civil rights determined that the preponderance of the evidence showed that the riverside county office of education retaliated against barker in violation of section and title ii the office for civil rights further stated that a dvocacy on behalf of disabled students on issues related to their civil rights,and the filing of office for civil rights complaints,are protected activities under section and title ii.
barker then filed a complaint in federal district court contending that the riverside county office of education violated the provisions of both of the rehabilitation act of and title ii of the americans with disabilities act by retaliating against her after she advocated on behalf of her students with disabilities.in august,following the riverside county office of education.b motion,the district court found that barker did not have standing to sue under either statute and dismissed her claim with prejudice.barker timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
section of the rehabilitation act of 
barker contends that she has standing to sue her employer,the riverside county office of education,for retaliating against her pursuant to section of the rehabilitation act.she argues that section grants standing to individuals who are retaliated against for attempting to protect the rights of disabled people,even if they themselves are not disabled.the riverside county office of education,however,argues that because barker failed to allege that she was a qualified individual with a disability,see a,she can not avail herself of the rehabilitation act protection against retaliation.according to the riverside county office of education,section was not intended to provide redress of employment claims for persons who are neither disabled themselves,nor have any close relationship to a disabled person.contrary to the riverside county office of education arguments,we find that the provision of section grants standing to people who are retaliated against for attempting to protect the rights of the disabled.
in determining whether barker has standing under section,we begin by examining the statute plain meaning.see molski cable,cir.when the statutory language is clear and consistent with the statutory scheme at issue,the plain language of the statute is conclusive and the judicial inquiry is at an end.id.section a states
