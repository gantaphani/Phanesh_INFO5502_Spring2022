plaintiffs traverse bay area intermediate school district and traverse city area public schools collectively school districts appeal the district court order dismissing their amended complaint against defendants michigan department of education mde,michigan department of labor and economic growth dleg,and michigan state office of administrative hearings and rules soahr collectively state defendants,for their alleged failure to maintain procedural due process protections in accordance with the individuals with disabilities in education act,et idea.this appeal presents an issue of first impression in our circuit whether plaintiffs,as local educational agencies,have statutory standing under i a to challenge a state agency compliance with certain procedural safeguards set forth in b.for the reasons explained below,we hold that the idea does not provide school districts with an express or implied right to compel state defendants compliance with b procedural safeguards,absent an underlying claim that directly involves a disabled child individual educational program.
in exchange for federal funding,the idea requires states to identify,locate,and evaluate a ll children with disabilities residing in the state who are in need of special education and related services a a.a recipient state is required to provide a free appropriate public education fape for any such disabled child.a a.the state local educational,the local school create an individual educational program iep addressing each disabled child special needs.b d.in addition to these substantive obligations,all participating states and local educational agencies are required to establish and maintain certain procedural safeguards to ensure that all disabled children receive a fape.a see keene zelman,app x,cir unpublished discussing idea procedural due process protections.
the idea provides a hearing process through which parents who disagree with the appropriateness of their child iep may seek relief.specifically,a provides 
establishment of procedures 
any state educational agency,state agency,or local educational agency that receives assistance under this subchapter shall establish and maintain procedures in accordance with this section to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education by such agencies.
parents may challenge an iep by filing a complaint against the local educational agency and demanding a due process hearing,at which time they are given an opportunity to voice their concerns to an independent hearing officer iho.b and f.at the conclusion of the hearing,the iho must decide whether the iep satisfies or impedes the child right to a fape.f e.either party may appeal the iho decision to a state level review officer slro.g.finally,any party aggrieved by the slro decision may bring a civil action in state or federal court.i a.
this litigation began when,the parent of a minor child with autism,filed a complaint against school districts asserting that the iep did not fully address her child special needs.see b.before the iho conducted the due process hearing,however,school districts and reached a settlement agreement.nevertheless,a second dispute arose when school districts opposed motion to incorporate the settlement agreement into the order dismissing complaint.
after considering the matter,the iho denied motion to incorporate the settlement agreement.appealed the iho ruling to a slro pursuant to g.the slro agreed with and ordered the incorporation of the parties settlement agreement into the order of dismissal.school districts,aggrieved by this ruling,appealed the slro administrative decision to the united states district court for the western district of michigan pursuant to i a.
on september,school districts filed a complaint against and state defendants seeking declaratory,injunctive,monetary,and equitable relief.counts i and ii alleged breaches of contract against,and counts iii and iv alleged,inter alia,that state defendants unlawfully exercised jurisdiction over administrative appeal.essentially,school districts asserted that state defendants had no authority to adjudicate appeal pursuant to g because all contested iep issues were resolved.and state defendants moved to dismiss school districts complaint.
while the motions to dismiss were pending,the district court permitted school districts to file an amended complaint.the proposed amended complaint contained the original counts,as well as a modified count iv and a new count v,which,like count iv of the original complaint,alleged that state defendants violated the idea when they exercised jurisdiction over administrative appeal.importantly,count v also asserted that state defendants were in violation of b because they were neglecting their ongoing obligation to monitor and enforce the idea procedural safeguards and their duty to supervise soahr implementation of the due process hearing system in michigan.
on july,the district court granted state defendants motion to dismiss in toto and motion to dismiss in part,permitting only count iv to proceed against defendant as an action pursuant to for review of the iho decision.school districts appealed the district court july,order in february.based upon a joint motion filed by and school districts,we remanded that portion of school districts appeal that challenged the dismissal of counts i and ii of the amended complaint and certain orders regarding attorneys fees.
in may,the district court accepted and school districts stipulation to dismiss all pending claims between them with prejudice.thus,the operative notice of appeal concerns only the district court july,order granting state defendants motion to dismiss counts of the amended complaint.school districts timely appeal that order.
as a preliminary matter,although school districts present three questions for our review,we may resolve their appeal by answering one question whether plaintiffs,as local educational agencies,possess a private right pursuant to i a to challenge a state agency compliance with certain procedural safeguards set forth in b of the idea we hold that they do not.

as the supreme court explained in alexander sandoval,
p rivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by congress.the judicial task is to interpret the statute congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.statutory intent on this latter point is determinative.without it,a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one,no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter,or how compatible with the statute.raising up causes of action where a statute has not created them may be a proper function for courts,but not for federal tribunals.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in accordance with these principles,we must first examine the statutory language to determine whether the idea creates an express right for a local educational agency to maintain a civil action against a state educational agency for its failure to comply with b.if no express right exists in the statutory text,we must then determine whether the idea creates an implied right of action.
