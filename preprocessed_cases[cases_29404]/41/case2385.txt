the alaska department of health and social services hereinafter the state petitions for review of a final determination by the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms or agency disapproving a proposed medicaid state plan amendment that would alter the rate at which the federal government reimburses state expenditures on behalf of patients at indian tribal health facilities.the administrator rejected the proposed amendment on two alternative grounds that it was inconsistent with the statutory requirement of efficiency,economy,and quality of care and that it failed to comply with a regulation governing payment ceilings.the state challenges the administrator decision as arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.we conclude that the administrator interpretations of the statute and regulation were permissible and deny the petition for review.
background 
statutory framework 
medicaid is a cooperative program through which the federal government reimburses states for certain medical expenses incurred on behalf of needy persons.wilder.hosp.ass n,d.participation by states is voluntary,but those that choose to participate must comply both with statutory requirements imposed by the medicaid act and with regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services.see also orthopaedic hosp.belshe,cir.
to qualify for federal assistance,participating states must submit to the secretary,and have approved,a plan for medical assistance that describes the nature and scope of the state program.wilder,at.the medicaid act prescribes a laundry list of requirements that this state plan must satisfy,a,and an extensive body of regulations implements these requirements.the secretary shall approve any state plan or amendment that fulfills these statutory and regulatory conditions,b,and has delegated this authority to the cms administrator.b.
under normal circumstances,if the administrator approves the state plan,the federal government reimburses the state for a fixed percentage of certain expenses that the state incurs on behalf of individuals.this percentage,known as the federal medical assistance percentage fmap,varies from state to state.health care providers bill the state,the state pays the providers,and the federal government reimburses the state at the fmap,for alaska in,was.the state is responsible for the balance.in theory,this arrangement incentivizes states to keep rates at efficient levels,because they share financial responsibility for medicaid costs with the federal government.the tribal facilities at issue in this case are unique,however,and by statute receive fmap.see b there are seven such in anchorage and six in rural areas.
assuming that its plan meets federal requirements,a state has considerable discretion in administering its medicaid program,including setting reimbursement rates.see lewis hegstrom,cir.the statutory requirement at issue here provides that a state plan must 
provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care.
a a hereinafter a.neither the medicaid act,nor its implementing regulations,define the terms efficiency,economy,or quality of care.however,since,a has been the principal statutory authority for a series of upper payment limit upl regulations that cap state reimbursement rates to promote economy and efficiency.at.these regulations have been modified several times in recent years to respond to concerns about states inappropriate use of intergovernmental transfers to fund their medicaid programs.
regulatory framework 
an intergovernmental transfer igt is a mechanism by which states use local,rather than state,dollars to fund the state share of medicare expenditures.such typically require that public entities at the city or county level transfer funds to the specifically sanctioned by the medicare act,which grants states the flexibility to fund up to of their share of medicare expenditures with local dollars.at.although the agency recognizes that the use of igts is protected by statute,in its view that flexibility has been used in recent years to establish funding arrangements that are excessive and abusive and do not assure that federal medicaid funding is spent for medicaid covered services provided to medicaid eligible individuals.id.at.
in,audits by the office of the inspector general and the general accounting office revealed a relationship between igt misuse and excessive federal medicaid spending.the agency,concluding that its upl regulations created a financial incentive for igt abuse,modified them by rule.id.at.in short,the upls placed a single upper limit on aggregate payments made to several categories of providers,including i state facilities,ii,city and county facilities,and iii private facilities.this allowed states to set reimbursement rates for city and county facilities at relatively high levels,and other facilities at relatively low levels,while still complying with the overall aggregate upl.at.because the federal government reimburses states for a fixed percentage of their medicaid expenses,the higher rates at local facilities led to higher federal matching payments.id.at.and,as these local facilities are public entities,the majority of excess federal matching payments could be returned,via igts,from local providers to the states.the states ultimately used the excess federal dollars to fund their own share of medicaid sometimes for wholly unrelated purposes.id.
the agency determined that this practice,which effectively replaced state medicaid dollars with federal medicaid dollars,was not consistent with the statutory requirements that medicaid payments be economical and efficient.id.to remedy this problem,and to reduce the incentive for abuse,the agency revised the upl regulations.specifically,it retained the upper limit on overall aggregate payments to all facilities,and implemented separate aggregate limits for both state facilities and facilities.
however,indian health services facilities and tribal facilities were specifically excepted from the scope of these new regulations.instead,these facilities were made subject to a separate upl for other facilities,which provides 
the state agency may pay the customary charges of the provider but must not pay more than the prevailing charges in the locality for comparable services under comparable circumstances.
see.at.in proposing this exception,the agency explained that we excluded ihs facilities because we believe there is little incentive for states to pay enhanced rates to these facilities.rates to these facilities are generally set by the state in accordance with rates published by the federal government.at.its concern,rather,was that categorizing them as public facilities within the upls may enable states to set lower payments for the ihs and tribal facilities,and set payments for government operated providers at higher levels and still comply with the aggregate upls.at.therefore,to avoid these types of incentives,the agency excluded ihs facilities from the upls.id.
c.the state plan amendment 
shortly after the amendments to the upls,alaska submitted state plan amendment to the agency.it provided 
under agreement with a tribal health facility provider the alaska department of health and social services may pay the customary charges of the provider but must not pay more than the prevailing charges in the locality for comparable services under comparable circumstances.such a payment is subject to the payment limits at cfr.
the text of the proposed amendment thus tracks verbatim the upl that the amendments made applicable to the tribal facilities at issue.in response to the agency request for clarification,the state explained that,to receive the additional federal revenue generated by the amendment,the tribal facilities will be expected to enter into an igt with the state,under which the facilities would retain just of the additional federal monies.finally,the state indicated that,should the proposed amendment take effect,additional federal payments would amount to nearly million a year.
the agency disapproved the proposed amendment as inconsistent with a,primarily because the proposed rates would substantially exceed the ihs published rates on which federal payments have historically been based.it further explained that the ihs rates are based on an analysis of statewide costs of the alaska ihs facilities and that,while it might consider a request for a higher rate if supported by data showing costs that were not considered by ihs in setting the published rates,alaska provided no such data to substantiate its proposed rates.the agency concluded that,absent such data,the proposed rates are not consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care under a.
the state petitioned for reconsideration and,after briefing and a formal hearing,the hearing officer recommended that the disapproval of the proposed amendment be affirmed because it was not consistent with either a or.the administrator agreed and,in a reasoned opinion,affirmed disapproval of the amendment.in re the disapproval of the alaska state plan amendment,cms administrator june.
ii.standard of review 
under the administrative procedure act,we may set aside formal agency action only if arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a wilderness soc y united states fish wildlife,cir en banc,amended by cir.factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence.bear lake watch,ferc,cir.
a n agency rule is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

iii.discussion 
the administrator rejected the proposed amendment on two alternative grounds that it was inconsistent with the statutory requirement of efficiency,economy,and quality of care under a and that it failed to comply with the upl set forth in.examining each ground in turn,we conclude that either is independently adequate to support disapproval.
in concluding that the amendment was inconsistent with a,the administrator first determined that the upl regulations promulgated pursuant to that section are not that section sole requirement rather,the statute requires that rates be consistent with efficiency and economy notwithstanding compliance with the upl regulations.she found that the state failed to meet the statutory standard because it submitted no alone an the current ihs rates were inadequate.moreover,she viewed the state insistence that tribal facilities return to the state of the increased federal payments,via igts,as an implicit acknowledgment that the current ihs rates are sufficient.
the state argues that a can not be an independent basis for disapproval of an amendment that complies with upl regulations promulgated pursuant to that section.instead,it urges that compliance with upl regulations conclusively establishes that rates meet the statutory mandate of efficiency and economy it argues that there is no basis whatsoever for review of state rate setting,and therefore that review of rates is an encroachment on state discretion.accordingly,it suggests that it was inappropriate for the administrator to request cost data justifying the rate increase.finally,it emphasizes that igts are protected by statute and fit within current regulations.
chevron deference 
the parties initially disagree about the degree of deference owed to the administrator interpretation of the statutory,the terms efficiency and economy.although we generally afford chevron deference to the agency interpretations of the medicaid act,see,folden.state dep t of social health,cir,the state contends that skidmore deference is instead appropriate because the agency interpretation is contrary to existing regulations and does not bespeak the legislative type of activity that would naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling.united states mead,d.compare chevron nat.res.defense council,d,with skidmore swift.
we disagree.chevron deference is required when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law.mead,at.mead recognized that congress contemplates administrative action with the effect of law when it provides for a relatively formal administrative procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should underlie a pronouncement of such force,and noted that the fruits of rulemaking or formal adjudication receive chevron deference.id.at.see also ins,d giving chevron deference to the bia construction,through adjudication,of ambiguous statutory terms.here,the formal administrative process afforded the state included the opportunities to petition for reconsideration,brief its arguments,be heard at a formal hearing,receive reasoned decisions at multiple levels of review,and submit exceptions to those decisions.these hallmarks of fairness and deliberation are clear evidence that congress intended the administrator final determination to carry the force of law.mead,at.see pharm.rsch.mfrs.of am.thompson,holding that the secretary duty to ensur e that each state plan complies with a vast network of specific statutory requirements constitutes an express delegation of specific interpretative authority that evidences congress intent to imbue the secretary determinations with the force of law see also texas united states dep t of health human,cir applying chevron deference in the context of the disapproval of a medicaid state plan amendment georgia shalala,cir same.
accordingly,to the extent that the state challenges the administrator interpretation of ambiguities in a,we apply the familiar chevron framework.under chevron,i f the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.wilderness soc y,at quoting chevron,at.but,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the issue at hand,then the reviewing court must defer to the agency so long as the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.quoting chevron,at.
construction of a 
before reaching the propriety of the administrator interpretation of a,we first conclude that she permissibly relied on that section as an independent basis for disapproval of the proposed amendment,notwithstanding its compliance with the applicable upl.the statutory text makes clear that the secretary has the,the ensure that each of the statutory prerequisites is satisfied before approving a medicaid state plan amendment.b provides the secretary shall approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in subsection a one such condition is a state plan for medical assistance must provide such methods and procedures as may be necessary to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care.a a.because the secretary is charged with ensuring that the state complies with this statutory mandate,it follows that he can not approve a state plan that does not provide such methods and if it complies with other regulations.
contrary to the state argument that the upl regulations leave no gap to fill,and thus that there is no role here for chevron deference,it is,in fact,possible to violate the broad statute while complying with the upl regulations.although the upl regulations are clearly grounded in economic concerns,in that they proscribe payment levels that exceed certain limits,the terms efficiency and economy are nowhere defined in the medicaid act or its implementing regulations.thus,we can not equate mere compliance with the upl regulations as conclusive proof of compliance with the broader statutory requirement.
in her decision,the administrator concluded that the proposed,by all accounts,would at least double payments to the f
