background 
plaintiffs brought this suit on behalf of individuals and entities who purchased uahc securities during the period from may,through april,to recover damages following the decline in the value of uahc securities.plaintiffs allege that the damages result from defendants failure to disclose the fact that payments were made to senator ford and that these payments violated uahc contract with the state of tennessee.
for purposes of reviewing the district court grant of defendants motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,we accept as true plaintiffs allegations.therefore,the following facts are taken from the complaint 
omnicare is a wholly owned subsidiary of uahc.compl.uahc manages the operations of omnicare.id.
tenncare is owned and operated by the state of tennessee.id.tenncare extended health care coverage to uninsured and uninsurable persons who were not eligible for medicaid.id.enrollees are free to choose the managed care organization mco they wish among those available in the area in which they live.id.
omnicare provides mco services to tenncare pursuant to a contract with the state of tennessee to participate as an mco in the tenncare program.id.the contract is called the amended and restated contractor risk agreement the cra between the state of tennessee,tenncare,and omnicare.id.
from to november,omnicare represented about of uahc revenue and earnings.id.since november,omnicare through the cra has accounted for nearly one hundred percent of uahc annual revenue and earnings and represents uahc primary asset.id.
john ford was,during the class period,an elected tennessee state senator who sat on three legislative committees with tenncare oversight.id.uahc issued a press release on april,admitting to having hired senator ford as a consultant since at least.id.uahc has subsequently admitted to making monthly payments to senator ford of approximately a month for a total of terminating the contract on march.id.
section of the cra prohibits uahc from offering or giving gratuities of any kind to any officials or employees of the state of tennessee.id.payment of any such gratuity permits tenncare to terminate the cra.id.the cra at section also specifically prohibits uahc from either directly or indirectly paying to any officer or employee of the state of tennessee any wages,compensation,or gifts in exchange for acting as an officer,agent,employee,subcontractor or consultant to omnicare without approval from tenncare.id.uahc never sought or obtained the approval of tenncare to make the admitted payments to senator john ford,in direct violation and breach of the cra.id.the cra also specifically prohibits uahc from using any of the revenue earned from the cra to pay the expenses of lobbyists.id.
under section.of the cra,in the event omnicare engages in any act prohibited or restricted by the cra,tenncare may immediately declare a default and terminate the cra and may recover actual damages,including incidental or consequential damages,any other remedy at law or equity and all liquidated damages provided for in the cra.id.
the amended and restated cra signed by omnicare and submitted to tenncare each year during the class period contained material misrepresentations of fact.id.the omnicare payments to senator ford demonstrate that omnicare made a material misrepresentation in breach of the warranties in section,and of the cra.id.t he payments to senator ford subjected omnicare to penalties of up to million.id.t he payments by omnicare also subjected the cra to immediate termination by tenncare,as well as permitted the state of tennessee to place omnicare under administrative supervision,events that would have a catastrophic impact on uahc and its share price.id.
on april,the company issued a press release acknowledging the payments but maintaining that the agreement with senator ford was lawful and complied with the provisions of the tenncare contract.id.
on april,the tennessee commissioner of commerce and insurance issued an order placing omnicare under administrative supervision because of violations of the cra and submission of false information and the making of false statements to tenncare.id.
on april,news of the order caused uahc stock price to immediately drop from about to in heavy trading damaging investors.id.on april,the company issued a press release acknowledging the order and stating that uahc plans on defending against the allegations in the order.id.
since then,the tennessee legislature,tenncare,and the tennessee department of insurance has been investigating the payments by omnicare to senator ford and hotly debating whether or not to terminate the cra with omnicare.id.
despite the alleged breaches listed above,the cra was renewed later in,the period of administrative supervision has expired,and the state of tennessee has not declared any breach of contract by uahc.
plaintiffs allege that uahc submitted statements to the securities and exchange commission sec in violation of relevant generally accepted accounting principles gaap and that such statements are presumed to be misleading or inaccurate,despite footnotes and disclosures.compl.citing a.plaintiffs additionally allege violations of gaap financial accounting standards fasb,and,which require disclosure of contingencies where there is either certain loss or a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred,as well as disclosure of unasserted claims and assessments where there is a probability that such a claim may be filed.id.plaintiffs complaint continues 
public disclosure of these payments by omnicare has resulted in numerous criminal and civil investigations by the attorney,the tennessee attorney general,tenncare,the tennessee department of insurance and other bodies.id.under the circumstances,as a public company,uahc knew that its actions would definitely have serious adverse consequences.id.due to the failure to accrue for or disclose losses associated with the contract breaches,uahc presented its financial results and statements which violated gaap.id.
plaintiffs next allege that statements made by defendants in sec forms and constitute material misrepresentations that are actionable.they allege that the filed forms were false and misleading for omitting to state that omnicare had breached the cra,that the cra was currently subject to immediate termination by tenncare,and that omnicare was subject to substantial monetary penalties as a result of its breaches of the cra.id.the were additionally alleged to be misleading 
the forms stated that uahc operations are subject to substantial regulation by the state and that its license to operate is subject to suspension or revocation if there is a determination that the plans are operating out of compliance with the law,while omitting to state the material facts that omnicare was currently in violation of tennessee law that it was breaching the cra,that the cra was subject to immediate termination and omnicare subject to administrative supervision and that omnicare certificate of authority to operate in tennessee was subject to termination.id.
the complaint next alleges facts attempting to support liability on the part of individual defendants under section a.however,because we conclude below that the forgoing allegations do not give rise to liability under section b,the claims against the individual defendants pursuant to section a necessarily fail and we need not consider those claims.see,pr diamonds,chandler,cir.
on january,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,concluding that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action under the heightened pleading requirement for section b and rule.in re united healthcare.sec,wl.plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of defendants rule b motion to dismiss.robert clemens trust,et morgan stanley dw,cir.a claim survives this motion where its f actual allegations are enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all of the complaint allegations are true.bell atl.twombly,d.in reviewing a rule b motion to dismiss,we treat all allegations in the complaint as true,and we find dismissal proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claims that would entitle him or her to relief.downie city of middleburg heights,cir internal citations omitted.w hen a complaint adequately states a claim,it may not be dismissed based on a district court assessment that the plaintiff will fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations or prove his claim to the satisfaction of the factfinder.bell.at.we must also construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.inge rock fin,cir.in doing so,however,the court does not accept the bare assertion of legal conclusions as enough,nor does it accept as true unwarranted factual inferences.in re sofamor danek group,cir.further,we may affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims on any grounds,including those not relied on by the district court.in re comshare.sec,cir.
a.the pleading standard under section b and rule b 
section b of the securities exchange act of the act and rule prohibit fraudulent,material misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale or purchase of a security.pr diamonds,at internal quotations omitted.see also tellabs makor issues rights,d.section b provides,in relevant part,as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails,or of any facility of any national securities exchange 
b to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
further,rule,promulgated by the sec under section b,provides,in relevant part,as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
a valid claim under section b of the act and rule must allege,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,the misstatement or omission of a material fact,made with scienter,upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied and which proximately caused the plaintiff injury.in re comshare,at pr diamonds,at.the requirement that plaintiffs plead fraud with scienter emerges from congress amendment of the act in.private securities litigation reform act the pslra,codified at.the supreme court recently clarified the level of scienter required at the pleading stage,holding that an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.tellabs.at.
b.the alleged omissions and misrepresentations do not give rise to a duty to disclose 
standard for determining materiality 
plaintiffs claim is based entirely on defendants failure to disclose that omnicare had materially breached the cra and was thus in immediate risk of losing its sole source of revenue and subject to substantial financial and other penalties.compl.plaintiffs must prove that this failure to disclose by uahc was material,in re comshare,at.for the purposes of securities fraud cases,materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.basic levinson,d.that is,a statement is material where there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at.citations omitted.once materiality is proved,reliance need not be shown.affiliated ute citizens united states,d p ositive proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery in a case.all that is necessary is that the facts withheld be material in the sense that a reasonable investigator might have considered them important in the making of this decision.
however,materiality alone is not enough to place a duty to disclose on a company.see in re sofamor danek,at.further limitations on this duty to disclose are necessary because corporations might otherwise face potential in a subsequent disclosure suit,a regime that would threaten to deluge investors with marginally useful information,and would damage corporations legitimate needs to keep some information.city of monroe employees ret.bridgestone,cir citing in re sofamor danek,at.in determining whether or not the duty to disclose exists,the in re sofamor danek court distinguished between soft information and hard information a company has a duty to disclose hard information but not soft information unless other criteria are met.in re sofamor danek,at.
hard information is typically historical information or other factual information that is objectively verifiable.such information is to be contrasted with soft information,which includes predications and matters of opinion.
id.at internal quotations and omissions omitted.the failure to disclose soft information is actionable only if it is virtually as certain as hard facts.city of monroe,at citing starkman marathon oil,cir internal citations omitted.
in addition to the limitation on liability where information is deemed to be soft,the pslra has provided a provision that generally protects companies from liability when they issue future forecasts 
the safe harbor provision excuses liability for defendants projections,statements of plans and objectives,and estimates of future economic performance.a plaintiff may overcome this protection only if the statement was material if defendants had actual knowledge that it was false or misleading and if the statement was not identified as or lacked meaningful cautionary statements.
helwig,at citing c.where a company does disclose that its statement is,liability may still attach to the extent that the company made the statement in a misleading manner.that is,if a company chooses to disclose information about the future,its disclosure must be full and fair,and courts may conclude that the company was obliged to disclose additional material facts to the extent that the volunteered disclosure was misleading.id.at internal quotations and omissions omitted.therefore,once a company chooses to speak,it must provide complete and information with respect to subjects on which it undertakes to speak.rubin schottenstein,zox dunn,cir.in such cases,
t he question thus is not whether a company silence can give rise to liability,but whether liability may flow from its decision to speak concerning material details,without revealing certain additional known facts necessary to make its statements not misleading.this question is answered by the text of the sec rule b its
