sid peterson memorial hospital spmh appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of tommy thompson,acting in his official capacity as the secretary of health and human services the secretary.spmh filed this case is federal court pursuant to title xviii of the social security act,f,challenging the secretary decision denying the hospital claim for reimbursement of interest expenses on certain capital indebtedness attributable to the purchase of its hospital facility on various grounds.the district court ruled that the interest expenses incurred by spmh were not proper,and therefore not reimbursable,because the hospital borrowed the underlying capital from the hal and charlie peterson foundation the foundation,a as defined by the medicare regulations.we hold that the and of the medicare regulations,defining and control,are consistent with the text of the medicare statute.we also hold that the secretary interpretation of these regulations was reasonable and that substantial evidence supported his determination that the loan from the foundation to spmh for the purchase of the hospital facilities was a transaction.in addition,we conclude that there is no equitable exception to the denial of reimbursement under the medicare regulations.
the medicare program is codified in title xviii of the social security act,et,which establishes a federally funded health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.part a of the medicare regime authorizes direct payment for covered hospital services to providers of health services.see.in essence,a provider of services does not bill eligible patients under medicare for covered services.rather,the provider is reimbursed by the government for the lesser of its reasonable costs in providing approved services or the customary charges for those services.see b.
the medicare reimbursement program is structured around this concept of reasonable costs.the statute defines reasonable cost as the cost actually incurred by the provider excluding therefrom any part of the incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.v a.based on these broad parameters,the statute directs the secretary to create regulations in order to establish the method or methods to be used,and items to be included,in determining such costs.id.these regulations must take into account the direct and indirect costs necessary in the efficient delivery of covered services to medicare beneficiaries so that such costs will not be borne by individuals.see v a i.
pursuant to its statutory authority,the secretary has promulgated regulations,codified at part,governing the reimbursement of health care providers for reasonable costs.in addition,the secretary has published interpretations of the governing statute and regulations in the provider reimbursement manual prm in order to assist these providers as well as the fiscal intermediaries in understanding how the government applies this regulatory framework.
the medicare regulations recognize that necessary and proper interest on both current and capital indebtedness is generally an allowable cost.see.in order for a provider to receive reimbursement,however,the interest on the loan must be proper.the regulation defines proper interest as interest that is both incurred at a rate not in excess of what a prudent borrower would have had to pay in the money market existing at the time the loan was made and paid to a lender not related through control or ownership,or personal relationship to the borrowing organization.a i ii.a provider is related to another organization if the provider to a significant extent is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by another organization.b.control exists if an individual or an organization had the power,directly or indirectly,significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.b.the prm states that in making a determination that the provider and lender are related through control,the secretary will examine the entire body of facts and circumstances involved in each case.prm.
the purpose behind the rule is to assure that loans are legitimate and necessary,and that the interest rate is reasonable.see c.the rule is prophylactic in the sense that it involves a judgment that the probability of abuse in related transactions is high enough that it is more efficient to prevent the opportunity for abuse from arising by prohibiting certain relationships that are likely to give rise to transactions,rather than to try to detect actual incidents of abuse.see biloxi reg med.ctr.bowen.the regulations provide that the presence of control by either the provider or the lender could affect the bargaining process that usually accompanies the making of a loan,and could thus be suggestive of an agreement on higher rates of interest or of unnecessary loans.c.thus,the rule precludes the recovery of capital interest expenses if the lender can significantly influence,directly or indirectly,the actions of the provider.
the foundation was organized in for the purpose of supporting charitable and educational undertakings.in pursuit of these goals,the foundation constructed a,nonprofit hospital in kerrville,texas in.the foundation continued to own and manage the hospital until january,when it sold the facility to spmh.
the foundation,developing concerns that large malpractice awards could adversely affect its other assets,recognizing that the broader charitable mission of the foundation and that of the hospital did not always coincide,and confronting a growing desire by the medical staff of the facility to have a greater voice in the daily operations of the hospital,decided to sell the facility.due to limitations set forth in its charter and,the foundation concluded that only charitable,organizations would be considered as potential buyers.in addition,the foundation decided that,in order to ensure that the hospital would continue to serve the community,it should be sold to a local entity.
faced with these limitations on potential buyers,the foundation sought to create a new local entity to which it could the hospital.to this end,chas johnson,a member of the foundation board,john mosty,a foundation employee,and john burkett,an attorney,incorporated spmh for the exclusive purpose of operating a charitable hospital in kerr county,texas.spmh charter provided for a board of directors.of these nine,three members,scott sterling,matthews,and judge julius neunhoffer,were also members of the foundation board of trustees.the other six directors were active and retired physicians and members of the local community.in addition,hall,a member of the foundation board of trustees,also served as an advisory member of the nascent corporation board.during its first organizational meeting,the board elected officers,approved filing for status with the irs,and selected a bank.the irs subsequently recognized spmh as a c corporation.
while members of the foundation board were incorporating spmh,the foundation continued planning the sale of hospital.the foundation sought advice from the irs as to the potential adverse tax consequences arising from the proposed sale.on december,the irs informed the foundation that the sale of the hospital to spmh would not affect its status.eight days later,the foundation held a special meeting,during which the board of trustees accepted the resignations of sterling,matthews,neunhoffer,and hall.then,on december,the foundation and spmh entered into an agreement whereby all properties used in the operation of the hospital would be transferred to the plaintiff.
the agreement became effective at midnight on december.it provided for no gain or loss on the asset sale because the sale price was set at the book value of the hospital assets.spmh purchased the tangible assets of the hospital for the total price of.the foundation fully financed the purchase by issuing two promissory notes to spmh.the first note for,covered the hospital tangible assets and was payable to the foundation over a year period at interest per annum.the second note for,covering the hospital intangible assets and existing inventories,was payable at the end of one year.the interest rate on the second note was also.at the conclusion of the transaction,spmh wholly owned and operated the hospital facilities.
in its,and cost reports to medicare,spmh claimed the interest expenses paid on the notes to the foundation as a reimbursable expense.when spmh fiscal intermediary,blue cross and blue shield of texas the intermediary,audited these expense reports,it found that the foundation and spmh were related parties as set forth in of the provider reimbursement manual because the foundation had controlled influenced the actions of the board of directors of spmh.the intermediary issued a notice of program reimbursement disallowing the disputed interest costs.this disallowance of interest expenses reduced the amount of medicare reimbursement by approximately for the three years in contention.
faced with the loss of these medicare funds,spmh appealed the intermediary decision to the provider reimbursement review board prrb.the prrb concluded that spmh and the foundation were related parties as defined by.accordingly,it concluded that the interest expense was not an allowable cost under the regulatory provisions governing interest expenses in.specifically,the prrb found that the foundation had control over spmh and exercised that control to influence significantly spmh actions in the negotiation and sale of the hospital.the prrb concluded that there was substantial evidence that the foundation board of trustees controlled the transaction final outcome.rejecting spmh argument that the only relevant events that the prrb could consider were those occurring at the time of and subsequent to the sale,the prrb determined that the was based on a preconceived plan that the board initiated nearly two years prior to the december,closing date.the prrb maintained that the foundation board developed the notion to legally separate the hospital from the foundation as part of an overall strategy to restructure its organization and also determined the manner in which to carry out the and executed the transaction almost exactly as planned.the secretary subsequently adopted the prrb report,and spmh appealed the secretary decision to the district court.
the district court upheld the secretary decision denying reimbursement.it concluded that the regulations were not inconsistent with the medicare statute and that the secretary could properly look at all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction in determining whether the parties were related through control.in addition,the district court found that substantial evidence existed that the foundation and spmh were related.lastly,the trial court held that there was no equitable exception to the rule under the provisions of and.
on appeal,spmh renews its challenge to the validity of the regulations,themselves,as well as the secretary interpretation of them.spmh also contests the secretary determination that substantial evidence supported the finding that the foundation was related to spmh through control.spmh further argues that the district court erred in not finding an equitable exception to the rule when the interest on the underlying transaction was at fair market value.
spmh first contends that the secretary interpretation of and renders the regulations invalid because they will result in to patients.if that were the case,the regulations would be inconsistent with the express language of v a.
we review an agency interpretation of a statute through the promulgation of regulations under the familiar test of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.under chevron,we must first determine whether congress has directly spoken on the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if congress has not addressed the issue,we must then determine whether the agency interpretation of the statute was reasonable.id.at.our review under the second prong of the chevron test is narrow.we are not empowered to overrule the secretary interpretation merely because it does not coincide with our own notion of reasonable cost,or because we might have interpreted the statute in a different manner.see batterton francis,d.instead,we will uphold the regulation if it bears a rational relationship to the purposes of the statute.mercy hosp.heckler,cir construing the social security act.
as stated above,congress has conferred upon the secretary exceptionally broad authority to prescribe standards for defining reasonable costs.the statute expressly delegates to the secretary the right to issue regulations establishing the method or methods to be used in computing reasonable cost.v a because congress chose to delegate the regulatory authority to the secretary rather than addressing the reasonable cost concept itself,we will review the regulations merely to determine whether they are rationally related to the enabling legislation.
under the statute,the secretary is required to adopt regulations that result in the reimbursement of actual costs although payment may be made on various bases,the objective,whatever method of computation is used,will be to approximate as closely as practicable the actual cost both direct and indirect of services rendered to the beneficiaries of the program,cong.sess.at,reprinted in.here,the regulations provide a reasonable method of determining actual costs.the secretary could have rationally concluded that individualized cost calculations were neither required by the statutory text nor administratively practicable and that a broader,rule was appropriate.the denial of reimbursement of interest under the rule is not patently arbitrary,utterly lacking in rational justification,but rather a logical attempt by the secretary to focus on those transactions that pose a significant risk of improper inflation of costs to the medicare program.in doing so,he respected the congressional directive that he establish the best gauge of actual costs.
recognizing the necessity of some imprecision,those courts that have considered the validity of the rule have generally upheld this prophylactic rule despite its potential for occasional overinclusiveness.see,shaker med.ctr.hosp.secretary of health human services,cir goleta valley cmty.hosp.schweiker,cir holding the rule valid as a means to ensure parties deal at arms length fairfax hosp.ass n,califano,cir.but see,hosp.serv,cir holding the prohibition invalid solely as to that portion of the loan equal to the excess of the former provider depreciated cost.the fairfax court commented 
particularly in a program as complex as the medicare program,with its large numbers of providers and suppliers and with its wide range of supplies and services,the secretary,in his regulations,may make,and indeed must make,rough accommodations illogical,it may be,and unscientific using generalized classifications governing the method of calculating reasonable cost when it is obvious that individualized cost calculations are both not administratively practical and unduly expensive.
fairfax,at internal citations omitted.while and may be somewhat overinclusive,there is no requirement under the deferential chevron standard that the regulations be so narrowly tailored to the statute so as to preclude this type of administrative compromise to the reasonable cost problem.congress has implicitly endorsed such approaches in its broad grant of authority to the secretary.we follow those decisions upholding the regulations,and conclude that and are rationally related to the purposes of the medicare statute.
we now turn to the issue of whether the secretary interpretation of and was reasonable.the medicare judicial review provision,f,incorporates the standard of review applicable to actions arising under administrative procedure act apa.section a of the apa commands reviewing courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under this standard,our task is not to decide which interpretation between conflicting views best serves the regulatory purpose,but rather to determine if the secretary has reasonably interpreted his own regulations.thomas jefferson shalala,d girling health care,shalala,cir.in other words,we will affirm the secretary interpretation unless,in light of the language and purpose of the regulation,it is unreasonable.see,marcello bowen,cir courts accept the agency interpretation if it is reasonable in terms of the words of the regulations and the purposes of the statute,even though,as an original matter,the court might have reached a different conclusion.
spmh argues that the secretary erred when he determined that the foundation controlled spmh because he based this decision on the relationship of the parties prior to the final agreement to sell the hospital facilities.spmh contends that requires a tangible mechanism of control,such as a majority of overlapping board members,to exist at the time of the transaction in order for the parties to be related.according to spmh,in order to deny reimbursement,the regulations required the secretary to examine the relationship of the parties at the time when they actually consummated the.
spmh is correct that the regulations require that the parties be related through control at the time of the transaction.the language of the regulations,as well as the case law interpreting them,however,compel a broader interpretation than spmh suggests.
section provides that both direct and indirect abilities to influence significantly the provider at the time of the transaction establishes control.thus,while the foundation may not have formally controlled spmh at the time of the transaction,a decision based solely on this evidence would be insufficient,given the text of the regulations,to preclude a finding of relatedness.if one party possesses the ability to influence significantly the other in the bargaining process so that it could dictate the terms of the ultimate agreement,the requirement that the parties be related through a mechanism of control at the time of the transaction is satisfied 
the regulations,therefore,contemplate a inquiry into the relationship of the parties,logically concluding that direct control over a provider during the bargaining process could result in the continued manifestation of that control in the final agreement in order to make the determination that the transaction is a product of a bargaining process tainted by one party ability to control the other,the secretary should consider the entire body of facts and circumstances involved.dep t of health and human services,medicare prm,part i.
in this case,the secretary correctly interpreted the regulations as permitting him to examine the entire bargaining process in order to discern whether the foundation could directly or indirectly control spmh through the terms of the and loan agreement.the secretary position is supported by the text of the regulations.we can not conclude,therefore,that the requirement that the parties be related at the time of the transaction renders the secretary reading of the regulations unreasonable.
none of the other textual arguments advanced by spmh undermine the secretary interpretation.spmh focuses on the first part of the definition of proper in b i,which requires that reimbursable interest be incurred at a rate not in excess of what a prudent borrower would have had to pay at the time the loan was made.b i.the second part of the definition of proper interest,however,directs the secretary to look at whether the parties are related through control,even in cases in which the interest charged does not exceed fair market rates.the regulation states proper requires that the interest be paid to a lender not related through control.b ii.the provision does not state or even suggest that the only relevant time for determining relatedness is at the time the parties actually effect the transaction.if the secretary had originally intended to impose such a limitation,similar language would have been included in or b ii.instead,b ii contemplates a much broader factual analysis in determining whether the parties are related.this contrast between the restrictive time period for comparing interest rates and the more open approach to determining whether the parties are related through control provides further support for the secretary interpretation of the provisions.
spmh also argues that the case law interpreting and requires that the secretary only consider whether the parties were related through control at the time of and subsequent to the transaction.a close analysis of these judicial decisions reveals that they do not support spmh argument.
spmh first contends that biloxi regional medical center bowen,demonstrates that the relatedness determination should be limited solely to the time of the transaction.in biloxi regional,the court concluded that the city government did not control the medical center at the time of the transaction and therefore the parties were not related.biloxi regional,at.the only possible mechanism of control was the mayor ability to veto the appointment of potential board members.the court found that the approval process was a mere formality and that the mayor had no power of influence over appointments.id at.thus,any influence the city might exert through the mayor veto power fell well short of that required to establish control under the regulation.id.at.
the court found,based on its analysis of the agreement,that the requirement that the parties be related through control at the time of the transaction was not met.there was no evidence that the city could significantly influence the medical center based on their relationship.the court,therefore,did not need to examine the entire negotiating process in making its relatedness determination because the city complete lack of control over the medical center was apparent from the facts existing at the time of the transaction.where,as in this case,the prior dealings between the parties reveal the potential for a lender to influence a provider,the secretary necessarily must make a broader inquiry into the surrounding circumstances in order to determine if the parties were,in fact,related at the time of the transaction.the biloxi regional decision does not preclude this sort of searching analysis.
spmh also relies on the third circuit decision in monsour medical center heckler.specifically,spmh focuses on language in the opinion that requires relatedness to be measured at the time of their borrowing and lending.id.at.spmh reliance on this language is misplaced.the monsour decision essentially restates the proposition that the provider must be related to the other party at the time of the transaction in order to preclude reimbursement.in considering whether such relatedness existed at the time of the loan,however,the third circuit approved of the prrb examination of the corporate planning period,which covered a period of six years.thus,the decision endorses an examination of the entire body of facts and circumstances in reaching the conclusion about the ultimate transaction.
lastly,spmh maintains that the secretary interpretation would result in an infinitely broad rule.we do not agree with spmh argument that under the secretary version of the regulations,no two related parties could ever become unrelated for purposes of medicare reimbursement.mere historical associations,without more,are insufficient to establish that the parties are related.they simply provide evidence in making a final determination of relatedness.
the arizona district court decision in dch,bowen,wl,medicare and medicaid guide cch.april,reached a similar conclusion.in dch,the plaintiff appealed the secretary decision denying reimbursement because it was related to another health care provider,republic health corporation.the district court disagreed with the secretary findings,concluding that mere historical associations between the parties did not amount to substantial evidence that the parties were currently related through control.the court found that their association was diluted by mergers,sales and ultimate abrogation of the corporate relationship dch,wl at.the district court looked at the entire body of facts and circumstances in reaching the conclusion that republic no longer possessed the abil
