christian claims that shortly after his arrival at the jail,he began to cough up blood,to experience difficulty breathing,and to feel pain in his lungs.he testified that he sought help informally from jail employees,including koshatka,until he was told of the inmate grievance process.under this grievance process,as described by captain wagner,an inmate filed a grievance on a form provided by a jail employee.the grievance was then submitted to wagner,who either handled the matter himself or assigned the matter to another employee for later review by wagner.once the grievance was resolved by wagner,the inmate could appeal an unsatisfactory decision on a form provided by a jail employee.major duane lewis,wagner superior,decided the appeals.
on june,christian filed a grievance objecting to,among other concerns,the use of toxic cleaning chemicals and denial of medical attention.wagner assigned the grievance to deatsch for investigation.deatsch advised christian that medical request forms were available and would be reviewed by the jail medical staff and handled appropriately.
two days after filing the grievance,christian submitted a medical request form.he complained of a toxic chemical pink spray that caused him to cough up blood,dirty ventilation systems,fiberglass filters and a generally unsanitary environment that caused chest pain,a spinal disorder aggravated by hard metal bunks,and a gastric disorder aggravated by certain foods.in response to this medical request,marjorie goodyear,a physician assistant pa,examined christian on june.in the record of christian examination,goodyear noted that she advised christian to talk to deputies to see if he could be moved from his cell when other inmates used the cleaning products.
christian was transferred to cellblock g on june after he had an altercation with another inmate about cell cleaning.the jail log book indicated that jail employees moved christian due to problems with his turn cleaning in the block that arose when christian claimed the cleaning product caused him to have an allergic reaction.christian filed a grievance about his removal from cellblock a,and claimed that he refused to clean for religious reasons.wagner answered the grievance and determined that the transfer separated christian from the other inmate and diffused the problem.
on june,christian attorney wrote wagner,asking for copies of christian medical request form,the documentation from his examination with goodyear,and information about the pink cleaning fluid,which was hdq neutral.in response,wagner provided christian with the material safety data sheet for hdq neutral,and sent the requested medical information to christian counsel.
on july,christian filed an appeal regarding a previous grievance.in the appeal,christian protested the use of chemicals which have known or unknown toxi co effects,including bug killer,hdq neutral,and bleach.lewis,in response,stated that there was no evidence of a health risk caused by the chemicals,and he provided christian with the jail air quality report,which was prepared by an industrial hygienist.
christian submitted a medical request form the following day,listing concerns regarding an unsanitary environment,exposure to mold spores,insect infestation,lack of fresh air and sunshine,the ventilation system,and chemicals,including bleach,hdq neutral,and insecticide,all of which he claimed sickened him and made it hard for him to breathe.on july,koshatka escorted christian to a medical examination.pa david walz examined christian and told him to take aphedrid,an antihistamine for respiratory symptoms.according to the record of the examination,he also instructed christian to minimize his exposure to cleaning products.christian stopped taking aphedrid shortly after the examination,complaining of side effects and ineffectiveness.
on july,christian filed an appeal in which he reasserted a laundry list of concerns raised in earlier grievances.christian again claimed that the jail cleaning supplies caused him illness,and he objected that the jailers did not remove him from the cellblock when the chemicals were used.lewis responded that christian grievances and appeals were rambling and hard to interpret constructively.lewis warned christian that repetitive grievances could result in disciplinary action.
christian requested medical services on july,alleging that a moldy carrot in his lunch made him sick.in the request,christian asserted that the moldy carrot aggravated his symptoms,including a headache and pain in the roof of his mouth.he also complained of a general sickness that began on may and intensified on july.goodyear examined christian the next day and advised him to increase his fluid intake and to avoid moldy foods.
in a july grievance,christian protested that he had not received an answer about why he had not been moved from his cellblock when bleach,hdq neutral,and insecticide were in use.wagner responded that the same chemicals were used throughout the jail,and that movement in the jail was.wagner nevertheless met with christian and offered to move him to a holding cell where the chemicals were not used.christian declined.he filed another grievance two days later ambiguously complaining of the proximity of a cleaning spray.deatsch responded that christian concern about the location of the spray is outweighed by the need to keep the facility clean.
christian was released from the jail on august.he went to an emergency room the following day,complaining that he suffered from sinus and throat pain and that he had coughed up blood.christian requested a test for tuberculosis,which proved negative,and he received no other treatment.he testified that emergency room staff may have prescribed medication,but that he would have refused it,fearing another reaction.
