myers company,a large electrical contractor,was convicted of willfully violating occupational safety and health administration osha regulations,causing the death of one of its employees.see e.an apprentice linesman in the early stages of his training with myers was killed while working on a repair assignment atop a transmission tower owned by commonwealth edison comed.the static wire on the tower was not in fact static,a grounded dead wire but instead was energized the apprentice came into contact with it and was electrocuted.
on appeal myers argues that the magistrate judge who presided at trial improperly instructed the jury on the issues of corporate knowledge and conscious avoidance.the company also argues that the judge erroneously excluded evidence of a fatality involving a comed linesman who was electrocuted by contact with an energized static wire.finally,the company claims it is entitled to a new trial based on a proposed osha regulation creating new duties for host employers like comed regarding hazards at their transmission facilities.the proposed rule,published for notice and comment after the trial was concluded,was accompanied by an explanatory comment from osha describing energized static wires as one such hazard.
we reverse.the magistrate judge improperly instructed the jury on corporate knowledge and conscious avoidance.corporate knowledge in this context includes knowledge of hazards acquired by the corporation employees provided the employees in question are responsible for reporting such hazards to the corporate hierarchy.this important proviso was omitted from the jury instruction on corporate knowledge.furthermore,there was insufficient evidentiary support for the conscious avoidance or ostrich instruction it should not have been given.because the statute willfulness requirement was the central point of contention in this criminal osha case,we are not convinced that these instructional errors were harmless.remand for retrial is required.
we reject myers evidentiary argument,however the evidence of the comed fatality was properly excluded.finally,because we are reversing for a new trial based on instructional error,we need not address whether myers is entitled to a new trial based on the proposed osha regulation.
background 
electric transmission towers carry electricity from generating plants to distribution networks for further distribution to the utility customers.these towers typically have six energized power lines,three on each side of the tower.a static wire runs above the power lines on each side and acts as a lightning rod,directing strikes of lightning toward the towers and then to the ground,preserving the insulators and the wires.energized power lines have insulators connecting the lines to the tower.a static wire,however,usually will not have any insulator between itself and the tower it is a grounded dead wire.in rare instances a static wire can become spontaneously energized by induction,depending on its proximity to and the level of voltage in the transmission lines.
myers is one of the largest electrical contractors in the nation and contracts with electric utilities to provide maintenance and repair work on transmission lines.myers had a longstanding contractual relationship with comed to perform maintenance and repair work on comed transmission network in the chicago area and received regular work assignments from comed to service its transmission towers.under the contract and myers collective bargaining agreement with its employees,myers was responsible for compliance with osha safety standards on these service jobs.
in one of comed transmission towers located in the flight path of airport in chicago was nearly struck by a plane.as a result,the federal aviation administration required comed to place lights on top of its transmission towers near airports in the chicago area.to power the lights,comed energized the static wire on one side of the affected towers,making it an energized static wire,which would otherwise be an oxymoron.the energized static wires on these towers had small insulators separating them from the towers.
a.the blake lane fatality 
on december,comed asked myers to perform emergency service on tower in prospect,illinois.comed visual inspection of the tower had revealed that the pin holding the static wire on the east side of the tower was loose.if the wire broke free,it could fall onto the transmission wires below,causing power outages.the next day myers assembled a crew for this assignment roger nelson,a general foreman darin west,a foreman and apprentices blake lane and robert huchel.lane and huchel had recently graduated from the american line builders joint apprenticeship and training program and had just that month started working at myers as apprentice linesmen.norman streseman,a comed inspector,was present at the job site to ensure that the work was completed in accordance with the contract and comed policy,however,he did not directly supervise the repair work.
the myers crew arrived at tower and briefly discussed the work to be done,but west the foreman did not read the comed construction specifications included in the work order.huchel stayed on the ground with nelson to operate the hand line a pulley used to send equipment up and down the tower.west and lane climbed up the tower and successfully secured the static wire.nelson,the general foreman,then called up to them to check the static wire to see if it was loose as well.nelson had visually examined the static wire with the aid of binoculars before west and lane climbed the tower he had not,however,visually inspected the static wire and so did not notice the small insulator attached to it.
in response to nelson direction,west sent lane to the other side of the tower to check the static wire.west did not notice the insulator either.from his vantage point on the opposite side of the tower,he could not see the hardware connected to the static wire.west told lane not to touch the static not because he understood that it was energized.rather,he told lane not to touch the wire because he thought the pin might break loose,causing the wire to fall onto the power lines.lane accidentally touched the energized static wire and was fatally electrocuted.
b.the wade cumpston fatality 
about three months later,on march,wade cumpston,a journeyman linesman with extensive experience working on electrical towers,was part of an myers crew replacing insulators on another set of transmission lines.the wires on the side where the crew was working had been,but the wires on the other side had not.this left the possibility that the wires could become energized by induction from the high voltage in the energized wires.to mitigate the risk,the crew was required to use grounding cables to connect the uninsulated bucket they worked in to the tower.
the crew working on the tower complained to the foreman,clifton gooch,that the grounding cables were too short.gooch said he would ask nelson again,the general foreman on this job about replacing the cables.when the men complained again,gooch told them to do the work with the cables they had or go home.the linesmen successfully replaced two insulators without incident using the grounding cables they thought were too short.as they removed the grounds from the next insulator,however,cumpston and another member of the crew were electrocuted.cumpston was killed.the other crew member survived,but the accident severely damaged his memory and he was unable to recall what happened with the grounding cables.no one else on the job saw what happened when the two were electrocuted.
c.the osha charges 
myers was charged under e with two counts of willfully violating numerous osha regulations,causing the deaths of blake lane and wade cumpston.more specifically,the government alleged that myers had failed to properly train its employees,improperly determined conditions,failed to conduct a prejob briefing of potential hazards,failed to ensure that employees were qualified for the work they were performing,failed to ensure that employees maintained a minimum distance to energized power lines,and with respect to the wade cumpston fatality failed to ensure proper use of grounding cables.see a i,a,c,l,l,n.the defendant waived the right to trial before a district judge and consented to a jury trial before a magistrate judge.see.b.
at trial the government sought to establish that energized static wires were a common occurrence on transmission towers around airports in northern illinois.it introduced a comed map depicting the location of towers with energized static wires and also introduced the contract between comed and myers,in which myers represented that it was familiar with comed facilities and transmission system.streseman,the comed inspector on site at the time of the lane fatality,testified that he had seen the insulator on the static wire on the west side of the tower and brought it to the attention of west,the myers foreman.the government also elicited testimony from witnesses in the electrical industry that it was standard practice to treat all electrical lines as energized unless grounded or otherwise secured as dead or nonenergized.
myers employees testified that they had never heard of an energized static wire and therefore never thought they would need to look for signs of one.west conceded that he had not read the work order that comed had given to him,but also testified that it was not relevant because streseman had already verbally told him what needed to be done and the written materials did not contain any information about the energized static wire.the myers employees acknowledged,however,that they could have discovered the insulator on the static wire had they looked for it and that none of them had used binoculars to examine that side of the tower.witnesses testified that although blake lane was an apprentice,the union manual encouraged employers to send apprentices into the transmission towers as soon as possible in order to gain experience necessary to progress through their apprenticeship.these witnesses also testified that climbing a steel tower is significantly easier than climbing wooden pole distribution towers on which apprentices are initially trained.
regarding the wade cumpston fatality,michael young,a member of the crew,testified that he complained to the foremen that the grounding cables were too short and that he and cumpston had difficulty adequately grounding the first transmission wires they worked on.young also testified that the cables provided by myers did not have the proper type of clamp for grounding the transmission wires.other witnesses contradicted this testimony,however,and an expert for myers testified that the grounding cables were the correct length and type for the kind of work the men were doing.
to bolster its proof that myers acted willfully or with deliberate indifference,the government introduced evidence of a service call in october of in which myers performed repair work on a comed tower with an energized static wire.comed records from this job reflected that the myers crew repaired the static wire without incident.in its closing argument,the government maintained that the evidence regarding the service call established that myers knew that some of comed towers had energized static wires.
myers sought to introduce evidence about a incident in which a comed lineman was electrocuted when he came into contact with an energized static wire.notes prepared by an osha compliance officer after this fatality indicated that the officer recommended that comed consider placing warning signs at towers with energized static wires,and that in response comed agreed to take certain other precautionary measures to warn outside contractors about the location of energized static wires.myers argued that this evidence helped to establish as a general matter that energized static wires were not commonly recognized,and more specifically,that the evidence was exculpatory because there was no such warning from comed prior to the blake lane fatality.the magistrate judge thought the evidence of the accident was irrelevant and potentially misleading and therefore excluded it.
the conference produced several disagreements among the parties.the government proposed instructions told the jury that as to each of the two counts,the government must prove that at least one willful violation of one of the osha regulations set forth in that count caused the death of an employee.the instructions went on to define willful as follows 
a violation of an osha regulation or safety standard is willful if the employer had actual knowledge that its actions did not comply with the regulation or standard,and the employer intentionally disregarded the requirements of the regulation or standard or was deliberately indifferent to those requirements.the employer need not have acted maliciously or specifically intended to harm its employees.
the instructions also defined the actual knowledge of a corporation as follows 
in deciding whether the defendant corporation acted knowingly,you must consider that a corporation can act only through its employees and agents.accordingly,knowledge obtained by the corporation employees acting within the scope of their employment that concerns a matter within the scope of their employment is knowledge possessed by the corporation.once a corporation acquires that knowledge,it remains with the corporation even if the employee is no longer employed by the corporation,if the knowledge is of continuing importance to the business of the corporation.
this corporate knowledge instruction was tailored in part to explain the legal significance of the evidence regarding the service call.the core of myers defense to the count involving the blake lane fatality was that energized static wires were not a phenomenon and the company did not have actual knowledge of the existence of this hazard.the government argued that myers knew that energized static wires were present on at least some of comed towers because the october service call involved the repair of a static wire on a tower with an energized static wire.according to the government,the knowledge acquired by the crew on the service call was the corporation knowledge,and it remained with the corporation through the accident that killed blake lane.
myers objected to the proposed definition of corporate knowledge,arguing that under united states ladish malting,cir,an employee who obtains knowledge of a given hazard must also have a duty to report that information to superiors or to ameliorate the condition for the employee knowledge to be considered the corporation.the company asked the magistrate judge to amend the instruction to reflect this principle.the judge declined and gave the instruction as it appears above.
in addition,the government asked for a conscious avoidance instruction,more colloquially known as the ostrich instruction.the ostrich instruction permitted the jury to infer knowledge from a combination of suspicion and indifference to the truth.more specifically,the ostrich instruction told the jury that i f you find that a person had a strong suspicion that things were not what they seemed or that someone had withheld some important facts,yet shut his eyes for fear of what he would learn,you may conclude that he acted knowingly.myers objected to this instruction as well,arguing that the evidence did not support it.the magistrate judge disagreed and included the ostrich instruction along with the other instructions on willfulness noted above.
the jury found myers guilty on the e count involving the death of blake lane but not guilty on the e count involving the death of wade cumpston.the magistrate judge imposed a sentence of three years probation and a fine of.see c organizational defendant found guilty of a misdemeanor resulting in death may be fined up to.
myers moved for a new trial under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure based on newly discovered evidence,or alternatively,a violation of brady maryland,d.myers noted that osha had proposed a new safety regulation regarding hazards at transmission facilities and argued that the new regulation was either newly discovered evidence or brady evidence bearing on the issue of its knowledge of the hazard.t
