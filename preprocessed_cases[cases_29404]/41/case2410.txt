levi townsend,as representative for a certified class of disabled medicaid recipients residing in washington state,appeals a district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the secretary the secretary of the state of washington department of social and health services dshs.townsend contends that the state use of services to provide essential long term care to some disabled medicaid recipients but not others violates title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada and a department of justice regulation implementing the ada and mandating that public entities administer and deliver government services to qualified disabled persons in the most integrated setting possible.see d.
because we find that the secretary refusal to offer nursing services to some disabled persons may violate the ada,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for the secretary.in consideration of the secretary arguments that extending eligibility for nursing services to all the state disabled medicaid recipients may fundamentally alter the state medicaid program,not addressed by the district court,we remand this case for further factual findings and development of the record.
background 
medicaid in washington state 
the federal medicaid program provid es federal financial assistance to states that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.harris mcrae,d.participation by states in the medicaid program is optional,but a state receiving medicaid funds must comply with the requirements of the medicaid act.see.an exception to this rule is the medicaid waiver program,under which the secretary of health and human services is authorized to waive certain medicaid requirements for innovative or experimental state health care programs.see b.the programs encouraged by the waiver program include increased provision of home and community based health care to medicaid recipients who would otherwise qualify for nursing home care.see c.
the medicaid act groups needy persons into two categories,usually distinguished by income level the categorically needy and the medically needy.a a schweiker hogan,d.a participating state must provide certain types of services to categorically needy persons.see a a,a.for medically needy persons,the state is only obligated to establish reasonable standards consistent with the purposes of the medicaid act for determining the extent of assistance it will offer.beal doe,d a.
washington receives medicaid funding and funds the provision of medical care and living assistance in nursing home settings to both the categorically and the medically needy.categorically needy washington state residents,however,have the additional option of receiving living assistance and medical care in their own homes or adult family homes in the community through a medicaid waiver program community options program entry services copes.medically needy persons must receive long term living and medical assistance in a nursing home setting or not at all.
plaintiffs and procedural history of this case 
levi townsend,the lead plaintiff in this case,is in his eighties,has diabetic peripheral vascular disease,and is a bilateral amputee.in addition to medical treatment,he requires assistance preparing meals,performing housework,bathing,dressing,and attending to other personal hygiene needs.townsend is eligible for medicaid services administered by dshs because he is a person with a limited income.
before july,townsend income placed him among the categorically needy who qualified for copes assistance.rather than move to a nursing home,townsend chose to receive copes services in a adult family home setting.this arrangement enabled townsend to remain in his own community,near friends and family.
in washington,persons whose income is at or below percent of the social security income federal benefit rate ssi fbr are deemed categorically needy.see.admin.code.in july,townsend income increased to approximately dollars above three hundred percent of the ssi fbr.this increase meant that townsend was no longer categorically needy,but,instead,only medically needy.dshs informed townsend that he would have to move to a nursing home within days or lose his medicaid benefits.
in may,townsend filed suit on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated medicaid recipients certified by the district court,seeking to enjoin the requirement that he move to a nursing home as a condition of receiving needed,available medicaid services.townsend alleged that dshs denial of long term care to medically needy disabled persons violated the ada by discriminating on the basis of disability and contravening the principles expressed in olmstead,d,and the ada integration regulation,which require that public entities administer services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.d.
the district court granted summary judgment for the dshs secretary.the court held that the exclusion of medically needy persons from copes did not discriminate on the basis of medicaid recipients disability,but instead permissibly allocated services according to recipients income levels.characterizing copes as a distinct program through which washington state has sought to provide additional services for the most needy individuals,the court further held that modifying the restrictions on copes eligibility for disabled medically needy persons would fundamentally alter the program by merging the two distinct classes of categorically needy and medically needy individuals.because the ada ordinarily does not require fundamental alterations to state programs,the court found that exclusion of medically needy disabled persons from copes did not violate the ada.
with regard to plaintiffs separate argument that the secretary was violating the ada integration mandate by not providing services to medically needy disabled persons in the most integrated setting possible,the court relied on rodriguez city of new york,cir,in which the second circuit stated that the ada does not require the state to provide services that it does not already provide to the disabled.in the court view,requiring the state to provide long term care in settings as well as nursing homes would mean developing and funding a new program of services for the disabled.the court concluded that because washington state does not provide programs to the medically needy,the integration mandate does not require their creation.
townsend appeals the court grant of summary judgment on his claim that the state failure to provide care to the medically needy disabled in a setting violates the ada principles expressed in olmstead and the integration regulation implementing those principles.he does not appeal the grant of summary judgment on his claim that exclusion from copes discriminated against class members on the basis of disability.
a.the ada integration mandate 
in adopting the ada,congress recognized that historically,society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,and,despite some improvements,such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem,and that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination,including outright intentional exclusion,failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices,and segregation.a.congress aimed to eliminate this unjustified segregation and isolation of disabled persons through,among other provisions of the ada,title ii,which provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.
the department of justice integration regulation implements the isolation and segregation concerns that,in part,underlie title ii.the regulation states a public entity shall administer services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified persons with disabilities.d.another regulation provides a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.b.
in olmstead,the supreme court applied the integration and principles,interpreting discrimination forbidden under title ii of the ada to include u njustified isolation of the disabled.olmstead,at.olmstead held that georgia practice of institutionalizing mentally disabled persons rather than providing them with treatment would violate the ada unless georgia could demonstrate that modifying state programs to provide care would fundamentally alter the nature of the services it offered the mentally disabled.the court reasoned 
recognition that unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination reflects two evident judgments.first,institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life second,confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals,including family relations,social contacts,work options,economic independence,educational advancement,and cultural enrichment.
the plain language of the integration regulation,coupled with the reasoning and holding of olmstead,direct our analysis in this case.to prove that a public service or program violates title ii of the ada,a plaintiff must show he is a qualified individual with a disability he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity services,programs,or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity such exclusion,denial of benefits,or discrimination was by reason of his disability.duvall county of kitsap,cir.
the parties do not dispute that townsend is disabled within the meaning of the ada.as a person within the medically needy category of medicaid recipients,townsend is qualified to receive medical care and living assistance through washington medicaid program.as shown by townsend benefit from,and preference for,receiving this care through the copes program,services are appropriate for his needs.
in olmstead,the supreme court interpreted the failure to provide medicaid services in a setting as a form of discrimination on the basis of disability.when a state policies discriminate against the disabled in violation of the ada,the ada regulations mandate reasonable modifications to those policies in order to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,at least when such modification would not fundamentally alter the nature of the services provided by the state.lovell chandler,cir citing crowder kitagawa,cir.because dshs does not allow townsend to receive the services for which he is qualified in a,rather than nursing home,setting,townsend can prove that the secretary has violated title ii of the ada,unless the secretary can demonstrate that provision of services to townsend and members of the class would fundamentally alter the nature of the services dshs provides.
the district court relied on rodriguez city of new york,cir to distinguish this case from olmstead.in rodriguez,a class of medicaid recipients challenged new york failure to provide safety monitoring services as part of its medicaid program providing personal care services such as assistance bathing,dressing,and toileting to financially needy disabled individuals.id.at.the rodriguez court found that the plaintiff class was demanding a separate service,one not already provided by the city,and that t he ada requires only that a particular service provided to some not be denied to disabled people new york can not have unlawfully discriminated against appellees by denying a benefit that it provides to no one.id.at.the rodriguez court found olmstead inapposite because i n olmstead,the parties disputed the court addressed georgia should provide treatment,not whether it must provide it.id.at emphasis in original.
the district court reliance on rodriguez in support of its determination that townsend is requesting new benefits not currently provided by the state medicaid program is misplaced.as rodriguez makes clear,where the issue is the location of services,not whether services will be provided,olmstead controls.
here,the precise issue is not whether the state must provide the long term care services sought by townsend and the class state is already providing these in what location these services will be provided.townsend simply requests that the services he is already eligible to receive under an existing state program assistance in dressing,bathing,preparing meals,taking medications,and so on be provided in the adult home where he lives,rather than the nursing home setting the state requires.see helen didario,cir state violated the ada integration mandate by not providing attendant care services for which plaintiff was eligible in her own home,rather than a nursing home.
characterizing provision of services as a new program of services not currently provided by the state fails to account for the fact that the state is already providing those very same services.if services were determined to constitute distinct programs based solely on the location in which they were provided,olmstead and the integration regulation would be effectively gutted.states could avoid compliance with the ada simply by characterizing services offered in one isolated location as a program distinct from the provision of the same services in an integrated location.
after considering the language of the statute and of the integration regulation and the supreme court mandate and reasoning in olmstead,we conclude that dshs is in violation of title ii of the ada by failing to provide long term care services it currently provides to medically needy disabled persons in integrated settings,unless it can show that providing services in settings would fundamentally alter the nature of the services it currently dispenses to medically needy medicaid recipients in washington 
fundamental alteration 
it is clear from the language of title ii and the integration regulation that public entities are not required to create new programs that provide heretofore unprovided services to assist disabled persons.see rodriguez,see also alexander choate,d medicaid programs do not guarantee that each recipient will receive that level of health care precisely tailored to his or her particular needs t he benefit provided remains the individual services adequate health care.nor,ordinarily,must public entities make modifications that would fundamentally alter existing programs and services administered pursuant to policies that do not facially discriminate against the disabled 
a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.
b emphasis added.as the regulatory language makes clear,entities are required only to make reasonable changes in existing policies in order to accommodate individuals disabilities.olmstead,at.plaintiffs do not challenge the applicability of a fundamental alteration defense in this case,so we assume it applies 
the secretary contends that a decision that the state must offer long term care services to disabled medically needy persons would fundamentally alter congress and the state legislature considered policy decisions to provide long term care services to medically needy persons only in nursing homes.but policy choices that isolate the disabled can not be upheld solely because offering integrated services would change the segregated way in which existing services are provided.olmstead makes that clear,for precisely that alteration was at issue in olmstead,and olmstead did not regard the transfer of services to a community setting,without more,as a fundamental alteration.indeed,such a broad reading of fundamental alteration regulation would render the protection against isolation of the disabled substanceless.
furthermore,the secretary argument fails to account for the explicit policy preferences for home and care contained in recent federal and state medicaid statutes.through the medicaid waiver program,congress has encouraged states to experiment with providing medical care in community and settings for the categorically needy.see c olmstead,at.in addition,the washington state legislature has itself declared that the public interest would best be served by a broad array of care services that support persons who need such services at home or in the community whenever practicable and that promote individual autonomy,dignity,and choice.in recognition of these important goals,the washington legislature has taken steps to establish a medicaid waiver program through which some medically needy persons may receive the same sort of services provided only to the categorically needy under the current copes program.see.a finding that the secretary may have discriminated by unnecessarily isolating and segregating the medically needy disabled in nursing homes therefore offends no policy choices,and in fact coincides with the federal and state governments growing recognition of the value of care for disabled persons.
the secretary further argues that extending services to medically needy disabled persons might fundamentally alter the state medicaid program by requiring dshs to apply for additional medicaid waivers in order to provide services to medically needy disabled persons and burdening the state medicaid program fisc to the extent that the state would be compelled to make significant cuts in medicaid services.
addressing an integration challenge by mentally disabled georgians who were only offered treatment in institutional settings,a supreme court plurality in olmstead made clear that courts evaluating fundamental alteration defenses must take into account financial and other logistical limitations on a state capacity to provide integrated services to the disabled 
states are required to provide treatment for persons with mental disabilities when the state treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate,the affected persons do not oppose such treatment,and the placement can be reasonably accommodated,taking into account the resources available to the state and the needs of others with mental disabilities.
olmstead,at.olmstead counsels that states must be able to take financial burdens into account in administering programs affecting the disabled,see id.at,and must enjoy a certain measure of leeway to administer services with an even hand among its citizenry.id.at.
plaintiffs have asserted that it is cheaper on a per capita basis to provide care services to individuals in a setting rather than a nursing home.this assertion,however,does not account for the cost of serving additional persons who are eligible to receive care services but would not have previously availed themselves of this care when the services were offered only in a nursing home environment.at the same time,even if extension of long term care services to the medically needy were to generate greater expenses for the state medicaid program,it is unclear whether these extra costs would,in fact,compel cutbacks in services to other medicaid recipients.see olmstead,at.sensibly construed,the component of the regulation would allow the state to show that,in the allocation of available resources,immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable,given the responsibility the state has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with mental disabilities.
we can not tell on the present record whether the concerns raised by the secretary are valid ones.because the court granted summary judgment for the secretary on the question whether plaintiffs could make out an ada case,neither party has had adequate opportunity to present evidence as to whether the provision of services to medically needy disabled washingtonians might fundamentally alter its medicaid programs,applying olmstead fundamental alteration standards.we therefore remand to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether the secretary can demonstrate that the modifications requested by the plaintiff class would fundamentally alter the nature of the services provided by the state.
conclusion 
we hold today that the denial of long term care for medically needy disabled persons violates the ada unless the secretary can demonstrate that extending eligibility to these persons would fundamentally alter its medicaid programs.because the current record does not provide us with sufficient information to evaluate the secretary fundamental alteration defense,we remand this case to the district court.on remand,the parties will have an opportunity to develop a relevant factual record and present their arguments for and against the applicability of a fundamental alteration defense in this case.
reversed and remanded.
levi townsend contends that the americans with disabilities act requires washington to create a home and community care program for disabled medicaid recipients who fall into medicaid medically needy category.because the comprehensive structure of the medicaid act forecloses this result,townsend claim under the americans with disabilities act should fail.the court opinion to the contrary fails to accord sufficient weight to the medicaid act statutory scheme.
i respectfully dissent.
the medicaid act recognizes three broad categories of services that states may use to provide long term medical care to eligible medicaid recipients.these three service categories are defined by federal law and are defined with reference to where an eligible recipient resides and receives care.
the first category of services are nursing facility services nursing home care,which involve medical services provided to medicaid recipients whose needs require institutionalization in nursing homes at a minimum,states must provide nursing home care to the neediest medicaid recipients,those who are classified as categorically needy.states have the option of providing nursing home care to less needy medicaid recipients who fall into the medically needy category 
the second category of services are home and services community care,which involve a wide range of medical services provided to medicaid recipients who would otherwise require care in a nursing facility these medical services allow recipients to remain living in their personal residence or other housing in their community.included within the scope of community care are such services as 
case management services 
homemaker services 
home health aide services 
personal care services 
adult day services 
habilitation services and 
respite care services 
the medicaid act gives states the option of offering community care to medicaid recipients in an effort to encourage states to offer community care to the disabled,congress has established a waiver program 
the waiver program exempts states from certain medicaid requirements for community care programs the waiver program allows states to offer community care to identified subgroups of medicaid recipients the disabled constitute one of these subgroups 
although states are encouraged to create community care programs for the disabled,there is one significant limitation on their ability to create such programs.states can not create community care programs for the disabled without prior approval from the federal government 
the third category of long term care recognized by the medicaid act involves home health services home care these services are generally provided in a residential setting,but like community care,home care allows recipients to remain in their communities and avoid institutionalization at a minimum,a state home care program must include nursing services,home health aid services and medical supplies,equipment and appliances 
under most circumstances,the creation of home care programs falls to the discretion of the states if a state provides nursing home care to recipients in a given medicaid category,however,it must also provide home care to recipients in that category 
the state of washington provides medicaid recipients who fall into the categorically needy classification with for nursing home care,community care and home care washington provides the medically needy with nursing home care and home care washington state does not provide community care for the medically needy 
townsend argues that it is discriminatory for washington to offer him nursing home care without also offering him community care.he relies on the americans with disabilities act and one of its implementing regulations,d,in support of his argument that washington discriminates on the basis of disability.this argument ultimately fails because it does not adequately account for the interaction between the americans with disabilities act and the medicaid act.
title ii of the americans with disabilities act provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.under the department of justice regulations implementing the americans with disabilities act,public entities like the state of washington are required to 
make reasonable modifications in policies,practices or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program or activity.
townsend relies on another section of the same department of justice regulation in support of his argument that washington discriminates against him section d the integration mandate requires public entities to administer services,programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with a disability.the most integrated setting is a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.a failure to comply with d would constitute discrimination because congress explicitly recognizes that the segregation of persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination 
townsend contends that washington violates the integration mandate.he first argues that he is eligible to receive the medical services he needs under washington medicaid program if he submits to institutionalization,the prerequisite for receiving nursing home care.he then argues that washington could,if it so chose,allow him to receive the same medical services he needs in a less isolated setting by establishing a community care program.
according to townsend,because washington could provide him with the services he needs in a home or community setting,forcing him to receive these services in a nursing home violates the integration mandate.he therefore believes that washington must create a community care program for the disabled who fall within the medically needy category.
the state of washington counters that the medicaid act does not require it to provide community care to anyone within the medically needy category.the state further contends that it would be unreasonable and a fundamental alteration of its medicaid program to require the state to create an entirely new community care program for medically needy disabled individuals like townsend.
townsend claim under the americans with disabilities act should not succeed.it is necessary to address the interaction between the medicaid act and the americans with disabilities act to see why townsend claim fails.a proper reconciliation of these two statutes leads to the conclusion that washington is not required by the americans with disabilities act to provide community care coverage for disabled medicaid recipients who fall into the medically needy classification.
whenever two federal statutes may be in tension or conflict,we are required to reconcile the two statutes.the supreme court has given us instructions on how to do so 
it is a basic principle of statutory construction that a statute dealing with a narrow,precise,and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum,unless the latter statute expressly contradicts the original act or unless such a construction is absolutely necessary in order that the words for the later statute shall have any meaning at all.the courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective 
applying these instructions,we should conclude that title ii of the americans with disabilities act can not require washington to offer community care for disabled medically needy medicaid recipients.
the medicaid act establishes a comprehensive framework regulating the medicaid program.it is a narrow statute that informs states about what medical services must be provided and what medical services are optional.the medicaid act also establishes procedural rules governing the provision of these services.because the medicaid act is a narrow,comprehensive statute,we must apply the traynor analysis in evaluating the impact of the americans with disabilities act on the medicaid act 
the medicaid act leaves the creation of community care programs to the broad discretion of the states the only significant limitation on this discretion is that states are forbidden from creating community care programs for the disabled without prior federal approval there is no statute or regulation that requires states to create community care programs.community care is the only form of long term care that the medicaid act does not require under any set of circumstances a requirement that states provide community care programs to the disabled is inconsistent with the medicaid act text and structure.
moreover,congress consciously chose not to link community care for the disabled to the provision of nursing home care in the same legislation that established the community care waiver program,congress made the coverage of home care mandatory for any medicaid group that receives coverage for nursing home care at that time congress opted merely to encourage the creation of community care programs and to do so without regard to the existence or of nursing home care programs congress has not seen fit to replace the waiver program with a mandatory requirement over the course of the last two decades,leaving the waiver program optional approach to community care programs for the disabled in force.
applying traynor,the americans with disabilities act should not transform washington exercise of discretion into discrimination.the court opinion to the contrary effectively submerges several sections of the medicaid act under the perceived force of the integration mandate.today opinion casts aside the conscious choices congress made in permitting,but not requiring,states to provide community care for the benefit of the disabled.under traynor this result is to be avoided if an alternate approach would continue to give effect to both the americans with disabilities act and the medicaid act recognizing that the americans with disabilities act does not address the state of washington initial decision whether or not to create a community care program provides just such an alternate approach.recognizing limits on the ada in the community care context still leaves the ada with significant force in regulating the provision of community care to the disabled.once a state decides to offer community care to a given medicaid category,states must administer their community care waiver programs in a manner that complies with the integration mandate following traynor requirement that we adopt the interpretation that gives a narrow statute like the medicaid act full meaning,i would conclude that the a
