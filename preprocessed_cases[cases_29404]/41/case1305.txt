lynn marie larson contends that she is disabled by anxiety,depression,and ankle pain.she applied for supplemental security income ssi,but an administrative law judge alj concluded that her impairments,although severe,are not disabling.the district court upheld the agency decision,larson astrue,wl,at,and larson appeals.among other things,she argues that the alj erred by discrediting her testimony and not giving controlling weight to the opinion of her treating psychiatrist.we agree with her that the evidence supports an award of benefits.
now,larson was educated through three years of college and has past work experience as a bartender.she has been under the care of mental health specialists since at least,when she began seeing bruce rhoades,a psychiatrist.he diagnosed larson with major depression recurrent moderate.his treatment notes from through show that he prescribed and regularly adjusted the dosages of several and anxiety medications.
matters went from bad to worse for larson in january,when she was raped by the grandfather of one of her children and suffered a broken hand and injured thumb.she dates the onset of her disability from that incident.after the assault a social worker provided therapy for depression and stress disorder ptsd.the social worker scored larson at on the global assessment of functioning gaf,which measures a person overall ability to function.american psychiatric association,diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,ed.a gaf of indicates serious symptoms or functional limitations.id.at.larson also consulted rhoades,who observed that her mood was depressed though she appeared pleasant and settled.he diagnosed larson with generalized anxiety disorder and possible ptsd,renewed her prescriptions for,and increased the dosage of her medication.a few months later rhoades concluded that larson was doing much better and scored her at on the gaf nevertheless,he confirmed his diagnosis of ptsd.
in april,larson tripped outside a bar after five or six drinks and fractured her ankle in three places.the same orthopedist who had treated her after the rape surgically repaired the ankle fractures.a month later he concluded that the ankle was healing well.around the same time,larson confessed to rhoades that she had started drinking more heavily and questioned whether her depression was the reason.rhoades responded by adjusting her medications he decreased the dosage of her but,gauging her anxiety level as fairly high,he increased her medication.her gaf was back down to.rhoades later reported that larson anxiety was under reasonable control,a view that prompted him to change her medication again.in june she applied for benefits.her initial application was limited to allegations relating to the pain from her broken ankle later she added allegations of disability stemming from mental impairments.
a month later,larson stepfather beat her and her ankle.showed no evidence of a new fracture,but larson told her orthopedist that she was having difficulty walking without an ankle brace.she also saw rhoades,who reconfirmed the diagnosis of major depression and prescribed additional and medications.
other issues in and led to further consultations with rhoades and jennifer herink,a psychotherapist.in august rhoades noted that larson was not doing very well and prescribed additional medication to treat her depression and anxiety.she had a nervous breakdown and missed almost two weeks of work at the head start program where she had been working as a bus driver.a nephew she had been raising was placed in foster care after a social services agency investigated an allegation of child neglect.and she was arrested for driving while under the influence.she reported to herink that she had stopped taking her prescription medication and started or,it seems,continued with marijuana and alcohol.larson reported to rhoades that she was not getting out of bed,and so he prescribed two additional.throughout the last half of and,rhoades documented that larson was depressed,assessed her gaf at to,and prescribed additional medications to control her anxiety and mood.
larson application for ssi was denied initially in august and upon reconsideration in august.a psychologist had reviewed the medical record shortly before the second denial and had assessed larson mental impairments using a standard form psychiatric review technique,see a.he diagnosed larson with an affective disorder specifically listing and an disorder under listing,see pt,subpt.in his opinion neither of the impairments was severe.he concluded that larson had not suffered an extended episode of decompensation a somewhat vague term whose meaning we explore below and was experiencing only mild restrictions on daily living activities and moderate difficulties in the realms of social functioning and concentration,persistence,or pace.he thought that larson could perform simple,repetitive,work even though she would probably have trouble dealing with large groups of people or stressful situations.
in december,rhoades completed a mental impairment questionnaire.he reported there that he had been treating larson since on roughly a monthly basis.his diagnosis was severe,recurrent depression and dissociate identity disorder.her current gaf score,he said,was.observing that she avoids most social situations,he noted that larson was experiencing repeated,three or more episodes of decompensation.he also checked a box indicating that she had slight restrictions in activities of daily living,marked difficulties in social functioning,and frequent deficiencies of concentration,persistence,or pace.
in january,larson reported to herink that she was having increased thoughts of suicide.herink encouraged her to go to the hospital,but she did not follow that advice.herink later asked the police to check on larson.they did so and,according to herink progress notes,they took her to the hospital.the administrative record contains no other information about this hospitalization.
larson briefly testified before the alj at her hearing in march.twice during the questioning she said that she wanted to go home.much of her testimony focused on her efforts to hold a job since her alleged onset date.the month before the hearing,larson had quit a job at a gas station,where she occasionally had to hide in the bathroom,apparently to avoid customers.since she also had been working about two hours per week at a restaurant,tending bar,cooking,and waiting tables.although she drove the head start school bus for a short period,she was fired from that job after suffering a breakdown that alerted her employer to the drugs she was taking.larson insisted that she could not work because she suffers panic attacks and uncontrollable crying spells that last as little as minutes to as long as several hours.she had succeeded in keeping the restaurant job,she explained,only because the owner,paul calliss,was a friend.larson explained that she was caring for her four children then ranging in age from to,cooking for the family,and doing laundry and other household chores.if she needed to shop,she went with calliss or else waited until late in the evening to avoid encountering other people.finally,she reported that she was taking medications she did not say what or for which condition that made her drowsy and required her to nap during the day.
calliss,larson friend and employer,confirmed that larson worked for him very part time,sometimes all day if there was a special event but on average less than two hours per week.he explained that larson typically needed a break after a short time because she was nervous around strangers.
the alj called steven carter,a psychologist,as a medical expert to testify about larson mental impairments.carter considered whether larson met the criteria for a per se disability under listing for depression.a claimant suffering from an affective disorder meets the listed severity level for a depressive syndrome if enough listed factors the a criteria are present.pt,subpart,a see rabbers comm r soc.sec,cir holohan massanari,cir.there is no dispute that larson depression qualified as severe for purposes of the a cri
