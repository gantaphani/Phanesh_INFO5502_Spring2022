background 
david began attending orange as a at the beginning of the school year.prior to attending orange,david had been diagnosed with a deficit and a learning disability,and was found eligible for special education services.because of this,his education had been governed by a succession of ieps based upon evaluations mfe of his learning ability and behavior.nack,a special education teacher with a master degree in the field and extensive experience,was always very involved in david education and the development of his ieps.accordingly,when david was enrolled in orange,nack met shortly thereafter with april,coordinator of special education,to discuss various iep issues and concerns and to provide a copy of david iep which had already been developed at his previous school to.orange educated david in accordance with the dictates of this iep.
at the end of the year,david was performing at grade level and received passing grades in each of his subjects.in april,david iep team,which included nack,two teachers,a speech language therapist,and,met to develop an iep for the school year.the iep contained various changes to david schooling,and nack signed off on the document.staff meetings were held on a weekly basis to discuss david progress,and david was educated pursuant to the iep.however,beginning in october and continuing throughout the school year,david began experiencing disciplinary problems at school.in an attempt to rein in david behavior,nack met with david iep team and the team amended his iep to address these new concerns.nack initialed the changes to the iep occurring at this meeting.among these changes was to have david attend a social skills group in the middle school positive alternative success strategies mpass classroom at special education classroom.later,nack repeatedly expressed her unhappiness with david placement in the mpass classroom.
due to both absence and suspension from school,david was attending school infrequently by the end of february.numerous meetings between nack and school officials sought to address this problem and david iep was changed accordingly however,his attendance remained sparse.in april,david was hospitalized for almost a week after making suicidal threats at home that he attributed to his problems at school.also,nack explored the option of home schooling her son during this time,with assistance from orange.ultimately,david scored proficient for all of the subjects on the ohio proficiency tests,even scoring advanced proficient in writing.
in may,david iep team met for the first of three meetings concerning his iep for his year in.ultimately,the team developed an iep that identified the mpass classroom as the least restrictive environment for david and recommended he spend a portion of his day in that classroom.nack disagreed with this assessment and placement and refused to consent to the iep.she filed a due process complaint against the school in june and orange filed its own due process complaint the same month,seeking to impose a more restrictive environment on david.the impartial hearing officer iho found that the implementation of the iep and the creation and implementation of the iep provided david with a fape and were designed to impart meaningful educational benefit.the iho also found that the placement of david in a more restrictive environment the mpass classroom was appropriate.the iep was found to provide david a fape,except to the extent that it failed to address the need for individual psychotherapy on a weekly basis.the iho found that flaw denied david a fape.on appeal,the state level review officer slro agreed with the iho conclusions,except that the slro found the iep was adequate as drafted with regard to psychotherapy.thus,the slro found completely in orange favor.after nack appealed,the district court granted summary judgment to orange,affirming the slro decision that none of the challenged ieps denied david a fape.
discussion 
idea issues 
the idea was designed to give children with disabilities a free appropriate public education designed to meet their unique needs.burilovich bd.of educ.of lincoln consol,cir citations omitted.a fape consists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child,supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from the instruction.bd.of educ.of the hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley,d see also.
as part of providing a fape,school districts receiving funds under the idea are required to establish an iep for each child with a disability.the iep must contain a specific statement of the child current performance levels,the child and goals,the educational and other services to be provided,and criteria for evaluating the child progress.
deal hamilton county bd.of,cir.
there are two and a court inquiry in idea suits.deal,at.first,the court must determine whether the school system has complied with the procedures set forth in the idea.second,the court must assess whether the iep developed through those procedures was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.id.at citations omitted.if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.rowley,at.furthermore,it is clear that parents have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the iep was inadequate.renner bd.of educ.of pub.sch.of city of ann arbor,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.
district courts are required to conduct a modified de novo review of the administrative proceedings in idea cases.ex rel.knox county,cir.
under a modified de novo standard of review,a district court is required to make findings of fact based upon a preponderance of the evidence contained in the complete record,while giving some deference to the fact findings of the administrative proceedings,particularly when educational expertise is essential to the findings.

we must ensure that there are no genuine issues regarding the facts essential to the hearing officer decision.burilovich,at citation omitted.it is appropriate to rely upon the hearing officer presumed educational expertise,as long as the material facts underlying the officer determination are not in dispute.id.nack makes three specific procedural challenges to the ieps before us and also substantively alleges that david sixth and ieps were not reasonably calculated to enable him to receive educational benefits.each charge will be dealt with in turn.
procedural violations 
with regard to procedural matters,a court should strictly review an iep for procedural compliance,although technical deviations will not render an iep invalid.dong,at see.heights city sch.dist.boss ex rel.boss,cir noting that minor technical violations may be excused.a finding of procedural violations does not necessarily entitle appellants to relief.knable ex rel.knable,cir.only if a procedural violation has resulted in substantive harm,and thus constitutes a denial of a fape,may relief be granted.id.the supreme court has emphasized the importance congress attached to the idea procedural safeguards 
t he congressional emphasis upon full participation of concerned parties throughout the development of the iep,as well as the requirements that state and local plans be submitted to the secretary for approval,demonstrates the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what congress wished in the way of substantive content in an iep.
rowley,at.if the procedural requirements of the idea are met,greater deference is to be afforded to the district placement decision.dong,at.
nack argues that orange procedurally violated the idea in the following ways it predetermined a particular program for david without regard for his individual needs all of david ieps at orange failed to procedurally comply with the idea and nack was given inadequate notice with regard to david iep.
predetermination 
nack first argues that orange violated the idea with david iep by deciding to place david out of the mainstream of the regular education environment without first considering an array of inclusion settings with supplemental aids and support services.in effect,nack alleges orange had a particular program for david regardless of his demonstrated individual needs.deal,at.predetermination amounts to a procedural violation of the idea.id.at.it can cause substantive harm,and therefore deprive a child of a fape,where parents are effectively deprived of meaningful participation in the iep process.id.however,predetermination is not synonymous with preparation.federal law prohibits a completed iep from being presented at the iep team meeting or being otherwise forced on the parents,but states that school evaluators may prepare reports and come with opinions regarding the best course of action for the child as long as they are willing to listen to the parents and parents have the opportunity to make objections and suggestions.knox county,at see also,app.a.we have emphasized that this p articipation must be more than mere form it must be meaningful.deal,at citations omitted emphasis in original.we review a predetermination decision de novo,since it is a mixed question of law and fact.id.at citation omitted.
nack points to a variety of evidence that he claims proves predetermination,including the school written notice,laurie barron testimony,linda cusick testimony,and certain conclusions by the iho.however,this evidence,while signaling nack disagreement with orange ultimate decision,does little to prove nack claim that orange had predetermined david educational path.in fact,three separate iep meetings were held concerning david iep and nack actively participated in each of these meetings.prior to and during these meetings,nack repeatedly made school officials aware of her disapproval of david participation in the mpass program and her desire for him to remain in regular education setting.nack was always able to be a significant part of the discussions concerning the iep.
t his is a far cry from the situation in deal where the sixth circuit found numerous procedural and substantive errors,that the school district had an unofficial policy of refusing to consider certain programs regardless of the child needs,and that the district main concern was financial.indeed,in deal,the parents were not even allowed to ask questions during the iep meetings.
winkelman parma city sch,d,citing deal,at.likewise,in spielberg ex rel.spielberg henrico county public,cir,the fourth circuit found predetermination in a situation where the school resolved to educate the child at one school,and then developed an iep to carry out their decision.there is simply no evidence here that orange had david fate prior to the iep meeting.while there clearly had been ongoing discussions concerning david and certain portions of the iep had been drafted in advance,school evaluators may prepare reports and come with opinions regarding the best course of action for the child as long as they are willing to listen to the parents and parents have the opportunity to make objections and suggestions.knox county,at.here,nack was given many opportunities to comment on the iep and,by every indication,orange took her suggestions seriously.in the end,there is insufficient evidence in the record to prove a procedural violation of the idea through predetermination.
validity of david ieps 
next,nack claims that orange procedurally violated the idea since the various ieps created for david did not conform to the requirements of d a.the slro found that there were no procedural violations in the or ieps.as for the iep,the slro,like the iho,ruled that procedural errors were committed,including that either sufficient present levels of educational performance were not provided or were not provided to the extent necessary to implement goals and objectives,and that orange had fail ed to provide weekly assignment sheets.however,the slro ruled that there was no substantive violation in that these errors in the iep neither resulted in a loss of educational opportunity for the student or infringed upon parent opportunity to participate in the iep process.on review,the district court noted that orange did not dispute that the ieps were incomplete,but the court ultimately found that there was no evidence that david or nack suffered any substantive harm as a result of the omission of such data,and thus nothing to connect the procedural shortcomings to actual denial of educational opportunities for david.
looking first to the fifth and ieps,nack asserts that these ieps failed to conform to the requirements of d a,but points to no particular portions of the ieps that are flawed and instead chooses to simply state that the ieps failed to conform to many of the idea requirements.nevertheless,a review of the iep shows that it fully complies with the requirements of d a i and in that it contains all of the required information and there are no allegations that orange erred in its implementation.similarly,the iep contains the required information and nack again fails to point to any specific problems given both the apparent completeness of each iep and that nack points to no particular deficiencies with the creation or implementation of the ieps,the fifth and ieps satisfy the procedural requirements of the idea.see d a i a.
as for the iep,orange concedes that it failed to appeal to the slro the iho decision that david iep did not conform with the requirements of d a.therefore,we assume that david iep was procedurally flawed.nonetheless,a procedural violation of the idea is not a per se denial of a fape rather,a school district failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the act will constitute a denial of a fape only if such violation causes substantive harm to the child or his parents.knable ex rel.knable bexley city sch,cir citations omitted.substantive harm occurs when the procedural violations in question either seriously infringe upon the parents opportunity to participate in the iep process or deprive an eligible student of an individualized education program or result in the loss of educational opportunity.id.at citations omitted.nack does not allege that her opportunity to participate in the iep process was seriously infringed upon by these procedural violations.instead,relying heavily upon the sixth circuit decision in boss,nack argues that david was substantively harmed by the failure of the iep to provide a baseline to measure david future progress.
in boss,the iep did not include appropriate objective criteria for measuring the child progress,at,and instead contained only vague and general statements,id.at.since the required components of an iep are how the adequacy of an iep is to be judged,we held that this violation was far from technical and not harmless since the omission went to the heart of the substance of the plan.id.at.we distinguished a prior case,doe ex rel.doe defendant i,cir,by noting that the ruling in that case relied upon the undisputed fact that the information absent from the iep was known to all parties.id.at.defendant i held that invalidating an iep for minor technical violations would exalt form over substance given the supreme court concern with a dequate parental involvement and participation in formulating an iep,not adherence to the laundry list of items now in d a i.at.
this case appears closer to defendant i than boss.the primary shortcoming of the iep was its failure to provide a baseline by which to measure david future progress.however,as the iho noted,david test results,which he scored at or above proficiency standard in all categories,along with maxine rosenbau
