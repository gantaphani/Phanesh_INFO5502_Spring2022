collectively referred to as teen ranch,appeal the district court grant of summary judgement in favor of,collectively referred to as the family independence agency fia on teen ranch constitutional and statutory religious discrimination claims.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgement.
the fia,a department of the michigan state government,is responsible for providing care and supervision to abused,neglected,and delinquent children who have been committed to or placed in its care through state courts.the fia is authorized to contract with private organizations to provide placement services.the fia contracts with private agencies to provide residential services to youth for stays averaging four to twelve months.at least of the providers are organizations.
once a child is placed in the care of the fia,a computerized grid is then used to determine the best placement for the child.the computer system considers the child history,family history,any relevant psychological or psychiatric information,and other information identifying the child treatment needs.the computer then selects a service provider that best matches the child needs.
teen ranch,one of the providers that contract with the fia,is an organization that has provided licensed and residential services for delinquent,neglected,abused,and emotionally troubled youth between the ages of and since.teen ranch has openly advertised its religious orientation,and has admittedly incorporated religious programming into the services it provides under the fia contract.however,teen ranch maintains that participation in the religious programming is voluntary since its policy does not mandate participation in any religious activity,including church services.specifically,its program involves voluntary prayers before meals,voluntary devotions during the week,voluntary church attendance,and voluntary discussions concerning the christian faith between staff and the children.
between october and november of,the fia conducted a quality assurance review qar of the teen ranch program.the qar unveiled several areas of contract and policy noncompliance.therefore,on november,the fia,through debora buchanan buchanan,sent a letter to teen ranch outlining violations of particular significance and issuing a moratorium on further placements at teen ranch.the qar also uncovered evidence,which was later confirmed,in the form of youth reports,interviews with residents,and teen ranch brochure,that teen ranch coerced children into participating in religious activities.thereafter,teen ranch incorporation of religious practices into its programming became the fia chief concern.
on december,the fia issued a quality assurance program review report to teen ranch and requested,within days,a quality improvement plan addressing all of their concerns.teen ranch subsequently submitted a corrective action plan cap or plan,and on december,buchanan sent a letter responding to teen ranch plan.in addition to detailing the areas of teen ranch cap that did not adequately ensure compliance,the letter also addressed teen ranch representation that youth are not required to participate in religious programming.buchanan stated,it is not only improper to force youth to participate in religious practices,but it is also improper to incorporate religious teachings into the daily activities of youth and their treatment plans.at.on december,a meeting was held between the fia and teen ranch where teen ranch continued to maintain its position of incorporating its religious beliefs into treatment programming.at the conclusion of that meeting,and in response to the fia request for an amended cap concerning the religious practices,teen ranch issued the following statement,in pertinent part 
the mission statement of teen ranch states,providing hope to young people and families through life changing relationships and experiences from a christian perspective.this mission,and our interpretation of this mission,will not change,be sacrificed,nor will it be compromised.
teen ranch,as policy,does not force youth to attend religious services,although it is encouraged and we believe to be part of an effective treatment program.alternatives are provided for the children who wish not to attend religious services,such as a personal academic study time if desired,letter writing home sic,recreational time in the gymnasium,or watch sic television until the other youth return home.
however,incorporating religious teachings into daily activities of youth and their treatment plans touches at the core of why we were founded,why we are here today,and why we will continue to include such programming for children in our care.
at emphasis in original.
by early january,teen ranch had submitted an amended cap that addressed all of the violations identified by the fia,with the exception of the incorporation of religious practices in its programming.accordingly,on january,the fia informed teen ranch,by letter,that while it supports the important role that organizations play in providing quality services to michigan youth and families,providers receiving federal funding may not incorporate sectarian worship,instruction,or proselytization into the daily treatment and service plan activities.at.furthermore,it stated that t he incorporation of faith specific tenets into treatment is not permitted by state and federal law,and if teen ranch is unwilling to modify its current practices regarding the imposition of its religious beliefs into the daily treatment and service plan activities,the fia is unable to approve the corrective action plan and rescind the moratorium.at.

the district court properly considered teen ranch constitutional and statutory claims,and correctly granted judgement in favor of the fia.as a preliminary matter,the district court identified the applicable law at issue of the michigan state appropriations bill,public act which governs contracts between the fia and organizations and also instructs the fia to follow the guidelines set forth in the federal statute that governs contracts between states and charitable,religious or private organizations.the district court properly recognized that this case turns on whether the fia funding of teen ranch is indirect,rather than direct,because the funding is a result of the genuine and independent choices of private individuals.zelman,d see also mitchell helms,d supreme court stating that it has repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals rather than the unmediated will of government.quoting agostini felton,d accordingly,the district court examined whether the ability of youth to opt out of the teen ranch program pursuant to
