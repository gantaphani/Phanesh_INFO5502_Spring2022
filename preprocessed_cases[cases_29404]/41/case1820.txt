baptist memorial medical little rock baptist memorial challenges a decision by the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs denying,for medicare reimbursement purposes,approved educational activity status for classroom costs incurred by baptist memorial in connection with its affiliation with a nursing school.the district court upheld the secretary decision.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
hhs administers the medicare program,et,through its component centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.the secretary contracts with fiscal intermediaries,such as blue shield in the instant case,to audit the costs submitted by medicare provider hospitals and approve or disapprove medicare reimbursement.see defining fiscal intermediary.a provider hospital may appeal the reimbursement decision of the fiscal intermediary to hhs provider reimbursement review board prrb.the prrb decision becomes the final decision of the agency unless the secretary,on his own motion,decides to affirm,reverse or modify the decision.id.f.
prior to,all costs incurred by a provider hospital were reimbursed on a reasonable cost,each hospital actual costs incurred were reimbursed so long as the secretary found the costs reasonable.see b.in title vi of the social security amendments of,stat.pps legislation,congress established the prospective payment system pps as an incentive for hospitals to reduce costs and operate more efficiently.see,at,reprinted in.under pps,a provider hospital receives medicare reimbursement at a flat rate for each patient based on the patient category of treatment.d.
congress exempted a few costs from pps,allowing continued medicare reimbursement under b treatment for,among other things,approved educational activities.a.congress did not define approved educational activities in the statute.the secretary published a regulation stating that approved educational activities included neither c linical training of students not enrolled in an approved education program operated by the provider,d emphasis added,nor o ther activities that do not involve the actual operation of an approved education program,id.d.during the phase of the regulation publication,the secretary elaborated that only the costs of those approved medical education programs operated directly by a hospital are excluded from pps,emphasis added 
in addition to costs for programs that would qualify as approved educational activities under,congress established treatment for another category of costs borne by provider hospitals in of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra,stat,extended in b of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra,stat.this treatment category includes only the costs of clinical nursing school programs conducted on the premises of,but not necessarily directly operated by,a provider hospital so long as certain conditions specified in obra are met.
in short,educational activities at a provider hospital that do not qualify for treatment under either or obra are reimbursed as part of the pps payment for the hospital normal operating costs.treatment for educational activities is financially desirable for the provider hospital because the pps payment for normal operating costs essentially depends only upon the number of patients discharged and their diagnoses,and does not directly compensate the costs of educational activities 
baptist memorial is owned and operated by baptist health,a corporation that also owned and operated three other hospitals from to.baptist health also owned and operated baptist school of nursing nursing school during that time.the four hospitals and the nursing school were not separate subsidiary corporations but were each operated as separate business units and maintained separate bookkeeping.each hospital had its own medicare provider number,but baptist health was the legal entity that contracted for the numbers.
after the institution of the pps system,baptist health allocated the costs of the nursing school among its four hospitals.each hospital then characterized its share of those costs as approved educational activities and received reimbursement.in,however,the regional cms office notified the hospitals fiscal intermediary that the nursing school costs were not eligible for treatment because the provider hospitals did not operate the nursing school.in response,in baptist health moved all nursing school costs to baptist memorial books.baptist memorial and the nursing school executed a memorandum of agreement outlining the responsibilities of baptist memorial to support the school.
from to baptist memorial submitted its nursing school costs for treatment,but the fiscal intermediary denied reimbursement.on administrative appeal,the prrb reversed,finding that the costs qualified for treatment as an approved educational activity because baptist memorial was engaged in,to a significant extent,the operation of the nursing education program.the administrator of cms,acting under the authority of the secretary,vacated the prrb decision because baptist memorial did not directly operate the nursing school.however,the administrator remanded to the prrb for a determination of whether any of the nursing school costs were qualified clinical costs under obra.on remand,the prrb approved all submitted clinical costs for treatment under obra and also reinstated its already rejected finding that the,or classroom,costs were eligible for treatment as an approved educational activity.the administrator affirmed that the clinical costs were eligible for treatment under obra but reversed again on the classroom costs because baptist memorial did not directly operate the nursing school.
baptist memorial sued for review of the agency decision in federal district court.the district court affirmed the administrator decision,relying on the circuit resolution of a similar dispute in community care foundation thompson.baptist memorial now appeals the denial of treatment for the classroom costs associated with the nursing school,arguing that the direct operation requirement is not a permissible interpretation of the statute and that it conflicts with the secretary prior interpretation.baptist memorial also argues that,even under the standard,its affiliation with the nursing school qualified as an approved educational activity.

a.the secretary interpretation of the statute 
baptist memorial argues that it is arbitrary and capricious for the secretary to interpret the statutory language approved educational activity to include a requirement that the provider hospital directly operate the educational program.the chevron test determines whether the secretary rule is a permissible interpretation of the statute 
w e ask first whether the intent of congress is clear as to the precise question at issue.if,by employing traditional tools of statutory construction,we determine that congress intent is clear,that is the end of the matter.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.if the agency reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the legislature design,we give that reading controlling weight,even if it is not the answer the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.
regions hosp.shalala,d citations omitted quoting chevron natural res.def.council,d.
under step one of the chevron analysis,we determine whether the statute makes clear the intent of congress as to the meaning of the term approved educational activities.the statute does not expressly define the term,but baptist memorial contends that congress implicitly adopted an existing definition from a medicare regulation.the term approved educational activities was defined in medicare regulations in as formally organized or planned programs of study usually engaged in by providers in order to enhance the quality of patient care in an institution.prior to the establishment of the pps system in,the secretary adopted the holding of a seventh circuit case,john hickey memorial hospital,califano,cir,which interpreted the regulation to mean that a provider hospital need only be engaged in,rather than the legal operator of,an educational program for the program to meet the regulatory definition of an approved educational activity.
in support of its argument that congress intended to incorporate the definition of approved educational activities from into the pps legislation,baptist memorial cites toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams,d,and bragdon abbott,d,for the proposition that congress repetition of a term carries the implication that congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with regulatory interpretations.bragdon,at.see also toyota motor,at.the relevant issue in both toyota motor and bragdon was the interpretation of the definition of disability provided in the americans with disabilities act of ada.the supreme court noted that the detailed,definition provided in the ada was drawn almost verbatim from the definition of handicapped individual in the earlier rehabilitation act of,b,and the definition of handicap contained in the fair housing amendments act of,h.bragdon,at.see also toyota motor,at.in addition,the court noted that the ada expressly stated,except as otherwise provided in this chapter,nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under title v of the rehabilitation act of et or the regulations issued by federal agencies pursuant to such title.toyota motor,at.quoting a bragdon,at.quoting a.based on the adoption of identical,detailed language from the earlier statutes and the express reference to the standards set by one of the earlier statutes and its associated regulations,the court found that the regulations associated with the earlier statute were appropriate sources of guidance for interpreting the terms of the definition in the ada.toyota motor,at.bragdon,at.
toyota motor and bragdon do not support the proposition that congress implicitly intended to incorporate the definition of approved educational activities from into the pps statutory scheme.first,the ada adopted an entire,definition from the relevant earlier statutes,not just a single term in contrast,the pps legislation used only the term approved educational activities and conspicuously failed to incorporate the associated definition provided in the earlier regulation.second,the ada adopted the definition from earlier statutes,not merely from an agency regulatory definition,as baptist memorial suggests happened in this case.finally,the ada expressly referenced the standards developed from the applicable earlier statute and its associated regulations the pps legislation does not do so.under these circumstances,we can not find any congressional intent to incorporate the definition of approved educational activities from,as elaborated upon in john hickey and its progeny,into the pps legislation.instead,we agree with the circuit that congress,by its silence,left the definition of approved educational activities to the secretary.accord cmty.care,at 
we now proceed to step two of the chevron analysis and determine whether the agency definition is based on a permissible construction of the statute.regions,at.quotation omitted.in proposing the regulation at issue here,the secretary described why the definition of the approved educational activities made eligible for treatment in the pps legislation was important to the policy goals of that legislation 
we are also amending later to clarify the definition of allowable costs for medical education,because certain medical education costs are excluded from payment under pps.this was not necessary before,since all the costs were reimbursed on the same reasonable cost basis.however,under pps,failure to properly define those medical education costs,for which payment in addition to prospective payments is permitted,could result in unnecessary and inappropriate payments.
later,in response to comments on the proposed new regulation,the secretary explained why a requirement of direct operation of the educational program by the provider hospital was necessary to implement congress medicare goals 
number of comments were received concerning whether the pass through of direct education costs is limited to only the costs of those approved medical education programs that a hospital directly operates itself.if this is the case,commenters were concerned that certain costs,such as the costs of clinical training for students enrolled in programs other than at the hospital,may not be excluded from the prospective payment system,but rather are considered to be normal operating costs.
believe that only the costs of those approved medical education programs operated directly by a hospital be excluded from the prospective payment system.if a program is operated by another institution,such as a nearby college or university,it must be noted that by far the majority of the costs of that program are borne by that other institution,and not by the hospital.while it is true that the hospital may incur some costs associated with its provision of clinical training to students enrolled in a nearby institution,the hospital also gains in return.
for example,it obtains the services of the trainee often at no direct cost to itself.we do not believe that this type of relationship was what congress intended when it provided for a pass through of the costs of approved medical education programs.rather,we believe that congress was concerned with those programs that a hospital operates itself,and for which it incurs substantial direct costs.
we are revising d later d to clarify that the costs of clinical training for students enrolled in programs,other than at the hospital,are normal operating costs.
the secretary explanation of why a requirement for approved educational activities was necessary to implement congress goals for the pps legislation is eminently reasonable in light of the legislature design.regions,at.therefore,we hold that the secretary rule is a permissible interpretation of the statute.
b.the prrb conflicting prior interpretations 
in three decisions announced between and,involving cost years from to,the prrb analyzed approved educational activities under the john hickey engaged in standard,rather than the more strict standard originally associated with d.the secretary declined review of those decisions.baptist memorial argues that it is arbitrary and capricious for the secretary now to change his interpretation and apply the standard in this case we disagree.
when we evaluate an agency change of position,
the mere fact that an agency interpretation contradicts a prior agency position is not fatal.sudden and unexplained change or change that does not take account of legitimate reliance on prior interpretation may be arbitrary,capricious or an abuse of discretion.but if these pitfalls are avoided,change is not invalidating,since the whole point of chevron is to leave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a statute with the implementing agency.
