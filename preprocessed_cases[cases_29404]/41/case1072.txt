amended opinion 
this social security disability appeal presents a single procedural issue regarding whether the social security administration adequately explained its decision.at least on the particular facts of this case,it was procedurally acceptable for the alj not to address in his opinion that bowie was borderline between age groups under b.the district court therefore properly upheld the commissioner denial of benefits.
suffering from hypertension,aortic stenosis,and recurrent depression,appellant josephine bowie filed an application for social security disability benefits on march.her claim was denied initially and on reconsideration,after which she requested and received a hearing before an alj.bowie was apprised of her right to representation,but proceeded without an attorney.a vocational expert appeared and testified at the hearing.at the time of the alj decision,bowie was years old and less than two months away from her birthday.
the alj filed an opinion on july,in which he concluded that bowie was not disabled.proceeding through the five steps of the analysis prescribed in the social security administration disability regulations,see b g,the alj determined that bowie had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity since her alleged disability onset date step that bowie impairments are severe step,but do not qualify under the administration listings of impairments step that bowie is capable of performing unskilled sedentary exertional work that bowie is unable to perform any of her past relevant work as an assembler in the automobile industry step and that,considering bowie residual functional capacity and vocational factors,bowie is capable of making an adjustment to other work step.with respect to step five,the alj concluded that bowie past relevant work is unskilled that she has two years of college education and that,giving bowie the benefit of the doubt and according full credence to her testimony there are thousands of jobs in the regional economy requiring only unskilled sedentary work that bowie could perform.the latter conclusion was based largely on the testimony of the vocational expert,who testified that there were a significant number of unskilled sedentary jobs in the regional economy within bowie established residual functional capacity and that bowie exertional and nonexertional limitations would not,in combination,preclude the performance of any substantial gainful activity.
importantly for purposes of this appeal,the alj placed bowie in the younger individual age category claimant is a younger individual.the younger person category spans ages to,and is followed by the closely approaching advanced age category,which spans ages to.c d.subsection b of the regulation governing age categories provides that there is to be some flexibility between the age categories in borderline situations 
how we apply the age categories.when we make a finding about your ability to do other work under f,we will use the age categories in paragraphs c through e of this section.we will use each of the age categories that applies to you during the period for which we must determine if you are disabled.we will not apply the age categories mechanically in a borderline situation.if you are within a few days to a few months of reaching an older age category,and using the older age category would result in a determination or decision that you are disabled,we will consider whether to use the older age category after evaluating the overall impact of all the factors of your case.
b emphasis added.other than concluding that bowie is a younger individual and citing,the alj did not discuss bowie age categorization in his opinion.he did not explicitly address the possibility that bowie,less than two months shy of her birthday,presented a borderline situation,and he did not discuss the possibility of moving bowie to the closely approaching advanced age category.
bowie subsequently filed a request for review with the appeals council,which initially granted her request and remanded the case because the administrative record was missing.upon locating the record,the order of remand was vacated and bowie request for review was denied on august.bowie then challenged the commissioner decision in district court.
characterizing bowie argument as that the alj improperly categorized plaintiff as a younger individual when she should have properly been considered closely approaching advanced age,the magistrate judge concluded that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence and that bowie was properly categorized as a younger individual.the magistrate judge emphasized that the record contains no evidence of the additional vocational adversities described in the hearings,appeals and litigation law manual of the social security administration hallex.see application of the guidelines in borderline age situations,soc.sec,office of hearings and appeals,hearings,appeals and litigation law manual hallex.through the hallex,the associate commissioner of hearings and appeals provides guiding principles,procedural guidance and information to adjudicators and staff of the office of hearings and appeals.id.the hallex provisions relied upon by the magistrate judge became effective on november.id.
according to the hallex,a claimant presents a borderline age situation when the claimant age is within a few days or months of a higher age category and use of the higher age category would result in a finding of disability.id.if a claimant presents a borderline situation,the alj is directed to decide whether it is more appropriate to use the claimant chronological age or the higher age.to do this,the alj takes a sliding scale approach 
under this approach,the claimant must show progressively more additional vocational adversity ies to support use of the higher the time period between the claimant actual age and his or her attainment of the next higher age category lengthens.
id.examples of additional vocational adversities are the presence of an additional impairment that infringes on the claimant remaining occupational base having only a marginal ability to communicate in english or a history of work experience in an unskilled job in one isolated industry or work setting id.absent a showing of additional adversity ies the adjudicator will use the claimant chronological age.id.based on his conclusion that the record was devoid of evidence that bowie had any such additional adversities,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant summary judgment to the commissioner.
bowie objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.she clarified that her claim is that,because she presented a borderline age situation,the alj was required in his decision to address b,the regulation providing for flexibility in borderline age situations.in support,bowie cited wilson commissioner,cir,for the proposition that the commissioner should not have the ability to violate regulations with impunity and render the protections promised therein illusory.she requested that the district court remand her case to the alj to make a proper determination regarding the age category provisions of b.
the district judge adopted the magistrate report and recommendation,overruled bowie objections,and granted summary judgment to the commissioner.the district judge interpreted bowie as arguing that the application of the older age category was both mandatory and would result in a finding of disability,and concluded that bowie misinterprets the law,explaining that the alj simply has discretion to apply the older age category if he believes it is warranted.the judge also rejected bowie contention that the alj did not apply b,explaining that t he alj made a specific finding under section that the plaintiff was a younger individual and that,having listed both bowie age and birth date,the alj was plainly informed of the fact that she was approaching years of age.the district judge concluded that u ltimately,the plaintiff can not demonstrate that the alj disregarded the applicable regulation.at best,she has voiced her dissatisfaction with the effect of that application.moreover,the judge distinguished wilson,finding the case inapposite at issue here is the discretionary application of certain rules governing vocational factors,not the articulation of a reason to depart from a rule for crediting medical evidence.
on appeal,bowie argues that because she was borderline between age groups the alj was required to apply b in determining her age category.on bowie reading of the regulation,this means that the alj is required to acknowledge bowie borderline status explicitly and to make an explicit determination regarding which age group is most appropriate,and that an alj failure to conduct an explicit borderline age analysis constitutes a mechanical application of the age categories in violation of b.accordingly,bowie argues that the alj committed procedural error by not addressing her borderline status or otherwise explicitly indicating that he considered it.
the alj decision to deny bowie benefits is,however,supported by substantial evidence and not the product of procedural error.while an alj may need to provide,in cases where the record indicates that use of a higher age category is appropriate,some indication that he considered borderline age categorization in order to satisfy a reviewing court that his decision is supported by substantial evidence,b does not impose on aljs a per se procedural requirement to address borderline age categorization in every borderline case.
in regulations addressed to the claimant in the second person,the administration provides that if a claimant is unable to perform her past relevant work due to her impairment,the administration will consider the claimant residual functional capacity combined with her vocational include age,education,and work determine if the claimant can make an adjustment to other work.see g step.in considering age as a vocational factor,the regulations provide that a ge means your chronological age and that the administration will use the age categories in paragraphs c through e of.id.a b.describing how the administration will apply the age categories,the regulation informs the claimant that the administration will not apply the age categories mechanically in a borderline situation,and explains that in such a situation the administration will consider whether to use the older age category after evaluating the overall impact of all the factors of your case.b.
although aljs are obligated by this text not to apply the age categories mechanically and to consider whether use of an older age category would be appropriate in a borderline case,nothing in this language obligates an alj to address a claimant borderline age situation in his opinion or explain his thought process in arriving at a particular determination.rather,the regulation merely promises claimants that the administration will consider veering from the default in borderline situations.
while not binding on this court,the procedural guidance to the staff and adjudicators of the office of hearings and appeals set forth in the hallex bolsters this interpretation.in section,the associate commissioner of hearings and appeals provided an appeals council interpretation of entitled application of the guidelines in borderline age situations,which interpretation directs aljs to consider whether the claimant has presented additional vocational adversities in determining whether to veer from a claimant chronological age in a borderline situation.hallex.appeals council interpretations are designed to surface and resolve issues arising from gaps in policy or unclear statements of policy,promote greater consistency and uniformity in applying policy throughout the adjudicatory process,and establish precedents at the hearings and appeals levels of adjudication.id.with respect to borderline age situations,the council advised 
absent a showing of additional adversity ies justifying use of the higher age category,the adjudicator will use the claimant chronological when the time period is only a few days.the adjudicator need not explain his or her use of the claimant chronological age.
id.emphasis added.moreover,the appeals council appears to anticipate that aljs will not always address the issue of age categorization in cases involving borderline age situations,and explains that in such situations,the council will typically deny review unless there is a basis in the record for using a higher age category 
the appeals council will ordinarily deny review,assuming there is no other basis for granting review,when a borderline age situation exists,the alj decision does not address the issue,and the appeals council does not find sufficient basis in the record for using the higher age category.
id.emphasis added.thus,not only is there no procedural requirement apparent on the face of b to address age categorization explicitly in borderline situations,the appeals council also does not presume such a requirement.
this court decision in wilson commissioner,cir,is not to the contrary.although bowie is correct that wilson stands for the proposition that remand is appropriate when an agency fails to follow its own procedural requirements,wilson is distinguishable from the instant case in that the alj in wilson demonstrably violated a clear elaboration requirement imposed explicitly by the regulations.section d promises claimants that the administration will always give good reasons in our notice of determination or decision for not giving weight to a treating physician opinion in the context of a disability determination.d.despite this good reasons requirement,the alj in wilson rejected the opinion of the claimant treating physician without providing any explanation.wilson,at.this action violated the alj clear explanatory obligation to give good reasons for rejecting a treating physician opinion.by contrast,the regulations governing borderline age situations do not impose a procedural explanatory requirement.section b does not,for example,promise claimants that the administration will give good reasons for using chronological age in a borderline age situation.rather,b merely provides that the administration will consider whether use of an older age category would be appropriate and that it will not apply the age categories mechanically in a borderline situation.
that b does not impose a per se procedural requirement to address borderline age categorization explicitly in every borderline case does not relieve aljs of their obligation to provide enough explanation of their overall disability determinations to assure reviewers that their decisions are supported by substantial evidence.see g.although an alj does not have a procedural obligation to address a claimant borderline age situation in his opinion or explain his reasons for arriving at a particular age categorization,lack of an explanation may in some cases mean that the alj ultimate decision is not supported by sufficient evidence.for example,substantial evidence might be lacking where an alj,with no explanation,places a claimant in the younger individual age category who is years and months,unskilled,sedentary,barely literate,and whose only previous work experience was in the fishing industry.see rule,app.to subpart p of hallex.in that situation,the claimant additional vocational adversities would be significant and would merit some discussion of proper age categorization in order to meet the threshold.
such is not the case with respect to bowie.as the magistrate judge explained in detail,there is simply no evidence in the record that bowie suffered from any additional vocational adversities that might justify placing her in the higher age category.moreover,the alj indicated that he did not find bowie allegations regarding her limitations entirely credible to begin with and that he gave her testimony the benefit of the doubt.given these circumstances and the lack of any other questionable findings by the alj,the ultimate benefits determination is supported by substantial evidence.
our reasoning is supported by the,albeit unpublished,decision in van der maas commissioner of social security,cir 
van der maas was within a couple of months of reaching an older age category.although the al
