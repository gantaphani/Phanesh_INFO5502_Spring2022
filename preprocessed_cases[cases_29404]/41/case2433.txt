background 
azer was the sole shareholder and president of dml.beginning in,dml was licensed to provide clinical laboratory services to california program.is california health program for the indigent,and is operated under the federal medicaid act.more than of dml revenues came from.because two aspects of the regulatory framework are pertinent to this appeal,we outline them briefly.
regulatory framework 
in exchange for receiving federal medicaid funds,states implementing programs such as must comply with the federal statutory and regulatory requirements of medicaid.see wilder.hosp.ass n,d san lazaro ass n,connell,cir.regulations implementing the medicaid act are promulgated by the federal department of health and human services hhs.one statutory provision requires a state participating in medicaid to designate a single state agency to administer its medicaid plan.a.dhs is the single state agency designated to administer.the designated state agency may not delegate to any other agency the authority to exercise discretion in administering the program.see e.however,the single state agency may subcontract certain functions that do not involve a delegation of discretionary authority.see.for example,dhs contracts with a private entity,electronic data systems eds,to review and process provider payments for services to patients.see san lazaro,at.
another provision of federal law requires states to establish procedures to investigate medicaid fraud and abuse,while also safeguarding the rights of providers.see a,a.if an audit reveals overpayment to a provider,the provider is entitled to an administrative appeal of the audit findings.see cal.welf.although dhs is permitted by federal regulation to withhold payments to a provider in cases of fraud or willful misrepresentation,such withholdings must be temporary.see c.dhs may not recoup alleged overpayments to a provider until the administrative appeals process is complete.see regs.tit,a.
audit agreement between dhs and the controller 
in june,dhs and the state controller entered into an interagency agreement under which the controller would perform audits and identify overpayments to providers.the agreement provided that although the controller would perform audits,dhs would retain final authority to review all reports of overpayments identified by the controller.see rcj med,bonta,th,d describing the agreement.in september,pursuant to the interagency agreement with dhs,the state controller defendants ordered two financial auditors employed exclusively by the state controller office to conduct an unannounced,warrantless search of dml business premises and to seize various documents and records.dml alleges that there were subsequent warrantless searches as well,and that the funds seized had been previously approved for payment.the defendants ultimately seized and withheld approximately in payments from dml.as a result of the seizures,dml was forced to close its laboratory,effective november.
dml state court suits 
in november,dml filed suit in california state court seeking a declaration that the controller had acted unlawfully in seizing and withholding the funds,and an order that the funds be released.the suit named as defendant only california state controller connell,in her official capacity.the trial court ruled in favor of dml,holding that although the controller had the authority to audit dml,she had acted improperly in impounding the funds.the california court of appeal affirmed the trial court holding that the controller had improperly impounded the funds,and affirmed its order requiring the controller to refund the payments seized from dml.see doctor med,connell,th,d.the appellate court reversed the trial court holding that the controller may conduct audits.see id.at,d.
although the california court of appeal ordered the controller to release all funds that eds had approved for payment to dml without prejudice to subsequent audits and claims for overpayment by dhs,id.at,d,the controller refused to release any funds.instead,she petitioned for rehearing,and then appealed to the california supreme court.that court denied review on may.
two days later,dhs defendant munso sent a memorandum to the controller office stating 
we understand that the california supreme court has refused to overturn the decision of the court of appeal we further understand that this means that your office is now compelled to release payments previously withheld from dml.based on information available,we have determined that we have reliable evidence of fraud or willful misrepresentation by dml.therefore,we are requesting that you withhold any payments based on adjudicated claims pursuant to our authority in cfr section the temporary withholding provision.
after munso memorandum was sent,dhs defendant schaden informed plaintiffs that dhs was temporarily withholding all of the payments in question because it had determined that there was fraud or misrepresentation by dml.in response to munso memorandum,the controller office delivered to dhs a warrant payable to dml for.dhs,in turn,refused to release the funds to dml.
dml returned to state court seeking to compel the controller to comply with the order that it refund the money to dml.both the trial court and the court of appeal rejected the controller argument that it could not refund the payments to dml because it had turned the warrant over to dhs.see doctor med,connell,no.june.the court of appeal concluded that because the payments had been withheld for more than two and a half years,the withholding could not be termed temporary pursuant to the relevant regulation.see c.
the controller finally released some of the money owed to dml in june.the balance of the money was refunded in november.
d.the current suit 
azer and dml filed this complaint on october,seeking relief under.suits under by corporate plaintiffs are permissible.see cal.diversified promotions,musick,cir.to establish a prima facie case under,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the action complained of occurred under color of law,and the action resulted in a deprivation of a constitutional right or a federal statutory right.mcdade west,cir citing parratt taylor,d,overruled on other grounds by daniels williams,d.
the four counts of the complaint allege the controller warrantless search of dml premises and her seizure of papers and payments constitute a violation of plaintiffs fourth amendment rights the initial seizure of funds approved for payment to dml and the continuing withholding of those funds constituted a violation of plaintiffs due process rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments defendants deprived plaintiffs of their right under a and to have a single state agency administer the program and defendants deprived plaintiffs of their rights under and to due process of law and to have funds withheld only temporarily.plaintiffs seek million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.
the district court initially held that plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case as to counts and of its complaint,rejecting the defendants argument that medi
