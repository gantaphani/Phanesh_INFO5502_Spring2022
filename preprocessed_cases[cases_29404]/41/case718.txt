the equal employment opportunity commission brought this suit on behalf of deborah waechter against her former employer,fairbrook medical clinic.the agency alleges that john kessel,the sole owner of the clinic,subjected waechter to a hostile work environment because of her sex in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the district court held that kessel conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment.what happened here,however,was not merely general crudity but a series of graphic remarks of a highly personal nature directed at a female employee by the sole owner of an establishment.after carefully considering these circumstances,we conclude that the eeoc has presented an issue of triable fact and accordingly reverse.
for purposes of summary judgment,we view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party,here the eeoc.scott harris,internal quotation omitted.
deborah waechter graduated from medical school in and completed her residency in.in december of,she accepted a position as a physician at fairbrook medical clinic,a family medicine practice in hickory,north carolina.during the time period relevant to this suit,fairbrook employed between and people,most of whom were women.
john kessel is the sole owner of fairbrook,and he served as waechter immediate supervisor during her entire tenure at the clinic.by kessel own estimation,waechter was an excellent physician.within a few years of working at fairbrook,she had between three and four hundred regular patients.
waechter alleges that kessel sexually harassed her while she worked at fairbrook.according to her,the incidents of harassment became so frequent and distressing that she decided to leave the clinic for other employment in early.these incidents are detailed below.
the first incident occurred a few weeks after waechter started working at fairbook.in january of,kessel showed her an of his hip for the supposed purpose of revealing a hip abnormality that he had suffered since adolescence.in the,a shadowy image of his penis was highly visible.after describing his hip condition,kessel pointed to the image of his penis and called it happy.this comment left waechter speechless and uncomfortable.according to waechter,kessel showed this to other people in the clinic at least to times,mostly around the time that he had surgery to correct the abnormality.on about five to ten of these occasions,he referred to the image of his penis as happy.other employees report having seen the as well.for example,joseph sigmon,the former pharmacist at fairbrook,testified that the was left hanging on a wall for four to six weeks and that kessel showed it to female drug representatives who came to the clinic.
the next incident occurred in february of.during a staff meeting,kessel stated that he was very glad that his wife had had a with their triplets because she still had a nice,tight pussy.although waechter was not present at the meeting,employees who were in attendance later reported the incident to her.on a few occasions,kessel directly discussed his sex life with waechter,telling her that he was glad that his wife had had to have a vaginal birth because her muscles were still tight.when waechter said that she did not feel comfortable discussing the topic,kessel said well,you just like one of the guys,to which she replied no,i not.
in march of,kessel approached waechter to talk about her attire.kessel reported that a male patient had remarked that kessel sure had hired a lady physician with a nice set of breasts.he then instructed waechter to be aware of her breasts and dress appropriately.when waechter asked what the patient had been referring to,kessel responded that the patient had probably been able to see her nipples through her blouse.waechter replied that she tried to maintain a professional appearance and did not dress in a manner that would show her nipples.
at some point,kessel invited waechter to look at some photographs from his recent vacation to the caribbean.waechter agreed,expecting to see innocuous images of beaches or scuba diving.she was shocked,however,to discover a picture of kessel,his wife,and a few other couples in which the men were wearing speedos and the women were topless.when waechter expressed her surprise,kessel called the photograph funny and remarked that he still could not believe that his wife had agreed to have it taken.
in the fall of,kessel was receiving physical therapy in an examination room in the vicinity of waechter work station.he opened the door,emerged from the room without a shirt,and called out,hey deborah,do you want to come in here waechter refused and went about her business.
in march of,waechter traveled with her daughter to visit her husband in washington,where he was doing an internship.while waechter was gone,kessel treated one of her regular patients.according to the patient,kessel said that waechter was away on vacation and was probably screwing around so she can have another baby.at the end of the visit,he told the patient,you can follow up with waechter when she returns from screwing.when waechter returned,the patient informed her of kessel remarks.waechter was absolutely infuriated and confronted kessel.she told him that she considered it very inappropriate and unprofessional to speak that way about a colleague,especially in front of a patient.kessel adamantly denied making the remarks but did not attempt to explain why the patient would have made them up.
waechter also recalls hearing kessel tell dirty jokes about two or three times a month during her time at fairbrook.specifically,she remembers one joke in which kessel pretended to kiss a pair of breasts,moving back and forth between each one.on one occasion,kessel told a foul joke to a male drug representative in front of waechter.when the drug representative said he was surprised that kessel would tell such a joke in front of waechter,kessel responded,oh,she just like one of the guys.i just say anything in front of her.waechter then interjected that she did not appreciate hearing his jokes.
according to waechter,kessel also made demeaning comments about female drug representatives in front of her.on one such occasion,a female drug representative was walking down the hall with her back turned to kessel.kessel looked to waechter and said,does she look great for having had three kids i sure would like a piece of that.he then gestured as if he were grabbing the representative buttocks.waechter protested that the comment was not very nice.unfazed,kessel stated,well,she does look great for having had three kids.
other employees similarly report that kessel joked about sex and made demeaning comments about women.joseph sigmon recalls that kessel frequently talked about oral sex and women breasts and occasionally used terms like slut and cunt to refer to female staff and patients at the clinic.according to sigmon,kessel made sexually offensive remarks to a nybody,anytime,whether male or female.he further stated that kessel delighted in being a shock jock and watching women react to his obscene comments.in a similar vein,another employee reported that kessel used the term slut to refer to his own sister.
of course,kessel was not the only one who made crude remarks around the clinic.both employees and patients occasionally did so as well.waechter herself even made remarks on a few occasions.after one patient told her that her breasts had grown,waechter joked with the patient and later reported the episode to other employees.on another occasion,waechter authorized her assistant to tape posters of attractive men,some of whom were,to the ceiling above where she conducted pelvic examinations on female patients.after seeing the posters during her examination,a patient in her eighties told waechter that she had had that much excitement in years.waechter later joked about the incident around the office.
kessel comments to waechter became much more personal after she became pregnant with her second child.by october of,waechter was in her ninth month of pregnancy.on two or three occasions that month,kessel told her how big her breasts were getting and how fat she was getting.when waechter complained that these comments were inappropriate,kessel responded,well,you know i a breast man.i like breasts.shortly thereafter,waechter gave birth and went on maternity leave for six weeks.
when waechter returned from maternity leave in december of,kessel comments about her breasts became more frequent.on her first day back at work,for instance,kessel spotted her arriving in the parking lot and said,you sure have slimmed down,except in your breasts.at that time,waechter was still nursing her child at home and would pump breast milk in her office,usually during her lunch breaks.on several occasions,kessel asked her when she was going to let him help her pump her breasts.other times,he inquired if she had a better sexual libido while she was pumping and opined that she was probably a wild thing in bed.he also asked her,are you going to let me see your breasts and then stated,i sure hope you let me do so before you stop pumping.waechter estimates that kessel made these comments at least once or twice per week from her return in december of through january of.by january,waechter found kessel behavior very distressing and concluded that fairbrook was no longer a good working environment for her.accordingly,she began to consider other employment.
kessel offensive behavior continued into february of.one day in early february,waechter was sitting in the break room with an employee named debra sharpe.kessel entered the room and announced that he had stopped by waechter office to look for her.he then reported that he had seen a drop of breast milk on her desk and that he wanted to to lick it up.appalled,waechter told kessel that his comments were disgusting and gross.although kessel never repeated that remark,he continued to make comments about pumping her breasts.
the last straw for waechter happened on february.at that time,waechter was involved in a contract dispute with a hospital called frye regional medical center that had loaned her money in so that she could relocate to hickory,north carolina.kessel was paying her legal fees in the matter and had assured waechter that he would pay her outstanding debt if no other solution could be reached.on the day in question,kessel approached waechter at the clinic and said,you owe me big for helping you with the frye thing.he then asked,are you going to let me help you pump your breasts waechter called his comments ridiculous and said that they needed to stop.she explained that,while she appreciated his help with the frye matter,she did think that he needed to tell her that she owed him something,especially of a sexual nature.that was the last time that kessel made an inappropriate comment to her.
on february,waechter tendered her resignation.in a letter to kessel,she thanked him for the opportunity to practice medicine at fairbrook and announced that she would be taking a position at another practice.in addition,she stated her intention to continue working at fairbrook for thirty days in order to ensure a smooth transition.nowhere in the letter did she complain about kessel behavior.according to waechter,she declined to do so primarily because she wanted to keep working at fairbrook until her new job became available in order to provide continuous support for her family.
waechter continued working at fairbrook until march,and then started her new job the following week.her new position had several advantages over her former one namely,it had a higher salary and a shorter commute.nonetheless,waechter maintains that she would not have been as interested in the new position had it not been for kessel behavior.in fact,she turned down two other offers of employment prior to october of,the point at which kessel began making comments about her breasts on a regular basis.
while waechter was working at fairbrook,the clinic had an official policy prohibiting sexual harassment.the policy instructs employees to report any sexual harassment to their immediate supervisor s.if doing so is ineffective,employees should then report their complaints to the partners of fairbrook and ultimately to a human resource representative or a representative of the eeoc.under the policy,kessel was both waechter immediate supervisor and the only partner of fairbrook,given that he was its sole owner.as detailed above,she complained to him about his remarks on multiple occasions.waechter also told the officer manager,shelia cook,that kessel made a comment about her breasts,and she believes she may have told the personnel manager,sherry bartnicki,about one of kessel comments as well.the clinic did not conduct an investigation or take any corrective action.
on june,waechter filed a charge of sex discrimination with the eeoc the eeoc subsequently filed a suit on her behalf on august,alleging that fairbrook was liable for a hostile work environment in violation of title vii,a.
after discovery,the district court granted fairbrook motion for summary judgment.in its view,kessel conduct was neither severe nor pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment.specifically,it reasoned that the offensive conduct was not particularly frequent,mostly involved the type of crude jokes that do not run afoul of title vii,did not cause waechter to miss work or feel severe psychological stress,and did not include inappropriate touching or physical threats.the eeoc now appeals.
title vii of the civil rights act of states that i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of sex.a.the supreme court has held that this prohibition not only covers terms and conditions in the narrow contractual sense,but evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment.oncale sundowner offshore,quoting meritor savings bank,fsb vinson.thus,a plaintiff may establish a violation of title vii by proving that discrimination based on sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment.meritor,at.to make out such a claim,a plaintiff must show that the offending conduct was unwelcome,was based on her sex,was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive work environment,and was imputable to her employer.ocheltree scollon,cir en banc.
we review the district court summary judgment ruling on the eeoc hostile work environment claim de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.see.c see also celotex catrett.fairbrook does not dispute that waechter found kessel conduct to be unwelcome.it does contend,however,that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of the other three elements of the eeoc hostile work environment claim.we consider each of these elements in turn.
first,fairbrook contends that kessel did not make offensive comments to waechter because of her sex.instead,it argues that kessel was a generally crude person who made vulgar comments to men and women alike.
this contention is easily dismissed.although kessel made offensive remarks in front of both male and female audiences,his use of and derogatory terms indicates that he intended to demean women.see oncale,at.to provide a few examples,kessel used terms like cunt and slut to refer to women at the clinic and talked about female body parts,including his own wife,in graphic terms.moreover,several of his remarks involved explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity,that a reasonable jury could infer would not have been made to someone of the same sex.id.for instance,kessel asked waechter if she had a better libido while she was pumping her breasts,opined that she was probably a wild thing in bed,and requested to view and pump her breasts.based on the nature of these remarks,we think that a jury could conclude that kessel comments were based on sex and that their intimate nature was intended to make women in his employ feel acutely embarrassed and uncomfortable.kessel delight in being a shock jock does nothing to dispel the impression.
