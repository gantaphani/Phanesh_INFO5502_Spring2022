we begin with the district court grant of the defendants first summary judgment motion in favor of the district of columbia and cca.the court granted the motion on the ground that malik had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.
the exhaustion provision of the plra provides as follows no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a.the plra requires proper exhaustion,which includes compliance with an agency deadlines and other critical procedural rules.woodford ngo,d.
both cca and the district rely on cca grievance policy to argue that malik did not properly exhaust his administrative remedies.the cca policy requires that grievances be filed within seven days of the incident being grieved.richey aff.the bus trip about which malik complained ended on july,but he did not file his first grievance until july rather than seven days after the transfer.as a consequence,the defendants maintain that malik failed to properly exhaust his administrative remedies.
the problem with this argument is that the same cca grievance policy renders a complaint like malik nongrievable.under the policy,grievable matters include issues regarding the application of policies,rules and procedures individual staff and inmate actions,including any denial of access to the grievance procedure reprisals and retaliation against inmates for filing an appeal loss of property and any other matter relating to the conditions of care and supervision within the authority of cca.id.but the policy also provides that i nstitutional transfers are not grievable mat
