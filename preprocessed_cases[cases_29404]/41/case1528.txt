the government appeals from an order by the district court quashing a subpoena commanding northwestern memorial hospital in chicago to produce the medical records of certain patients on whom cassing hammond had performed abortions at the hospital using the controversial method known variously as d x dilation and extraction and intact d e dilation and evacuation.we accelerated briefing and argument,and now accelerate our decision,in view of the pressures of time discussed later in the opinion.
the subpoenaed records,apparently some in number,are sought for use in the forthcoming trial in the southern district of new york of a suit challenging the constitutionality of the abortion ban act of,stat.see national abortion federation ashcroft,wl,order denying summary judgment for plaintiffs.hammond is one of the plaintiffs in that suit and will also be testifying as an expert witness.the district court held that the production of the records is barred by regulations issued under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa,stat,and let us begin there.
section of hipaa,note,directs the secretary of health and human services to promulgate regulations to protect the privacy of medical records,but provides in subsection c that such a regulation shall not supercede a contrary provision of state law,if the provision of state law imposes requirements,standards,or implementation specifications that are more stringent than the requirements,standards,or implementation specifications imposed under the regulation.see also b.a standard is more stringent if it provides greater privacy protection for the individual who is the subject of the individually identifiable health information than the standard in the regulation.
the particular focus of the appeal is an hhs regulation entitled standard disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings,e,which authorizes a covered entity such as northwestern memorial hospital to disclose private health information in judicial or administrative proceedings in response to an order of a court.e i.the regulation also allows the disclosure of such information in those proceedings in response to a subpoena,discovery request,or other lawful process,e ii,if the party seeking the information either notifies the patient or at least makes a good faith effort to do so or makes a reasonable effort to secure a qualified protective order,that is,an order that prohibits the use or disclosure of the information outside the litigation and requires the return or destruction of the information at the end of the litigation.e v.
the district judge presiding over the case in new york issued an order authorizing,although not directing,the hospital to provide the records to the government after redaction to remove information identifying the patients.the parties agree that his order is an order within the meaning of the in response provision.it hardly matters the government did need such an order because it had obtained a protective order,thus qualifying under the alternative procedure for disclosure of medical records.but under illinois law,even redacted medical records are not to be disclosed in judicial proceedings,with immaterial exceptions.ilcs department of professional regulation manos,d,parkson central dupage hospital,d.the district court in our case ruled that the illinois law,because it sets a more stringent standard for disclosure than the hipaa regulation,trumps that regulation by virtue of hipaa supersession provision.so he quashed the subpoena,precipitating this appeal.
although the issue is not free from doubt,we agree with the government that the hipaa regulations do not impose state evidentiary privileges on suits to enforce federal law.illinois is free to enforce its more stringent privilege there is no comparable federal privilege in suits in state court to enforce state law and,by virtue of an express provision in,in suits in federal court mainly diversity suits as well in which state law supplies the rule of decision.but the illinois privilege does not govern in suits,such as the suit in the southern district of new york.the enforcement of federal law might be hamstrung if privileges more stringent than any federal privilege regarding medical records were applicable to all federal cases.we say might not would because some federal statutes authorize subpoenas in terms that would override the hipaa regulations.see,in re subpoena duces tecum,cir.but almost certainly there are gaps and we think it improbable that hhs intended to open such a can of worms when it set forth a procedure for disclosure of medical records in,that is,to be regulating,actually or potentially depending on other statutory provisions regulating subpoenas,the litigation of federal employment discrimination cases,social security disability cases,erisa cases,medicare and medicaid fraud cases,food and drug administration cases,and the numerous other classes of federal case in which medical records whether of the parties or of nonparties would not be privileged under federal evidence law.
all that e should be understood to do,therefore,is to create a procedure for obtaining authority to use medical records in litigation.whether the records are actually admissible in evidence will depend among other things on whether they are privileged.and the evidentiary privileges that are applicable to suits are given not by state law but by federal law,which does not recognize a or privilege.rule in terms makes federal common law the source of any privileges in suits unless an act of congress provides otherwise.we do not think hipaa is rightly understood as an act of congress that creates a privilege.
the purely procedural character of the hipaa standard for disclosure of medical information in judicial or administrative proceedings is indicated by the procedure for disclosure in response to a subpoena or other process the notice to the patient must contain sufficient information about the litigation or proceeding in which the protected health information is requested to permit the individual to raise an objection to the court.e iii b.the objection in court would often be based on a source of which would be found elsewhere than in the regulations themselves.
this conclusion is buttressed by a hipaa regulation which says that the more stringent clause applies only to individually identifiable health information,b,as opposed to health information that does not identify an individual and with respect to which there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual.a.provided that medical records are redacted in accordance with the redaction requirements themselves quite stringent of a,they would not contain individually identifiable health information and the more stringent clause would fall away.
as an alternative basis for quashing the subpoena,the district judge undertook to craft a new federal common law privilege for abortion records.he based this ruling on their sensitivity,which he compared to that of psychotherapists treatment records,held privileged in jaffee redmond,d.the creation of new common law evidentiary privileges is authorized by,and jaffee is not the only recent case in which the authority was exercised.goodyear tire rubber chiles power supply,cir in re air crash near cali,colombia,and united states lowe,all created new privileges on the authority of jaffee.but none relates to medical records and we are reluctant to embark on a determination of the relative sensitivity of medical records of different ailments or procedures.most medical records are sensitive,and many are as sensitive as abortion records,such as the records of aids patients.proceeding down the path taken by the district court would inevitably result in either arbitrary line drawing or the creation of an comprehensive privilege for medical records.northwestern memorial hospital concedes that there is no federal common law privilege.it is not for in so summary a proceeding as this litigation to quash the government create one,whether all at once or by a process of slow but inevitable additions to the sole category recognized by jaffee.university of pennsylvania eeoc,d united states nixon,d in re witness before special grand jury,cir in re sealed case,per curiam.
the district court did not reach a further ground urged by northwestern memorial hospital for quashing the government subpoena,which is simply that the burden of compliance with it would exceed the benefit of production of the material sought by it.c a iv deitchman squibb sons,cir roberts shawnee mission ford,cir miscellaneous docket matter.miscellaneous docket matter,cir in re sealed case.however,in support of his ruling expanding the federal common law of privilege to embrace the medical records of abortion patients,the judge made findings that are highly germane arguably dispositive rule c issue.he pointed out that the government seeks these records on the possibility that it may find something therein which would affect the testimony of hammond adversely,that is,for its potential value in impeaching his credibility as a witness.what the government ignores in its argument is how little,if any,probative value lies within these patient records.he contrasted the dearth of probative value with the potential loss of privacy that would ensue were these medical records used in a case in which the patient was not a party and concluded that the balance of harms resulting from disclosure severely the loss to the government through.
these findings were solidly based.the hospital had urged both the lack of probative value of the records and the loss of privacy by the patients.the government had responded in generalities,arguing that redaction would eliminate any privacy concern and that since hammond had made assertions of fact about his experience and his patients that plaintiffs are using to support their claim that,without a health exception,the act is unconstitutional,the government should be permitted to test those assertions but the government had not indicated what assertions these were or how the records might bear on them.although on appeal the hospital repeated at length its reasons for believing that the records sought by the government would have little or no probative value,the government response in both its opening brief and its reply brief remained vague to the point of being evasive.
at the oral argument we pressed the government lawyer repeatedly and hard for indications of what he hoped to learn from the hospital records,and drew a blank.contrary to our usual practice,we did not limit the length of the oral argument.the lawyer did suggest that if hammond testified that patients with leukemia are better off with the d x procedure than with the conventional d e procedure but the medical records indicate that not all abortion patients with leukemia undergo d x abortions,this would both impeach hammond and suggest that d x is not the only medically safe abortion procedure available to pregnant women afflicted with leukemia.but such information would be unlikely to be found in hammond records,given his strongly expressed preference for using the d x method in the case of patients in fragile health.the information would be much more likely to be found in the records of physicians who perform d e rather than d x abortions on such women.those records,however,the government did seek.
we learned at argument for the first time that hammond has been deposed in the new york litigation.the questions and answers in his deposition might illuminate the relevance of the medical records for impeachment of his testimony at the trial.but the government has made no effort to make the deposition a part of the record.
ordinarily when a district judge has not addressed an issue committed to his discretion,such as the balance of benefit and burden in complying with a subpoena,peate mccann,cir deitchman squibb sons,supra,at pamida,originals,cir,and the issue becomes critical to the disposition of the appeal,the appellate court must remand to give the judge a chance to exercise his discretion.icicle seafoods,worthington,d.we do not follow that course,here,however,for two reasons.the first is that the judge,in the passages we quoted from his opinion,struck the other words,weigh ed the competing hardships.deitchman squibb sons,supra,at.true,he did so in the course of addressing a different issue from whether rule c required that the subpoena be quashed but,realistically,the result of a remand is foreordained.
the second reason is that with the trial in new york scheduled to begin on march and to last only four weeks,the practical effect of a remand would be to moot the issue of compliance with the subpoena.the time factor is unfortunate,and is not the fault of the government or of anyone else,so far as appears.if time permitted a remand,the judge would on remand examine the records,or at least a sample of them,in camera,as in the parallel subpoena case of planned parenthood federation of america,ashcroft,wl,to determine whether they are likely to have any probative value.time does not permit.the government has not suggested that the case be remanded if we reject the district court grounds for quashing the subpoena.a remand would be tantamount to mooting its appeal in the government words,a remand would entirely frustrate the government interest in preparing a timely defense in the new york trial,which will begin on march.we take this as a waiver of any objection to our weighing the hardships ourselves,and we proceed to the weighing.see beer nuts,clover club foods,cir mccord bailey,international ins.caja nacional de ahorro y seguro,cir dillard city of greensboro,cir.
like the district judge,we think the balance weighs in favor of quashing the subpoena.the government does not deny that the hospital is an appropriate representative of the privacy interests of its patients.parkson central dupage hospital,supra,at.but it argues that since it is seeking only a limited number of records and they would be produced to it minus the information that would enable the identity of the patient to be determined,there is no hardship to either the hospital or the patients of compliance.the argument is unrealistic and incomplete.what is true is that the administrative hardship from compliance would be modest.but it is not the only or the main hardship.the natural sensitivity that people feel about the disclosure of their medical sensitivity that lies behind amplified when the records are of a procedure that congress has now declared to be a crime.even if all the women whose records the government seeks know what redacted means,they are bound to be skeptical that redaction will conceal their identity from the world.this is hardly a typical case in which medical records get drawn into a lawsuit.reflecting the fierce emotions that the controversy over the morality and legality of abortion has made combustible,the abortion ban act and the litigation challenging its even more so the rash of suits around the country in which the department of justice has been seeking the hospital records of abortion generated enormous publicity.these women must know that,and doubtless they are also aware that hostility to abortion has at times erupted into violence,including criminal obstruction of entry into abortion clinics,the firebombing of clinics,and the assassination of physicians who perform abortions.
some of these women will be afraid that when their redacted records are made a part of the trial record in new york,persons of their acquaintance,or skillful googlers,sifting the information contained in the medical records concerning each patient medical and sex history,will put two and two together,out the women,and thereby expose them to threats,humiliation,and obloquy.as the court pointed out in parkson central dupage hospital,supra,at,whether the patients identities would remain confidential by the exclusion of their names and identifying numbers is questionable at best.the patients admit and discharge summaries arguably contain histories of the patients prior and present medical conditions,information that in the cumulative can make the possibility of recognition very high.in its opening brief,as throughout the district court proceeding,the government expressly reserved the right,at a later date,to seek the identity of the patients whose records are produced.pressed at argument,the government lawyer abandoned the reservation but we do not know what would prevent reconsideration should the government,the subpoena having been enforced,discover that particular medical records that it had obtained were incomplete,opaque,or ambiguous.
even if there were no possibility that a patient identity might be learned from a redacted medical record,there would be an invasion of privacy.imagine if nude pictures of a woman,uploaded to the internet without her consent though without identifying her by name,were downloaded in a foreign country by people who will never meet her.she would still feel that her privacy had been invaded.the revelation of the intimate details contained in the record of a abortion may inflict a similar wound.
if northwestern memorial hospital can not shield the medical records of its abortion patients from disclosure in judicial proceedings,moreover,the hospital will lose the confidence of its patients,and persons with sensitive medical conditions may be inclined to turn elsewhere for medical treatment.it is not as if the government were seeking medical records from every hospital and clinic that performs abortions,in which event women wanting assurance against the disclosure of their records would have nowhere to turn.it is hammond presence in the new york suit as plaintiff and expert that has resulted in the government subpoenaing northwestern memorial hospital.
the concerns that the hospital has articulated do not necessarily justify withholding probative evidence from the government nor can the possibility that medical records of abortion patients would yield evidence germane to the constitutionality of the abortion ban act be gainsaid.a nearly identical state predecessor of the act was invalidated by the supreme court in stenberg carhart,d,because it did not permit the d x procedure in cases in which it is required to protect the health of the pregnant woman.id.at.in response,the preamble to the act contains a finding that the procedure is never required for health reasons.stat.the government concedes as it must that this finding,although entitled to respectful consideration,does not bind the courts,united states morrison,d turner broadcasting system,fcc,d plurality.the issue of medical necessity remains for determination at the trial in new york,where hammond will testify that he believes there are situations in which the d x procedure is medically indicated.the essential difference between that procedure and the conventional d e procedure is that in the latter procedure the fetus is destroyed while it is still entirely within the womb,while in the former procedure it is destroyed after the lower extremities,and sometimes the torso,have emerged from the womb and only the head remains inside.it is because part of the fetus is outside the womb when the fetus is destroyed that the supporters of the act describe the d x procedure as partial birth abortion.hammond and other d x practitioners argue that because less of the fetus is in the womb there is less danger of cutting the woman tissues with the sharp knives used to dismember the fetus body in the conventional d e procedure and causing hemorrhaging,and that if the woman is in fragile health avoiding that danger is medically indicated.
the merits of the dispute are for determination at trial.the only issue for us is whether,given that there is a potential psychological cost to the hospital patients,and a potential cost in lost goodwill to the hospital itself,from the involuntary production of the medical records even as redacted,the cost is offset by the probative value of the records.the district judge presiding at the trial has said that the records are relevant,and no doubt they the attenuated sense in which materials may be sought in discovery.relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.b see oppenheimer fund,sanders,d csc holdings,redisi,cir.the trial judge has not opined on the probative value of the records,which appears to be meager.
the government has had repeated opportunities to articulate a use for the records that it seeks,and it has failed to do so.what it would like to prove at the trial in new york,to refute hammond,is that d e is always an adequate alternative,from the standpoint of a pregnant woman health,to the d x procedure.but the government has failed to explain how the record of a d x abortion would show this.and it is not as if hammond had relied on the medical records of his patients in preparing his expert testimony.had he done so,they would have had to be disclosed to the government under.a.he does have the records,is not basing his testimony on them,and so far as appears does even remember them.
none of the records is going to state that hammond said that he performed a d x although he believed that a d e would be just as good.we thought the government might be hoping to find in the records evidence that hammond had lied when he said he had performed a d x on a woman who had leukemia or a woman who had breast cancer,but at argument the government disclaimed any such suggestion.we still at a loss to understand what it hopes to gain from such discovery.we begged the government lawyer to be concrete.of course,not having seen the records,the government labors under a disadvantage,although it has surely seen other medical records.and of course,pretrial discovery is a fishing expedition and one ca know what one has caught until one fishes.but.c allows the fish to object,and when they do so the fisherman has to come up with more than the government has been able to do in this case despite the excellence of its lawyers.

although hammond is a plaintiff in the new york case,presumably because he actually performs d x abortions and wants to be allowed to continue doing so,he will be testifying as an expert medical witness.of all experts who testify in court,physicians are probably the most common.yet the government has cited to us no case before this one in which medical experts patient records were used to impeach the expert langley coughlin,wl june,rejected the attempt,in a helpful discussion,though in malpractice cases it is not uncommon to use redacted medical records bearing on the defendant alleged negligence for impeachment,as in terre haute regional hospital,trueblood,and todd south jersey hospital system.
were the government sincerely interested in whether d x abortions are ever medically indicated,one would have expected it to seek from northwestern memorial hospital statistics summarizing the hospital experience with abortions.suppose the patients who undergo d x abortions are identical in all material respects age,health,number of weeks pregnant,and so on to those who undergo procedures not forbidden by the abortion ban act.that would be potent evidence that the d x procedure does not have a compelling health rationale.no such evidence has been sought,in contrast to planned parenthood federation of america,ashcroft,supra,at transcript.a variant of the suggested approach would be to obtain a random sample of abortion records from various sources and then determine,through good statistical analysis,whether the patient characteristics that lead hammond to perform a d x lead other physicians to perform a conventional d e instead,and whether there are differences in the health consequences for these two groups of women.if there are no differences,the government might have a good defense of the act.gathering records from hammond patients alone will not be useful but if the government has other records say,from va hospitals already in its files,then records of hammond procedures might enable a useful comparison.the government has suggested doing anything like that either.its motives in seeking individuals medical records remain thoroughly obscure.
the question whether the d x procedure is ever medically indicated will be resolved as a matter of legislative fact not requiring the taking of testimony at all see hope clinic ryan,supra,at dissenting opinion,or will pivot on the clash of expert witnesses at the new york trial,or perhaps,as suggested in stenberg,will be answered by some combination of these two approaches to ascertaining facts.the medical records of expert witnesses are irrelevant to the first inquiry and,so far as we can determine after having listened to the government arguments at length,those records will not figure significantly in the resolution of experts disagreements either.
the fact that quashing the subpoena comports with illinois privilege is a final factor in favor of the district order action.as we held in memorial hospital for mchenry county shadur,cir,comity impels federal courts to recognize state privileges where this can be accomplished at no substantial cost to federal substantive and procedural policy.see also united states v.one parcel of property located at york street,cir per curiam.patients,physicians,and hospitals in illinois rely on illinois strong policy of privacy of medical records.they can not rely completely,for they are not entitled to count on the state privilege being applied in federal court.but in a case such as this in which,so far as we can determine,applying the privilege would not interfere significantly with federal proceedings,comity has required us not to apply the illinois privilege,but to consider with special care the arguments for quashing the subpoena on the basis of relative hardship under.c.
i agree with the court that hippa does not adopt state privilege law in a federal question suit brought in federal court,but rather rule of the federal rules of evidence governs the evidentiary privileges applicable in such suits.opinion at.i also agree that it is not for us to create a federal common law privilege where none exists,and that the redacted medical records are not privileged.opinion at.however,for several reasons,i disagree with the court conclusion that enforcing the subpoena creates an undue burden under.c a iv.in passing hippa,congress recognized a privacy interest only in individually identifiable medical records and not redacted medical records,and hippa preempts state law in this regard.the redaction of all identifying information from the medical records and the extensive protective order in place also eliminates any privacy interest in the records.additionally,not only are the records in this case relevant,as the court acknowledges,but they are highly probative of the underlying issue.finally,contrary to the court conclusion that quashing the subpoena occurs at no substantial cost to federal substantive and procedural policy,both suffer greatly.this court should enforce the subpoena.i therefore concur in part and dissent in part.
as the court recognizes,in section of hippa,congress authorized the secretary of health and human services to promulgate regulations to protect the privacy of medical records.opinion at citing.therefore,hippa and the related regulations determine the privacy interests at stake.while tediously detailed,these regulations appear to have thoroughly considered and resolved the privacy concerns expressed by the hospital and the court.
section,which sets forth the general rules for the use and disclosure of protected health information,provides that a covered entity may not use or disclose protected health information,except as permitted or required by this subpart or by subpart c of part of this subchapter.a.before looking to the various exceptions,the initial question is whether the information sought in this case is protected health information.the regulations define protected health information as individually identifiable health information.both congress and hhs define individually identifiable health information as information that is created or received by a health care provider,health plan,employer,or health care clearinghouse and relates to the past,present,or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual,the provision of health care to an individual,or the past,present,or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual,and i identifies the individual or ii with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.emphasis added.
in this case,the government seeks only redacted medical records and agrees that all identifying information may be removed before northwestern makes the records available for its review.because the records will be redacted,they will not identify the individual.nor is there a reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify the individual.section b confirms the latter conclusion.section b i sets forth specific identifiers which,if removed,the health records 
b all geographic subdivisions smaller than a state,including street address,city,county,precinct,zip code,and their equivalent geocodes,except for the initial three digits of a zip code if,according to the current publicly available data from the bureau of the census 
the geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than people and 
the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing or fewer people is changed to.
c all elements of dates except year for dates directly related to an individual,including birth date,admission date,discharge date,date of death and all ages over and all elements of dates including year indicative of such age,except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age or older

p biometric identifiers,including finger and voice prints 
q full face photographic images and any comparable images and 
r any other unique identifying number,characteristic,or code,except as permitted by paragraph c of this section 
once these identifiers are redacted,the medical records are no longer individually identifiable health information.a under hippa and the implementing regulations,there is no protected privacy interest in health information.again,the regulations confirm this conclusion.d provides 
uses and disclosures of information.health information that meets the standard and implementation specifications for under a and b is considered not to be individually identifiable health information.the requirements of this subpart do not apply to information that has been in accordance with the applicable requirements of 
d emphasis added.
because the government seeks only redacted records that are not individually identifiable,under hippa there is no privacy interest in those records.however,even if the records were individually identifiable,they would still be subject to the general privacy rules governing use and disclosure of protected health information set forth in.as noted above,the privacy protection afforded in that section provides several exceptions.a a covered entity may not use or disclose protected health information,except as permitted or required by this subpart or by subpart c of part of this subchapter.emphasis added.of relevance here is e i,which authorizes the disclosure of protected health information pursuant to a court order.in this case,the government obtained a court order authorizing the disclosure of the medical records.under the regulations,such an order negates any need to redact identifying information e i.yet,as the government stressed at oral argument,it has no need for,nor desire to know,the individual identities of the patients.therefore,it is only seeking the relevant redacted medical records.such redacted records are afforded no privacy protection under hippa,logically so because the redacted records have no identifiably private information to expose.and although illinois law has adopted an expansive view of privilege that includes redacted medical records,as the court recognizes,illinois law does not govern this question.
that should end the inquiry.but instead the court resurrects the privacy question through the undue burden language of.c a iv.rule c a iv provides that a court may quash or modify a subpoena if it subjects a person to undue burden.c a iv.in the court view,compliance with the subpoena would impose an undue burden potential psychological cost on the women whose redacted records were subpoenaed.such an undue burden exists,according to the court,because the potential loss of privacy outweighs the probative value of the medical records.see opinion at stating that the illinois district court finding that the potential loss of privacy that would ensue were these medical records used in a case in which the patient was not a party outweighs the loss to the government through is solidly based.this conclusion is wrong on several levels.
initially,to reiterate,hippa and the implementing regulations recognize that there is no loss of privacy where the medical records are redacted or in hippa jargon.nor is it reasonable to believe that the unidentified women have acquaintances who will put two and two together,out the women,and thereby expose them to threats,humiliation,and obloquy.opinion at.in fact,there is no reason to believe that the women themselves have any idea that their records are among the few sought by the government in this case but even if they knew no one else ever would,because all of the information that could reasonably be used to identify them will be redacted,see b i,and none of the even the redacted ever be made public,much less paraded in court or placed on the internet within the reach of skillful googlers.opinion at.that is guaranteed by the additional security of the protective order entered in this case in the southern district of new york.see,reproductive,walker,d brennan,in chambers dissolving stay of subpoena seeking abortion records of patients on condition that patient names were redacted and parties agreed to a protective order to ensure privacy of all patients.
the court erroneous conclusion that a privacy interest exists in the redacted documents leads to the unnecessary attempt to assess the probative value of the evidence.notably,the district court judge kocoras did not reach the undue burden of compliance issue of.c a iv.in the interest of time,with the trial date at hand,the court bypassed a remand and accepted the district court findings on the privilege issue and applied them to the undue burden question.it then in effect agrees with the district court that there is little if any probative value in the requested documents.based on the complaint,hammond declaration,the congressional findings when it passed the law,and the arguments made by the government and the hospital both very limited since privilege,not probative value,was the issue argued below,there is significant probative value.but that is not for us to decide,as the probative value of the evidence has already been determined.district court judge casey,who is presiding over the underlying case,believes the information is relevant,so much so,that he has indicated that if it is not produced,he would consider lifting the stay and dismissing the case or at least dismissing hammond from the case.this should also make clear that judge casey believes the evidence is not just relevant in the attenuated sense,opinion at,but highly probative to the difficult question he will face starting on march.if any deference is owed,it is to the presiding judge who handled this case and who knows the arguments presented by both sides,and the judge who will need all relevant evidence available to allow him to make the necessary factual findings to determine this difficult and contentious constitutional case.
however,while recognizing that t he merits of the dispute are for determination at trial,opinion at,the court nonetheless interjects its own theory of the case and its own judgment of the probative value of the evidence.for instance,the court states what the government would like to show,in refutation of hammond impending testimony,is that d e is always an adequate alternative,from the standpoint of a pregnant woman health,to the d x procedure.the government has failed to explain how the record of a d x abortion would show this.opinion at.but the government document request was not so structured the government did not ask for the records of the d x abortions identified by hammond,but rather requested the redacted medical records of patients who had the d e and d x the reasons asserted by hammond as justifying a abortion.for instance,hammond stated that he sometimes performed abortions for women to protect their health after they learned that their fetuses have anomalies that are often quite severe.declaration.the government requested the patient records for of any women who had an abortion during their or week of pregnancy,whether or d e for that reason.interrogatories at document request at.as the government explained at oral argument,those records are highly relevant to the question of medical necessity because,if they show that hammond did not regularly perform abortions under those circumstances,that would demonstrate that hammond does not believe a abortion is necessary to protect the women health.of course,there could be some variations in the medical conditions of the individual cases that explain why hammond used a different method,but hammond remembers few,if any,of the circumstances surrounding the abortions.opinion at.thus,the only way the government and the trial judge can assess hammond contention that abortions are medically necessary to protect the women health is to review the medical records of the patients with the conditions that hammond referenced.
the court rejects this theory,stating but such information would be unlikely to be found in hammond records in view of his strongly expressed preference for using the d x method on patients in fragile health.it would be much more likely to be found in the records,not sought by the government,of physicians who perform d e rather than d x abortions on such women.opinion at.but that is exactly the point the government does not know what is to be found in hammond medical records.it only knows what could be found that,notwithstanding hammond declaration that he strongly prefers using the d x method of abortion on patients in fragile health,in practice,he does not use that procedure.such evidence would be highly probative,as the court itself implies by recognizing it would be unlikely to be found in hammond records in view of his strongly expressed preference for using the d x method.
in fact,the relevance here can not be overstated congress made explicit findings that a abo
