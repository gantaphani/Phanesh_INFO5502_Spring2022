background 
the long and complex history of this litigation has been set forth in detail in numerous prior opinions of this court and of the district court.see,catanzano wing,cir catanzano v catanzano dowling,catanzano ii,aff,cir catanzano iii.familiarity with the facts and with the prior decisions of the district court and of this court is therefore assumed,and the following discussion is restricted to facts relevant to the issues currently on appeal.
new york health care system provides,as part of its participation in the medicaid program,that home health services be furnished to financially needy patients by a chha.see pub.health law mckinney see also a.chhas provide home health services,services provided in the home of a preventive,therapeutic,rehabilitative,health guidance supportive nature,including,inter alia,nursing services.mckinney accord regs.tit,a,b,pt.
in,michele catanzano brought a class action pursuant to in the district court against the directors of the monroe county,new york department of social services and the monroe county,new york department of health collectively,county defendants after her chha reduced her home health services in contravention of her doctor orders,without providing her with notice or with the opportunity to contest the reduction in a hearing,and without continuing her aid until a hearing could be provided.in her complaint,catanzano alleged,inter alia,that such actions,without accompanying procedural protections,violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,the federal medicaid act,et,the medicaid regulations,and the new york social services law and corresponding regulations.the district court preliminarily enjoined the reduction,catanzano richardson,aff,cir catanzano i,and certified a plaintiff class comprised of monroe county medicaid recipients who receive home health care,and who now or in the future receive less home health care than that level of care ordered by their treating physician,catanzano ii.at.
in and,the state of new york amended its social services law,instituting a procedure whereby chhas performed a fiscal assessment to determine whether home health services should be provided.mckinney expired,id.mckinney expired,d mckinney tit.these amendments,or fiscal assessment laws,did not provide for notice,a hearing,or when a chha or local social services district conducted a fiscal assessment and determined that a change in service was warranted.plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint so as to challenge the fiscal assessment laws and add the commissioners of new york department of health and department of social services collectively,defendants or state defendants,to modify the class,and for a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the amendments without rights to notice,a hearing,and.the motions were granted,and on march,the district court modified the class to comprise 
a ll new york state recipients and applicants of home health care who receive less home health care than most recently ordered by their treating physician or who have had their home health care suspended,denied,terminated or reduced without prior notice,right to a fair hearing and as mandated by.
catanzano ii.at.the district court concluded that under the fiscal assessment laws a chha could unilaterally reduce home health care services without affording the patient any notification or any hearing,and that such a circumstance contravenes the clear directive of federal law and basic due process rights delineated in goldberg kelly,d,that prior to any adverse action,the patient must receive a notice indicating the action to be taken,the reasons for the action and the regulations that support such action.catanzano ii.at.the district court therefore preliminarily enjoined the state and county defendants from,inter alia,suspending,terminating or reducing home health services received by class members as a result of conducting a fiscal assessment or otherwise without providing notice,hearing,and procedures as mandated by medicaid regulations,and from implementing the fiscal assessment laws until such procedures have been established.id.at.
when the parties could not agree on implementation of the district court order,the court modified the injunction and directed defendants to adopt a preliminary injunction implementation plan.see catanzano ex rel.catanzano dowling,catanzano iv,aff in part and vacated in part,catanzano v.the plan sets forth detailed instructions for chhas and local social services districts with respect to denials of,reductions in,or terminations of home health services based on chha determinations that the services ordered by the recipient physician can not maintain the recipient health and safety fiscal assessments and chha determinations that the recipient medical conditions have improved.catanzano iv.at.the district court specifically limited the injunction and plan to adverse actions taken contrary to a treating physician orders with respect to home health services.id.at.the court also attached model notices to the plan which it ordered the local social services district to provide whenever such actions were taken.the modified injunction and implementation plan remain in effect now.see catanzano wing.catanzano vi adopting implementation plan on remand from catanzano v tit,f codifying implementation plan.
on march,the district court ordered the parties to show cause as to why it should not convert its preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and issue a final judgment.see catanzano wing,catanzano vii.in response to the order,plaintiffs filed a motion on july,requesting various forms of relief on their remaining claims.only two of those claims are at issue in this appeal first,plaintiffs claim that the fiscal assessment notices mandated by the implementation plan are legally and constitutionally inadequate because they are unreadable and do not provide sufficient information notice adequacy claim second,they claim that state law,federal law,and due process requires that home health services recipients be given notice,a hearing,and when the chha denies,reduces,or terminates services,not only contrary to the treating physician order,but even if the chha decision ostensibly conforms to the treating physician order physician order claim.
with respect to these two claims,plaintiffs requested that the district court either dismiss the claims without prejudice,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,at expressly provide that the claims had been adjudicated on their merits solely for the purposes of preliminary,but not final,injunctive relief,or allow plaintiffs to conduct discovery and submit a motion for summary judgment,at.
on july,while plaintiffs motion was still under advisement,the fiscal assessment laws expired.see note.the next day,the new york state department of health notified all of its local social services districts that the fiscal assessment laws had expired and directed the districts to discontinue all fiscal assessment activities until further notice.plaintiffs,however,believing that the new york legislature would soon reinstate the laws,urged the court to rule on the motion despite their expiration.
the court granted plaintiffs motion in part and denied it in part.catanzano wing,catanzano vii.
with respect to plaintiffs notice adequacy claim,the court stated that it had already found the notices to be constitutionally sufficient as a matter of law,and found no basis upon which to revisit that issue or allow plaintiffs to relitigate it.id.at.the court therefore denied the relief plaintiffs sought and entered final judgment on that claim.id.at.
with respect to plaintiffs physician order claim,the court denied plaintiffs requested relief and reaffirmed its earlier determination that a change directed by the patient treating physician is not the kind of change or alteration that requires notice and a fair hearing.id.at quoting catanzano dowling,at july,internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,the court ruled,the class had never been so broadly defined as to include recipients whose services have been reduced by their own physician,and the court found that the risk of physician or chha error was not high enough to warrant mandating the full panoply of notice and hearing rights to health care recipients whose own physicians direct some change in their care.id.at.
in addition,the court concluded that rather than rendering the case moot,the expiration of the fiscal assessment laws merely provided further justification for its decision to enter final judgment and to close the case 
t he statute demise is an additional reason to dispose of all of plaintiffs claims,whether by entry of a final judgment or by dismissal.since one of the central sources of controversy between the parties has,for the time being at least,ceased to exist,final resolution of this action is appropriate s hould the fiscal assessment procedures be reimplemented in the same format,defendants will continue to be bound by this court prior rulings concerning those procedures.
whereupon the court converted its preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and ordered the parties to comply with the injunction,the implementation plan,and all other prior rulings issued in this action by both the district court and this court.id.the district court also entered final judgment in plaintiffs favor on the second cause of action in their amended complaint,in which plaintiffs alleged that defendants failure to provide notice,a hearing,and when actions were taken affecting plaintiffs home health services violated due process and the medicaid act.id 
in december,shortly after plaintiffs had commenced their appeal to this court,the new york legislature met and declined to renew the fiscal assessment laws.yacknin decl.in supp.of mot.to dismiss the appeal as moot and to vacate the adverse rulings of the decision below yacknin decl.plaintiffs then moved to dismiss the appeal as moot and to vacate the adverse rulings of the decision below.plaintiffs contended that in light of the legislature december decision not to reinstate the fiscal assessment laws,their notice adequacy and treating physician order claims are moot because the statutes left in place after the laws expiration provide them with sufficient due process protections.see yacknin decl,appellants br.at.a panel of this court denied the motion without prejudice to its renewal before this panel.catanzano wing,l cir,order denying plaintiffs motion for dismissal of appeal,and vacatur of adverse rulings.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,in addition to challenging the district court substantive conclusions regarding their notice adequacy claim and their physician order claim,plaintiffs reassert their argument that the fiscal assessment laws expiration renders moot both of the claims they have raised on appeal.they ask this court either to reverse the district court decision with respect to plaintiffs notice adequacy claim and physician order claim,and direct the district court either to dismiss these claims without prejudice or to restrict its judgment by enter ing a judgment that expressly provides that its ruling s on these claims were made for the sole purpose of preliminary,but not final,injunctive relief,appellants br.at to dismiss the appeal as moot and vacate the judgment of the district court or to reverse the court rulings on these two issues.
defendants agree that the expiration of the fiscal assessment laws renders the notice adequacy claim moot,but argue that the physician order claim is not moot because it is not affected by the expiration of the amendments.defendants further argue that chha actions in implementing physicians orders do not require the procedural protections plaintiffs seek because such actions are not those of the state.
notice adequacy claim 
the district court preliminary injunction implementation plan requires that local social services districts issue specific notices whenever a medicaid recipient or a medicaid applicant home health services are denied,discontinued,or reduced contrary to the recipient physician orders due,inter alia,to a fiscal assessment see tit,f app.catanzano iv.at.plaintiffs argue that these notices are legally and constitutionally inadequate because they do not provide individualized reasons for the action being taken,and because they are printed in a type that is too small to read using language too difficult to understand.
we review questions of mootness de novo because they are questions of law.see fund for animals babbitt,cir citing comer cisneros,cir.
the mootness doctrine,which is mandated by the case or controversy requirement in article iii of the united states constitution,requires that federal courts may not adjudicate matters that no longer present an actual dispute betweenparties.see lewis cont l bank,d.thus,when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome,powell mccormack,d,a case is moot and the federal court is divested of jurisdiction over it,see county of los angeles davis,d.for example,when it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur,and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation,the issue is moot.id.internal citations,quotations,and alterations omitted.the central question is decision of a once living dispute continues to be justified by a sufficient
