james prater and several other retired employees of the ohio education association oea claim that oea improperly terminated their health benefits,which they say had become vested and irreducible through a series of collective bargaining agreements.relying in part on our decision in maurer joy technologies,cir,the district court rejected the claims as a matter of law.because we conclude that maurer does not apply here,because unilateral summary plan descriptions can not supercede the amendment provisions in a collective bargaining agreement and because the contracts are otherwise ambiguous about whether they promise lifetime,irreducible health benefits to employees upon their retirement,we reverse.
in its capacity as a union,oea represents teaching professionals throughout ohio.unions are employers too,however,and,in its capacity as an employer,oea employs numerous individuals who are represented by two other unions the professional staff union psu and the ohio associate staff union oasu.oea has negotiated several collective bargaining agreements with these unions,and these agreements have provided for retiree healthcare benefits since for psu retirees and since for oasu retirees.plaintiffs montgomery and whaley,former associate staff employees of oea,retired in and,and they seek to represent a class of oasu retirees.plaintiffs thorley,prater and westfall,former professional employees of oea,retired between and,and they seek to represent a class of psu retirees.
the oasu agreements.when montgomery and whaley retired,the collective bargaining agreement for oasu employees said that it represented the full and complete commitments between both parties and could be altered only through the voluntary,mutual consent of the parties in a written and signed amendment.ja.the agreement provided active employees with medical insurance covering hospitalization surgical ekg laboratory prescription drug dental and optical.ja.retirees,the agreement said,shall be included in the association group in regard to hospitalization surgical and coverage,but,a fter the retiree reaches age,the association is required to provide only coverage.ja.the collective bargaining agreement also required the company to give each employee an individual contract guaranteeing the retiree health benefits at the time of retirement.id.
the psu agreements.like the oasu contract,the psu collective bargaining agreements in force when prater,thorley and westfall retired provided that changes could be made only by an amendment properly signed and ratified by each party.ja.the first provision for retiree benefits,in a subsection entitled continuation of benefits,said that t he association shall continue to provide all benefits provided by sections and of this contract for each retired employee to age.ja thorley ja prater see also ja westfall.the next subsection,entitled reimbursement for cost of medicare,said that oea shall reimburse each retired employee over age for the cost of medicare part id.and under the next subsection,entitled supplement to medicare,the agreement said that oea shall supplement the benefits of medicare parts a and b to provide benefits at a level equal to those benefits provided by sections and of this contract for each retired employee to age.id.
the summary plan descriptions.oea,like other employers,distributes summary plan descriptions to its employees to assist them in understanding the more detailed,complex and formal plan documents.each of the summaries distributed to the plaintiffs contained clauses.
the summary distributed to the oasu retirees provided retired employees may continue coverage,in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement while the employer expects retiree coverage to continue,the employer reserves the right to modify or discontinue retiree coverage at any time.ja.elsewhere the oasu summary said that oea may modify or amend the plan from time to time in accordance with the provision of the collective bargaining agreement.ja.
the clauses in the psu summaries did not say that any modifications to benefits must be in accordance with the bargaining agreements.the plan administrator,they said,may change or eliminate benefits under the plan and may terminate the entire plan or any portion of it.ja thorley ja prater see also ja westfall.
the dispute.for two decades,oea provided most of its retirees with insurance to supplement medicare after they reached.on march,oea sent a letter to psu employees informing them that oea would honor its contractual commitment to reimburse retirees for medicare part b but would no longer pay for the optional,supplemental coverage it had been providing.ja.that same day,oea sent a similar letter to oasu retirees,informing them that oea obligation to provide coverage ceases when each retiree reaches the age of.ja.on august,oea terminated the retirees supplemental coverage.
the oasu and psu retirees filed this class action under section of the labor management relations act,claiming that the union had violated the collective bargaining agreements.oea moved for summary judgment on the psu retirees claims for supplemental insurance,and it moved for summary judgment or partial summary judgment on the oasu retirees claims for prescription drug,surgical,hospitalization and outpatient coverage.after the parties had filed their summary judgment papers,the retirees sought leave to amend their complaint to add several erisa claims.
the district court held that the contracts unambiguously excluded the coverage.it reasoned that the to age clause in the psu agreement indicates a limitation on coverage available and is not at all ambiguous.op.at.and it reasoned that the oasu agreement contained a limitation on coverage that could not be more clear or unambiguous.id.at.the court also held that the plan summaries reserved to oea an unqualified right to alter or terminate the retirement benefits under maurer,at,and ultimately granted oea motion for summary judgment on all claims.op.at.the court denied the retirees motion for leave to amend because the litigation was at an advanced stage.
at the same time that erisa carefully regulates the vesting of pension benefits,it leaves the decision of whether employers will provide employees with healthcare benefits upon retirement to contract that may come in the form of a collective bargaining agreement,an employment relationship or something in between.see uaw,cir sprague motors,cir yolton el paso.pipeline,cir.in the past,the application of ordinary principles of contract interpretation to these different types of agreements,yolton,at,has raised a host of perplexing questions what is required to establish an employer commitment to provide lifetime benefits to retirees what exactly are lifetime healthcare benefits does a promise of lifetime benefits mean that they can not be reduced over the life of a retiree what if the employer reduces health benefits for active employees or increases the cost of those benefits to active employees what if the employer increases some health benefits for active employees but reduces others must the retiree take the bitter with the sweet or is it a only the improvements in health benefits available to the retiree but with no compulsion to take any reduction 
happily for us,this case sidesteps these least for now.oea concedes that,in the absence of a right to terminate retiree benefits under the clauses in the summary plan descriptions,a fact dispute exists over whether the retiree benefits provided for in the collective bargaining agreements survive the term of the agreements.that leaves two related but distinct disputes for us to resolve are the retirees claimed benefits among those enumerated in the collective bargaining agreements did oea plan summaries give the union the right to terminate any health benefits provided for in the collective bargaining agreements 
in interpreting collective bargaining agreements,we consider the language of the agreement,the context in which that language appears and other traditional canons of construction.mccoy meridian auto,cir.if,after applying these rules of interpretation,the contract remains ambiguous,we perm
