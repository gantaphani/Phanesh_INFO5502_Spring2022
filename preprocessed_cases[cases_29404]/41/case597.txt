opinion of the court 
doctor stephen paranich brought this qui tam action against irwin leasing corporation,formerly affiliated capital corporation,a company that finances the purchase of equipment,under the false claims act fca or act,et.paranich alleges that irwin fraudulently induced him to file false medicare reimbursement claims for chiropractic treatments in which he used a medical device called the matrix.irwin has consistently denied liability for any false medicare claims and further contends that paranich is not a proper relator in a qui tam action because the allegations he now asserts had been publicly disclosed before his suit and because he is not an original source as defined by the fca on irwin motion for summary judgment,the district court agreed with irwin on both points and dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.although our reasoning differs somewhat from that of the district court,we will affirm its dismissal because we conclude that paranich is not a proper relator under the fca because his allegations were based on public disclosures and he does not qualify as an original source.
factual background 
matrix biokinetics,is a nevada corporation that sold medical devices throughout the united states.on or about january,matrix began marketing and selling electrical nerve stimulation devices known as the matrix pro elec dt and the matrix pro elec referred to collectively and severally as the matrix device.cera international,is a research and technical organization that conducted sales conferences for the matrix device.after attending a sales conference in late,paranich decided to acquire a matrix device for the treatment of patients at his medical clinic,comprehensive medical network cmn.cmn subsequently arranged with an independent sales representative to finance the purchase of the device through leases with irwin.on december,and march,april,and june,cmn and irwin entered into four separate written agreements to lease four matrix devices.
the matrix device works by pulsating electricity to the nerves of a patient at various frequencies through electrodes attached to the patient body.according to materials published by cera,when the matrix device is used at high frequencies,it operates as a neuron blockade,or nerve block.this electric nerve block functionality has been viewed as an alternative to a traditional chemical injection nerve block.
by june,the food and drug administration had approved both models of the matrix device for marketing and sale in the united states.ultimately,the fda granted clearance for sale of the devices under section k of the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,k,however,the devices were never approved for sale as nerve block devices.
in january,paranich began submitting claims to medicare for reimbursement for procedures involving the matrix device.under the medicare system,claims for reimbursement are submitted under standard uniform codes set by the american medical association current procedural terminology cpt manual.paranich was submitting claims for treatments involving the matrix device under the cpt code for nerve block injections,which medicare reimbursed at rates of to per procedure although reimbursement for procedures submitted under the codes for electronic stimulation was at rates of to per procedure,paranich alleged that he was advised by matrix and cera to submit claims for nerve block injections to maximize the reimbursement.medicare purportedly reimbursed paranich at the rates for nerve block injections.
in june,deborah mcmenamin,a former employee of cmn,contacted special agent charles hydock of the federal bureau of investigation to report that paranich was overbilling medicare for matrix device procedures.hydock then began an investigation of paranich and cmn.on october,paranich was served with a grand jury subpoena requiring cmn to produce,inter alia,all documents relating to the matrix devices,specifically including billing documents.paranich stopped billing under the nerve block codes in february.
after being served with the subpoena,paranich lawyer,kenneth haber,began investigating the matrix device.during an extensive investigation,which haber conducted with limited participation from paranich,haber discovered that transamerica occidental life insurance company,the carrier and administrator for the medicare program in southern california,had published a bulletin advising its providers not to bill matrix device procedures under the cpt codes for nerve block injections he also learned that in,transamerica held hearings to determine the proper billing code and attendant reimbursement rates for electrical nerve blocks.haber learned about the bulletin and hearings by october,and,shortly thereafter,he requested a report of the transamerica hearings from the government under the freedom of information act foia.
throughout the investigation,haber was notably cooperative with the government.he communicated with the fbi and attorneys offices,writing letters to each to provide updates on the progress of the response to the subpoena.in a letter to the attorneys office dated april,he outlined the alleged fraud perpetrated by matrix and affiliated companies as his investigation began to disclose this information.the response to the subpoena included seventy boxes of billing records and other materials that were turned over to the fbi.
on may,during the time haber was conducting his investigation and preparing a response to the subpoena,a group of doctors in southern california filed a suit against matrix alleging fraud with respect to billing codes that matrix had allegedly recommended to those doctors.this state court fraud action,heifets matrix electromedical,no,named irwin as a defendant however,summary judgment was eventually entered in irwin favor after the court concluded that irwin was not responsible for matrix activities.irwin was also named as a defendant in a similar suit,rubanenko matrix biokinetics,no.rubanenko was voluntarily dismissed in august.
ii.procedural history 
on december,paranich filed the original complaint in this action.see united states ex rel.paranich sorgnard,d.in october,paranich amended the complaint to include irwin as a defendant,asserting that irwin had induced him to file false medicare reimbursement claims for treatments involving the matrix device.irwin moved for summary judgment with respect to the fca claim,denying liability and arguing that paranich was not a proper relator under the act 
the district court analyzed whether it had subject matter jurisdiction under the jurisdictional constraints of the fca.see united states ex rel.fine,cir when a court subject matter jurisdiction depends upon the same statute that creates the substantive claims,the jurisdictional inquiry is necessarily intertwined with the merits.adopting irwin statement of facts for the most part the district court ultimately determined that the action did not meet the jurisdictional requirements of the fca because although his complaint was based on prior public disclosures,paranich did not qualify as an original source because it was his attorney investigation that disclosed the alleged fraud,and the information uncovered during the investigation was not independent of the public disclosures.with the dismissal of the fca claim,the court dismissed irwin remaining state law counterclaim for indemnity as lacking independent subject matter jurisdiction.see c a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim if the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
paranich now appeals the district court decision,complaining that the court erred in its finding that he was not an original source of the information regarding the alleged fraud under the fca.we have jurisdiction to review this final decision of the district court under.we exercise plenary review of a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,prudential ins,cir citing york bank trust fed.sav.loan ins,cir.
iv.discussion 
introduction 
we have,on several prior occasions,engaged in extensive reviews of the history and background of the false claims act.see,united states ex rel.dunleavy county of,cir stinson,at id.at scirica,dissenting.and we have expended a fair amount of ink examining various aspects of the act jurisdictional bar provision to resolve the instant appeal,we need not reopen pandora box with respect to certain requirements of the act,such as the contours of the public disclosure requirement.nor do we choose to resolve the issue that the district court addressed,namely,whether paranich knowledge was direct given the role his attorney played in the investigation.this is because we see the instant matter as turning on an issue we have not previously addressed,namely,the requirement that the source must have provided information to the government voluntarily.
in broad strokes,the fca imposes penalties on persons who knowingly submit fraudulent claims to the government.to encourage the ferreting out of fraud against the government,the fca incentives private individuals aware of such fraud to bring civil actions as relators against those submitting such claims by allowing relators to collect a percentage of any recovery.prior to filing such a civil action,known as a qui tam action,the relator must disclose the information regarding the fraud to the government.the government then has sixty days to intervene and take over the action.see b.if the government does not do so,the relator may continue with the action unless the fca jurisdictional bar provision is triggered.the jurisdictional bar provision operates to exclude qui tam actions based upon allegations of fraud or fraudulent transactions that have been publicly disclosed prior to their filing.the provision was designed to preclude qui tam suits based on information that would have been equally available to strangers to the fraud transaction had they chosen to look for it as it was to the relator.stinson,at.this provision does,however,contain a savings clause,preserving suits brought by an original source of the information even where there have been prior public disclosures.
the text of the jurisdictional bar provision reads 
a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government general accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
e.as enumerated elements,this section divests courts of subject matter jurisdiction where 
there was a public disclosure 
in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government general accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media 
of allegations or transactions of the fraud 
that the relator action was based upon and 
the relator was not an original source of the information.
dunleavy,at.we will employ this catalog of elements to structure our analysis,touching on certain aspects more briefly than others.
public disclosure 
corresponding to the first two elements in our catalog,to qualify as a public disclosure under the fca,a disclosure must issue from a source or occur in a context specifically recognized by the act,and be sufficient to support the conclusion that the information contained therein is now public within the meaning of the act.see mistick,at dunleavy,at.regarding the first requirement,section e a clearly provides three classes of sources or contexts of disclosures criminal,civil,or administrative hearings congressional,administrative,or government general accounting office reports,hearings,audits,or investigations and the news media.in dunleavy,we subscribed to the prevailing view that this list is an exhaustive rendition of the possible sources.id as to the second requirement,the sufficiency of the disclosure as public within the meaning of the act,we have suggested that section e a requires information to be public enough that it would have been equally available to strangers to the fraud transaction had they chosen to look for it as it was to the relator.stinson,at.whether a disclosure is public is a determination influenced significantly by the specific source or context of the disclosure and the particular facts of each case.given our precedent on this issue,we have little difficulty finding that there were public disclosures in the instant matter.
we agree with the district court conclusion that irwin has established public disclosure of the alleged fraud.paranich,d at.under our precedent,the heifets and rubanenko complaints and the foia report undoubtedly qualified as public disclosures.in stinson,we held that section e a class of criminal,civil,or administrative hearings should be broadly interpreted to include criminal,civil,or administrative litigation,encompass ing the full range of proceedings in a civil lawsuit.see stinson,at.more specifically,we held that the disclosure of discovery material to a party who is not under any court imposed limitation as to its use constituted a public disclosure within the context of a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing.see id.at.although this view is not universally held,see id.at scirica,dissenting arguing that public disclosure refers to availability of information to the general public at the time of disclosure see also mistick,at becker,dissenting decrying stinson s definition of public disclosure for including discovery material given to a single person in litigation between two private parties and not otherwise filed with a court,the issue of whether a complaint in a civil action qualifies as a public disclosure is potentially much less controversial.unlike discovery material,a complaint,if it is to be operative,is necessarily filed with the court and,except in rare instances,available and accessible to the public.these two characteristics,filing with the court and public,would persuade even those in disagreement with stinson that a complaint is a public disclosure under the fca.see id.at becker,dissenting championing actual,not potential,public accessibility of court files for public disclosure determination stinson,at scirica,dissenting conceding that information gleaned from browsing through public court files would constitute a public disclosure.indeed,other courts have arrived at this conclusion,and even those critical of disclosures in unfiled discovery materials seem willing to concede that disclosures in filed materials would constitute public disclosures in any event,we are persuaded that a complaint in a civil action falls into the context of criminal,civil,or administrative hearings and is sufficiently public within the meaning of the act to constitute a public disclosure.
as to the foia report obtained by paranich counsel,pursuant to mistick,the disclosure of information in response to a foia request is a public disclosure.at.this precedent could not be more clearly applicable the foia report haber received was a public disclosure under the fca.
allegations or transactions 
upon a determination that there has been a public disclosure within the meaning of section e a,the next inquiry,corresponding with the third element of our catalog,is whether the public disclosure contains allegations or transactions of the fraud upon which the qui tam action is based.the heifets and rubanenko complaints contained both allegations of fraud regarding matrix billing policy and at least enough information underlying those allegations to articulate a legal claim,even if the claim had no merit as against irwin.accordingly,we have little difficulty concluding that the complaints contained allegations or transactions of fraud.
based upon 
the next step in our analysis,corresponding with the fourth element in our catalog,is a determination of whether the current action is based upon the public disclosure of the allegations or transactions of fraud.we have held,consistent with the majority of our sister courts of appeals,that the term based upon means supported by or substantially similar to,not actually derived from.mistick,at accord united states ex rel.biddle bd.of trs.of the leland stanford,cir united states ex rel.findley employees club,cooper blue cross blue shield,cir koch,at united states ex rel.doe john doe,cir.but see united states bank of farmington,cir holding that based upon means actually derived from siller,at same.furthermore,we have held that a qui tam action is based upon a qualifying disclosure if the disclosure sets out either the allegations advanced in the qui tam action or all of the essential elements of the qui tam action claims.mistick,at.
regarding the complaints in the california cases,we have noted above that the allegations contained in those complaints concerned matrix allegedly fraudulent billing policy.specifically,the heifets complaint alleged that the defendants 
i nduced plaintiffs and other class members to acquire the matrix bioelectric treatment system and device known as pro elecdt or some other name,by misrepresenting to the class members that medicare will pay for treatments given patients with this device in truth medicare now claims that the billings for treatments rendered by the device were erroneous and in violation of medicare law.
complaint,heifets matrix electromedical,no.the rubanenko complaint asserted similar allegations.complaint,rubanenko matrix biokinetics,no both complaints named irwin formerly known as affiliated capital corporation as a defendant considering that these complaints and paranich action set out the same allegations against a common defendant,we believe there is enough similarity to conclude that paranich action was substantially similar to the heifets and rubanenko complaints and,therefore,that the action was based upon them.
we conclude,therefore,that at least with respect to the complaints,all of the elements of the fca jurisdictional bar provision are present.thus,the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the merits of paranich action unless he qualifies as an original source under section e b.
original source 
under section e b,for paranich to be an original source he must have had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and have voluntarily information to the government before filing the action.because we ultimately find that paranich fails on the voluntary requirement,we do not need to discuss the direct and independent requirements to resolve this matter.we will,however,comment on these requirements because we believe the district court erred in focusing on paranich limited involvement in his attorney investigation and its finding that paranich knowledge was categorically not direct and independent.
the first requirement for paranich to qualify as an original source is that his knowledge of the fraudulent conduct must have been direct.we have interpreted direct to mean marked by absence of an intervening agency,instrumentality,or influence immediate.stinson,at quoting webster third new international dictionary.other courts have interpreted direct to mean,findley,at,seen with the relator own eyes,wang ex rel.united states fmc,cir,unmediated by anything but the relator own labor,see also fine,at united states ex rel.devlin california,cir,and b y the relator own efforts,and not by the labors of others,and not derivative of the information of others,united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir.
the district court concluded that paranich did not qualify as an original source because his knowledge,derived from an investigation conducted by his attorney,was not his own and,therefore,not direct.the court reasoned further that,because haber information came after learning about the heifets and rubanenko suits and transamerica investigation,paranich knowledge was clearly derivative of these prior public disclosures and not direct and independent 
we disagree with the district court application of the direct knowledge requirement because it failed to consider one very important fact paranich did have direct knowledge of the billing scheme because he was involved in it.the first real question,therefore,is did haber investigation,which uncovered most of the fraudulent aspects of the scheme,detract from the directness of paranich own information see generally wang,at hafter,at devlin,at.keep in mind that haber was presumably acting as paranich agent,but he was not an intervening agent,as such.compounding the inquiry further is the fact that the only remaining defendant in the action is irwin leasing.admittedly,paranich did not have direct knowledge of whatever role irwin may have played in the scheme.but is that necessary in order for the relator who has direct knowledge of the overall scheme to state a claim against one who,as part of the scheme,may have played a role in defrauding the government we choose not to answer these questions as the latter was not alluded to in the district court,and,as to the former,the record fails to develop the nature of the agency relationship or the level of paranich actual involvement or control over haber investigation while we do not accept the district court terse consideration of the thought that paranich had direct knowledge based solely on haber having conducted the investigation,we are not prepared to expand the contours of this requirement in a vacuum.
independent 
the second requirement for paranich to qualify as an original source is that his knowledge of the fraudulent conduct must have been independent.we have interpreted this requirement to mean that knowledge of the fraud can not be merely dependent on a public disclosure.see hafter,at a relator who would not have learned of the information absent public disclosure d oes not have independent information within the statutory definition of original source.accord findley,at independent knowledge is knowledge that is not itself dependent on public disclosure.quoting quinn,at devlin,at the fact that the relators had evidence of the fraud prior to the public disclosure of the allegations establishes that their knowledge was independent.furthermore,although a relator does not have to be aware of a disclosure in order for it to be a public disclosure,logically,the relator would have to know of a disclosure in order for his information to be deemed dependent on it 
unlike the district court,we do not find paranich knowledge to have been derived exclusively from the public disclosures.instead,as we have pointed out above,his initial knowledge was,from his own experience,independent of such disclosures.and haber efforts were similarly independent of the public disclosures.as early as april,subsequent to the october,serving of the subpoena but prior to the filing of the california lawsuits,the issue of the transamerica hearing report,and paranich and haber awareness of the march medicare bulletin,haber wrote letters to the fbi and the attorneys offices outlining the alleged fraud perpetrated by matrix and affiliated companies.the letters are proof that paranich and haber knowledge of the alleged fraud was independent of the california lawsuits for the simple fact that these letters predated the filing of those suits.their knowledge similarly predated and was therefore independent of the foia report haber did not even request the foia report until october,six months after he wrote the letters.finally,the letters seem to have predated paranich and haber awareness of the march medicare bulletin the record suggests that paranich and haber were not aware of this bulletin until in or around october even had haber known of the bulletin prior to writing the letters,the bulletin did not contain any allegations that matrix and other parties engaged in deliberate misrepresentations the bulletin merely explained that the use of the matrix should not be billed as nerve block injections.accordingly,we conclude that paranich knowledge of the fraudulent conduct was independent of the public disclosures.
the last requirement for paranich to qualify as an original source is that he must have voluntarily provided information to the government before filing the action.although our courts have previously commented on the temporal requirement of providing information to the government before the qui tam action is filed,see,stinson,at scirica,dissenting united states ex rel.merena smithkline beecham,d,heretofore we have not engaged in an extended analysis of what voluntarily means.here,paranich supplied information after certain records had been subpoenaed by the government.accordingly,we must explore whether paranich provided materials voluntarily to the extent that,in addition to the materials subpoenaed,paranich attorney conducted an investigation and provided additional information to the government.while if only the subpoenaed information were supplied there would be no question that the information was not provided voluntarily,the question here is whether provision of other material,without specific compunction,renders the giving of information to have been voluntary for the purposes of the fca.because some of our sister courts have had an opportunity to explain what it means to provide information voluntarily,we turn to the fruits of their labors for guidance.
in united states ex rel.fine chevron usa,cir en banc,the ninth circuit was presented with a qui tam action brought by a former employee of the office of the inspector general at the department of energy.the relator,an assistant manager of the western region audit office,had left his job after his supervisors failed to pursue every perceived violation he brought to their attention and subsequently filed several qui tam actions based on audits and investigations he had done during his employment.see fine,at.affirming the district court,the majority held that it was without jurisdiction because the claims were based upon publicly disclosed allegations and the original source exception did not apply because the relator had provided the information to the government not voluntarily,but as part of his job responsibilities as a government employee.see id.at.
to reach that conclusion,the majority relied on a dictionary definition of voluntary supporting a reading of the term a cting,or done,of one own free will without valuable consideration acting or done without any present legal obligation to do the thing done or any such obligation that can accrue from the existing state of affairs.id.at quoting webster third new international dictionary definition g.under this definition,the majority determined that the relator was not a volunteer because he acted in return for valuable consideration,his salary,and under an obligation to do the very acts he claimed were voluntary.see id.at noting that the relator no more voluntarily provided information to the government than we,as federal judges,voluntarily hear arguments and draft dispositions.
the relator,citing a floor statement by senator grassley,the principal sponsor of the amendments to the fca,argued that the provision of information to the government should be held to be voluntary unless compelled by a subpoena.see id.the statement by senator grassley is provided below 
in the definition of original source,the requirement that the individual voluntarily informed the government or news media is meant to preclude the ability of an individual to sue under the qui tam section of the false claims act when his suit is based solely on public information and the individual was a source of the allegations only because the individual was subpeonaed sic to come forward.however,those persons who have been contacted or questioned by the government or the news media and cooperated by providing information which later led to a public disclosure would be considered to have voluntarily informed the government or media and therefore considered eligible qui tam relators.
cong.rec.the majority rejected the relator narrow interpretation of this statement,finding that the statement did not purport to describe the only situation in which the voluntary disclosure requirement would bar a qui tam suit following a public disclosure.fine,at stating further that a single floor statement could not convince us to adopt so tortured a construction of a commonly understood word citing chrysler brown,d the remarks of a single legislator,even the sponsor,are not controlling in analyzing legislative history.lastly,the relator argued that the majority had to construe his disclosures as voluntary lest it create a rule that barred all federal employees from being original sources in violation of a executive order directing employees to disclose waste,fraud,abuse,and corruption to appropriate authorities.id.quoting exec.order,k.the court summarily rejected this argument,stating that the fact that the relator was employed specifically to disclose fraud was important to the determination that his disclosures were not voluntary see id.
in united states ex rel.barth ridgedale electric,cir,the eighth circuit also interpreted the voluntary provision requirement in light of the policy underlying qui tam actions.in that case,the relators,an electrical worker barth and an electrical workers union union,brought an action against an electrical contractor and its president for submitting false certifications of contract compliance and fraudulent payroll reports to the government for work on a federally funded electrical construction project.barth,at.barth provision of information was actually initiated by an hud investigator and the provision of information was more than two years after the alleged fraudulent activities.see id.at.the district court had dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the union knowledge of the false claims was not sufficiently direct and barth provision of information to the government was not sufficiently voluntary to qualify as an original source under the fca.see id.affirming the decision of the district court,the eighth circuit reasoned that qui tam actions were designed to encourage private individuals cognizant of fraud on the government to bring such information forward at the earliest possible time and that one who was providing information only in response to a government inquiry was not doing so voluntarily within the meaning of the act.see id.in other words,rewarding an individual for merely complying with the government investigation wa s outside the intent of the act.id.
lastly,in united states ex rel.stone amwest savings association,the district court for the northern district of texas,citing both fine and barth,interpreted voluntary to mean uncompensated or unsolicited,not uncompelled.the court concluded that the relator in that case did not voluntarily provide information to the government because he did so seven months after leaving employment with the defendant as its president and ceo and only after securing criminal immunity for providing statements about the defendant questionable business dealings in the course of a government fraud investigation of the defendant.see stone.at.
after reviewing the cases discussed above,we conclude that a putative relator does not,consistent with the policy underlying qui tam actions,voluntarily provide information to the government where the government has identified the putative relator as being involved in the fraudulent activity and has initiated contact with a subpoena demanding information fundamental to the putative relator action.in such a case,as with cases involving federal employees charged with investigating fraud,and with cases involving complacent,reluctant,or delinquent informants,the incentive of a qui tam action as an device is lost and the putative relator further participation in the government investigation is necessarily fueled by other forms of.information not specifically compelled but nonetheless brought forward as a result of the government pointed contact should not be deemed voluntarily
