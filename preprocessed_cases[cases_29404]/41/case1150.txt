factual and procedural history 
plaintiff john gore began working for tennessee gas pipeline company tennessee gas,a subsidiary of tenneco,tenneco in.as an employee,gore participated in tenneco disability ltd plan,which provided for own occupation disability benefits for a period of months and any occupation disability benefits thereafter until the age of.
in,el paso acquired tennessee gas.shortly thereafter,el paso area manager and hr manager met with el paso new employees from former tenneco gas.the employees were told that their benefits at el paso would remain the same as they were at tenneco.according to gore,at no time during his employment with el paso did he receive a summary plan description,nor was he informed of any changes to the plan.
tenneco ltd plan was in effect until december.on january,a new group disability or income policy began to cover the company employees,including gore.this new policy,governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,is the subject of this dispute.
under the terms of the new policy,liberty was required to both manage and adjudicate claims for el paso.the plan itself was different from the previous plan in that it provided for own occupation disability benefits for only months after an elimination period,as opposed to the months of the tenneco plan.after months under the new plan,an employee would be required to demonstrate that his injury prevented him from working any occupation for which he is qualified.
in late november,gore was injured in a natural gas explosion at the el paso facility and has not worked there since.in june of,gore filed a claim for ltd benefits with liberty.liberty retroactively extended disability benefits to him from may,to may,because it was determined that he was unable to perform his own occupation.
in october,a vocational case manager conducted a transferable skills analysis to determine whether occupational alternatives were available to gore,based on his and capacities.the case manager determined that occupational alternatives were available to gore within the petroleum industry involving either sedentary work or work light in physical demand.these occupational alternatives were control panel operator,dispatcher,or title clerk.
in december,a physician conducted an independent medical examination of gore in connection with his worker compensation claims.the physician recommended that gore have certain restrictions placed on his work activities.this report was forwarded to another physician who essentially agreed with its evaluation of gore condition.
in february,liberty informed gore that in order to remain eligible for benefits after may,gore would have to meet the any occupation standard.
that next month,liberty ordered a labor market survey to be conducted concerning the three occupational alternatives identified by the vocational case manager.the survey was sent to nine different employers in texas and louisiana concerning nine available positions.eight of the nine employers determined,based on gore restrictions,that gore was qualified for the specified job.
in april,gore submitted his own vocational evaluation based on his medical records,academic testing,and a clinical interview with gore.this personal vocational evaluation determined that the types of jobs that gore could perform were not available in tennessee.
in may,liberty notified gore by letter that it had denied his claim for ltd because he did not meet el paso definition of disability.the denial was based on the finding that other occupational alternatives were available to gore accounting for his restrictions,limitations,and transferable skills in the petroleum industry.
gore appealed and requested to review pertinent claim file documents upon which the denial of benefits was based.after securing an attorney,the attorney requested from liberty the administrative record of gore claim a written explanation of the claims and appeals procedures applicable to gore claim an additional days to submit proof and a written explanation of liberty reasons for relying on the labor market survey.
liberty denied the appeal on july,by letter.the letter also noted that gore had already been forwarded a copy of both the administrative file and a copy of el paso ltd group contract.as a result,liberty denied his request for a copy.
in october of,gore filed a complaint against both liberty and el paso in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee asserting wrongful denial of disability benefits under el paso ltd plan,pursuant to a b.gore also asserted a claim for civil penalties due to defendants failure or refusal to provide certain documents within days after written request.gore finally asserted that both liberty and el paso breached their fiduciary duties and requested other appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of the plan erisa,pursuant to a.in addition to benefits and civil penalty damages,gore requested an injunction,fees and costs.
the parties conferred,drafted,and submitted a proposed initial case management order that the district court then entered in february.the order structured the case in two stages.the first stage concerned gore claims for wrongful denial of benefits,while the second stage dealt with both gore breach of fiduciary duty claims and civil penalty claims.
in early,gore moved to supplement the administrative record.in may,the district court granted gore motion to supplement the administrative record with the july,medical examination report and remanded the case to liberty for reconsideration of gore claim for ltd benefits.
liberty then commissioned a peer review of gore medical files,which came to the consensus that gore was at the time capably and gainfully employed of being fit for full duty of light to medium duty with certain restrictions and limitations.after the peer review,liberty sought an updated vocational review,which determined that gore could earn between and a year for the previously identified alternative occupations in the tennessee area and roughly the same for the national economy.
in december,liberty determined that gore medical restrictions and limitations do not prevent him from returning to alternative sedentary to light occupations.thus,liberty again determined that gore did not meet the policy definition of disability.
after the case was reopened by the district court,a second case management order was entered in march.the only relevant change was that the parties agreed to include both the benefits and civil penalties claims in the first stage of the litigation,leaving only the breach of fiduciary duties claims under a for the second stage.this second case management order discussed the relationship between gore claim for benefits and breach of fiduciary duties claim 
to the extent that the order ruling on plaintiff and liberty cross motions for judgment awards full benefits to plaintiff from the date of curtailment of benefit payments through his attainment of,the second stage of the case becomes moot.
once the discovery for the first stage of the litigation was complete,liberty moved for summary judgment on gore claim for civil penalties.gore moved for partial summary judgment on his civil penalty claims.
in december,the district court entered an order denying gore motion and dismissed his claims for benefits and civil penalties.the court determined that el paso,not liberty,was the plan administrator.though the policy itself was silent as to the plan administrator,the long term disability plan summary description stated that el paso was the plan administrator.furthermore,the parties stipulated that el paso is the administrator of the ltd plan within the meaning of erisa in the initial case management order.in addition,the district court further found that gore requested information about the plan from liberty only.relying on this circuit case law,the district court declined in its discretion to impose statutory penalties against el paso.
in early december,the district court ordered another case management conference and required the parties to confer,draft,and submit position statements on the status of the case.in january,the district court ordered gore to file a brief that supports the survival of his fiduciary duty claim after the court prior ruling.gore submitted his brief and el paso responded.
in october,the district court dismissed gore a claim for breach of fiduciary duty and request for equitable relief.the district court held 
in light of these facts,the fact that a b provided an adequate remedy,as well as the aforementioned gore admissions,the court finds that the plaintiff remaining claim against el paso for breach of fiduciary duty is nothing more than a repackaged denial of benefits claim,precisely the type of claim expressly rejected by the supreme court in varity,and the sixth circuit in wilkins.equitable relief under a is,therefore,not appropriate,and gore breach of fiduciary duty claims against el paso must be dismissed.
the district court also rejected gore equitable estoppel argument on the grounds that it was not preserved,calling it an claim.as a result,the case was dismissed.
gore appealed raising two separate issues first,whether the district court erred by denying his claim against el paso for equitable relief and second,whether the district court erred by denying his claim for civil penalties against el paso.gore has subsequently settled his claims against liberty,and liberty has been dismissed from the appeal.

iii.claims as repackaged individual benefits claims 
gore contends that he is entitled to equitable relief for el paso breach of fiduciary duty,pursuant to a.specifically,gore claims that el paso breached its duty by misrepresenting the duration of his own occupation long term disability benefits,citing varity howe,d,for support.as a result of this alleged breach,gore argues that he should be awarded compensatory damages in the form of one year worth of compensation,the difference between tenneco ltd plan own occupation benefits years and el paso ltd plan own occupation benefits year.
section a of erisa,a,provides that 
a civil action may be brought 
by a participant or beneficiary 
a for the relief provided in subsection c of this section providing for liquidated damages for failure to provide certain information on request,or 
b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan 
by the secretary,or by a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section of this title 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary 
a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or 
b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief 
i to dress such violations or 
ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan 
the district court determined that plaintiff was barred from pursuing equitable relief under the provision of a because gore breach of fiduciary duty claim was nothing more than a repackaged denial of benefits claim,similar to the type warned about in varity,at,and determined to be barred in wilkins baptist healthcare system,cir.
in varity,an employer reorganized,combining some of its divisions into a new subsidiary corporation.at.the employer also administered its employees original welfare benefit plan.id.during the reconfiguration,the employer convinced many of the employees to transfer their benefits plan to a plan offered by the new subsidiary,assuring them that the benefits would remain secure.id.at.however,the employer was aware that the new entity was insolvent from its inception.id.at the end of the corporation second year,the new entity went into receivership,resulting in the loss of the employees nonpension benefits.id.a group of those employees brought suit seeking the benefits they would have been paid had they not transferred to the new entity plan.id.
agreeing with the district court and the eighth circuit,the supreme court found that erisa a,a,gave the employees a right to appropriate equitable relief to redress the harm that the original deception had caused them individually.id.at.the supreme court determined that while there is a remedy for a breach of fiduciary duty related to the interpretation of plan documents and payment of claims under erisa a b,a b,the remedy for other breaches of other sorts of fiduciary obligation may be sought under a.
erisa specifically provides a remedy for breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to interpretation of plan documents and the payment of claims,one that is outside the framework of the second subsection and,and one that runs directly to the injured beneficiary a b.why should we not conclude that congress provided yet other remedies for yet other breaches of other sorts of fiduciary obligation in another,catchall remedial section 
id.at.internal citations omitted.the supreme court concluded that it should expect that where congress elsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary injury,there will likely be no need for further equitable relief,in which case such relief would normally not be appropriate.id.at.the plaintiffs in varity qualified for this catchall because they had no remedy under a b or a.
with this guidance,the sixth circuit in wilkins baptist healthcare system,cir,first addressed a as interpreted by varity.in wilkins,the plaintiff contended that he was entitled to compensatory damages,pursuant to a,based on the defendant breach of fiduciary duty to act solely in wilkins interest for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to him.id.at.this court interpreted varity as clearly limiting the applicability of a to beneficiaries who may not avail themselves of other remedies.id.citing varity,at.because a b provided a remedy for wilkins alleged injury and allowed him to bring a lawsuit to challenge the plan administrator denial of benefits,a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty pursuant to a was not appropriate.id.in further distinguishing wilkins from the plaintiffs in varity,this court noted that the in varity misled the employees,causing them to lose their benefits.id.
several subsequent sixth circuit decisions that have addressed a claims suggest that a plaintiff who is permitted to bring a a b claim for denial of benefits and does so is under no circumstance permitted to also bring a a claim.see marks newcourt,cir julia,cir putney medical mutual of ohio,cir.
