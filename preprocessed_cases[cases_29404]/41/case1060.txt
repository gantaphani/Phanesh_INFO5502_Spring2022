the plaintiffs united steel,paper and forestry,rubber,manufacturing,energy,allied industrial and service workers international union,usw and hobert tackett,woodrow piles,and harland conley retiree plaintiffs separately appeal the district court dismissal of their case under federal rule of civil procedure b and b.
the plaintiffs alleged that,under their collective bargaining agreement cba,the defendant m g polymers,usa m g promised them vested benefits.when defendant m g announced it would begin requiring retiree contributions to costs,the plaintiffs sued.in addition to suing m g,the plaintiffs also sued the m health plans that retiree plaintiffs receive their benefits from the m g comprehensive medical benefits program for employees and their dependents,the m g catastrophic medical plan,the m g medical necessity benefits program of hospital,surgical,medical,and prescription drug benefits for employees and their dependents,and the m g major medical benefits plan collectively,with defendant m g,defendants.
in resolving this appeal,we must decide two main issues whether,under of the labor management relations act lmra,a,a district court must find that a violation of a collective bargaining agreement has occurred before it can exercise jurisdiction and whether,under this circuit analysis,uaw,cir,the plaintiffs have sufficiently established a right to vested benefits to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b by relying on cba language promising a full company contribution to these benefits.
because we hold that a violation is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction under and because the plaintiffs have sufficiently shown an intention to vest healthcare benefits to survive a motion to dismiss,we reverse and remand.
standard of review 
we generally review a district court ruling under rule b and b de novo.nichols muskingum college,cir citations omitted ass of cleveland fire fighters city of cleveland,ohio,cir.courts have,however,observed an exception to this de novo standard of review under rule b.when congress statutorily confers jurisdiction,it can require that certain prerequisites be met before a federal district court can exercise jurisdiction.see,establishing jurisdiction over cases between citizens of different states.when congress establishes a jurisdictional prerequisite,a district court may admit extrinsic evidence and resolve disputed facts to decide if the asserted claim satisfies the jurisdictional prerequisite.arbaugh y h,d.if a district court considers and resolves facts in deciding a rule b motion,we review those findings for clear error.nichols,at.aside from the resolution of jurisdictional prerequisites,a district court must generally confine its rule b or b ruling to matters contained within the pleadings and accept all allegations as true.gentek building products,cir.
ii.background and procedural posture 
before their retirement,the retiree plaintiffs worked at the point pleasant polyester plant the plant in apple grove,west virginia.at that location,plaintiff usw,or its predecessor union,bargained on behalf of the plant employees.the plant has changed ownership several times,and m g now owns the plant.
in december,m g announced that it would begin requiring retirees to contribute to the cost of their benefits.after defendant m g announcement,retiree plaintiffs,as putative class representatives,and usw sued under of the lmra and under the employee retirement income security act erisa a and a b.following the district court dismissal,the plaintiffs appealed separately,with usw challenging the district court ruling on and the retiree plaintiffs challenging the ruling on both and erisa a and a b.the appeals were consolidated for submission to this court.
in their complaint,the plaintiffs pointed to language in the november,cba between m g and usw that governed retirees entitlement to benefits 
employees who retire on or after january,and who are eligible for and receiving a monthly pension under the pension plan whose full years of attained age and full years of attained continuous service at the time of retirement equals or more points will receive a full company contribution towards the cost of benefits employees who have less than points at the time of retirement will receive a reduced company contribution.the company contribution will be reduced by for every point less than.employees will be required to pay the balance of the health care contribution,as estimated by the company annually in advance,for the health care benefits failure to pay the required medical contribution will result in cancellation of coverage.
emphasis added.according to the plaintiffs,this full company contribution language shows a vested right to benefits those employees meeting the age and qualifications are entitled to health care benefits and those falling below these qualifications would receive reductions from full coverage as set out in the plan.the retiree plaintiffs also sought to represent surviving spouses whose benefits were affected by defendants alleged breach.the plaintiffs said that the defendants unilaterally set the contribution at a level below full coverage violating the language.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under rule b and b.the defendants argued that,which confers jurisdiction in federal district courts in s uits for violation of contracts,a,required that a plaintiff show a violation before a district court could exercise jurisdiction.in the alternative,the defendants moved to dismiss saying that the language quoted by the plaintiffs did not establish a vested right to benefits.
in moving to dismiss,the defendants submitted evidence of several side letter agreements.defendants said that these side letters were incorporated by reference into the cba that the plaintiffs sued under and that the side letters cap the amount of the employer contribution to the cost of benefits.responding,the plaintiffs said that these side cap letters were not part of the collective bargaining agreement that the plaintiffs sued under.resolution of this disputed issue,however,required consideration of materials extrinsic to the pleadings the defendants said that the district court could consider this extrinsic material under rule b because the court found a lack of a violation,which was a jurisdictional prerequisite.
the district court agreed with the defendants and held that the showing of a collective bargaining agreement violation was a prerequisite to jurisdiction absent a breach by defendants,this court lacks jurisdiction over the claim.tackett m g polymers usa,d.the court then admitted and weighed the extrinsic evidence on the side letters to decide whether m g breached the collective bargaining agreement id.at.ultimately,the district court concluded that the defendants did not breach the cba,and that it lacked jurisdiction.
as an alternative to its dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,the district court then assumed for argument purposes that it had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims for relief and addressed the defendants b motion to dismiss.because the lrma and the erisa a b claims both turned on whether the plaintiffs benefits were vested,the district court considered these claims together and held that the full company contribution language did not plausibly state a claim for vested healthcare benefits.
the district court additionally granted the defendants b motion directed at the plaintiffs erisa fiduciary claim,holding that plaintiffs failed to plead facts supporting this claim.id.at.
iii.rule b 
our review of the district court dismissal under rule b turns on whether a plaintiff must establish the breach of a collective bargaining agreement as a prerequisite to jurisdiction under of the lmra the lmra confers jurisdiction in federal district courts in s uits for violation of contracts.a whether the language in a statute like is a jurisdictional prerequisite or merely an essential ingredient of a federal claim for relief is sometimes a close question.arbaugh,at.quoting da silva kinsho intern,cir.
if a violation is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,then,to survive a rule b motion,the plaintiffs need not show a violation but merely that their violation claim is colorable.id.at.citing bell hood.additionally,if a violation is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,the district court erred in admitting and weighing evidence extrinsic to the pleadings in resolving the rule b motion.
the distinction between a jurisdictional prerequisite and an essential ingredient of a federal claim to relief 
in finding that it did not have jurisdiction over plaintiffs breach of contract claim,the district court relied upon bauer rbx industries,cir.giving bauer an exceedingly broad reading,the district court held that plaintiffs in a action must demonstrate a contractual violation to establish jurisdiction.tackett,d at.the district court interpretation of bauer was.more importantly,the supreme court and this court have both subsequently rejected the district court requirement.
after the bauer decision,the supreme court clarified the distinction between a jurisdictional prerequisite and an essential ingredient of a federal claim to relief and provided a test that courts must use to determine what showing is required to establish jurisdiction and what showing is required to establish the merits of their claims.in arbaugh,the plaintiff sued for alleged violations of title vii.id.at.title vii says that e ach united states district court shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter.id.at.citing f.title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate,on the basis of sex.id.at.citing a.separately,title vii defines employer to only include those employers with fifteen or more employees.id.at.citing b.the central issue in arbaugh was whether this statutory requirement was a jurisdictional prerequisite,or merely an essential ingredient of the plaintiff claim.arbaugh,at.
in resolving this central issue,the arbaugh court first criticized the frequent sloppiness in courts treatment of motions to dismiss,noting that courts too often conflated rule b merits motions with rule b jurisdictional motions.id.at.to remedy this,the supreme court established a bright line rule 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as in character.
id.at.citations omitted emphasis added.
in determining whether congress intended courts to treat the employee numerosity requirement as jurisdictional,the supreme court noted that title vii gave no indication that a district court should raise and resolve the requirement on its own.id.at.
in concluding that congress did not intend to rank the requirement as jurisdictional,the court identified two additional practical considerations that supported its holding the discretion that district courts enjoy when their overlaps with the merits of the claims and judicial efficiency.id.a district court can resolve disputed facts that underlie a jurisdictional prerequisite in a b motion,but when the prerequisite is intertwined with the merits,this undercuts the jury role as the proper trier of contested facts.id.additionally,because jurisdiction defects can be raised at any stage of litigation,and because a lack of jurisdiction requires dismissal of pendent claims,a district court may be required to dismiss state claims after expending considerable judicial resources.id.
application of arbaugh in the sixth circuit 
after oral argument in this case,this court reexamined bauer and its jurisprudence in light of the arbaugh decision.winnett caterpillar,cir.in winnett,this court overruled the bauer decision and held that the existence of a union contract is an element of plaintiffs merits claim,not a limit on federal jurisdiction.id.at.
in reaching this decision,the winnett court started with an examination of congressional intent.id.at arbaugh now tells us to ask did congress clearly state,at,that the existence of a union contract is a jurisdictional prerequisite for a section a claim.in determining whether congress intended a contract to be a jurisdictional prerequisite,the court noted that the only reference to jurisdiction in was to personal jurisdiction and in that reference the statute had not impose d new barriers to federal courts,but had ease d access.id.at.additionally,includes all of the prima facie elements of the cause of action in the provision.the court reasoned that,if a contract is a jurisdictional prerequisite,then likely each other prima facie requirement in functions as a jurisdictional prerequisite.the winnett court was reluctant to conclude that congress intended to create a cause of action that has no elements.id.
after finding no indication that congress clearly state d that courts should treat a contract as jurisdictional,the court went on to address the considerations associated with treating a contract as jurisdictional.id.this additional analysis after examining congressional intent was drawn from the arbaugh decision arbaugh also tells us not to just look at labels but also pragmatically to consider the consequences of giving a jurisdictional label to an element of a cause of action.id.the winnett court then pointed out that,when a district court finds a jurisdictional defect,the court must dismiss even meritorious pendent claims,despite the time and resources the court and parties have expended on the case.id.at noting the wasteful inefficiencies on the parties or the courts.
as directed by the supreme court in arbaugh and the winnett court,we conclude that congress did not clearly state an intent to treat the violation language as jurisdictional.see id.at.additionally,after examining the considerations of labeling the violation language as jurisdictional,we find the district court interpretation would wreak havoc.see id.at.
the winnett court has already determined that congress did not intend the contract language in as jurisdictional.we agree and hold that congress did not clearly state that courts should treat the violation language as jurisdictional for the same reasons identified by the winnett court.the language of suggests that a violation is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction suits for violation of contracts may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties a emphasis added.if we were to consider a violation a jurisdictional prerequisite,congress would be requiring a district court to determine whether a violation had occurred before it could decide at the merits stage whether a violation had occurred.this can not be the result intended by congress with the use of the violation language.
this conclusion is bolstered here,even more so than in winnett,by the considerations associated with labeling a violation as a jurisdictional prerequisite.winnett,at.first,the lmra gives the district court jurisdiction over s uits for violation of contracts.section does not limit jurisdiction to suits where a violation of contract has been established.the district court will consider the same set of underlying facts when deciding if there was a violation to support jurisdiction and when deciding if the plaintiffs should ultimately succeed on the merits of their claim.any by a district court during a jurisdictional determination undercuts the jury traditional role as the proper trier of contested facts.see arbaugh,at.citations omitted.
second,as both winnett and arbaugh noted,when a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a claim,it must immediately dismiss not just that claim but any pendent claims as matter how late in the case the district or appellate court identifies the jurisdictional defect.winnett,at citing arbaugh,at.for example,a case may go all the way to a jury trial on a claim and pendent claims.if the jury finds that the claims are meritorious but also that a plaintiff did not establish a violation of a labor contract,the court would be required to dismiss these meritorious claims after expending considerable judicial resources on their adjudication.this required dismissal may impose wasteful inefficiencies on the parties or the courts.id.
these inefficiencies become exacerbated in the context of a action.in charles dowd box courtney,d,the supreme court addressed concurrent federal and state court jurisdiction over claims for a violation of a collective bargaining agreement.the court held that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims.id.at.we agree with the supreme judicial court of massachusetts that the courts of that commonwealth had jurisdiction in this case,and we accordingly affirm the judgment before us.see also,valinski detroit edison,cir state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims,but must of course apply federal law.if plaintiffs claim for breach of contract is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,res judicata does not prevent of the breach of contract claim in a state court with plenary jurisdiction.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure the basic rule that dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not preclude a second action on the same claim is well settled.
accordingly,we hold that the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs claims for lack of jurisdiction 
after dismissing the plaintiffs lmra claim for lack of jurisdiction,the district court then assumed that it had jurisdiction and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim.we now address the district court grant of the defendants b motion.the district court decline d to consider material extrinsic to the pleadings in regard to the motion to dismiss,and therefore did not convert the b motion into a motion for summary judgment.tackett,d at the defendants say that we should affirm that district court b ruling,or,alternatively,convert this into a rule motion and consider materials outside the pleadings.the defendants say that conversion is appropriate because both parties submitted,and the district court considered,extrinsic materials in the rule b analysis.
under our b analysis above,we did not consider matters outside the pleadings.rule b,besides some minor exceptions,does not permit courts to consider evidence extrinsic to the pleadings.see tellabs,makor issues rights,d citing wright miller.if,however,as the defendants urge,we convert the b motion into a rule motion,we would need to examine all of the extrinsic materials the parties submitted.accordingly,we will first address whether such an examination is necessary,and decide if the defendants rule b motion should be converted into a rule motion on appeal.
rule d conversion 
when a court considers matters outside the pleadings in a rule b motion,rule d requires that the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under rule.d.a district court may convert the motion sua sponte.this conversion,however,should be exercised with great caution and attention to the parties procedural rights.wright miller.
in the sixth circuit,before a district court may convert the motion sua sponte,the district court must afford the party against whom sua sponte summary judgment is to be entered notice and an adequate opportunity to respond.yashon gregory,cir.despite this clearly established rule,an appeals court will reverse for failure to notify only if the losing party can demonstrate prejudice.harrington bd.of,cir a district court failure to comply with the requirement of rule c is subject to the harmless error rule.
yashon states that the notice requirement is flexible and that a failure to give notice will result in reversal only if there was sufficient prejudice to the party.see wright miller t he absence of formal notice will be excused when it is harmless or when the parties were otherwise apprised of the conversion and,in fact,had a sufficient opportunity to present the materials relevant to a summary judgment motion.
in asking this court to convert the b motion sua sponte,the defendants point to cunningham osram sylvania,cir,an unreported sixth circuit opinion where the district court granted the defendant b motion to dismiss,but considered materials extrinsic to the pleadings.on appeal,the parties conceded that,although the district court decided the motion under rule b,a decision under rule was appropriate.id.this court did not reverse because the district court committed a technical error and merely mislabeled its analysis the district court decision was the functional equivalent of a rule determination.id.
cunningham involved the review of a district court opinion that was the functional equivalent of a ruling under rule.the merits analysis presented here under rule b,however,was not at all the functional equivalent of a rule determination.here,the district court weighed and resolved the claim without viewing the facts,and all inferences to be drawn from them,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.abercrombie fitch stores,am.eagle outfitters,cir citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.additionally,the district court made no conclusions regarding whether the claim presented any genuine issue as to any material fact.c.
because the district court ruling was not the functional equivalent of a rule ruling,we decline the defendants invitation to base our ruling on rule.therefore,we will not consider matters extrinsic to the pleadings and we will proceed to review the district court rule b analysis.
rule b standard 
in deciding a rule b motion,a district court must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and take all factual allegations as true.gunasekera irwin,cir citations omitted.but the district court need not accept a bare assertion of legal conclusions.columbia natural,tatum,cir.
in bell atlantic twombly,d,the supreme court said that,when viewing the complaint under the above standards,to survive a motion to dismiss a complaint must contain enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible,more than a formulaic recitation of a cause of action elements,and allegations that suggest a right to relief above a speculative level.
just weeks after the twombly decision,however,the supreme court cited twombly to reaffirm the liberal pleading standard in rule a rule a requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.specific facts are not necessary the statement need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.erickson pardus,d quoting twombly.at.on several occasions,the sixth circuit has identified uncertainty regarding the scope of twombly,and noted that twombly may be limited to expensive,complicated litigation.gunasekera,at.in reviewing a motion to dismiss,w e read twombly and erickson in conjunction with one another.sensations,city of grand rapids,cir.
we will now address whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded their lmra and erisa claims to survive a rule b motion.
section pleading sufficiency 
the parties dispute whether the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a violation of the cba.the plaintiffs allege that defendants unilaterally modified the plaintiffs vested benefits.benefits vest only if the parties so intend.noe polyone,cir.if the parties do not intend to vest the benefits,the former employer can modify the retiree benefits without breaching a collective bargaining agreement.
in determining whether the parties intended health care benefits to vest,this court applies the principles first described in uaw,cir.in,we held that,when interpreting a collective bargaining agreement,a court must start with the explicit language.id.general principles of contract interpretation should guide a district court interpretation of the explicit language when a contractual provision is ambiguous,the court may turn to extrinsic evidence.uaw bvr liquidating,cir.language in a collective bargaining agreement that equate es eligibility for retiree health benefits with eligibility for a pension suggests an intent to vest.mccoy meridian auto,cir citing golden,cir.
courts reviewing a collective bargaining agreement must also keep in mind the context of negotiations on retiree benefits because retirement health care benefits are not mandatory or required to be included in an agreement,and because they are typica
