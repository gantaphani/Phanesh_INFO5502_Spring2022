we must decide whether transit riders can recover under the americans with disabilities act where a public transit service system complies with existing federal design regulations for train station accessibility.
sheron george had congenital cataracts.by,her vision had become impaired to the point that she was declared legally blind george valued her independence,and because she could not drive,relied on services provided by bay area rapid transit district bart and other public transportation services to get around.she found it particularly difficult to negotiate stairs because of her limited depth perception.however,she was able to use stairs if they were painted or marked a different color to show the location of each step.she was taught to follow the movement of others to avoid getting lost when she entered or exited public places.she had never attempted to use bart accessible or universal routes in its train stations.
one day,george was walking from a bus to a bart train station when she fell down a set of stairs.she reported that she did not see any markings or any other indication that she was approaching a stair until she suddenly stepped off into thin air.she also noted that she was in great pain as a result of her fall and was taken to the hospital the next day.four days later,george fell again when she attempted to use what was unbeknownst to her a closed entrance.she stated in an affidavit that she was severely hurt and asked bart to call an ambulance.
george eyesight improved in to the point that she was no longer legally blind.however,she reported that after her falls she developed physical disabilities that significantly impaired her mobility and was prescribed a wheelchair due to those disabilities.
sharricci had partial sight in both eyes,with corrected vision of in one eye and in the other her depth perception and peripheral vision were limited her night vision was even more significantly impaired.as of,she was a student at california state university at hayward and used public transportation including bart to attend school and for other purposes.she reported anxiety when using some of bart stations because they were not equipped with color contrast striping or accessible handrails.she did not have the visual acuity necessary to locate a designated accessible route on her own because she could not read signs in public places unless she was very close to them.reported feeling unsafe when isolated from the general public,and stated that the bart elevators she knew of were too isolated.for these two reasons,she would not and could not use the universal route that bart claims was intended and designed for blind and low vision persons.she reported,however,that she could use facilities with a few minor modifications,such as color contrast striping and accessible handrails.
reported that the lack of color contrast striping and the excessively wide handrails almost caused her to fall at bart macarthur train station.she also reported that the glare from the color contrast steps at the street station also caused her difficulty in using the stairs.
george and to whom we refer as transit riders sued bart in the united states district court for the northern district of california,alleging violations of the americans with disabilities act ada,the rehabilitation act of,and california civil rights laws 
in the district court,both sides agreed that bart facilities complied with the department of transportation dot regulations,which require that each light rail station have at least one accessible route from an accessible entrance to those areas necessary for the use of the transportation system.dot regulations are required by statute to be consistent with the ada accessibility guidelines adaag in effect at the time.such specific technical guidelines implementing the ada are issued by the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board board,an independent agency nevertheless,the district court found that such dot regulations were both arbitrary and plainly contrary to the statute.because the ada requires that public transportation programs be accessible to all patrons with disabilities,t he dot regulations are arbitrary and capricious to the extent that they fail to fulfill this mandate by failing to address the needs of those with visual impairments.a stipulated judgment required bart to pay attorney fees and costs,as well as in compensatory damages.in addition,bart was required to take seven specific steps to improve the accessibility of some of its facilities to those with vision impairments.
bart appealed the district court decision to this court,whereupon the united states was granted leave to file a brief as amicus curiae.on april,we vacated the district court decision and remanded the case to the district court so the united states could intervene as a party,which the united states promptly did.see george bay area rapid transit.cir.following remand,the district court again found the dot regulations to be arbitrary and capricious.bart and the united states both now timely appeal.
the united states argues that the district court erred by declaring the dot regulatory scheme arbitrary and capricious 
dot was required to issue regulations to make key stations readily accessible to and useable by persons with visual impairments.see b id.a.the united states argues that dot has,in fact,done so.we agree the dot regulations are not arbitrary or capricious because the dot did address the needs of those with visual disabilities,although perhaps not to the level the transit riders would have preferred.
dot regulations address these needs,in part,through a performance standard.the board had explicitly included in adaag a provision requiring facilities to be designed to minimize the distance which wheelchair users and other persons who can not negotiate steps may have to travel compared to the general public.the performance standard addresses persons who can not negotiate steps,and the board enacted the performance standard to aid the visually disabled.see,the preliminary rules required designers to lay out stations in a straightforward manner,both to reduce the distance a person with a disability would need to travel and to encourage consistency in design to assist all persons,but especially persons with cognitive,visual or disabilities to locate various elements expeditiously.emphases added.earlier,the board considered whether steps should have contrasting nosings or thread markings but concluded that it was not aware of any research that supported such a recommendation,july.consistent with the board decisions,dot included the performance standard in its regulations,but did not require contrasting nosings or thread markings.
furthermore,the dot regulations require many other features to aid those with visual disabilities.for instance,signs used to indicate the direction of the accessible route must use a wheelchair icon and meet certain typeface requirements.id.at.certain steps to minimize glare are required,and tactile warnings must be placed near platform edges.id.at 
the transit riders counter that readily accessible to and usable by means a high degree of convenient accessibility.iii.however,they merely replace one vague phrase with another,doing little to aid us in deciding whether dot regulations are arbitrary and capricious.
a decision is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or has offered an explanation so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or product of agency expertise.united states snoring relief labs,cir internal quotation marks omitted,bracketed numbers added.
there is no evidence that dot considered impermissible factors.the regulations demonstrate that dot did not entirely fail to consider the needs of those with visual disabilities.nor is there any reason to think that the overall set of regulations runs counter to the evidence or is implausible.
nor did dot act a
