michael diekhoff appeals his convictions below for kidnapping in violation of a,using a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of c,and being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.following his convictions,the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment as to the first count with concurrent sentences for the remaining two.the only real issue below was diekhoff sanity,and,here on appeal,diekhoff appeals the district court handling of this defense on a number of grounds.finding no error,we affirm.
background 
in,diekhoff lived in westmont,indiana but worked for a bloomington,illinois trucking company as an trucker.there,he met and befriended one of the company dispatchers,lori wagner.although wagner and diekhoff were never romantic,the two were for dinner every month and,after diekhoff left the company,visiting each other periodically.in august,wagner began dating the man who would become her future husband.wagner and diekhoff still spoke on the phone,but their monthly visits became a thing of the past.in,diekhoff called wagner to tell her that,in light of her emerging romance,he would not be calling her any more.
then strange things began happening to wagner.on october,someone set her house on fire,causing a good deal of property damage and killing two of her cats.in early november,someone dumped yellow paint on her car,and a diekhoff had that night asking if she had seen the damage to her car.this anonymous woman would call again a few weeks later,reading a script that diekhoff had given her.she told wagner to leave the country and said that the property damage to her car and home would pale in comparison to what would happen to her children.police tracked the phone calls to indiana.and when wagner told the police that diekhoff lived there,the police paid him a visit.following his interview,diekhoff called wagner to tell her that two fbi agents had visited him to investigate her case.then the phone calls stopped three weeks of police surveillance of wagner work place did not reveal any suspicious activity.
wagner would not hear from diekhoff again until the morning of january,when he approached her in her work parking lot wearing a mask and sporting a shotgun.diekhoff pointed the gun at her and hustled her into a minivan he had rented.when wagner fought back,diekhoff threatened to shoot her and dragged her into the minivan by her hair.there,the struggle continued until diekhoff pointed the gun to wagner head and told her he had no problem blowing her brains out right here and now.subdued,wagner was handcuffed to a chain around the driver seat,and the two drove west.
diekhoff was clearly agitated.his mother,with whom diekhoff lived,would testify at trial that prior to the kidnapping he had stopped working and stayed by himself in his bedroom for hours on end.she described him as nervous and paranoid he lost a good deal of weight and had taken to talking to himself.driving west in the minivan,wagner got a sense of diekhoff problems and learned the story behind her two months of harassment.he said that he had started the fire at her house because he wanted to hurt her,and he had paid a woman to make the harassing phone calls.diekhoff had also spied on her and her boyfriend on one occasion,watching them in her home.he told wagner that he would have killed them both if he had a gun at the time.
diekhoff also said that he still wanted to hurt wagner a few times during the drive.at one point,diekhoff gave wagner minutes to convince him that she was human,that she deserved to live.and at another,he told her that he was going to kill her and put her in the tall weeds for apparently lying to him.after passing from illinois to iowa,diekhoff stopped the minivan and told wagner to call someone to say that she was fine and was on her way to colorado.after wagner fed this story to her boss at the trucking company,diekhoff called his mother in indiana.at this point,the police were aware of the kidnapping,and they had found diekhoff suicide note after searching his room.diekhoff told his mother that he was going to colorado with wagner in light of the note,his mother told him he should just let wagner go and come home.
but diekhoff kept iowa through to south dakota.over the next two days,wagner attempted to placate diekhoff by agreeing with everything he said.the tactic eventually worked.diekhoff let wagner call her daughter at one point.and eventually he grew to trust her,so much so that when the two stopped at a gas station in south dakota diekhoff left wagner alone in the car.seizing the opportunity,she drove away and called the police,who soon captured diekhoff.a search of the minivan revealed water,boots,binoculars,camouflage pants,and a clutch of incriminating equipment the loaded shotgun,shotgun shells,duct tape,and packaging for the face mask.
a indictment and diekhoff arraignment followed.at his arraignment,the district court ordered a psychological exam to determine whether diekhoff was competent to stand trial.following the examination,the district court found diekhoff to be incompetent and ordered him confined in a treatment facility until his competency was restored.following his treatment,the district court eventually concluded that diekhoff was competent and,when diekhoff pled not guilty by reason of insanity,set the case for trial.
prior to trial,the government informed diekhoff that it would seek to admit evidence related to two prior felony convictions for attempted manslaughter and confinement.both stemmed from incidents in involving diekhoff girlfriend at the time,tina hoeing.hoeing and diekhoff had dated briefly from late until the spring of,when hoeing broke things off.soon afterwards,the police arrested diekhoff when he fired a gun at hoeing head.then,when he was out on bond,he broke into hoeing home.he forced hoeing and her brother out at gunpoint,making the latter drive them away in hoeing car.after a brief stop at his own he grabbed a duffel bag filled with chains,duct tape,cash,and a left hoeing brother behind and took hoeing to an indianapolis hotel,handcuffed and covered in a tarp.diekhoff held her captive until the next night when the police found and freed her.the government soon charged him with attempted firing the gun at hoeing kidnapping hoeing and her brother.a jury would find him guilty but mentally insane as to the attempted murder charge,and a separate jury would find him guilty of the confinement charge.for all this,diekhoff served time in prison,eventually earning his release in.after the parties briefed the issue,the district court allowed the government to present evidence related to the confinement offense,but not the attempted murder offense.the court said that it was a close call,but added that the evidence was relevant and probative on the matter of the defendant state of mind,his intent.the court went on to reason that under these circumstances which involve a claim of insanity at the time of the conduct,it did not consider the prejudice to be unfair and held that the evidence would be admissible.
at trial,the only issue was diekhoff sanity.the government put on twelve witnesses in its,including wagner,the police officers involved in the offense,as well as hoeing and two officers involved in her case.in his defense,diekhoff presented the testimony of his mother and that of robert chapman.the latter would testify that diekhoff suffered from major depression,recurrent type,which causes hopelessness,helplessness,and despair.in his opinion,this defect would cause impaired judgment,though he conceded on that this did not necessarily mean diekhoff could not understand the wrongfulness of his actions.
to rebut chapman testimony,the government presented the testimony of two doctors who had examined diekhoff after he was declared competent but prior to trial.the first,ralph newman,was a psychiatrist who agreed that diekhoff suffered from a major depressive disorder.but,in his opinion,this disorder would have no correlation with unlawful behavior.the second,adeirdre stribling,was a staff psychologist at the bureau of prisons who had interviewed diekhoff prior to trial.stribling also agreed that diekhoff suffered from a major depressive disorder and a personality disorder.in her opinion,diekhoff suffered from the latter but not the former during the kidnapping someone with a major depressive disorder would have an impaired ability to function on a basis and could not plan or execute higher level tasks.the government then asked stribling about the specifics of her conversations with diekhoff concerning the kidnapping.she recalled his statement from her notes,over diekhoff objection,when i kidnapped the girl,i needed help.i knew it was wrong.it was also wrong for me to want to kill myself and i sorry.
on,diekhoff counsel asked stribling to read the notes from her interview with diekhoff in their entirety.in response,she read a statement diekhoff had given her 
when they say i kidnapped the girl,i actually did know if i could make it another day.i just felt like i did want to go on.i just wanted to visit three states before i killed myself.i just brought her along for the ride.i wanted to make the whole trip,drive to the end,drop her off at home,then shoot myself.i knew it was wrong to take her with me like that,so i tried to let her use the phone along the way during the trip.it was more problems than that because by then it was a kidnapping.that was wrong.but it was also wrong for me to want to kill myself.now i on the medication and it is important that i live.i do know how long i will be in prison.they could just give me time served.i was wrong and i sorry.
the parties would come to dispute the sentences of this statement.when the time came to tender jury instructions,diekhoff offered one that read 
if the defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity,the court will commit the defendant to a suitable facility until he is eligible for release under the law.
he claimed that this instruction was necessary to counteract stribling testimony recounting his the statements that he did know how long he will be in prison and that they could just give him time served.diekhoff counsel thought this was misleading the jury could convict despite a belief that he was insane simply because it did not want to see diekhoff walking the streets.but the judge disagreed,stating first that the statement was of the defendant own doing and,more importantly,that there was no inaccurate or misleading information of the type that the instruction contemplates.the jury convicted diekhoff on all three counts,and the judge sentenced him to life for the kidnapping,a concurrent sentence for the use of a firearm,and a concurrent term for the charge.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
diekhoff raises three evidentiary issues on appeal related to the admission of testimony regarding his prior offenses,the content of stribling testimony,and the district court denial of a requested jury instruction.the following sections discuss each in turn.
admission of rule b evidence 
diekhoff first challenges the district court decision allowing the government to present evidence of his previous kidnapping conviction,arguing that it was impermissible propensity evidence.rule b provides that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.b.this court has set up a test for examining potential propensity evidence,which combines the proscription laid out in rule b with the more general foundation,relevancy,and prejudice requirements defined elsewhere.see,see also united states shackleford,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by huddleston united states,d.thus,courts are to examine whether 
the evidence is directed toward establishing a matter in issue other than the defendant propensity to commit the crime charged the evidence shows that the other act is similar enough and close enough in time to be relevant to the matter in issue the evidence is sufficient to support a jury finding that the defendant committed the similar act and the evidence has probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
united states simpson,cir.diekhoff challenges the district court decision to admit the evidence on the basis of the first and fourth prong,a decision we review for an abuse of discretion.united states thomas,cir.
diekhoff first claim is that the admission of the testimony regarding his previous kidnapping and burglary convictions did not establish a matter in issue other than his propensity to commit the crime charged.below,the district court admitted the evidence under the theory that it was relevant to diekhoff state of mind,his intent,not his propensity to have committed the crime.diekhoff raises two broad challenges to these theories of admissibility.first,diekhoff claims that the government never really pinpointed a theory of relevancy below and,in his estimation,it was reversible error for the district court not to require that it do so.this argument has little support in the record.in september,the parties discussed the admissibility of diekhoff prior crimes.during that hearing,the government pressed for the admission of both the prior attempted manslaughter and kidnapping charges under the theory that it proved intent,knowledge,plan.the court then denied the request as to the admission of the attempted manslaughter offense and ordered supplemental briefing as to the kidnapping charge.in its brief,the government argued that the evidence was still relevant despite diekhoff insanity plea to show that he appreciated the wrongfulness of his actions,the central issue at trial.and the court then admitted the evidence to bear on diekhoff state of mind and his intent.in sum,there is no basis for concluding,as diekhoff urges us to do,that the government was reciting by rote the admissible purposes listed in rule b without tying that theory to the case.on the contrary,both the district court and the government were careful to examine the admissibility of this evidence in light of diekhoff insanity defense.
diekhoff principal argument,however,is that the evidence showed nothing but his propensity for criminal behavior.he submits that his intent and state of mind were not at issue because he stipulated to having kidnapped wagner.and,he claims,his intent had little relevance in establishing whether he could tell the difference between right and wrong.we disagree.
the only issue in this case was diekhoff state of mind whether he appreciated the wrongfulness of kidnapping wagner.and the evidence presented by the government bore directly on this issue.specifically,it tended to show that diekhoff was aware of the wrongfulness of his behavior.see united states ewing,cir a defendant knowledge that his conduct was illegal may be taken into account when determining his ability to appreciate its wrongfulness.see also united states ruster,cir.the fact that diekhoff had committed a similar kidnapping offense in the past made it more likely that he understood that the activity underlying the charged offense was wrong as well.see united states bradshaw.defining relevance.in addition,the prior conviction showed that he was mentally capable of planning a complicated criminal act.united states brown,cir.diekhoff ability to organize and orchestrate,was directly relevant to diekhoff alleged mental disease or defect.and the fact that he had executed a complicated kidnapping before made it more probable that he had an ability to awareness of the world surrounding him,belied insanity.he was free to argue that his mental state had deteriorated from the date of the last offense.but this does not preclude admissibility.
lastly,diekhoff argues that the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.we review the district court balancing of these factors below deferentially,asking only whether it abused its discretion.united states bramlet,cir.and because the court did not,we agree with its conclusion.the probity of his previous offense dovetails with the theories of relevance just discussed a prior criminal record for similar acts is highly relevant to the basis for and the reliability of witnesses testimony about the defendant appr
