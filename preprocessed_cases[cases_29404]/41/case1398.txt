background 
because this case is here on a grant of summary judgment for the defendants,we must review the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.squibb mem.med,cir.
freeburg community school district the district is a public school system located in clair county,illinois.the district is governed by a board of education school board.in march,its members included defendants john blomenkamp,tammy carpenter,steve lindauer,herschel parrish,dean salvatore,scott weber and richard trolard rob hawkins is the superintendent of the school district,and he is responsible for overseeing the functions and performance of all the district employees.hawkins makes recommendations to the school board regarding the selection and dismissal of employees however,all final employment decisions are within the province of the school board.
lewis began working for the district as a bookkeeper and treasurer in september.she was responsible for maintaining all financial accounts and records preparing payroll,tax returns and other required state financial reports paying bills monthly preparing monthly cafeteria reports and financial reports and otherwise assisting the superintendent.all parties agree that lewis performed her job admirably until.
the year,however,was a truly terrible year for lewis.both of her parents became terminally ill,and lewis attempted to care for them at home.her father died at home on may,and in a tragic sequence of events,five other family members or close friends passed away that year.on may,her mother came home from the hospital and needed constant care.lewis thereafter often missed work to care for her mother at home.hawkins,her immediate supervisor,was aware that lewis was taking time off from work in order to care for her ailing parents,and he gave her permission to do so.in the fiscal year lewis was absent a total of out of a possible workdays.
during this time,with the encouragement of hawkins,lewis took much of her bookkeeping work home with her and worked whenever she could,including in the evenings or on weekends.she was able to get much of the bookkeeping work done that way.according to hawkins,however,her schedule began to be a problem for the school district because other employees were forced to alter their schedules to cover for lewis,and she was not available during regular work hours to answer questions from employees or vendors.
on june,the school board met in a closed session to discuss employee salaries.although the meeting was closed to the public,it was tape recorded in compliance with the requirements of the illinois open meetings act,ilcs a.in the meeting,hawkins proposed that lewis be given a small raise,but he also informed the board that she had been absent days so far that year.he explained some of the hardships caused to the district by her absences lewis had failed to produce a cafeteria report for a number of months,and hawkins had been forced to make a list of priorities and pay some of the district bills himself.he also remarked that the office did not function as smoothly without lewis there to help answer phones and dispose of mail,and he lamented that she was unavailable for vendor calls.at that time,a number of board members expressed the view that they ought to start looking for a new bookkeeper,but hawkins dissuaded them.
that same day,however,hawkins sent lewis a letter advising her that she should resume a regular to work schedule by the start of the next school year.the letter identified the aspects of her job that required her attendance during normal business hours assisting with covering the office during lunch breaks,assisting with answering the phone,being available for teachers,staff,and himself for information,and being available for vendors when they call with questions.
nevertheless,in september,lewis missed of days of work in october she missed of.at the school board october meeting,hawkins again made mention of the inconveniences caused by lewis large number of absences he also described a number of performance problems that he claimed were unrelated to her absences.specifically,he noted that the district tax payments to the irs had been late,resulting in a penalty although lewis ultimately had been able to get it waived the district had been denied credit from verizon due to a blemish on its credit check the completion report had not been filed a number of cafeteria reports had not been completed other bills were not being paid timely and lewis had not compiled her own attendance report.he also mentioned that her office was a mess.at least one board member expressed the view that she should be fired for absenteeism and poor performance.hawkins,however,informed the board that the district faced potential legal liability under the fmla accordingly,he suggested that lewis be approached and offered official fmla leave instead.the board gave its approval,and on november,hawkins sent a letter to lewis,informing her that her paid sick leave and vacation time had run out but that she was entitled to take up to weeks of unpaid leave under the fmla.
lewis completed the necessary paperwork and,at the direction of hawkins,subsequently began taking intermittent fmla leave.lewis and hawkins established a procedure by which she would call the office whenever she needed to take leave and inform hawkins that she was going to be absent that day.she simply was required to specify that her absence was for fmla reasons,and her absence would then be excused,though unpaid.
during the time that she was taking intermittent fmla leave,however,lewis still was asked to perform all of the functions of a bookkeeper.she was able,to some extent,to determine her own schedule,but she continued to do much of the district bookkeeping work at her home and on weekends in order to ensure that necessary tasks were completed.she never was credited for her time spent working at home,however,and she was not paid for the days on which she took fmla leave.the school board was well aware of this practice in fact,hawkins even commented to the board that lewis actually was helping the budget because she,uh,already being docked because she exhausted all of her sick days,she been gone for all of her vacation days,her bereavement day and her personal day and she in the hole,ex.at.despite the alleged difficulties caused by her absences,however,the district never sought any help for the bookkeeper position during the period in which lewis was taking intermittent leave.
throughout,the school board continued to discuss lewis and the problems caused by her absences.on november,in another meeting,a number of board members expressed the opinion that they would like to fire lewis however,they were concerned about their potential legal liability under the fmla.hawkins confirmed their fears,stating that we do have anything,it all too soft to do anything about her in terms of performance i f she did have the fmla issue it would be easier for me to do something id.at.the board members responded by discussing the fmla with disdain,noting that it was just ludicrous,id.at,and it such a fiasco that you ca just say thank you for your services,goodbye,because of fmla and bill clinton.id.at.hawkins was encouraged to continue documenting any problems in order to build a case against lewis that was unrelated to her absences.id.at.
on march,lewis received her first and only performance review from hawkins.the review form contained three potential rankings very good,satisfactory and needs improvement.lewis received two rankings of very good,seven rankings of satisfactory and four rankings of needs improvement,ex.jj.the areas that needed improvement were works in a manner that promotes safety,cleanliness and efficiency demonstrates pride in work by performing tasks neatly and accurately shows punctuality and has excellent attendance and demonstrates professionalism through appropriate dress,language,and interactions.id.in the comments section adjacent to the pride in work category,hawkins noted this was not a problem previously.it has become an issue the past mo nths with the reduced hour week.while i believe lewis still takes pride in her work,time constraints have caused problems.id.additionally,at the bottom of the form,he wrote 
deb,most of the items that are satisfactory or needs improvement are a direct result of your reduced hour schedule.as i have mentioned many times when we discuss this,i understand your commitment to taking care of your parents.i also understand you are doing what you can to prioritize so that crucial deadlines are not missed.unfortunately,as i told you,you can not continue as you are and be effective in all arenas.i understand your personal dilemma.i have tried to balance that with the needs of the district.rob.
on march,the school board again met in a closed session and discussed lewis.although state law requires that closed sessions of school board meetings be tape recorded,the first minutes of the,the portion of the meeting in which lewis was missing from the meeting recording.two conflicting explanations for the missing segment of tape exist in the record one note,signed by hawkins,states that the machine had malfunctioned,and another unsigned note states that the operator had believed that the machine was running from the beginning of the session,but later had realized that it was not and began recording.the written minutes of the meeting reflect only that hawkins recommended that lewis be replaced as bookkeeper.the minutes do not state whether a vote of the board was taken,although each board member has signed a sworn statement that the board voted at this meeting to replace lewis as bookkeeper.
the district ultimately decided to offer lewis two options either resignation,with paid insurance for the rest of the school year,or reassignment to a teacher assistant position,paid her current salary and benefits for the few months remaining in that fiscal year,but paid at the much lower teacher assistant salary thereafter.hawkins testified in his deposition that the reassignment,if accepted,was not intended to be was decided at the march meeting that her demotion would be permanent.
on march,hawkins sent a letter to lewis on behalf of the district,informing her of the school board decision to remove her from her position as bookkeeper.the letter offered only one reason for her replacement it was determined that you miss too much work to meet the essential functions of your present assignment,ex.mm.the letter then explained her choice between resignation or permanent reassignment to a lower position.hawkins met with lewis the next day to explain further her options and to help her clean out her office.at that time,according to lewis,hawkins provided his own explanation for the district actions he told her that the board did have any idea how much time she was missing and they voted to fire her,ex.c at see also id.at.
lewis husband,an attorney,thereafter wrote an to hawkins,suggesting that the district actions were in violation of lewis rights under the fmla.hawkins referred the to the district counsel,defendant shane jones.jones responded in a letter to lewis,stating that the district has determined that lewis performance in the bookkeeper job assignment is not satisfactory,and thus its decision not to reappoint her to her position as bookkeeper for the following year was unrelated to her fmla leave,ex.
lewis requested reinstatement to her position as bookkeeper in august.hawkins and jones authored a letter in which they denied her request for reinstatement,citing performance problems that had been discovered after she had been reassigned.these alleged performance problems included newly discovered late payments,overpayments,and checks that had been neither deposited nor voided.
after her request for reinstatement was denied,lewis filed suit against the district,the individual members of the school board,hawkins,and attorney shane jones.her complaint alleged violations of the fmla,breach of contract,defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.in response,the defendants suggested that lewis had been replaced,not because of her absenteeism,but because of issues.
on june,the district court dismissed the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against jones.on september,the court entered summary judgment in his favor on the defamation claim as well.lewis filed a motion to reconsider,which was denied.on november,the district court entered summary judgment on all remaining counts in favor of all remaining defendants.it concluded that the record was replete with evidence of lewis poor performance as bookkeeper and that lewis had not presented evidence of retaliation,under either the direct or indirect method of proof,sufficient to establish an issue of triable fact.lewis timely appealed the judgment of the district court.
discussiona.
we first address a procedural issue raised by lewis.she initially filed suit in state court on september,and served all but one of the defendants with process on the same date.the defendants filed a notice of removal on october.under federal rule of civil procedure c a defendant has five days from the filing of the petition for removal in which to file an answer in the district court.accounting for an intervening weekend,november was therefore the last day for the defendants to file an answer,absent an extension of time.the defendants,however,filed their answer on november.lewis moved to strike their answer as untimely,but her motion was denied.she now submits that the district court erred by considering the defendants answer.
the defendants contend that their answer was not untimely because federal rule of civil procedure e,read in conjunction with the local electronic filing rules,entitled them to an additional three days to file.rule e allows a party additional time to file an answer whenever that party is served by a method other than personal service.at the time that the defendants filed their answer,rule e stated 
whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party under rule b b,or c,or d,days shall be added to the prescribed period.
similarly,the local filing rules provide pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e whenever something is served electronically,three days are added to the prescribed response period.local electronic filing rule.the defendants here filed and served their notice of removal electronically,an act that they contend entitled them to an additional three days to file their answer under rule e and local rule.
the magistrate judge determined that the defendants were entitled to an additional three days beyond the five days provided for in rule in which to file an answer.lewis objected.relying on the plain wording of the rule,she contends that,because the defendants themselves had filed the notice of removal,their right to file an answer in federal court was not triggered by any electronic service upon them.therefore,rule e did not apply.the district court,however,agreed with the magistrate judge.it concluded 
the plaintiff asserts that only the plaintiff gets an additional three days to respond,not the defendants because they were the party serving the answer.however,the plaintiff appears to overlook the fact that the defendants were also served with the complaint,thereby triggering their right to file an answer,and under the federal rules giving them an additional three days in which to file.
we can not agree with the district court interpretation of the rules.the defendants indeed were served with the complaint in state court however,that service can not be seen as the triggering event here.if it were,then the defendants filing certainly was untimely because rule c requires an answer to be filed within days of service.instead,the defendants own electronic filing of the notice of removal was the event that triggered their right to file an answer in federal court within five days of removal.c.additionally,service of the complaint here was achieved through personal service therefore,if the district court was correct in considering that service to be the basis for the defendants right to file an answer,rule e certainly would not have applied.in this case,the only event that potentially could have triggered the application of rule e was the defendants own electronic filing of the notice of removal.
permitting a party extra time to file an answer because of his own electronic filing finds no support in the plain wording of the rule.rule e grants a party an extension of time to respond only after the service of a notice or other paper upon the party by a method other than personal service.e emphasis added.this extension does not appear to apply to actions taken by a party after the service of a notice or other paper by that party.in our view,a facial reading of the rules makes clear that the defendants here were not entitled to an additional three days under rule e,and therefore their answer was filed untimely.
nevertheless,a district court has the discretion to permit the defendants to file their answer late when the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.b.a finding of excusable neglect is not limited to situations where the failure to timely file is due to circumstances beyond the control of the filer,pioneer inv.servs.brunswick,d,but extends to some cases in which the delay is caused by inadvertence,mistake,or carelessness.id.at.we have cautioned,however,that a simple case of miscalculation of a deadline generally is not a sufficient reason to extend time.marquez mineta,cir quotation marks omitted but see crue aiken,cir upholding a district court grant of an extension based on excusable neglect when an attorney simply miscalculated a filing period by one day.because the district court here determined that the defendants had timely filed their answer,however,it did not reach explicitly the question of whether the defendants failure to timely file was the result of excusable neglect.
lewis relies on language in our decision in prizevoits indiana bell telephone,cir,for the proposition that the excusable neglect standard can never be met by a showing of inability or refusal to read and comprehend the plain language of the federal rules.we believe,however,that this proposition can not control the situation now before us.in prizevoits,we distinguished between an inexplicable failure to read the rules and plausible misinterpretations of ambiguous rules.id.at.in prizevoits,the rule was crystal clear and the attorney error egregious and inexplicable.id.here,by contrast,we have a plausible misinterpretation of a procedural misinterpretation based on a reading so plausible that both the magistrate judge and the district judge made the same misinterpretation.lorenzen employees ret.plan of the sperry hutchinson,cir holding that delay based on a good faith and plausible misconstruction of the law may warrant a finding of excusable neglect.
the supreme court has concluded that the determination of excusable neglect is at bottom an equitable one,taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party omission.pioneer,at.the factors to consider include the danger of prejudice,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,and whether the movant had acted in good faith.id.here,there is no reason to believe that lewis was at all prejudiced by the defendants answer being filed two days late.the length of the delay and the potential impact on judicial proceedings was minimal,and there is no reason to believe that the defendants acted in bad faith.because the tardy filing was a result of excusable neglect,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied lewis motion to strike the defendants answer.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.rudin lincoln land cmty,cir.summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also anderson liberty lobby,d celotex catrett,d.when reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we view all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and we draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.id.
the fmla establishes two categories of protections for employees.first,the act provides eligible employees the right to take unpaid leave for a period of up to twelve work weeks in any period because of a serious health condition,including the serious health condition of a family member.king preferred technical group,cir.after the period of qualified leave expires and the employee returns to work,she is entitled to be reinstated to her former position or to an equivalent position with the same benefits and terms of employment.a.the fmla makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under the act.a 
in addition to the substantive guarantees contemplated by the act,the fmla also affords employees protection in the event that they are retaliated against because of their choice to exercise their rights under the act.king,at citing a.specifically,a n employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees who have used fmla leave.id.citing c.on appeal,lewis does not allege that the defendants interfered with her substantive rights under the fmla she contends only that she was retaliated against for taking leave.
a plaintiff can avert summary judgment on an fmla retaliation claim either by proffering direct or circumstantial evidence of her employer discriminatory motivation,or by establishing that,after taking fmla leave,she was treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees who did not take fmla leave,even though s he was performing her job in a satisfactory manner.burnett lfw,cir.the first of these methods of evidence of a retaliatory referred to as the direct method.the second method of her treatment to that of a similarly situated called the indirect method.
lewis has proceeded under the direct method of proof.a plaintiff proceeding according to this direct method of proof can survive summary judgment by creating a triable issue of whether the adverse employment action of which she complains had a discriminatory motivation.rudin,at internal citations,alterations and quotation marks omitted.lewis need not prove that retaliation was the only reason for her termination she may establish an fmla retaliation claim by showing that the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer decision.culver gorman,cir.a motivating factor does not amount to a factor or to the only factor,but is rather a factor that motivated the defendant actions.id.quoting spiegla hull,cir.
lewis may use two types of evidence to prove that her employer acted with a discriminatory motivation direct evidence or circumstantial evidence.rudin,at.direct evidence is evidence which if believed by the trier of fact will prove the fact in question without reliance upon inference or presumption.id.at quotations omitted.direct evidence generally involves an admission or a statement by the decision maker regarding his discriminatory intent.circumstantial evidence allows the trier of fact to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.id.direct evidence is not required under the direct method of proof circumstantial evidence that suggests discrimination,albeit through a longer chain of inferences,is sufficient.lewis city of chicago,cir.in this case,however,lewis has presented both direct and circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory motive sufficient to avert summary judgment under the direct method of proof.
the most prominent direct evidence proffered by lewis is hawkins letter informing her of the district decision to replace her as bookkeeper.the letter offered only one justification for the district action it was determined that you miss too much work to meet the essential functions of your present assignment,ex.mm.furthermore,according to lewis sworn affidavit,hawkins explicitly told her that the school board had decided to demote her because of her absenteeism.these statements,made by the district superintendent on behalf of the district itself,are,when read in context,direct evidence of an impermissible motivation for her loss of the bookkeeper position.
lewis has presented circumstantial evidence of an impermissible motivation as well.before her fmla leave,during her fmla leave and at the time of her termination,the actions of the school board and of the superintendent cast doubt on their claim that her removal from the bookkeeper position was for incompetence.
first,the conduct of the school board and the superintendent during the period before lewis was placed on fmla leave raises the permissible inference that,while fully cognizant of their obligations to lewis under the fmla,they decided not to inform her of those rights and place her on fmla leave,but instead to build a case for her discharge on the ground of incompetence.moreover,the record reveals that,in a meeting at which lewis situation was discussed,the school board members referred to the requirements of fmla with disdain.they described the act requirements as just ludicrous and a fiasco,ex.at.indeed,it was at that same meeting that the board members instructed hawkins to document everything in an attempt to build a case against lewis based on her performance 
the actions of the school board and the superintendent during lewis period of fmla leave also raise serious questions about their reason for discharging her.there is evidence that,although the district was aware that certain bookkeeper functions were not being completed adequately while lewis was taking intermittent fmla leave,it made no effort to take adequate steps to assuage the impact of her intermittent leave on the district operations.a reasonable jury could conclude that the district,instead of taking such steps,expected lewis to complete all of the duties of a bookkeeper while she was working and being paid on an essentially basis.arguably,when her periods of intermittent leave prevented her from timely completing all of the duties she had performed as a bookkeeper,she was removed from her position.viewed in this way,a reasonable jury could find that the fmla leave granted to lewis was illusory.if the jury were to take this view of the evidence,the performance problems noted by the district court could not provide a permissible justification for an adverse employment action the problems would be,under such circumstances,the direct result of lewis exercise of her fmla rights.the jury could conclude that the school district had numerous options consistent with the mandates of the fmla that did not require it to maintain the problematic status quo.it could have shifted some of the bookkeeper job duties to other employees during the time that lewis was taking fmla leave.it could have hired help for the bookkeeper position.it also could have transferred lewis to another position such as a teacher assistant position temporarily if she was unable to fulfill the essential functions of her job while taking intermittent fmla leave.b the district declined to exercise any of these options.in short,we believe that a jury would be entitled to conclude that the school board and the superintendent held lewis to the unrealistic expectation that she should accomplish satisfactorily all of the duties of the bookkeeper position during her period of intermittent leave.the imposition of such unrealistic expectations,if accepted by the jury,would be relevant and probative evidence of a retaliatory intent.
finally,we believe that a reasonable jury could conclude that the actions of the district at the time of her dismissal from the bookkeeper position provide circumstantial proof of retaliatory motive.in addition to the evidence that she was demoted permanently during the time period in which she was taking intermittent fmla leave,lewis also produced evidence that the school board had failed to follow its own procedures in demoting her a circumstance that,if true,could suggest a discriminatory motivation.see rudin,at.additionally,she presented evidence that the board may have tampered with audio recordings of meetings at which her employment was discussed,evidence that we have considered to be probative of pretext or improper motivation on other occasions.see ogborn united food commercial workers union,cir noting that evidence of tampering may be evidence of pretext,although ultimately denying the claim on other grounds.in the aggregate,such direct and circumstantial evidence is sufficient under the direct method of proof to survive summary judgment on her fmla claim.
the district court took the view that the record contained ample evidence of problems that justified lewis discharge on the ground of incompetence rather than in retaliation for taking leave.in the court view,she was replaced because she was not performing adequately the duties of a bookkeeper.indeed,it listed a significant number of errors that,in its view,were unrelated to her absenteeism a trier of fact ultimately might reach the same conclusion as the district court.however,the evidence presented by lewis casts sufficient doubt upon the district and the superintendent motives to make summary judgment an impermissible vehicle for the resolution of this case.hawkins admitted in his deposition that,before lewis took time off to care for her ailing parents,her performance had been satisfactory.he told the school board about lewis performance problems only after she began taking time off to care for her ailing parents,and his complaints were based largely on the fact that lewis was not in the office to cover general office duties,answer phone calls or address questions from vendors or employees.a trier of fact could find that these problems,along with sporadic late payments,paycheck discrepancies and other problems cited by the district court,were not performance problems that permissibly could be attributed to lewis,but rather were a direct result of the district failure to respond appropriately to the challenges presented by her absences.indeed,hawkins noted in lewis performance evaluation that m ost of the items that are satisfactory or needs improvement are a direct result of your reduced hour schedule,ex.jj 
the district apparent decision to hold lewis to the standard of a employee during the time that she was taking fmla leave,in conjunction with its failure timely to inform lewis of her rights under the fmla,the school board members expressed hostility towards the act,and the other direct and circumstantial evidence presented by lewis casts doubt on the district proffered justification for its decision to replace lewis as bookkeeper.accordingly,whether the school board decided to replace lewis at least in part because she had inconvenienced the district by missing too many days of work under the fmla,or whether the decision was based only on the fact that it felt that she was not a very good bookkeeper,is a question of fact that must be decided by a jury under these circumstances,we believe that the district court should have left to the jury the question of whether lewis job performance,unrelated to the impact of her absenteeism,justified her removal from the bookkeeper position.
after lewis was informed of the district decision to replace her as bookkeeper,her husband and attorney,david lewis,wrote an to hawkins stating that the district actions were in violation of the fmla.hawkins forwarded the letter to the district attorney,shane jones.in response to this allegation,jones informed lewis that the district
