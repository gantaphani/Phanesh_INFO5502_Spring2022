this is an appeal from a jury verdict rendered against jorge zamora and his clinics for sex discrimination and retaliation against four female employees.we affirm the judgments for three appellees but reverse for insufficient evidence to support noelia galvan quid pro quo claim.
jorge zamora owns and operates an osteoporosis and arthritis practice consisting of two clinics.four former employees,thelma alaniz,galvan,mary tipton,and angelica solis,brought title vii sexual harassment claims against zamora and the clinics.
alaniz worked as a receptionist at one of the clinics.she alleged that zamora sexually harassed her on many occasions he frequently asked her out,forced her to dance with him,and when learning she was pregnant,asked whether her husband gave her the chocolate.zamora would also call her to his office for private meetings where he would sit next to her and caress her hand while looking into her eyes and asking if she was afraid of him.
alaniz also alleged that zamora and her supervisor,roberto silva,consistently harassed her.among other behaviors,silva inappropriately stared at parts of alaniz body,repeatedly called her mamacita,and suggested that she wear more revealing clothing.
zamora conduct worsened after alaniz returned from maternity leave.on one occasion,he told her she was looking pretty good and not to get pregnant again.he also called her repeatedly to ask what color underwear she was wearing and during meetings in his office,zamora would sometimes rub her thighs and knees.despite alaniz repeated complaints to the office manager,zamora behavior continued.on one occasion,when alaniz went into his office,zamora grabbed her around the waist and kissed her on the lips.
zamora then informed alaniz that there were some problems with her performance but that she could keep her job if she had a sexual relationship with him.alaniz refused and submitted a written complaint to galvan,the human resources hr manager.several days later,she initiated a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.
after alaniz missed a mandatory work meeting,zamora instructed galvan to issue alaniz a written reprimand.however,before the reprimand could be given and after zamora was informed of the eeoc complaint,he instructed galvan to terminate alaniz.zamora claims alaniz was fired for missing the meeting,poor performance and attendance,conflicts with other employees,and recruiting witnesses for a lawsuit during business hours.
galvan was initially hired as hr manager but she claims,and zamora disputes,that after alaniz termination she became an office administrator.on one occasion,galvan met with zamora in his office,and he began the meeting by asking her to sit on his lap.when she refused,he explained she could make more money if she engaged in a sexual relationship with him.zamora then inquired about galvan marriage and whether she found zamora attractive or frightening.ultimately,galvan started crying.
the next day,zamora announced that another individual would be assuming the position of office administrator,thus stripping galvan of any responsibilities she may have had in that capacity.galvan salary,benefits,and role as hr manager were unchanged.the following workday,zamora reprimanded galvan for some performance problems.the next day,he called her into his office where he informed her,in front of the office manager and the new administrator,that he was disappointed with her performance.zamora then instructed galvan to relinquish all of her remaining responsibilities and explained that he would take a couple of weeks to determine whether he would continue to employ her.galvan resigned the following day.
six months after galvan resignation,zamora hired tipton to serve as office manager.tipton alleges that within the first week of starting her employment,zamora gave her a hug that involved running his hands up and down her back and pushing his chest and pelvis up against hers.although tipton struggled to free herself,zamora did not release her from his embrace and whispered that he knew that she would do a good job.on another occasion,zamora tried to kiss tipton on the lips.while in daily meetings,zamora would caress tipton hand and smell her hair,noting that it smelled really good.zamora would also frequently ask what tipton intended to wear the next day while biting his lower lip,invite her dancing,call her chiquita,compliment her body,and tell her that she should wear short skirts.
on one occasion,zamora informed tipton she could have anything she wanted,depending on how loyal and good she was.another incident involved zamora urinating in his private bathroom with the door open while tipton was in his office and reassuring her there was no reason to come back later because he was not going to do anything.further,while working late with tipton,zamora would inquire whether her husband was a jealous man because,as he explained,zamora was a handsome man who intimidated others.
on one occasion,zamora told tipton to reprimand another female employee.this employee,in turn,reported to tipton that zamora had sexually harassed her and that he was issuing the reprimand in retaliation.tipton investigated these allegations and eventually reported them to zamora,who denied the allegations and became upset about being confronted,questioning why tipton took the allegations seriously.tipton responded that she too felt sexually harassed by him in a similar manner,and at that time tipton asked the hr manager to record an official sexual harassment complaint.
a few days later,zamora called tipton a sexual harassment spy at a staff meeting and warned other employees to remember that they were in the presence of an american woman.according to tipton,zamora then assigned her two tasks with impossible deadlines that she failed to complete,resulting in a reprimand.the next day,zamora told tipton to take a few days off of work and maybe look for a new job.zamora then promoted solis,who was hired two days prior as zamora executive secretary,to office manager of one of the clinics.
the next morning,zamora,who was meeting with several female employees who had filed sexual harassment complaints,scheduled a meeting with tipton.during this meeting,however,zamora told tipton that zamora requested that she leave the clinic and that the police were called to escort her.zamora and tipton agree that she was effectively fired at this time.
solis also alleges that during private meetings,zamora would place his hand over hers and caress it,while telling her not to be afraid.he also often inquired about her boyfriend.on one occasion,zamora hugged her tightly and kissed her on the lips.another time,zamora offered solis a luxurious apartment,so that he could stay there with her whenever he was in town.
on one occasion,solis asked to speak to zamora regarding problems involving another female employee.as zamora was on his way to south padre island,he suggested that solis drive him there so they could talk on the way.during the trip,zamora would caress solis hand when she placed it on the gear shifter and told her he would cancel plans with his family to be with her.he also asked to stop at her apartment.when solis said no,zamora proposed they go to a hotel.solis again declined and explained that she was only interested in a professional relationship.in response,zamora inquired why solis could not be extra nice to him like some other female employees,but angrily agreed to treat her as any other employee in the future.
solis alleged that after this incident,zamora began unjustifiably reprimanding her.a month later,she was sent to a office manager training at another clinic.her salary was unchanged.during this training period,solis was told that zamora did not want her at the office.on october,zamora eliminated the position of office manager and made solis a marketing representative,again with salary and benefits unchanged.considering this a demotion,on october,solis filed a written sexual harassment complaint.the next day,zamora fired solis for allegedly stealing money and pharmaceuticals.
alaniz and galvan brought hostile work environment,quid pro quo,and retaliation claims against zamora.tipton and solis later intervened.alaniz,tipton,and solis submitted all three claims to the jury,while galvan submitted only her quid pro quo claim.the jury found zamora liable on all claims,awarding past compensatory and punitive damages additionally,the jury awarded alaniz,tipton,and solis backpay damages.zamora now appeals.
zamora first challenges the district court denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol and his motion for a new trial.he asserts that the evidence does not support the verdict as to any of the appellees quid pro quo claims nor tipton and solis hostile work environment claims.zamora does not challenge the verdict as to the retaliation claims and alaniz hostile work environment claim.
we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo and in accordance with the standards applied by the district court.jmol is proper when a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.
we review a district court denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion but,o ur review is particularly limited when the trial court has denied a motion for a new trial.furthermore,
i n such cases,all the factors that govern our review of the trial court decision favor affirmance,and we must affirm the verdict unless the in the light most favorable to the jury so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary conclusion 
zamora challenges the sufficiency of evidence supporting tipton and solis hostile work environment claims.a workplace environment is hostile when it is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment.however,not all harassment,including simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious,will affect a term,condition,or privilege of employment.to be actionable,the working environment must be objectively hostile or abusive whether an environment is hostile or abusive depends on the totality of the circumstances,including factors such as the frequency of the conduct,its severity,the degree to which the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating,and the degree to which the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.
given the nature of the inquiry,our prior holdings in this context are instructive.in shepherd comptroller of public accounts,we determined that the plaintiff could not withstand summary judgment on her hostile work environment claim where a male told shepherd that her elbows were the same color as her nipples told her that she had big thighs while simulating looking under her dress on several occasions attempted to look down her clothing often rubbed his hand from her shoulder to her wrist and twice patted his lap to indicate where she should sit but,shepherd also testified that the never propositioned her or asked her out,and that apart from the above instances the two had a friendly relationship at,as well as outside of,work further,the conduct that shepherd complained of took place over a period of almost two years we held that this conduct did not rise to the level of a title vii violation,noting in particular the infrequency of the conduct that the comments,although boorish and offensive,were not severe that shepherd was never physically threatened and that the conduct did not interfere unreasonably with work performance 
on the other hand,in horizon health care,we upheld a jury verdict granting relief on the plaintiff hostile work environment claim in,the plaintiff boss made offensive comments two to three times a week,often in front of other the comments centered around the plaintiff alleged proclivity to engage in sexual activity the boss would comment that he knew what she liked to do and would often inquire whether she had got ten any the night before he also joked that the plaintiff does know how to use condoms,and in another instance made very crude sexual remarks about the smell emanating from her office we focused on the frequency and crudeness of the remarks,as well as the frequent inquiries about the plaintiff sexual activity,and determined that this conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile work environment,even without evidence of propositioning or inappropriate touching 
in light of these holdings,we conclude that the facts are legally sufficient to support tipton and solis hostile work environment claims.unlike in shepherd,zamora repeatedly asked tipton out,propositioned her,and commented on her physical appearance and dress.moreover,this conduct occurred over only days this frequency of harassment is similar to,where comments occurred two to three times a week.moreover,the record contains evidence of repeated bodily contact.
in regard to solis,zamora harassment was worse than that involved in and far worse than that in shepherd.zamora initiated unwanted and inappropriate contact and directly propositioned solis on multiple occasions.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying jmol or abuse its discretion by denying zamora a new trial on these claims.
zamora also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on all of the appellees quid pro quo claims.to establish a title vii quid pro quo claim,a plaintiff must show that the acceptance or rejection of a supervisor alleged sexual harassment resulted in a tangible employment action.a tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.in addition,a plaintiff must show a causal nexus between the acceptance or rejection of the sexual advances and the tangible employment action.
this sufficiency claim only has a material effect on the judgment as to galvan,who asserted only quid pro quo harassment by zamora.this claim is not supported by sufficient evidence since she has not demonstrated that she suffered a tangible employment action.even assuming that galvan did at one time hold the office administrator position,her reassignment to hr manager does not constitute a tangible employment action.galvan salary,benefits,and hr duties remained unchanged,and she has not demonstrated that the administrator position was objectively superior so that her reassignment could be considered a demotion.
zamora placement of galvan on a paid probationary period similarly does not rise to the level of tangible employment action.the action was not an ultimate employment decision,and it did not result in a significant change in benefits.and although galvan eventually quit because she believed that she would be terminated,there is no evidence that her employment responsibilities were permanently altered prior to her departure 
with respect to alaniz,tipton,and solis,whether legally sufficient evidence supports their quid pro quo claims is irrelevant,because zamora has not challenged his liability for retaliation,and their claims for sexual harassment are fully supported.nevertheless,zamora argues that if we find the evidence insufficient to support the verdict on any of these three appellees claims,a new trial on damages would be necessary because the jury was not asked to apportion damages among the different theories of liability.he claims that it is impossible to parse the amount of damages awarded for each claim if certain verdicts are overturned.
zamora cites cases where a new trial was necessary because we could not tell how the jury ruled on a general verdict encompassing different theories of liability,not because the jury failed to apportion damages among various claims,each framed by a specific interrogatory in this case,the jury verdict on each theory of liability was clear.a new trial on damages is not necessary since,irrespective of the quid pro quo claims,the verdict for retaliation constitutes a predicate for backpay and the verdicts for retaliation and harassment support the other damages awards 
zamora also argues that the district court committed numerous errors that denied him a fair trial by allowing all four appellees to present their claims in a single trial admitting hearsay and me too evidence charging the jury with inconsistent questions allowing appellees attorney to proceed with an improper closing argument and allowing punitive damages to be awarded partially based on harm allegedly caused to.
the district court denied zamora motion for separate trials pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.zamora argues that this resulted in unfair prejudice because it allowed four different plaintiffs with discrete,unique,individualized and independent claims to bolster each other cases by presenting irrelevant evidence and unrelated allegations.
a district court denial of a motion for separate trials is reviewed for abuse of discretion rule b provides that a district court may order separate trials to expedite and economize,for convenience,or to avoid prejudice whether to conduct separate trials under the rule is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court on the basis of circumstances of the litigation before it.while we acknowledge the potential for jury confusion in this case,we conclude that it was outweighed by considerations of judicial economy and that zamora suffered no real prejudice given the similarities between the cases involved.all of the appellees claims center on allegations of continuous sex discrimination involving the same modus operandi.further,appellees claims are based on a similar series of transactions that were committed by the same defendant over a relatively short time span.accordingly,each appellee claim and evidence presented was relevant to the others allegations,while prejudice to the defendant,if any,was minimal.at least one other circuit has held that separate trials were not necessary in similar circumstances the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying zamora rule b motion.
dovetailing with his previous claim,zamora argues that the district court failure to separate the trials allowed testifying about their own subvert federal rule of evidence b,which prohibits the introduction of evidence of other alleged acts of harassment to prove that the plaintiff was also harassed.zamora also objects to the testimony of two employees,angelica ruiz and mari adama,on these grounds.
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion the federal rules of evidence do not allow the introduction of character evidence evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts to show action in conformity therewith.but,evidence of prior bad acts is admissible for other purposes,including proof of intent,plan,motive,knowledge,and absence of mistake or accident this rule is equally applicable to discrimination cases 
evidence that zamora harassed other parties was admissible for purposes other than propensity.at trial,the appellees portrayed zamora as an intimidating boss with a particular modus operandi in making sexual overtures to female subordinates.this evidence is admissible to demonstrate either plan,motive,or absence of mistake.the testimony of the two employees,ruiz and adama,is admissible for similar reasons.
zamora also objects to the introduction of testimony regarding silva harassment.this evidence was admissible because zamora was sued in his capacity as an employer and appellees presented evidence that zamora continuously ignored complaints of silva harassment.notably,zamora does not raise on appeal any issues regarding a possible defense whether silva was in fact an employee or supervisor,or sufficiency of notice.
zamora asserts that even if this evidence was admissible under rule b,its admission violates federal rule of evidence because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice 
the evidence of zamora harassment of other parties was highly probative to demonstrating a systemic pattern of discrimination at the clinics and relevant to all appellees.accordingly,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion by weighing the relevant considerations and determining that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any potential of unfair prejudice 
zamora also objects to a number of evidentiary rulings on hearsay grounds.for instance,ricardo arrioja,a former employee of the hr department,testified to a account of silva harassment.he also testified to allegations of harassment of an unidentified party that he heard from yet another employee.in addition,appellees provided hearsay testimony about alleged harassment of former employees who did not testify at trial.
hearsay is not admissible if offered solely for the truth of the matter asserted unless it is defined as or falls within an exception a number of instances that zamora complains of,however,do not involve testimony that was offered to prove that zamora harassed other individuals.rather,it was offered to demonstrate that other individuals had filed harassment claims through proper channels but that no action was taken,or that an employee decision to investigate a harassment claim caused zamora to retaliate.these statements were admissible for these purposes 
but,the district court did erroneously admit hearsay of which involved multiple several other occasions.a district court abuses its discretion when it admits evidence based on an error of law however,because the harmless error doctrine applies,the district court decision will be affirmed unless a substantial right of the complaining party was affected.an error does not affect substantial rights if the court is sure,after reviewing the entire record,that the error did not influence the jury or had but a very slight effect on its verdict.
after a thorough review of the record,we can not conclude that the admitted hearsay testimony had more than a slight effect on the jury verdict.taken together,the improperly admitted testimony involved allegations of zamora harassment of four who did not testify at trial.however,six other witnesses testified that zamora had harassed them personally.in addition,a number of witnesses testified to events they thus had personal knowledge much of the hearsay testimony.accordingly,the district court error is not reversible.
zamora raises a number of issues related to the submitted jury questions.because zamora did not object in district court,we review for plain error reversal is appropriate if the error is plain,affects the appellant substantial rights,and seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings an error is plain if it is clear or obvious 
zamora asserts that it was plain error to submit both the hostile work environment and the quid pro quo claims to the jury.zamora relies on casiano which he argues clearly stands for the proposition that an employer may not be found liable on both theories of liability.casiano,however,never addressed this question it merely provided a framework for analyzing whether an employer can avail itself of the defense in that context,casiano stated that the threshold question is whether the employee suffered a tangible employment action,and based on the answer,the claim is classified as either a hostile work environment or a quid pro quo claim then,depending on how the claim is classified,the affirmative defense may or may not be available to the employer casiano said nothing about whether employers can be held liable on both theories of liability.
we need not resolve this question,particularly since any error in this regard is harmless.we note merely that the two theories of liability are not wholly inconsistent with one another.thus,the district court did not commit a clear and obvious error by submitting both questions to the jury.
zamora argues that the jury questions relating to the quid pro quo claims and retaliation claims were erroneous because they required the jury to find two sole causes of the appellees termination.the jury answered yes to both 
did plaintiff suffer an adverse employment action as a resu
