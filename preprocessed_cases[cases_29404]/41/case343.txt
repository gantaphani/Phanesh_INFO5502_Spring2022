petitioners service employees international,and its insurer,insurance company of the state of pennsylvania together,the employer,seek review of a final order of the benefits review board the board,an entity established within the office of respondent director,office of workers compensation programs,united states department of labor.in the petition for review,the employer challenges the award of compensation to jesse barrios under the defense base act for temporary total disability and temporary partial disability as a consequence of an eye condition sustained or aggravated during his employment in iraq.agreeing with the administrative law judge,the board concluded that the eye condition was related to barrios employment that the condition was disabling and that barrios was entitled to the maximum compensation rate in effect for for his temporary and total disability.
we confront for the first time the question of our jurisdiction to entertain petitions for review under the defense base act.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that we have such jurisdiction and deny review on the merits.
background 
barrios began working for service employees international,in iraq on october.his employer was under a contract with the united states army to provide support services for troops stationed in iraq.barrios was employed to drive a fuel tank truck and to deliver jet and diesel fuel and gasoline throughout iraq.in connection with his employment,barrios underwent a physical examination and completed a medical questionnaire in which he noted a history of burning,tearing,and redness of the eyes.in iraq,barrios worked an average of thirteen hours a day and seven days a week in hot,dry,dusty,and windy conditions.not long after his arrival in iraq,barrios found himself using significantly more eye drops than he had used prior to taking up his employment there.on november,his eye symptoms became so severe that he sought attention at a medical facility and complained of dry and itchy eyes that became more irritated while he was driving and tired.the facility referred barrios to the international clinic in kuwait,where he was examined on december,by abdussammad abdullah,consultant in ophthalmology.
according to his report,dated december,abdullah diagnosed barrios with m ild dry eye both eyes pterygium in both eyes.pterygium is defined as a triangular fleshy mass of thickened conjunctiva occurring usu ally at the inner side of the eyeball,covering part of the cornea,and causing a disturbance of vision.webster third new int l dictionary.abdullah specifically found bilateral pterygium at the nasal limbus encroaching about mm on to the cornea in the right eye and mm on the left eye.the pterygium in the right eye is showing degenerative changes barrios visual acuity was in od and in os.the retinal examination was within normal limits.the physician prescribed use of lubricant eye drops and protective sun glasses and pterygium excision in the right eye and concluded his report as follows the exact cause of pterygium is unknown,but is more common in people exposed to dry weather,chronic irritation of eyes and exposure to sunlight.
although barrios returned to his employment,he continued to complain of eye irritation and strain and expressed his desire to undergo the excision prescribed by abdullah.ultimately,his employer removed him from driving duties and returned him to the united states on medical leave for treatment of his pterygium,which the employer characterized as a illness.barrios departed iraq on december.on january,barrios consulted with charles mcmahon,an ophthalmologist in colorado springs,colorado.in his report of january,mcmahon essentially confirmed the diagnosis of abdullah,specifically noting that t he right pterygi um is larger than the left pterygi um and both are starting to threaten vision.he further noted that barrios had vision in each eye and that tear production appeared normal.he recommended having the pterygia removed with a conjunctival graft to prevent a recurrence of this same condition,proceeding with the right eye first and the left eye two to three months later.
with respect to the origins of barrios eye condition,mcmahon opined as follows 
dry eye syndrome is commonly associated with the development of pterygia.pterygia are caused by exposure to dry and dusty conditions and intense sunlight such as barrios experienced in iraq.in addition to environmental conditions an underlying genetic predilection seems to be necessary to develop these growths.if this were not the case pterygia would be much more common in people who live in desert climates.i suspect that jess e had the genetic trait for pterygia and it was brought out by his exposure to the environment in iraq.
at the employer request,barrios medical records were reviewed by charles garcia,an ophthalmologist in houston,texas.although garcia did not examine barrios,he accepted the diagnosis of the physicians who did examine him and gave an opinion as to the nature and source of the eye condition in a report dated august,
a pterygium is a fibrovascular growth and extends from the conjunctiva onto the cornea.the pterygium may cause change in visual acuity by distorting the cornea.while it is true that there is a higher incidence of pterygia in patients who are exposed to extreme sunlight over extended periods of time,as well as dry or irritating conditions,this normally is a situation caused by exposure for many years.barrios appears to have been employed in the middle east for approximately one year and i do not feel that the pterygia were caused by living in the middle east,though there is some possibility that they could have been made worse by chronic dryness and irritation.
barrios never underwent the excision procedure for pterygia and,in may,began employment as a gasoline truck driver for groendyke transport,in colorado.his claims for benefits for the period he was totally disabled from employment and for the losses suffered as the result of reduced earnings thereafter were controverted by the employer on the ground that his eye condition was not related to his employment in iraq.barrios therefore filed a claim for disability benefits under the provisions of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,as amended,et,and as extended by the defense base act,et.
by decision and order dated march,following a formal hearing,administrative law judge alj russell pulver of the united states department of labor issued a compensation order as follows that the employer pay to barrios compensation for temporary total disability from december,through may,based on an average weekly wage of,using a compensation rate of compensation for temporary partial disability commencing may,at the rate of per week all outstanding medical bills related to barrios disability plus reasonable and necessary medical care and treatment and interest on unpaid compensation payments from the date such payment became due until the actual date of payment.in a subsequent amending order,the alj determined that barrios compensation rate for temporary total disability was subject to a weekly maximum of,the rate in effect for fiscal year.
the employer appealed the decision and order awarding benefits,as amended,to the benefits review board,which affirmed the determination of the alj in all respects in an unpublished per curiam decision and order issued on december.specifically,the board affirm ed the alj conclusion that claimant established that his pterygia is related to his employment in iraq as it is supported by substantial evidence.the board noted that the alj credited the opinion of abdullah and mcmahon over that of garcia but observed that even garcia expressed some possibility that barrios pterygia was made worse by the chronic dryness and irritation encountered in iraq.
with respect to the employer challenge to the alj finding that barrios eye condition was not disabling because of a lack of medical evidence that he was disabled from working and because he actually obtained employment as a gas tank driver in colorado,the board referred to barrios uncontradicted testimony that employer refused to allow claimant to continue working in iraq after december,due to his eye condition on the basis that it jeopardized the safety of his.accordingly,the board found it established that claimant was totally disabled from december,to may,when he found lower paying employment in colorado,rendering the employer liable for the diminution in capacity a s claimant usual work was unavailable to him due to his work injury.finally,the board found that the alj properly found claimant compensation subject to the maximum compensation rate in effect for the fiscal year of.
of jurisdiction 
we first address the question of our jurisdiction over the petition filed in this court by the employer,recognizing the split in circuit authority as to whether the initial review of decisions of the benefits review board under the defense base act lies in the courts of appeals or in the district courts.compare pearce director,office of workers comp.programs,cir,and pearce director,office of workers comp.programs,cir holding that jurisdiction for direct judicial review under the act is in the circuit courts of appeals,with itt base servs.hickson,cir lee boeing,cir worldwide felkner,cir home indem.stillwell,cir holding that the courts of appeals lack such jurisdiction.for the reasons that follow,we side with the circuits that conclude that jurisdiction for direct review lies in the courts of appeals.
the defense base act dba was enacted in to establish a scheme of workers compensation for injuries sustained by employees in their employment by private employers on military bases or national defense projects outside the continental united states.see.to accomplish this purpose,congress extended the already existing provisions of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,enacted in,to provide workers compensation coverage for those engaged in maritime employment.see stillwell,at.the extension was accomplished by section of the dba,which reads as follows 
except as herein modified,the provisions of the longshore act,approved march,stat,as amended,shall apply in respect to the injury or death of any employee covered by the defense base act.
prior to its amendment in,b of the lhwca provided for initial review of administrative compensation orders in the federal district court for the judicial district in which the injury occurred.b.because injuries compensable under the dba occurred only in overseas locations and not within any judicial district in the united states,b of the dba included the following specific provision 
judicial proceedings provided under section and of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,in respect to a compensation order made pursuant to the dba shall be instituted in the united states d istrict c ourt of the judicial district wherein is located the office of the deputy commissioner whose compensation order is involved if his office is located in a judicial district,and if not so located,such judicial proceedings shall be instituted in the judicial district nearest the base at which the injury or death occurs.
in,congress enacted c of the lhwca in its current form,providing for initial review of compensation claims in a newly created administrative board the benefits review board and for judicial review in the courts of appeals any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the board may obtain a review of that order in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred.c.the legislation made no change in dba b,which continued to provide that judicial proceedings be conducted in accordance with the lhwca and in the district court.
we recognize that some of our sister circuits find no ambiguity in the unamended provision for judicial review under the dba.see,hickson,at reading the plain language of the dba,we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the instant petition for review.lee,at section b of the dba clearly and unambiguously provides that a party adversely affected by the administrative resolution of a dba claim must file a petition for review in the united states d istrict c ourt.stillwell,at section b of the dba is unambiguous and it clearly requires judicial proceedings to review a compensation order to be conducted in the united states d istrict c ourt.we disagree.we do not see b of the dba as a statute containing language having a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case such that further inquiry is unnecessary.robinson shell oil,d.
ambiguity is apparent on the face of the statute.read literally,b of the dba states judicial proceedings provided under section of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act which now provides for initial review in the courts of appeals shall be instituted in the united states d istrict c ourt.initial review obviously can not lie in both courts.just as obviously,judicial review in a dba case can not lie in a court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred,in accordance with the amendments to the lhwca,c,because the dba covers injuries sustained during employment in overseas bases.
as demonstrated by the foregoing,the test for ambiguity easily is met here by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson,at.in departing from the conclusions reached by our sister circuits that have found the jurisdictional provision unambiguous in vesting review jurisdiction under the dba in district courts,we agree with the circuits that have read the disputed provision as ambiguous and have interpreted it to vest jurisdiction in the courts of appeals.this divergence of opinion in the circuits also speaks to the ambiguity of the statute,since the divergence itself makes it difficult indeed to contend that the statutory language is unambiguous with regard to the point at issue here.see smiley citibank,d.
having identified ambiguity in the disputed language,it now falls to us to interpret the meaning of the jurisdictional provision at issue.
we can best reach the meaning here,as always,by recourse to the underlying purpose,and with that as a guide,by trying to project upon the specific occasion how we think persons,actuated by such a purpose,would have dealt with it,if it had been presented to them at the time.to say that that is a hazardous process is indeed a truism,but we can not escape it,once we abandon literal method far more unreliable.
borella borden,cir learned hand.more recently,we have stated where the language is ambiguous,we focus upon the broader context and primary purpose of the statute.castellano city of,cir quoting robinson,at.
the primary and underlying purpose for the enactment of the defense base act in was to extend the benefits of the existing federal workers compensation program governing maritime employees to those employed at military bases outside the united states.in the broader context,the idea was to establish a unified scheme applicable to both classes of employees.the intention that the dba track the provisions of the lhwca is manifest in the dba requirement that e xcept as herein modified,the provisions of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,as amended,shall apply in respect to the injury or death of any employee engaged in any covered employment.a.the only modification in the dba was made to account for the difference in overseas and domestic employment.initial judicial review under both statutes originally was by proceedings in the federal district in which the injury occurred.but in the case of the dba,it was necessary to add the provision for district court jurisdiction in the judicial district nearest the base at which the injury occurred.
it is significant to our analysis of purpose and context that b of the dba authorizes j udicial proceedings under sections and of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act in respect to a compensation order made pursuant to the dba.b.at the time of the enactment of the dba,the language designating district courts as the loci of initial judicial proceedings was superfluous,since of the lhwca,which b incorporated,already
