opinion of the court 
this case concerns donald benn involuntary commitment to a psychiatric facility for an emergency examination.after his release,benn brought federal and state claims against those involved in his commitment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants.we affirm.
prior to the events at issue here,donald benn was under the care of therapist jack hartke and psychiatrist lynn bornfriend,both of whom had treated him for depression and stress disorder.the treatment included medication.
on august,benn telephoned the horsham clinic horsham three times.horsham,a mental healthcare facility in montgomery county,pennsylvania,is wholly owned by universal health system,uhs.each time benn called horsham,he spoke to eileen wilcox,an experienced counselor.benn told wilcox that he was looking for treatment for stress disorder and was interested in horsham.benn admits that during one conversation he told wilcox that he was driving over the bridge.wilcox claims that benn told her he had stopped his car and had considered jumping off the bridge.benn denies this.wilcox told benn that horsham did not make regular outpatient appointments but that they would assess his need for care if he came in.
benn arrived at horsham late that evening and was quickly interviewed by psychiatrist ramesh eluri.the interview lasted minutes,and eluri claims that,during the interview,benn admitted to being depressed and suicidal.benn asserts that he never told eluri that he was suicidal and that eluri misunderstood him because of eluri poor english.after the interview,eluri told wilcox that he was concerned for benn safety and that a petition for involuntary commitment might be necessary because benn refused to seek treatment.benn,however,did agree to sign a contract for safety,which stated 
i,donald benn on august,agreed to keep myself safe and that if i feel any increase of suicidal thoughts or feeling i will contact horsham clinic or the police.below the contract,benn wrote while there is no doubt that my health has been greatly compromised i feel as certain as certain can be that a few more days wo hurt too much.
wilcox asked benn to remain at the clinic while eluri looked over the contract,but benn refused and left.
upon seeing the contract,eluri concern about benn safety grew,and he filed an application under a provision of pennsylvania mental health procedures act mhpa.stat.ann.a,requesting that benn be examined to determine his need for treatment.see app.the application stated 
benn said he had seriously thought about jumping from coney bridge sic,while he was driving.in fact,he stopped the car.he admits feeling suicidal now and feels unsafe and unstable.he also believes that his mental health is compromised and needs hospitalization.he also says he had suicidal thoughts consistently for the past few weeks.he is vague about his attempts in my assessment,pt.is very suicidal,feels unsafe and dangerous to himself.he needs inpatient treatment.
the petition was reviewed by the county administrator,who authorized the police to take benn into custody.the police went to benn home,and he was transported by ambulance to montgomery county emergency service mces,a private,psychiatric hospital in norristown,pennsylvania,that,by contract,handles all involuntary and emergency psychiatric confinements in the county.
upon arrival at mces,benn was placed in an isolated waiting room.he was then seen by stephen zerby,an mces psychiatrist,who conducted an interview and decided,based on the interview and eluri petition,that benn should be admitted for an emergency examination for the period permitted by the mhpa.stat.ann.d,not more than hours.app.the next day,august,benn was interviewed by mohammad quasim,another mces psychiatrist,who continued the treatment started by zerby.the following day,august,benn was seen by venu mukerjee,yet another mces psychiatrist,who found him to have limited insight and obvious difficulties with impulse control,where he might have verbalized suicidal intent while at horsham his insight is limited and his judgment is definitely impaired.app.on august,mukerjee noted that benn is now contracting for safety and has never been suicidal since his admission here.he was then released.app.
during his time at mces,benn was in contact with his wife,his treating therapist,a lawyer,and a friend.benn claims that his detention room had no toilet and that he was forced to urinate on the walls.
in december,benn filed this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against wilcox,eluri,horsham,uhs,mces,mukerjee,zerby,and quasim.benn asserted claims under for alleged violations of his procedural and substantive due process rights,as well as numerous tort claims under pennsylvania law,to wit,intentional infliction of emotional distress,assault and battery,negligence,and false imprisonment.in addition,benn sought punitive damages against all defendants.
the parties filed for summary judgment.in july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants.the court held that eluri,wilcox,horsham,and uhs were not state actors and thus could not be sued under.in addition,assuming for the sake of argument that mces,mukerjee,zerby,and quasim were state actors,the court held that they did not violate benn right to substantive or procedural due process.the court also granted summary judgment on the state tort claims for all parties except wilcox,because it found that these parties were immune from such claims under section of the mhpa.stat.ann.as for wilcox,the court found that there was no evidence against her to support the state tort claims.benn appealed.
we turn first to benn claim.section provides in relevant part 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress.
to establish a claim under,benn must show that the defendants were state actors who violated his rights under the constitution or federal law.flagg,brooks,d.
benn contends that horsham,uhs,eluri,and wilcox the horsham defendants were state actors because they were acting pursuant to the mhpa.under the mhpa,a physician or other responsible party may file an application that may lead to the issuance of a warrant authorizing a person who is severely mentally disabled and in need of immediate treatment to be taken to a designated facility for an emergency examination.stat.ann.a in addition,a physician or other person who has observed a person engaging in conduct that provides reasonable grounds to believe that the person is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment may take the person to an approved facility for such an examination.stat.ann.b.at the facility,the individual who brought the person thought to need treatment must make a written statement setting forth the grounds for believing the person to be in need of examination.stat.ann.a.a person taken to a facility must be examined within two hours,and if it is determined that the person is severely mentally disabled and in need of immediate treatment,the treatment must begin immediately.stat.ann.b.if it is determined at any time that the person is not in need of treatment,the person must be discharged,and in any event the person must be released within hours unless a certification for extended involuntary emergency treatment is filed under.stat.ann.in this case,the district court held that,because the horsham defendants were merely involved in the application for benn commitment,they were not state actors.
in brentwood acad.tennessee secondary sch.athletic ass n,d,the supreme court noted that the criteria for determining whether state action is present lack rigid simplicity,but the court identified factors that bear on the question.the court wrote 
we have,for example,held that a challenged activity may be state action when it results from the state exercise of coercive power,blum yaretsky,d,when the state provides significant encouragement,either overt or covert,or when a private actor operates as a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents,lugar edmondson oil,d internal quotation marks omitted.we have treated a nominally private entity as a state actor when it is controlled by an agency of the state,pennsylvania board of directors of city trusts of philadelphia,d per curiam,when it has been delegated a public function by the state,west atkins,d edmonson leesville concrete,d,when it is entwined with governmental policies,or when government is entwined in its management or control,evans newton,d.
in the present case,none of these factors points toward the presence of state action.first,the mhpa,on which benn predicates his state action argument,did not coerce the horsham defendants to file the application that led to benn commitment.nor did the mhpa provide significant encouragement,either overt or covert.blum,at.although the mhpa permits a physician or other responsible party to file an application for an emergency examination,we see nothing in the mpha that compels or even significantly encourages the filing of an application.see rockwell cape cod,cir no compulsion where state law merely permits physicians to petition for involuntary commitment but does not mandate that they do so harvey harvey,cir no compulsion or encouragement where state statutes not enacted to encourage commitment spencer lee,cir same janicsko pellman,this court can not hold that the standards set by the mhpa rise to the level of coercion,aff,cir table.
second,the horsham defendants did not operate as willful participant s in joint activity with the state or its agents under lugar,at.in lugar,creditors moved for a prejudgment writ of attachment,and the writ was issued by a court clerk and executed by a sheriff.id.at.the debtor whose property was attached brought an action asserting two claims against the creditors.count one claimed that the prejudgment attachment process permitted by state law was procedurally defective under the fourteenth amendment.id.at.count two alleged that the creditors had invoked the attachment process in a way that was malicious,wanton,willful,opressive sic and unlawful under state law.id.at.brackets in supreme court opinion.the supreme court held that the first count stated a claim because the procedural scheme was the product of state action.id.by contrast,the court concluded that the second count did not satisfy the state action requirement because private misuse of a state statute does not describe conduct that can be attributed to the state.id.the court stated t hat the creditor invoked the statute without the grounds to do so could in no way be attributed to a state rule or decision.id.at.
in this case,benn constitutional claims against the horsham defendants parallel the claim found to be defective in lugar.as benn memorandum of law in support of his motion for summary judgment makes clear,benn theory was that these defendants violated his constitutional rights because they allegedly did not comply with the mhpa.see app.the portion of benn memorandum addressing his constitutional claims begins by stating 
defendants had a duty and obligation to follow the rules and standards of the pennsylvania mental health procedures act.such act governed the circumstances and procedures surrounding the extreme action of involuntarily committing an individual.
id.at.the memorandum then adds 
defendants clearly failed to act according to the act,and the high duty placed upon them.such intentional,reckless,and gross disregard of the rules and standards they were bound by,the defendants intentionally committed a horrible act upon plaintiff.
the crux of benn complaint about the conduct of the horsham defendants appears to be that they conducted a seriously defective evaluative process,appellant br.at,and that he did not meet the standard for emergency commitment under the mhpa.see app.memorandum in support of summary judgment id.at expert report.benn constitutional claim against horsham defendants is thus precisely the type of claim that lugar found to be inadequate to establish state action.
third,this is clearly not a case in which nominally private persons were controlled by an agency of the commonwealth.benn makes no such allegations.
fourth,the conduct in question for benn emergency not a public function that the mhpa delegated to private persons.in considering the public function issue,we must ask whether the challenged action relates to a function that has been traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state.jackson metropolitan edison,d.here,we have no basis for concluding that petitioning for involuntary confinement is or ever was the exclusive prerogative of the state,either in pennsylvania or in the country in general.see rockwell cape cod,at the history of involuntary treatment of the mentally ill in massachusetts demonstrates that involuntary treatment has by no means been the exclusive prerogative of the state.spencer lee,cir holding that civil commitment in illinois was not a traditional and exclusive public function bodor horsham clinic,wl at.july,pennsylvania.
fifth,this case does not involve entwinement within the meaning of brentwood.there,the court held that an interscholastic athletic association was entwined with the state where the great majority of the association member schools were public,representatives of the schools acting in their official capacities selected members of the association governing bodies,state officials also sat on those bodies in an ex officio capacity,the association was largely financed by gate receipts from tournaments,and association employees participated in the state retirement system.at.in this case,benn does not allege that the commonwealth was entwined in any comparable sense with the horsham defendants.thus,none of the factors identified in brentwood supports a finding of state action in this case.
nor does this case satisfy the symbiotic relationship test that derives from burton wilmington parking authority,d.after brentwood,our court,sitting en banc,held that the symbiotic relationship test continues to provide an additional,albeit narrow,basis for finding that private action may fairly be attributed to the state.crissman dover downs entertainment,cir.this theory,however,has no application here.a symbiotic relationship demands a close association of mutual benefit between the state and the private entity or person.crissman,at.in burton,such a relationship existed between a city that owned a parking structure and a restaurant to which it leased space.in this case,there is no indication that the horsham defendants made any profit from the petition to commit benn,and there certainly is no evidence that the government received any tangible benefit from horsham,save a possible increase in the general welfare.that a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not make its acts state action.kohn,d.thus,neither the factors cited in brentwood nor the symbiotic relationship theory shows the presence of state action in this case.
the decisions of other courts of appeals and those of district courts in this circuit also support the conclusion that persons who petition for the involuntary commitment of others are not state actors.see rockwell cape cod,at harvey harvey,cir spencer,at doby decrescenzo,wl,aff,cir table bodor horsham clinic,supra thoroughly analyzing the state actor question savacool delaware county department of mental health,wl,janicsko pellman,aff,cir.
our analysis leads to the same result.we thus hold that the horsham defendants were not state actors.
benn claims that mces,mukerjee,zerby,and quasim,all of whom conceded that they were state actors for purposes of the motion for summary judgment,violated both his procedural and substantive due process rights.we disagree.
benn argues that mces and its doctors violated procedural due process by failing to comply with the mhpa and by failing to grant him
