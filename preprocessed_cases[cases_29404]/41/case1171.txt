this case presents the question of whether a change in a rule governing the adjudication of social security disability benefits claims that is applied as of its effective date to all pending cases has an impermissibly retroactive effect.in the social security administration required more detailed proof of disability from obese claimants by eliminating a presumption of disability for obesity.such presumptions govern the process of administrative adjudication.changes to such rules,therefore,have their primary effect on claimants applications when the claimants appear before the agency to have their claims decided on the merits.the change in the rule is thus not impermissibly retroactive.
plaintiff barbara combs initially filed an application for social security disability benefits in november of.at that time,the social security administration ssa afforded obese claimants a generous presumption of disability.the social security commissioner deleted obesity from the list of conditions that benefit from this presumption in.in combs claim came before an administrative law judge alj on remand from an administrative appeal.the alj denied her claim for benefits due in part to the deletion of this obesity listing.combs appealed the decision administratively without success.she then filed suit in federal district court.there combs argued that the agency had exceeded its powers granted by the social security act the act by applying the changed listings to her claim retroactively.the act does not generally give the ssa the power to promulgate retroactive regulations.a bowen georgetown,d.
the district court rejected combs arguments,holding that the ssa had properly determined her eligibility for benefits without analyzing the deleted listing.this appeal followed.because the changed listing had its effect on combs claim after its effective date,when combs claim was administratively adjudicated,it was not impermissibly retroactive in its effect.moreover,the district court correctly concluded that the agency determination in this case is supported by substantial evidence.we therefore affirm.
an understanding of the effect of the change in the regulation requires a brief look at the procedure used by the ssa to determine eligibility for disability benefits.the act entitles to benefits payments certain claimants who,by virtue of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment of at least a year expected duration,can not engage in substantial gainful activity.d a.such claimants qualify as disabled.id.a claimant qualifies as disabled if she can not,in light of her age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.id.d a.to identify claimants who satisfy this definition of disability,the ssa uses a sequential evaluation process.a.the five steps are as follows 
in step one,the ssa identifies claimants who are doing substantial gainful activity and concludes that these claimants are not disabled.id.a i.if claimants get past this step,the ssa at step two considers the medical severity of claimants impairments,particularly whether such impairments have lasted or will last for at least twelve months.id.a ii.claimants with impairments of insufficient duration are not disabled.see id.those with impairments that have lasted or will last at least twelve months proceed to step three.
at step three,the ssa examines the severity of claimants impairments but with a view not solely to their duration but also to the degree of affliction imposed.id.a iii.claimants are conclusively presumed to be disabled if they suffer from an infirmity that appears on the ssa special list of impairments,or that is at least equal in severity to those listed.id.a iii,d.the list identifies and defines impairments that are of sufficient severity as to prevent any gainful activity.see sullivan zebley,d.a person with such an impairment or an equivalent,consequently,necessarily satisfies the statutory definition of disability.for such claimants,the process ends at step three.claimants with lesser impairments proceed to step four.
in the fourth step,the ssa evaluates claimants residual functional capacity,defined as the most the claimant can still do despite her limitations.a.claimants whose residual functional capacity permits them to perform their past relevant work are not disabled.id.a iv,f.past relevant work is defined as work claimants have done within the past fifteen years that is substantial gainful activity and that lasted long enough for the claimant to learn to do it.id.b.claimants who can still do their past relevant work are not disabled.those who can not do their past relevant work proceed to the fifth step,in which the ssa determines whether claimants,in light of their residual functional capacity,age,education,and work experience,can perform substantial gainful activity other than their past relevant work.see id.a v,g.claimants who can perform such work are not disabled.see c.the ssa bears the burden of proof at step five.see jones comm r of soc,cir.
for use at step three,the commissioner has promulgated an extensive list of impairments.see generally part,subpart p,appx.the list includes dozens of conditions,ranging from problems of the musculoskeletal system to skin disorders to malignant neoplastic diseases.see id.as late as,obesity was a listed impairment.part,subpart p,appx.the listing for obesity stated 
obesity.weight equal to or greater than the values specified in table i for males,table ii for females percent above desired level,and one of the following 
history of pain and limitation of motion in any joint or the lumbosacral spine on physical examination associated with findings on medically acceptable imaging techniques of arthritis in the affected joint or lumbosacral spine or 
hypertension with diastolic blood pressure persistently in excess of mm.hg measured with appropriate size cuff or 
history of congestive heart failure manifested by past evidence of vascular congestion such as hepatomegaly,peripheral or pulmonary edema or 
chronic venous insufficiency with superficial varicosities in a lower extremity with pain on weight bearing and persistent edema or 
respiratory disease with total forced vital capacity equal to or less than or a level of hypoxemia at rest equal to or less than the values specified in table or or.
the commissioner deleted listing effective october,following notice and comment.the commissioner explained this decision by noting that the criteria in listing were not appropriate indicators of severity because they did not represent a degree of functional limitation that would prevent an individual from engaging in any gainful activity.id.at.in its program and adjudicative experience,the ssa became convinced that the listing had required findings of disability in some cases in which the claimants were clearly not disabled as defined in the act.id.at.although obesity was no longer a separately listed impairment under step three,the commissioner explained that obese claimants can still prevail at step three by proving that their obesity combined with other ailments equals the severity of a different listed impairment.see id.at.indeed,the commissioner simultaneously amended the introductory text to the musculoskeletal,respiratory,and cardiovascular systems listings to give guidance regarding obesity potential to combine with other impairments at step three.see id.at.
the deletion of listing,the commissioner stated in response to comments,would have prospective effect only.see id.at.we will not review prior allowances based on listing under the new rules,the agency explained.id.the revised listings were to apply to pending applications for benefits,claims filed but not yet finally adjudicated before listing was deleted.see social security ruling,ssr p titles ii and xvi evaluation of obesity,social security ruling,ssr p titles ii and xvi evaluation of obesity,may,superseded by ssr p.
combs first filed for disability benefits with the ssa on november.she alleged in her application that she had been disabled since may,due to a wide variety of impairments.the ssa initially denied combs application in december of,and upon reconsideration a few months later in february of.combs requested a hearing before an alj later that year in august.the alj denied combs request for a hearing in january of.combs appealed the denial to the appeals council.the council reversed the alj decision in october of,granting combs request for a hearing.in the subsequent hearing in march of,the alj denied combs claim under the test.the alj did not find that combs obesity and other impairments were severe enough for her to prevail at step three under listing for obesity or any other listing.the alj denied her claim at step five.combs appealed the alj decision administratively.
during the pendency of her administrative appeal,the agency deleted listing for obesity on october.the appeals council in march of vacated the alj denial of benefits and remanded combs claim for further consideration.on remand,the alj in september of again at step five determined that combs was not disabled.the alj observed at step three that combs medically determinable impairments do not meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments needed for her to prevail.admin.at.combs appealed once again.in september of,the appeals council vacated the alj decision and remanded the matter to a different alj.
this second alj issued a decision on february,denying combs claim at step five.the alj identified combs medically determinable impairments and concluded,like the previous alj,that they do not meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments that could entitle her to benefits at step three.admin.at.combs administratively appealed again,this time without success.the second alj denial of benefits became the agency final decision.
combs sought review of the denial of benefits in the district court below.the district court granted the ssa motion for summary judgment,thereby upholding the denial of benefits.in its opinion,the district court held that the agency determination was supported by substantial evidence.the district court also concluded that the ssa acted properly when it did not apply former listing to combs claim,because that listing had been deleted prior to the hearing.
the district court properly refused to require the ssa to apply listing,notwithstanding the fact that combs claim was initially filed before the deletion of that listing.combs argues that the application of the current version of the listing was improper because application of the current listing had a retroactive effect on combs,by virtue of the fact that she had filed her claim before the change in the listing.
while congress has the power to permit the ssa to promulgate retroactive regulations,congress generally has not done so.bowen,at.neither party in this case argues that congress has authorized the ssa to promulgate regulations that would operate retroactively,where such retroactivity is of the type that would be presumed to be against the intent of congress if the provision were contained in a statute.we accordingly assume,for purposes of our analysis of whether the regulation at issue in this case is consistent with the statute,that we are to apply the same analysis that we would apply in determining whether a construed retroactively so as to invoke the supreme court presumption against retroactivity.in other words,the regulations as of october,are consistent with the social security act if they are not retroactive under the tests that the supreme court has used to determine whether certain unclear federal statutes operated retroactively.in landgraf usi film products,the court held that the application to activity of amendments to title vii of the civil rights act,newly providing for compensatory and punitive damages,would violate the presumption against retroactive legislation,d.later in republic of austria altmann,the court held that application to activity of exceptions to sovereign immunity contained in the foreign sovereign immunities act did not violate the presumption against retroactive legislation,d.assuming the applicability of the distinction to the issue of agency power presented in this case,it is apparent that the regulatory change in this case is not impermissibly retroactive.
as landgraf teaches,not all statutes raise retroactivity concerns.a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment at.campos ins,cir patel gonzales,cir.the application of law existing at the time of decision does not violate the presumption against retroactivity unless the statute in question has retroactive effects.landgraf,at.patel,at.a statute has retroactive effects if the statute 
attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.the conclusion that a particular rule operates retroactively comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event f amiliar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations offer sound guidance.
landgraf,at.
the factors articulated in notice,reasonable reliance,and settled against finding a retroactive effect.see id.at.it can hardly be argued that claimants become obese or otherwise become impaired in reliance on the availability of the presumption in the listing.nor is there any indication that they file their claims,or decide what to put in their claims,based on how the agency determines whether they meet the statutory requirements for disability eligibility.similarly,claimants have no settled expectation that the agency will use one as opposed to another algorithm for determining whether the statutory requirements are met.finally,there is no basis for claimants to argue that they need fair notice of a change in the step three presumptions.
this analysis tracks precisely the reasoning of our recent decision in patel gonzales.in that case we dealt with two versions of a statutory provision for discretionary waiver of removal of relatives of citizens.the older version applied to parents,spouses,or children of citizens the newer version did not apply to parents.we held that the newer version applied to the patels,even though they fraudulently entered the united states,committed the acts that formed the basis for their removal before the change in the statute.application of the later version of the statute was not impermissibly retroactive because 
the factors articulated in notice,reasonable reliance,and settled against finding a retroactive effect.in likelihood,petitioners did not enter the united states through fraud in reliance on the availability of the discretionary waiver.nor did petitioners have a settled expectation,given the fact that petitioners son was not a naturalized citizen in,that they would receive a discretionary waiver based on their relationship with their son.finally,unless petitioners had notice of the waiver in the first place,they can not rely on the argument that they need fair notice of the change.
patel,at citation omitted.it is less likely that combs became impaired in reliance on the unamended listing than that the patels entered the united states fraudulently in reliance on the availability of a discretionary waiver it is less apparent that combs had a settled expectation that a certain procedure would apply to her in the determination of her disability than that the patels had a settled expectation that their son would become a citizen,thereby entitling them to seek a waiver.and finally,there is no more basis for saying combs needed fair notice of the listing change than for saying the patels needed notice of the change in the availability of a discretionary waiver.our decision in patel thus strongly supports our conclusion that the listing change was not impermissibly retroactive with respect to combs.
moreover,the supreme court in landgraf and altmann,and our court in patel,have recognized that changes to procedural rules generally do not have retroactive effect because procedural rules regulate secondary as opposed to primary conduct.see landgraf,at.altmann,at.patel,at.in contrast,rules that deprive persons of vested substantive rights may have retroactive effects if applied to conduct occurring prior to their enactment.see landgraf,at,altmann,at.patel,at.thus,the supreme court has distinguished between provisions involving the right to a jury and the lifting of sovereign immunity as being on the side of the line,while the addition of new elements of damages are on the substantive side of the line.see altmann,at.foreign sovereign immunity landgraf,at.right to a jury trial is procedural but new right to compensatory and punitive damages is substantive.applying this distinction,the change in step three is more procedural than substantive in nature.the ultimate criteria of disability eligibility are not changed.instead,a presumption designed for administrative workability was changed to conform agency determinations more closely with the statutory requirements.while the change may be for some claimants,the same can be said for a jury trial right or the lifting of an immunity.the difference has to do with whether there is a change in substantive obligation as opposed to a change in the way in which the same obligation is adjudicated.in that light,the change in administrative presumption in step three is more like the latter.the substantive requirements for disability eligibility have not changed,only the way in which the agency goes about determining whether they are present.doubtless there are situations in which a procedural rule will have such substantive effects,see landgraf,at.n or do we suggest that concerns about retroactivity have no application to procedural rules,but the modification of the step three listing does not fall on the substantive side of the distinction.
our conclusion is buttressed by the in landgraf and emphasized in we focus on the relevant conduct regulated by the legislative provision to determine whether the provision is impermissibly retroactive.in landgraf,the supreme court explained that t he conclusion that a particular rule operates retroactively comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.at.emphasis added.the altmann court focused on this aspect of the landgraf analysis.it reasoned that the past event relevant to whether a limitation on foreign sovereign immunity was retroactive was the claim of immunity,not the underlying government action that was the basis for the lawsuit.see altmann,at.the foreign sovereign immunities act was intended to change the framework for determining liability of foreign states,more than the substantive content of that liability.see id.in making this analysis the court quoted with approval the following passage from justice scalia landgraf concurrence 
the critical issue,i think,is not whether the rule affects vested rights,or governs substance or procedure,but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.absent clear statement otherwise,only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered.most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct,and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.but other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relevant retroactivity event.
id.at.quoting landgraf,at.scalia,concurring in judgment.
a focus on the relevant activity in this case leads inexorably to the conclusion that the change in the regulation was not impermissibly retroactive.the relevant activity is the agency application of the procedure,not the date when claimant asserts that disability started,or the date the claim is filed.this is because it is the application of the process that the regulatory change is directed toward,not the substantive basis for disability eligibility.in other words,the regulatory change had no retroactive effect because the presumption defined by the listing is a rule of adjudication and therefore has its effect on claims at the time of adjudication.
the october listing did not operate retroactively here because,as part of step three in the sequential evaluation process,it regulated only the process of adjudicating social security disability benefits,adjudicatory the adjudicatory conduct regulated here took place years after these listings went into effect when combs claim was finally adjudicated by the ssa.
the entire sequential evaluation process has been designed to regulate adjudicatory conduct for the purpose of making adjudication of claims efficient and flexible.step three regulates a narrow category of adjudicatory conduct,also to promote adjudicatory efficiency.see bowen yuckert,d.step three governs the organization of evaluation of proof of listed impairments that,if supplied,renders entitlement to benefits a foregone conclusion.see id.noting that step three streamlines the decision process by identifying those claimants whose medical impairments are so severe that it is likely they would be found disabled regardless of their vocational background.emphasis added sullivan zebley,d observing that the regulations set the medical criteria defining the listed impairments at a higher level of severity than the statutory standard.step three effectively allows the ssa to skip the extensive and costly factual inquiry of steps four and five in obvious cases.see yuckert,at.as a tool for efficient and organized administrative adjudication,step three regulates the orderly evaluation and presentation of proof of listed impairments.changes to these listings consequently have their effect on benefits applications when claimants reach step three in the process of adjudicating their claims.
a rule regulating the evaluation and presentation of proof does not normally operate retroactively if it is applied to pending cases.the ssa may freely change rules that purely govern the conduct of adjudication,without fear of retroactive effect,if those changes apply only to pending cases.naturally,if the ssa had attempted to retry cases that had been adjudicated previously,that might be a different story.but that did not happen here.the application of the october listing to combs claim was prospective.
our upholding of the application of the revised listing to pending applications is supported by the unpublished opinion,albeit cursory in this regard,of the seventh circuit in barthelemy barnhart,cir.
we recognize that several district court cases and one unpublished circuit court opinion have stated or assumed that applying the october listing to pending claims has an impermissibly retroactive effect.nash apfel,wl cir.june.lexis cherry barnhart,d portlock barnhart,d kokal massanari,d.the reasoning of these cases is not compelling.
the tenth circuit opinion in nash is not compelling for several reasons.the unpublished opinion devotes several sentences to the requirement that the ssa regulations not be retroactive,but assumes without explanation that the change in the listing is impermissibly retroactive.see wl,at.lexis,at.there is no discussion of what past event the change in the regulation relates to,for purposes of drawing the distinction.moreover,in nash the old listing had not been repealed at the time of the agency adjudication,and was only repealed during the pendency of judicial review.see id.in addition,the tenth circuit upheld the denial of disability even under the old listing,thus further lessening any precedential weight of the tenth circuit opinion.see id.wl,at.lexis,at.
kokal and portlock,two district court opinions,rely upon the assertion that plaintiff rights would be substantively altered if the revision to pt,subpt.p,app.deleting listing was deemed applicable to pending claims,because the revised regulation would raise the bar on proof of disability based on obesity.kokal,d at see also portlock,d at following kokal.while deletion of listing indeed requires more detailed proof with respect to obese claimants,that fact as explained above does not establish that their rights have been substantively altered.the ssa deleted listing precisely because some clearly obese claimants were getting benefits to which they were not entitled.see.at.by reducing the number of erroneous benefits awards to people,the ssa has restricted no actual substantive rights.
the actual substantive right to benefits derives from the act definition of disability,not step three.combs does not argue that deleting listing created a conflict between the act definition of disability and the sequential evaluation process.such a conflict might result if deleting listing truly altered claimants substantive rights to benefits,but instead it provides a more accurate way of determining the substantive right to benefits resulting from obesity.for this reason,kokal and portlock are not persuasive.
in harmony with kokal,the district court in cherry concluded that applying the october listing to pending claims has a retroactive effect on claimants who filed their claims before the new listing became effective.d at.the cherry court said that the past act to which the changed listing attached new legal consequences is the filing of a claim.id.at.the cherry court identified no new legal consequences that the october listing attached to the act of filing a claim.a change in step three requiring more detailed proof simply does not attach new legal consequences to the act of filing a claim.
the application of the revised listing to claims filed before the change is accordingly not retroactive in a way that would make the regulation beyond the authorized rulemaking power of the commissioner 
finally,the district court correctly held that the record as a whole contains substantial evidence supporting the second alj denial of combs benefits claim.combs argues,however,that the alj gave too little force to the reports of combs primary treating specialist,james templin,and was too trusting of state agency physicians whose reports date back to and.
the alj stated,u pon reviewing all of the evidence of the record,the undersigned administrative law judge concludes that claimant is not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.admin.at.the alj found that combs still had the residual functional capacity to perform light and sedentary work,her impairments notwithstanding.see admin.at.the alj based much of his decision on the alj recitation of the medical evidence,see admin.at,which relied on the examinations and opinions of anthony uy,a state agency physician consultant.see admin.at relying on uy,uy findings.the alj stated that he substantially concurs with,adopts,and incorporates by reference the recitation of the medical evidence contained in the decision dated september.admin.at.the alj also noted that combs had supplied some new evidence of disability.
uy found that combs could lift and carry up to pounds frequently,could stand or walk for up to hours,and could sit without medical limitation.see admin.at.uy also found that combs was capable of climbing and balancing frequently.see admin.at.when the alj incorporated the alj recitation of the evidence,he incorporated the alj rationale discounting templin residual functional capacity determination.see admin.at.in october of,according to the alj,templin in effect found that combs could not perform any gainful work,not even sedentary work.see admin.at.specifically,the alj related that templin precluded combs from 
any lifting and limited standing and walking to hours total of an workday with only minutes uninterrupted.she could only sit a total of four hours and only one hour at any one time.nor could she ever climb,balance,stoop,crouch,kneel or crawl.reaching and handling were affected and templin precluded combs from pushing and pulling on an incline or over rough terrain templin also restrict ed her from working in humidity or with vibration.
admin.at emphasis in original.by virtue of his incorporation of the alj recitation of the evidence into his own determination,the alj agreed with the alj that others of templin many medical assessments of combs were inconsistent with this assessment,and that templin was therefore less than credible.see admin.at.for example,the alj noted that in other residual functional capacity assessments in and,templin said that combs could lift or carry up to pounds.see admin at alj comments,templin report dated july,templin report dated january.the alj noted further that although templin had said that combs should not sit for more than one hour at a time,combs nonetheless engages in such sedentary activities as spend ing the day watching television.admin.at.the alj also noted that templin medical assessments do not withstand the test of objective and clinical findings.admin.at.
at step five of the sequential evaluation process,the alj relied on expert testimony and concluded that combs could perform a significant number of jobs in the economy.see admin at born sec y of health and human,cir.in a hearing vocational expert testimony indicated that a hypothetical person with combs characteristics could do light or sedentary work as an information clerk,general office clerk,or security monitor.see admin at.in a hearing,a vocational expert stated that someone with attributes like combs could work as a service station attendant or cafeteria attendant.admin.at.in a hearing,a vocational expert testified that a hypothetical person like combs could work as an assembler of parts and components,and as a weigher,measurer,and inspector.admin.at.based on such testimony,the alj found that combs impairments permitted her to perform a significant range of light work.admin.at.the alj concluded that combs was not under a disability as defined in the act.see admin at.
combs objects mainly to the alj discounting of templin residual functional capacity determination and his crediting of uy assessment.given the lack of objective evidence of disability in templin reports and the alj other observations,the alj could discount his opinion.as we held in bogle sullivan,cir,a social security alj may properly discount a treating physician opinion of disability t his court has consistently stated that the secretary is not bound by the treating physician opinions,and that such opinions receive great weight only if they are supported by sufficient clinical findings and are consistent with the evidence.
there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the alj determination that combs is not disabled.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court judgment is affirmed.
any test of retroactivity,the supreme court has acknowledged,will leave room for disagreement in hard cases.landgraf usi film.as the four opinions produced today demonstrate,this is such a case.the case is made even more unique by the lengthy administrative proceedings required to adjudicate barbara combs application for disability benefits.had her claim been decided in the normal course,the process would have ended before the rule change,and there would have been no controversy over which rule to apply.
as luck would have it,however,the rule as applied to combs claim did change in the middle of the game.the commissioner decision to apply the new rule has prompted my colleagues,almost seven years after that change,to spar at length over whether it was substantive or procedural in nature.of the two positions articulated on that issue,i find judge clay dissent and judge griffin separate opinion more persuasive than the lead opinion in explaining why a shift in the burden of proof,or analogous changes that directly affect a party prospects for success on the merits,are substantive rather than procedural.in particular,i find both persuasive and apposite the circuit decision in national mining association department of labor,per curiam,a case that counsel for the commissioner was unable to distinguish at oral argument and that the lead opinion unconvincingly attempts to explain away.lead op.at.
i also believe,however,that both the lead opinion and the dissent have failed to see the forest for the trees by allowing these and dictate the outcome of this appeal.see lead op.at the substantive requirements for disability eligibility have not changed,only the way in which the agency goes about determining whether they are present.dissent at because the deletion of listing was a substantive change,our analysis should be concluded.the supreme court has cautioned against basing a finding that a particular change in the law operates retrospectively on the particular label attached to that change.see martin hadix,d when determining whether a new statute operates retroactively,it is not enough to attach a label,procedural,collateral to the statute.
heeding that warning,i can not agree with the dissent that applying the new rule to combs application is impermissibly retroactive simply because the legal change is more substantive than procedural in nature.nor do i find persuasive the argument that combs planned for the possibility of becoming disabled in reliance on the disability benefits scheme available at the time,or that her disability planning would have been significantly different had she known about possible changes in the rules.dissent at.
at the same time,i remain unconvinced by key aspects of the lead opinion,including its reliance on republic of austria altmann,d,and its conclusion that the relevant date for retroactivity purposes is the time of adjudication.see lead op.at.i find more compelling the decision in national mining association,at,where the circuit considered the relevant date to be the date when the miners disability claims were filed.the lead opinion also minimizes the impact of deleting the obesity listing by coining a new phrase,adjudicatory conduct,which it says is all that the regulatory change affected.lead op.at.although i do not understand the lead opinion to be carving out an entire category of agency activity immune from retroactivity concerns,i still can not join the lead opinion in creating a new concept whose scope and significance are unclear.finally,for the reasons explained in judge clay dissent,i do not believe that the remedy proposed by judge griffin in his separate opinion is viable under the governing social security regulations.dissent at.
i am thus left with the supreme court general guidance from landgraf.there,the court cited with approval justice story description of an impermissibly retroactive statute as one that takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability.landgraf,at.citations and quotation marks omitted id.at.explaining that a court deciding a retroactivity question must ask whether applying the new statute or regulation would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase his liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.deciding whether a statute operates retroactively is not always a simple or mechanical task,the court advised,and courts should make the retroactivity determination by taking into account familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.at.
i concur in the judgment affirming the decision below principally because i am not convinced that applying the new rule to combs claims for benefits impaired any vested right that combs may have had,increased her liability for past conduct,or impose d new duties on her with respect to a completed transaction.see id.at.citation and quotation marks omitted.the first circuit,under similar circumstances,held that the mere filing of an application is not the kind of completed transaction in which a party could fairly expect stability of the relevant laws as of the transaction date.pine tree med.assocs.sec.of health and human,cir.in pine tree medical associates,the plaintiff,a provider of healthcare services,requested that a government agency designate a town as a medically underserved population,or mup.id.at.healthcare providers that serve mups may be eligible for substantial,reimbursement under medicare and medicare programs.id.the agency altered the guidelines used to make the mup determination after the provider had submitted an application but before the agency had ruled on the application.using the new guidelines to evaluate the provider request,the agency then denied the application.id.
the first circuit found no retroactivity problem with the use of the new guidelines,squarely rejecting the proposition that filing an application with an agency essentially fixes an entitlement to the application of those substantive regulations in force on the filing date.id.at emphasis in original.i would follow this reasoning and reject combs retroactivity challenge on the ground that she had no settled alone a vested the use of the substantive regulations in force when she filed her disability claim.see id.the fact that the change may have been fatal to the success of her claim does not alter the conclusion that combs had no right to expect that filing an application would freeze the law in its state.
in my view,there is a faint yet discernible line that separates pine tree medical associates and the present case on the one hand from cases like landgraf and national mining association on the other.that line is the one between applying a new statute or regulation that might deny an applicant benefits being sought from a governmental body,and applying a new statute or regulation that imposes liability on a private party that the party would not have incurred under existing law.thus,the supreme court in landgraf held that a statutory provision awarding compensatory damages could not be applied to events antedating its enactment.at.the court reasoned that such damages affect ed the liabilities of defendants for past conduct and constituted the type of legal change that would have an impact on private parties planning.id.at.
similarly,the circuit in national mining association declared impermissibly retroactive one regulation that created a rebuttable presumption in favor of the applicant and another that expanded the scope of the employers liability by making more dependents and survivors eligible for benefits.at.the former regulation increased the likelihood that mining companies would be held liable for past conduct,whereas the latter altered the amount that the companies would be required to pay in the event that they were found liable.see id.like the statutory provisions at issue in landgraf,therefore,the regulations both increased the mining companies potential liability for past conduct and impacted the companies planning by altering the calculus of operators and insurers.to put the issue in landgraf parlance,the regulations attache d new legal consequences to events completed before their enactment.at.
in both pine tree medical associates and in the present case,in contrast,the change in the administrative regulations did not impose any kind of liability on either the healthcare provider or combs,respectively.what the healthcare provider lost was a more favorable regulatory scheme that might have increased its chances of securing reimbursement,just as combs lost a provision that might have entitled her to a conclusive finding of disability.both of these parties,in other words,saw a more favorable regulation replaced with one that,while still permitting them to prove their entitlement to the requested funds,made their eventual success less likely.awareness that the law might change during the application process,however,would not have dissuaded either applicant from seeking the benefits in the first place.that is to say,the possibility of change did not impact the parties planning.landgraf,at.
i also do not believe that the rule change in the present case,or the one in pine tree medical associates,attache d new legal consequences to completed events.see id.at.the applications for prospective governmental benefits in these cases simply do not constitute completed events that engender any justifiable reliance on regulations.when combs sought disability benefits,and when pine tree sought mup status,the legal consequence of applying was either the grant or denial of the requested benefit.after the change in the law,the legal consequences remained exactly the applicant either received or was denied the benefit.this stands in clear contrast to the examples of landgraf having to pay compensatory damages for past acts of discrimination and national mining association having to pay a larger number of beneficiaries,where the companies faced new kinds of liabilities for conduct undertaken before the passage of the laws at issue.
i recognize that the line that i have drawn is not perfect and that,like all such lines in the retroactivity context,it is susceptible to breaking down in extreme cases.see landgraf,at.noting that a ny test of retroactivity is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.one can imagine a scenario where an applicant for disability benefits organizes her proof around a controlling regulation,the administrative hearing is conducted pursuant to that regulation,and then the regulation changes before a decision is issued solely because the alj is a particularly slow drafter.under those circumstances,the applicant may well have a settled expectation in an administrative decision rendered pursuant to the former regulation.but the present case,although difficult,does not raise the more complicated issues that might arise from an agency unreasonable deliberate delay in resolving an application.
in sum,i agree with the lead opinion that the familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations cut against finding that the application of the new obesity standard to combs case was impermissibly retroactive.see landgraf,at.lead op.at.combs could not have had a settled expectation that the law would remain the same indefinitely,since almost every change in the the court has detrimental to some person interests.see landgraf,at.giving examples of uncontroversially prospective statutes that unsettle expectations and impose burdens on past conduct.and although combs undoubtedly relied on the availability of disability benefits when she submitted her application,the rule change did not deprive her of the ability to prove entitlement to those benefits,even if it did make her success less likely.in the end,i can not say that the fact that the rule change adversely affected combs chances of prevailing converted an otherwise permissible application of the current law into an impermissible one.
this last applying the current law to pending cases is the rule rather than the the final consideration that informs my resolution of this case.we should not forget that at the heart of landgraf is an attempt to reconcile two general principles of law that seemingly point in opposite directions that a court should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,id.at.quoting bradley school bd.of richmond,d and that congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result,id.quoting bowen georgetown,d.
as i read landgraf,the court resolved the apparent tension inherent in these principles by instructing that the current law be applied unless that law would have an impermissible retroactive effect as that concept is defined by the court cases.id.at.citation and quotation marks omitted see id.at.emphasizing that a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment citation omitted.that is,application of the current law is the default position from which courts should stray only if one of the narrow criteria set forth in landgraf is satisfied.see patel gonzales,cir courts should apply the law in effect at the time of the decision,unless such law has a retroactive effect on the parties.
i would also note that combs would hardly be complaining if listing had first come into existence after she had filed her application and while her case was still pending.united states real prop.in section,town north,range west township of charlton,cir applying to a pending case a new statute that increased the government burden of proof in civil forfeiture proceedings.applying the current law,in other words,leads to consequences that are far from universally negative.in addition to the other reasons set forth above,therefore,i believe that the sound practice of generally applying current law to pending cases tips the balance in favor of the alj decision in the context of this admittedly close case.
because i do not believe that applying the new obesity standard to combs application was impermissibly retroactive,and because substantial evidence in the record supports the decision of the alj,i concur in the judgment reached in the lead opinion.i do not,however,agree with key aspects of the lead opinion analysis and would therefore enter judgment only on the strength of the reasons set forth above.
i concur in the result of the plurality opinion for the claimed disability period.however,i respectfully dissent from the denial of plaintiff claim for disability benefits for the period of may,through october.regarding this portion of plaintiff claim arising prior to the repeal of listing,i would remand for a new hearing with instructions to apply to the closed period.
title a provides the commissioner of social security the commissioner with the authority to make reasonable rules and regulations that are consistent with the provisions of the social security act.however,as the supreme court cautioned in bowen georgetown hospital,d,a contain s no express authorization of retroactive rulemaking,id.at.although the parties recognize the precedential effect of bowen,they disagree on what constitutes retroactive rulemaking.the commissioner contends that application of the rule change to combs claims does not have an impermissible retroactive effect because it does not impair any of her substantive or vested rights.the commissioner argues that the regulation repeal is purely procedural and,therefore,does not affect plaintiff substantive rights.i disagree.
in landgraf usi film,the supreme court addressed the issue of retroactivity with respect to statutes.there,the court adopted a presumption against retroactivity because prospectively accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate and will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations.id.at.the court noted,however,that exceptions exist to the general rule favoring prospectively.as a result,to analyze retroactivity,the court set forth the following framework whether the statute on its face provides for prospective or retroactive application in the absence of such an express provision governing the statute reach,whether the statute would have retroactive effect and if the statute would have retroactive effect,whether congress clearly intended such a retroactive effect,overcoming the presumption of prospectively id.at.
the second step of the landgraf analysis requires a determination of whether application of the revised medical criteria would have retroactive effect.at.see portlock barnhart,d,the starting point for the court analysis is to determine whether applying the revised regulations in the manner urged by the ssa in ssr would constitute a retroactive application of a rule.black law dictionary defines the term retroactive as that which extends a statute or regulation in scope or effect to matters that have occurred in the past.black law dictionary ed.a regulation therefore has retroactive effect if it impair s the rights the party had when he acted,increase s a party liability for past conduct or impose s new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf,at.see also gonzales,d.
in this case,several courts have agreed that application of the revised medical criteria to a claimant with a claim pending when listing was deleted would have a retroactive effect.nash apfel,wl cir.june,unpublished.lexis,see,portlock,d at t he application of the revised listings to claimant claim would constitute a retroactive application of the rule.kokal massanari,d,holding new listing substantively alters a claimant rights cherry barnhart,d,noting deletion of listing clearly alters the standard for evaluating disability claims,aff.cir unpublished the logic of the forgoing cases is sound indeed,the administrative record reflects that combs likely meets the requirements of listing,yet does not meet the disability parameters outlined by the revised medical criteria.landgraf,at.noting retroactive effect arises when statute or regulation impair s rights possessed when claimant acted and impose s new duties with respect to transactions already completed.thus,plaintiff rights would be substantively altered if the revision to pt,subpt.p,app.was deemed applicable,because the revised regulation would raise the bar on proof of disability based on obesity.kokal,d at.accordingly,application of the revised medical criteria to combs would have a retroactive effect.
the commissioner argues that t he agency rules here are akin to procedural rules that the court has previously found not to be retroactive.burdens of proof,however,are substantive law,not procedural rules.dick new york life ins,d citation omitted blue diamond coal united mine workers of,cir observing that where the burden of proof lies is a matter of substantive law citing cent.ry.white.
moreover,other courts have previously rejected similar arguments from the commissioner.the cherry court,for example,noted that t he supreme court emphasized in landgraf that the presumption against retroactivity is not restricted to cases involving contractual or property rights or vested rights.d at citing landgraf,at.additionally,the landgraf court expressly noted,contrary to the commissioner arguments,that retroactivity concerns may arise in the context of procedural rules.landgraf,at.accord ibrahim district of columbia,observing that where a rule changes the law in a way that adversely affects a party prospects for success on the merits of the claim,it may operate retroactively even if designated as procedural by the commissioner.accordingly,i conclude that the procedural label assigned to the revised medical criteria by the commissioner is meaningless.
next,the parties dispute the date upon which retroactivity should be determined.combs argues that whether the repeal of listing is retroactive should be measured from november,the date that combs filed her application for benefits.on the other hand,the commissioner asserts,and the plurality agrees,that retroactivity should be determined by reference to the date of the adjudication of combs claim for benefits,january or february i disagree and would hold that retroactivity should be determined by a third,date upon which the regulation change became effective.
in my view,because a final determination of disability has never been made in this case due to the numerous appeals and convoluted procedural history,i would remand for a new hearing.for purposes of the hearing,i would afford combs the benefit of listing for the claimed disability period of may,until the effective date of its repeal,october.in regard to the claimed disability period,i would affirm the denial of disability benefits on the basis that the alj findings of fact for the period after the effective date of the repeal were supported by substantial evidence.g longworth comm r of soc.sec,cir.
at oral argument,the commissioner argued that bifurcating plaintiff disability claims into the periods of pre and repeal would be unduly burdensome and may violate f of the act.i disagree with both propositions.first,because retroactive rulemaking is prohibited by law,the commissioner is not permitted to impose rules retroactively simply as a matter of convenience.see bowen,at.deference to what appears to be nothing more than an agency convenient litigating position would be entirely inappropriate.regardless of the commissioner assertion of an increased administrative burden,it is axiomatic that the commissioner must apply new regulations prospectively,only.id.holding that a specifically contain s no express authorization of retroactive rulemaking.if such action leads to bifurcation of claims,then bifurcation is required by the law.
as to the second argument,the text of does not address the date that retroactivity should be determined.rather,f provides that a recipient of benefits may not have benefits terminated unless substantial evidence demonstrates a change in the medical condition or in the individual ability to engage in substantial,gainful employment 
a recipient of benefits under this title or title xviii based on the disability of any individual may be determined not to be entitled to such benefits on the basis of a finding that the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are provided has ceased,does not exist,or is not disabling only if such finding is supported by 
substantial evidence which demonstrates that 
a there has been any medical improvement in the individual impairment or combination of impairments other than medical improvement which is not related to the individual ability to work,and 
b the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity or 
substantial evidence which 
a consists of new medical evidence and a new assessment of the individual residual functional capacity,and demonstrates that 
i although the individual has not improved medically,he or she is nonetheless a beneficiary of advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology related to the individual ability to work,and 
ii the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity,or 
b demonstrates that 
i although the individual has not improved medically,he or she has undergone vocational therapy related to the individual ability to work,and 
ii the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity or 
substantial evidence which demonstrates that,as determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques or evaluations,the individual impairment or combination of impairments is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent prior decision that he or she was under a disability or continued to be under a disability,and that therefore the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity or 
substantial evidence which may be evidence on the record at the time any prior determination of the entitlement to benefits based on disability was made,or newly obtained evidence which relates to that determination which demonstrates that a prior determination was in error.
f emphasis added.
in the present case,this statutory provision is not applicable because,as a result of numerous appeals,there has not been a final determination and combs has not received benefits.by its terms,the plain language of f does not apply to combs pending claim for benefits.see hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.because combs has never received benefits,she is not a recipient of benefits.rather,she is,and always has been,a mere claimant for benefits for whom f is not applicable.
which defines good cause for the reopening of a decision,is also inapplicable 
we will not find good cause to reopen your case if the only reason for reopening is a change of legal interpretation or administrative ruling upon which the determination or decision was made.
again,however,because there has not been a final disposition of combs disability claim,the reopening of a prior decision is not at issue.the same is true with social security ruling,ssr,regarding periodic continuing disability review of previously awarded disability benefits.
in summary,the parties have poorly postured this case as an all or nothing proposition.to avoid the prohibition against retroactive rulemaking,combs asks this court to hold that the determinative date for purposes of retroactivity is the date on which the claim is filed,while defendant argues that this court should base any retroactivity analysis on the date of adjudication.i disagree with both positions and would hold that the operative date for purposes of retroactivity is the effective date that the regulation was changed.
although disability insurance benefits are determined for each month claimed beginning with the first month after his waiting period,a d emphasis added,the alj failed to apply the conclusive presumptions of obesity disability specified by listing for plaintiff claims for the period of may,to october,by instead applying the revised medical criteria to combs disability claim,the alj engaged in the application of retroactive rulemaking.accordingly,i would remand for a new hearing and a determination of whether plaintiff is entitled to disability benefits for the closed period of may,through october.with regard to the denial of benefits thereafter,i would affirm.
for these reasons,i respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.
in finding that the application of newly promulgated obesity rules did not have an impermissible retroactive effect on plaintiff with respect to her pending application for social security disability benefits,the lead opinion seriously misapprehends and oversimplifies the supreme court retroactivity jurisprudence.at its core,the lead opinion asserts two positions the shift from listing to the new obesity rules was merely a procedural change that did not have an impermissible retroactive effect and plaintiff did not rely on listing in becoming disabled.these positions are incorrect and irrelevant,respectively.i therefore respectfully dissent.
plaintiff is a former seamstress and daycare employee.plaintiff claims that as of may,she was disabled due to morbid obesity,fibromyalgia,degenerative disc disease of the lumbosacral spine,degenerative arthritis bilateral knees,and other severe physical ailments,as well as depression.plaintiff filed an application for disability benefits on november.after an initial denial of her application,plaintiff requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.on january,the alj denied the request.on october,the appeals council vacated the decision of the alj and granted plaintiff a hearing.in february,over two years after plaintiff initial application,the alj held a hearing and then subsequently denied plaintiff application.
the appeals council vacated the decision of the alj and remanded plaintiff case on the ground that the alj failed to properly analyze plaintiff impairments.on september,on remand,the alj again denied plaintiff application.the appeals council again vacated the decision of the alj and remanded plaintiff case on the grounds that the alj failed to properly analyze plaintiff impairments and the alj incorrectly analyzed plaintiff credibility.the case was remanded to another alj,who in february denied plaintiff application as well.the appeals council declined to reverse this decision.
when plaintiff filed her application for disability benefits in,listing was in effect.that listing stated that an applicant who met a certain combination so as to demonstrate morbid obesity and who also suffered from an additional,specific impairment would be presumed to be disabled and would be entitled to disability benefits listing was still in effect in february,when the alj erroneously analyzed plaintiff impairments and denied plaintiff application.from the record,it is clear that plaintiff had a strong case for presumptive disability under listing.at the first hearing,had the alj correctly analyzed plaintiff impairments,he most likely would have found plaintiff to be disabled.the social security administration ssa deleted listing on august,almost three years after plaintiff applied for disability benefits.the final,binding decision of the alj did not occur until february,so that plaintiff could not employ listing to establish her disability.
the lead opinion expends a scant amount of ink in explaining the nuances of supreme court cases pertaining to retroactivity.this lack of exposition is somewhat surprising,when one considers that the supreme court has stated that retroactivity analysis does not lend itself to easy application.see landgraf usi film.any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases,and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.further clarification of certain cases is in order and will assist in illuminating the deficiencies in the lead opinion.
the supreme court current position on retroactivity is best described in landgraf usi film products.in that case,the plaintiff was employed by the defendant from to.id.at.a fellow employee harassed the plaintiff with inappropriate remarks and physical contact.id.at.the plaintiff complained to the defendant management,and management conducted an investigation,reprimanded the harassing employee,and transferred that employee to another department.id.four days later,the plaintiff quit.id.the plaintiff filed a charge against the defendant with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,but the eeoc dismissed the charge because it found that while the plaintiff had suffered from a hostile work environment,the defendant had adequately remedied the situation.id.the plaintiff then filed suit in federal district court.id.in a bench trial,the court dismissed the plaintiff complaint it found that while the plaintiff had suffered from a hostile work environment,she was not constructively discharged by the defendant.id.the plaintiff appealed.
on november,while the plaintiff appeal was pending,the president signed into law the civil rights act of.id.at.prior to this legislation,the civil rights act of only provided for equitable remedies,such as backpay,in cases of discrimination.id.at.under the civil rights act of,however,a person who has suffered from discrimination could also recover compensatory and punitive damages.id.moreover,a person seeking compensatory and punitive damages is entitled to a jury trial.id.
the plaintiff argued before the court of appeals that the court should remand her case to the district court for a jury trial on the issues of compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to the civil rights act of.id.at.the court rejected this argument,reasoning that the civil rights act of could not be retroactively applied to the defendant,inasmuch as such application would be unjust because it would increase the defendant liability for conduct that occurred before the enactment of the civil rights act of.id.at.
the supreme court affirmed.the court found that the civil rights act of expanded the potential forms of relief available to a person who has suffered discrimination.id.at.in addition,the newly enacted legislation increased the scope of actionable conduct before the act,the plaintiff could not recover monetary relief unless the discrimination was also found to have some concrete effect on the plaintiff employment status,such as a denied promotion,a differential in compensation,or termination.id.at.under the act,however,a plaintiff could recover in circumstances in which there has been unlawful discrimination in the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,even though the discrimination did not involve a discharge or a loss of pay.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the first question the court addressed was whether the statutory text on which the plaintiff relies manifests an intent that the act should be applied to cases that arose and went to trial before its enactment.id.at.the court answered in the negative,finding that the text of the statute was ambiguous as to a congressional intent of retroactive application of the act.the court reasoned,it is entirely,highly because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue,congress viewed the matter as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.id.at.
next,the court addressed whether,despite the lack of clear congressional intent,the act could be retroactively applied to the defendant.the court found that there was a presumption against retroactive legislation elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.id.at.on the other hand,r etroactivity provisions often serve entirely benign and legitimate purposes,whether to respond to emergencies,to correct mistakes,to prevent circumvention of a new statute in the interval immediately preceding its passage,or simply to give comprehensive effect to a new law congress considers salutary.id.at.the court warned that deciding when a statute operates retroactively is not always a simple or mechanical task.id.at.more specifically 
a statute does not apply retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment,or upsets expectations based in prior law.rather,the court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.the conclusion that a particular rule operates retroactively comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases,and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.however,retroactivity is a matter on which judges have sound instinct s,and familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations offer sound guidance.
id.at.alteration in the original internal citations omitted.
despite the presumption against retroactivity,the court recognized that,in many situations,a court should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,even though that law was enacted after the events that gave rise to the suit.id.at.internal citation omitted.for example,w hen the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief,application of the new provision is not retroactive.id.in another example,the court stated,we have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction,whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.id.at.
importantly for plaintiff case,the court also reasoned that 
c hanges in procedural rules may often be applied in suits arising before their enactment without raising concerns about retroactivity we have noted the diminished reliance interests in the matter of procedure because rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct,the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial retroactive.
id.at.internal citations omitted.the court warned,however,that o f course,the mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it applies to every pending case our orders approving amendments to federal procedural rules reflect the commonsense notion that the applicability of such provisions ordinarily depends on the posture of the particular case.id.at.
the court offered these final words of guidance 
when a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit,the court first task is to determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.if congress has done so,of course,there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.when,however,the statute contains no such express command,the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if the statute would operate retroactively,our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.
id.at.armed with these principles,the court found that application of the act would have an impermissible retroactive effect on the conduct of the defendant.specifically,the court found that retroactive application of punitive damages would raise serious constitutional concerns with respect to the ex post facto clause.id.at.with respect to compensatory damages,the court found that t he introduction of a right to compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have an impact on private parties planning i f applied here,compensatory damages would attach an important new legal burden to that conduct.id.at.the court also found that because the act increased the scope of actionable conduct,it created a new cause of action that could not be retroactively applied to the defendant.id.at.
in martin hadix,d,the supreme court held that a provision of the prison litigation reform act of plra that limited attorney fees could not be applied to legal work performed before the plra enactment.prior to the plra,attorneys who worked on behalf of the prisoners in two specific federal cases that addressed prison conditions were entitled to the prevailing market rate,which was per hour at the time the work was performed.id.at.pursuant to the plra,however,the rate for prisoner legal work was set with respect to the rate of attorneys.id.at.as a result,attorneys who worked on behalf of the prisoners were only entitled to per hour.id.the issue was whether the plra limitation could apply to legal work performed before the enactment of the plra but where the fee request was filed after the enactment of the plra.id.at.
the supreme court answered in the negative.under the first step of landgraf,the court found that congress had not expressed a clear intent that the plra apply to legal work performed prior to the enactment of the plra.id.at.under the second step of landgraf,the court found that application of the plra to legal work would result in an impermissible retroactive effect.the court reasoned that the attorneys in the case 
had a reasonable expectation that work they performed prior to enactment of the plra would be compensated at the rates c ounsel performed a specific task and they were told that they would be compensated at a rate of per hour.thus,when the lawyers provided these services before the enactment of the plra,they worked in reasonable reliance on this fee schedule.the plra,as applied to work performed before its effective date,would alter the fee arrangement post hoc by reducing the rate of compensation.to give effect to the plra fees limitations,after the fact,would attac h new legal consequences to completed conduct.
id.at.second alteration in the original citation omitted.
the court rejected the respondent argument that the fee provision of the plra was collateral to the main cause of action and therefore was not impermissibly retroactive under landgraf.id.at.the court admitted that in landgraf,the court stated that the question of attorney fees did not change the substantive obligations of the parties because they are collateral to the main cause of action.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court,however,warned about generalizations in the retroactivity analysis 
while it may be possible to generalize about types of rules that ordinarily will not raise retroactivity concerns,these generalizations do not end the inquiry.for example,in landgraf,we acknowledged that procedural rules may often be applied to pending suits with no retroactivity problems,but we also cautioned that the mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it applies to every pending case we took pains to dispel the sugges tion that concerns about retroactivity have no application to procedural rules.when determining whether a new statute operates retroactively,it is not enough to attach a label,procedural,collateral to the statute we must ask whether the statute operates retroactively.
id.alteration in the original internal citations omitted.the court found that though the attorney fees were collateral,that label did not preclude a retroactivity analysis.id.
in republic of austria altmann,the supreme court held that the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia applied to claims based on conduct that occurred prior to the fsia enactment,d.the fsia was a codification of sovereign immunity principles and exempted foreign nations from the jurisdiction of state and federal courts,except in certain specific circumstances.id.at.one of these exceptions was when property was taken in violation of international law.id.the plaintiff in that case sued the republic of austria and the austrian gallery in federal court,alleging that the gallery obtained possession of valuable paintings belonging to her uncle through wrongful conduct that occurred during world war ii and the years directly afterward.id.at.the plaintiff claimed that she was the rightful owner of these paintings according to her uncle will.id.at.the defendants claimed that,at the time when the wrongful conduct occurred,they would have been absolutely immune to suit in federal court.id.at.they claimed that application of the fsia to allow jurisdiction over the case would have an impermissible retroactive effect.id.
the supreme court disagreed and held that the district court had jurisdiction to hear the case.the court first noted that while there was language in the fsia suggesting that congress intended the fsia to apply to preenactment conduct,that language was not so clear so as to be an expres s prescri ption of the statute proper reach.id.at.alterations in the original quotation marks omitted.the court then proceeded to determine whether the statute had an impermissible retroactive effect.the court found that the fsia defied categorization as either a substantive or procedural provision.id.at.the court,however,ruled that the presumption against retroactivity did not apply to changes in sovereign immunity,inasmuch as the purpose of sovereign immunity was not so that foreign nations could shape their conduct around such immunity.id.at.instead,sovereign immunity was a gesture of comity based on current political realities and relationships.id.in other words,the underlying rationale for the presumption against retroactivity did not exist in the sovereign immunity context.in bolstering its decision,the court found that the language of the statute and its structure,while not clear enough to be considered an express command from congress,strongly suggested that congress intended the fsia to reach claims based upon preenactment conduct.id.at.
the lead opinion asserts that the deletion of listing and the subsequent implementation of new obesity rules constituted procedural,as opposed to substantive,changes,so that plaintiff did not suffer from an impermissible retroactive effect.nothing could be further from the truth.as judge griffin explains in his separate opinion,and as judge gilman agrees in his separate opinion,burdens of proof are substantive,not procedural,law.see,raleigh illinois dep t of revenue,d given its importance to the outcome of cases,we have long held the burden of proof to be a substantive aspect of a claim.emphasis supplied,office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,d but the assignment of the burden of proof is a rule of substantive law dick new york life ins,d p resumptions and their effects and burden of proof are substantive.in the same vein,presumptions,such as that found in listing,are substantive law.see id see also allentown mack sales and,d explaining that evidentiary presumptions are substantive rules of law.no matter what label the lead opinion attaches,the shift from listing to the new obesity rules was a substantive change in the law,so that application of the new rules had an impermissible retroactive effect on plaintiff 
moreover,even without the preceding case law on the substantive nature of burdens of proof and presumptions,the lead opinion assertion that the change in the ssa obesity rules was procedural would still be improper.the supreme court has repeatedly warned against mechanically labeling a change in law as procedural and therefore not subject to the presumption against retroactivity.see martin,at.when determining whether a new statute operates retroactively,it is not enough to attach a label,procedural,collateral to the statute we must ask whether the statute operates retroactively.landgraf,at.the question then becomes what the proper inquiry should be to determine whether a change in law has an impermissible retroactive effect,without relying on the judicial shortcuts of calling the change procedural or substantive.
the analysis of the circuit is persuasive in this regard.in national mining association department of labor,the court addressed new rules promulgated by the department of health and human services dhhs pursuant to the black lung benefits act blba,legislation designed to provide disability benefits to coal miners.the bulk of these new rules provided procedures that made it easier for coal miners to assert a claim of disability.id.at.the dhhs argued that the new rules were only procedural and did not affect substantive rights.the court responded 
rather than rely on procedural and substantive labels,a court must ask whether the regulation operates retroactively this inquiry involves a commonsense,functional judgment about whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.thus,where a rule changes the law in a way that adversely affects a party prospects for success on the merits of the claim,it may operate retroactively even if designated procedural by the secretary.
id.at alterations in the original internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a specific example of a seemingly procedural change that the court struck down as impermissibly retroactive was.the regulation created 
a rebuttable presumption that when a miner who is eligible for black lung benefits receives medical treatment for a pulmonary disorder,the disorder is caused or aggravated by the miner pneumoconiosis.e.the employer may rebut the presumption with credible evidence that the medical service or supply provided was for a pulmonary disorder apart from those previously associated with the miner disability or was beyond the treatment necessary to treat the covered disorder,or was not for a pulmonary disorder at all.id.
id.at.before this new regulation,a miner was required to affirmatively prove that his pulmonary disorder was caused or aggravated by his pneumoconiosis in order to qualify for benefits in the form of payment of the medical expenses in connection with the pulmonary disorder.with the new regulation,the dhhs presumed that the pulmonary disorder was caused or aggravated by the miner pneumoconiosis and the miner was therefore eligible for benefits.thus,the miner employer was more likely to lose a claim under the new regulation where the miner asserted a pulmonary disease.this was the precise situation where a rule changes the law in a way that adversely affects a party prospects for success on the merits of the claim,id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,so that the court found that the new regulation was retroactive and could not be applied to pending cases,id.at.
the instant case presents almost identical circumstances,except that the burden shift was in the opposite direction.under listing,if plaintiff met certain criteria,there was an irrebuttable presumption that plaintiff was disabled and thus entitled to benefits.under the new obesity rules,plaintiff must actually prove disability at step three,four,or five of the ssa process in order to qualify for benefits.in kokal massanari,a district court viewed the deletion of listing in this manner here,plaintiff rights would be substantively altered if the change in obesity rules was deemed applicable to pending claims,because the revised regulation would raise the bar on proof of disability based on obesity.d.as the facts of this case so aptly demonstrate,the new obesity rules adversely affected plaintiff prospects for success on the merits.these new rules thus had an impermissible retroactive effect and should not have been applied to plaintiff pending application for disability benefits.
judge gilman position that national mining association is directly on point and persuasive therefore clashes and is irreconcilable with his conclusion that the deletion of listing and the application of the new obesity rules to plaintiff was not impermissibly retroactive.under national mining association,the inquiry is whether a rule changes the law in a way that adversely affects a party prospects for success on the merits of the claim.mining,at alteration in the original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this inquiry answers whether the change in law is impermissibly retroactive,not whether the change in law is substantive or procedural.id.at.in this case,it is without question that the change in law,from listing to the new obesity rules,adversely affected plaintiff prospects for success on the merits of her disability claim.the persuasive and apposite analysis of national mining association invariably leads to the conclusion that the application of the new obesity rules to plaintiff disability claim had an impermissible retroactive effect concurring,judge gilman,at.
the circuit analysis comports with the supreme court guidance in landgraf.the supreme court called on the lower courts to utilize familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations in a retroactivity analysis.landgraf,at.when application of new law would adversely affect a party prospects for success on the merits,as it did in this case,these familiar considerations counsel against retroactive application of the new law.this remains true even if the new law is superficially labeled as procedural.
the lead opinion repeated reliance on altmann,in deeming that the change in the ssa obesity rules is procedural,is puzzling.altmann was not a case whose decision hinged upon the supreme court determination that the relevant change in law was procedural indeed,the supreme court specifically rejected that argument 
under landgraf,it is appropriate to ask whether the act affects substantive rights and thus would be impermissibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct or addresses only matters of procedure and thus may be applied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.but the fsia defies such categorization.
at.emphasis supplied.the court decision did not rely on the line in its analysis.instead,the basis of the decision was that the fsia defined the boundaries of sovereign immunity,a principle where the presumption against retroactivity was inapplicable in that sui generis context.id.at.altmann simply can not be read to support the notion that the shift in obesity rules was merely procedural.
the lead opinion misapprehension of altmann is readily apparent when it cites to that case to support the proposition that a statute that has been held to be substantive in one context is not thereby made substantive for retroactivity purposes.lead op.at.there is absolutely no language in altmann that says such a thing.as stated above,altmann explicitly states that the fsia defied categorization as either substantive or procedural law.at.the pages to which the lead opinion cites continue and state that,even though the fsia was not clearly substantive or procedural,the general presumption against retroactivity did not apply to sovereign immunity,as sovereign immunity reflected current political realities and relationships,as opposed to a set of laws on which the foreign countries relied to shape their conduct.id.at.the supreme court did not hold that the fsia was substantive in one context,lead op.at,and the supreme court most certainly did not hold that substantive law in one context may not be substantive law in the retroactivity context,so that the application of the fsia would not have an impermissible retroactive effect on the defendants in that case.there is no support for the lead opinion assertion that substantive law may,through some form of judicial alchemy,become some other type of law for purposes of retroactivity analysis.
the lead opinion also states that the relevant activity here is adjudicatory conduct,so that the deletion of listing and the application of the new rules did not have a retroactive effect 
changes to these listings consequently have their effect on benefits applications when claimants reach step three in the process of adjudicating their claims.
a rule regulating the evaluation and presentation of proof does not normally operate retroactively if it is applied to pending cases.the ssa may freely change rules that purely govern the conduct of adjudication,without fear of retroactive effect,if those changes apply only to pending cases.
lead op.at.as an initial note,this is a repackaging of the lead opinion previous argument labeling the deletion of listing and the promulgation of new rules as a procedural change.the phrase adjudicatory conduct is simply another way to describe procedure in the litigation process.this is especially apparent in the lead opinion use of the phrase evaluation and presentation of proof and the lead opinion characterization of listing as a rule of adjudication the lead opinion is reasserting its position that changes in procedure do not give rise to an impermissible retroactive effect.obviously,a change in the burden of proof or in a presumption addresses the adjudication of a claim however,this does not necessarily mean that such a change does not have an impermissible retroactive effect.for the reasons set forth in addressing the lead opinion analysis,this argument fails.moreover,taken to its logical endpoint,the lead opinion inquiry is contrary to supreme court precedent.for example,in landgraf,the statute at issue was the civil rights act of,which stated that a plaintiff that brought suit on a discrimination claim could seek compensatory and punitive damages.at.one could quite plausibly describe the statute as addressing adjudicatory conduct,as it describes what types of damages a plaintiff may seek when she brings a claim.according to the lead opinion logic,the fact that the civil rights act of addressed adjudicatory conduct would lead to the inescapable conclusion that the statute could be applied to pending cases,a result that is at odds with the decision in landgraff.likewise,the lead opinion would find no impermissible retroactive effect in applying to pending cases the challenged provisions in national mining association those provisions too dealt with adjudicatory conduct in that they changed certain presumptions and burdens of the parties when a black lung benefits claim was raised.the point is simple labeling an action as adjudicatory conduct is as helpful as labeling an action as procedural,which is to say that it is of no help at all.by resting its decision on these labels,the lead opinion ignores the true retroactive harm that has befallen plaintiff in the application of the new regulations to her disability application.
because the deletion of listing was a substantive change,our analysis should be concluded the ssa application of the new rules to plaintiff disability claim had an impermissible retroactive effect.i would therefore remand the case to the ssa to review plaintiff application under listing i write further only to address a peculiar argument raised by the lead plaintiff did not rely on listing in becoming disabled,so that the deletion of listing did not work an impermissible retroactive effect.
at the risk of stating the obvious,most if not all of this country disabled did not rely on ssa rules and regulations or even disability benefits in becoming disabled.inherent in this point is that a person generally does not choose to become disabled a disability is ordinarily the product of circumstances beyond the control of the person whom it afflicts.but the absence of reliance on law in becoming disabled is not dispositive in determining whether a change in that law has an impermissible retroactive effect.under the lead opinion analysis,the ssa could theoretically withdraw the availability of disability benefits from all pending applicants and still pass muster under landgraf,as none of these applicants relied on ssa rules or regulations or disability benefits in becoming disabled in fact,under the lead opinion interpretation of landgraf,the ssa could even withdraw disability benefits from actual recipients who previously qualified for such benefits,as the recipients also did not rely on ssa rules or regulations or disability benefits in becoming disabled,nor could the recipients claim reliance on disability benefits in ceasing work,as such recipients claimed that it was their disabilities that prevented them from working the lead opinion logic,that because plaintiff did not rely on ssa rules or regulations in becoming disabled,the application of new rules does not work an impermissible retroactive effect,strikes with too broad a stroke such an inelegant approach would find no retroactive harm in even the most blatant of cases.
it is plain that plaintiff did not rely on ssa rules and regulations in becoming disabled.this fact,however,is irrelevant as to whether the application of the new rules would work an impermissible retroactive effect.the facts in landgraf illustrate this point one could not say that the defendant employer somehow relied on the civil rights act of and permitted a hostile work environment so that application of the civil rights act of would have a retroactive effect.it would be facetious to argue that an employer allows a hostile work environment in reliance on the limited remedies provided by the civil rights act of,just as it would be facetious to argue that a person becomes disabled in reliance on the rules and regulations available to establish a disability claim.yet the supreme court still found an impermissible retroactive effect in landgraf.the question then becomes what exactly was the underlying act in landgraf that the supreme court held to be protected from retroactive application of new law.
the supreme court found that the underlying act of the employer in landgraf was its planning on how to address a hostile work environment claim the introduction of a right to compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have an impact on private parties planning.at.specifically,the court stated that t he new damages provisions can be expected to give managers an added incentive to ward off discriminatory conduct by subordinates before it occurs.id.at.under the civil rights act of,the employer was liable only for equitable remedies as a result,it planned accordingly by allocating expenditures,effort,and policies commensurate with the possible liability.under the civil rights act of,the employer was subject to a much broader range of remedies,so that it would have planned a much greater allocation of resources to remedy the problem of a hostile work environment.thus,the supreme court found that application of the civil rights act of to the employer would have had a retroactive effect,as the employer had planned its discrimination policies based on the civil rights act of.
plaintiff case presents a similar issue of planning based on the ssa eligibility requirements for disability benefits.the difficulty of proving eligibility for benefits is certainly a factor considered by an individual in disability planning.for example,suppose that qualifying for social security disability benefits is extremely difficult only of applicants eventually receive benefits,and this is only after a torturous eligibility review process.an individual might look at the difficulty in proving eligibility and plan accordingly,by purchasing a third party disability insurance policy with less exacting requirements,by increasing her level of savings in case of disability in the future,and other such measures.likewise,if qualifying for social security disability benefits were extremely easy,an individual might have a very different portfolio mix in her planning,as she would not invest heavily in instruments that hedge the risk of disability.thus,in this case,plaintiff did not become disabled in reliance on the disability benefits scheme available at the time but rather,she planned for the possibility of becoming disabled in reliance on the disability benefits scheme available at the time.had plaintiff known that the ssa requirements for eligibility would have changed so dramatically,she might have been inclined to alter her planning.this is especially true with respect to plaintiff situation,where her application for disability benefits was pending for a number of years.this is the reason why application of the new obesity rules would have a retroactive effect on plaintiff planning under listing.
the lead opinion appears to believe that a reliance theory based on disability planning proves too much,as such a theory would for many,many years preclude application of newly enacted legislation to those who planned in accordance with the old scheme.lead op.at.this is incorrect and contrary to supreme court precedent.a simple example will illustrate this point the supreme court did not hold in landgraf that because the defendant employer,before,relied on the civil rights act of in planning how to address a hostile work environment,an employee could never raise or,for many,many years could not raise a claim under the civil rights act of,even for claims based on events after.instead,the supreme court held that a court could not apply the civil rights act of to the defendant employer for activity that took place before because it did not have the opportunity to plan according to that act with specific respect to such activity.landgraf,at.in other words,reliance on the old scheme in a party planning is not sufficient to demonstrate that the application of the new scheme would have an impermissible retroactive effect.instead,a party reliance on the old scheme in its planning,coupled with the party inability to change its planning in accordance with the new scheme,would demonstrate an impermissible retroactive effect if the new scheme were applied to that party.in this case,it is undisputed that plaintiff was unable to change her disability planning to accommodate the deletion of listing and implementation of the new obesity rules,which occurred in,because she became disabled in.in contrast,suppose plaintiff became disabled in.in that case,even though plaintiff,before,had planned based on the old regime,she also had the ability to change her planning to accommodate the rules of the new regime,so that the application of the new obesity rules would not have a retroactive effect.such is not the case here.
the effect on plaintiff disability planning also illustrates why the deletion of listing and the implementation of a new regulation was a substantive,as opposed to a procedural,change.a procedural change usually does not work an impermissible retroactive effect because a party usually does not rely on rules of procedure we have noted the diminished reliance interests in the matter of procedure because rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct,the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial retroactive.landgraf,at.citations omitted.in short,procedural rules may generally be retroactively applied,because even if a party had known of a procedural change in advance,it would not have changed its conduct prior to the lawsuit.united states real property in section,town north,range west township of charlton,cir citing landgraf,at.because a change from one procedure to another generally has an ambiguous and unknown effect on a party,a party usually does not fashion its conduct according to procedural rules.here,however,had plaintiff known of the change to the obesity rules in advance,she definitely would have changed her conduct in that her disability planning would have been significantly different 
national mining association is a textbook example of how a change in rules and regulations in establishing a claim may have an impermissible retroactive effect on a party planning based on the old regime.in that case,the mine operators purchased insurance to cover their liabilities for claims under the blba.at.the insurance companies charged a premium that corresponded to the difficulty in establishing a blba claim under the rules and regulations at that time.the dhhs subsequently promulgated numerous rules that made it easier for a coal miner to establish a blba claim.id.the net effect of these rules was that the insurance companies needed to set higher premiums in order to offset the increase in potential liability.id.the court found that where the new rules affected substantive liability determinations,the rules operated retroactively on pending claims.id.at citing martin,at.
