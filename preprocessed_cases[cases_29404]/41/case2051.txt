this case concerns a clash of competing interests the mission of health clinics to provide a panoply of medical services to communities on the one hand,and california persistent budget woes on the other.we must decide whether california legislation that eliminates coverage for certain healthcare services,including adult dental,podiatry,optometry and chiropractic services,conflicts with the medicaid act,et,and is therefore invalid.we hold that medicaid prohibits the limitations adopted by the california legislature and,accordingly,we reverse and remand.
background 
title xix of the social security act,referred to as the medicaid act,is a cooperative program through which the federal government provides financial assistance to states so that they can furnish medical care to individuals.wilder.hosp.ass n,citing,superseded on other grounds by statute.medicaid is jointly financed by federal and state governments and administered by the states through state plans approved by the secretary for health and human services.
states are not required to participate in medicaid,but those states that opt in to the system must comply with both the statutory requirements imposed by medicaid and with regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services.alaska dep t of health soc.servs.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,cir see also.as part of this requirement,states must cover certain services in their plans,a a.these services include those provided by rural health clinics health centers that provide services in rural areas with insufficient numbers of healthcare practitioners,and federally qualified health centers health centers that serve a medically population.a,l,aa.in addition,each state may opt to cover additional services or may extend services to populations that may not otherwise be covered.see id.a.each state has discretion to create reasonable standards for determining eligibility for medical services and the extent of those services,provided those standards comply with federal law.schweiker gray panthers.
california participates in medicaid through the california medical assistance program medi cal,which the california department of health services department administers.cal.welf,et.the department is responsible for establishing and complying with the state plan and must submit any state plan amendments spa to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for review and approval.a.the department also ensures that medi cal provides covered services to eligible beneficiaries and reimburses providers for their services.
in february,california found itself in the throes of a budget crisis.as a measure,the state legislature passed california welfare and institutions code,which eliminated certain medical benefits that the state deemed optional,including adult dental,podiatry,optometry and chiropractic services.the department amended california state plan accordingly,and submitted the spa for approval.in the meantime,the department discontinued reimbursement for services listed in.
the california association of rural health clinics and the avenal community health center,a federally qualified health center,collectively,the clinics,challenged the implementation of under a federal preemption theory.the clinics sought declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the implementation of,arguing that federal law prohibits the elimination of coverage of certain services,including adult dental,podiatry,optometry and chiropractic services.the clinics also contended that the department violated federal law by failing to obtain approval of the spa before discontinuing reimbursement.
the department countered that the clinics did not have a private right of action to bring either claim,that federal law permitted the exclusion of the optional services covered by,and that the department was not required to obtain approval of the amendments to the state plan before implementing those amendments.
the district court held that the clinics had a private right of action to bring their claims,that was not in conflict with medicaid requirements,and that the department was required to obtain approval for amendments to the state plan before implementing the changes.the court therefore granted declaratory relief to the clinics on the spa claim and enjoined further enforcement of pending cms approval of the spa.
after the district court entered judgment,but prior to the briefing on appeal,cms approved the department spa with a retroactive effective date of july.this timely appeal followed.
the clinics challenge the district court holding that is consistent with the medicaid act.the department,challenging the clinics private right of action to pursue their claims,as well as the injunctive relief granted to the clinics on their spa claim.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse the district court holding that the clinics have a private right of action to challenge the department implementation of the spa prior to obtaining approval.we affirm that the clinics have a private right of action to bring a claim pursuant to challenging the validity of.finally,we reverse the district court interpretation of the medicaid act and hold that impermissibly eliminates mandatory services from coverage.

iii.discussion 
private right of action to bring claim 
relying on,the clinics challenge as preempted by federal law.the department contends that the clinics do not have a private right of action to challenge because congress did not confer entitlements on them when it enacted bb,the medicaid provision at issue.
section safeguards certain rights conferred by federal statutes,but a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,not merely a violation of federal law.blessing freestone.three factors help determine whether a particular statutory provision gives rise to a federal right.
first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather then precatory,terms.
id.at citations and quotations omitted.the question is whether or not congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries with language.gonzaga doe,citations and quotations omitted.
whether the clinics have a private right of action under to challenge is a novel issue in this circuit we do not write on an entirely blank slate,however.in,we upheld an injunction that prevented the washington state department of social and health services from enforcing a state regulation that conflicted with the federally approved washington state medicaid plan.state health facilities ass.dep t of soc.health,cir per curiam,abrogated on other grounds by dev.serv.network douglas,cir.in that case we decided that the medicaid act did in fact confer a private right of action on the provider to enforce rights created by a e,which concerned the method for reimbursing nursing care facilities that accept medicaid patients.id.at.
we made the same assumption in oregon association of homes for the aging,state of oregon,cir.there,we held that a temporary rule reclassifying nursing services,which had the effect of reducing significantly the rate of reimbursement provided for those services,was invalid because the state did not submit the change for federal approval.id.at.the opinion did not discuss,but instead assumed,that a private right of action existed under to challenge the state failure to submit amendments to the state plan for federal approval before implementing those changes as required by a.id.at.
and in exeter memorial hospital association belshe exeter ii,we adopted the district court opinion,which noted that the parties agreed that a action was available to challenge the state failure to obtain approval of amendments to a state plan before implementing those changes under the boren amendment,cir,abrogated on other grounds by dev.serv.network,at.
although we held in developmental services network douglas,at,that medicaid providers did not have a private right of action,there we considered a different provision of the medicaid act than the one now before us.in that case,we had to decide whether medicaid providers had a private right of action to challenge california legislation setting provider reimbursement rates.id.at.the providers argued that the california provision conflicted with a a,a provision that required the state to consider the quality of care provided in setting medicaid payment rates.id.at.we held that the providers did not have a private right of action because no provision appear ed to unambiguously confer a right upon the providers and because the statutory provision requiring the submission of state plan amendments to federal authorities appear ed to be a general or administrative provision rather than one which confers individual entitlements.id.at.
in developmental services,we also noted that although washington state health facilities and oregon homes for the aging allowed for a action,neither actually discussed the question about what specific provision conferred a cause of action upon providers they were quite general,even ambiguous,in that regard.id.at.in addition,we recounted that the parties agreed in exeter ii that a action was available.id.at.and all three cases preceded gonzaga university,which clarified the requirements for bringing a action.id.at see also gonzaga,at,holding that the question is whether or not congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries with language.
against this backdrop,we must decide whether congress intended to confer on the clinics a private right of action to challenge as violating bb.it did.again,we must be clear at the outset that none of the cases we have discussed considered whether a action exists to contend that a state had violated bb,the statutory provision before us.that provision reads beginning with fiscal year with respect to services furnished on or after january,and each succeeding fiscal year,the state plan shall provide for payment for services furnished by a health center and services furnished by a rural health clinic in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.u.bb see also bb setting forth procedures for payment of services.this language persuades us that congress intended to confer individual rights upon the clinics with specific language.gonzaga,at,internal quotation marks omitted.first,the statutory text refers to rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers specifically by name,thus making the clinics named beneficiaries.blessing,at.further,the right to payment for services rendered is neither vague nor amorphous the statute plainly requires state plans to pay for services furnished by fqhcs and rhcs.id.finally,the statute imposes a mandatory obligation,stating that the state plan shall provide for payment for services.bb emphasis added.
because the language contained in bb is not general or administrative but contains specific language,it reflects congress intent to create new rights enforceable under in clear and unambiguous terms.gonzaga,at see also dev,at.thus,we now join several of our sister circuits in holding that medicaid providers have a private right of action to bring a claim to enforce bb.
b.the medicaid act prohibits the limitations contained in 
we do not accord chevron deference to cms approval 
after the district court entered judgment,cms approved the spa the clinics challenge on appeal.we ordered the parties to brief the effect of this approval on the pending appeal and to address the level of deference,if any,we owed cms approval of the spa.
it is clear that we can not defer to cms on any issue about which congress has directly spoken,such that the intent of congress is clear.see chevron natural res.def.council.while the question of statutory interpretation before us is difficult,we can not fairly say that congress was silent or ambiguous with respect to the issue at hand.alaska dep t of health,at.thus,we hold that chevron deference does not apply,and we therefore do not defer to cms approval of the challenged spa.
in considering whether chevron deference applies,we must first identify the precise question at issue.chevron,at.as discussed,medicaid requires states plans to cover,among other things,rural health clinic services and health center services.a,l,aa.both these categories of services incorporate physicians services.compare r with a a.california reads the medicaid act as permitting it to reimburse rhcs and fqhcs for only those physicians services performed by doctors of medicine and osteopathy.cal.welf.physicians services provided by other types of physicians,including dentists,podiatrists,optometrists and chiropractors,are no longer covered.id.cms implicitly approved california interpretation of the medicaid act when it approved the department spa post judgment.
the question we must answer is whether congress has defined unambiguously the scope of physician services for which the clinics must be reimbursed.as we discuss in the following section,the statutory text provides a clear answer,and,thus,we do not defer to cms approval of the spa.
our recent decision in managed pharmacy care sebelius,cir.may,does not alter our view.there,we considered whether reductions in medi cal reimbursement rates were consistent with medicaid requirement that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care.a a.we described the statutory language there as amorphous and broad and diffuse.managed pharmacy,at quoting sanchez johnson,cir.we noted that the statute uses words like consistent,sufficient,efficiency,and economy but without describing any specific steps a state must take in order to meet those standards.id.thus,the imprecise language in question made the agency expertise relevant to determining how to understand and interpret the statute.id.
here,however,the statutory text does not use vague and amorphous words.instead,it outlines specifically the types of services provided by rhcs and fqhcs that a state plan must cover.congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.because the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.because we do not defer to cms approval of the spa,we must interpret medicaid to determine whether conflicts with federal law.
statutory interpretation 
the medicaid act requires participating states to cover certain services in their state plans.a referring to a.these mandatory services include rhc and fqhc services.id.a b c.specifically,medicaid requires payment for rural health clinic services as defined in subsection l of this section and any other ambulatory services which are offered by a rural health clinic as defined in subsection l of this section and which are otherwise included in the plan and health center services as defined in subsection l of this section and any other ambulatory services offered by a health center and which are otherwise included in the plan.id.a.subsections l and l refer to l and of the medicaid act,which define rhc and fqhc services by referring to the medicare act.id.l l aa aa.medicare defines rhc and fqhc services to include physicians services and services furnished by a physician assistant,nurse practitioner,clinical psychologist or clinical social worker.id.aa.
as noted by the district court,the parties agree on this description of the law to this point.they also agree that the physicians services referenced in the medicare statute are the core services that rhcs and fqhcs must provide pursuant to medicaid and for which they are entitled to reimbursement.but here the parties diverge they disagree on which source of law medicaid or medicare defines physicians services with respect to rhcs and fqhcs.
the clinics predicate their cl
