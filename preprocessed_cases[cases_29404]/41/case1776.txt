the plaintiffs brought this action under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,alleging that the defendants breached several fiduciary duties and violated the terms of two erisa plans.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss one claim and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this case results from the events leading up to the merger of central plains clinic,cpc with sioux valley physician partners,svc.the plaintiffs are former employees of cpc whose employment ended prior to the merger cpc administered two erisa plans in which the plaintiffs money purchase pension plan mppp and a profit sharing plan psp.the psp was discretionarily funded by cpc,while the mppp was a plan that provided for contributions by cpc based on a percentage of a compensation.cpc reserved the right to amend,modify,terminate,or suspend contributions to the mppp at any time.
in response to financial difficulties,on december,cpc adopted an amendment to the mppp that reduced cpc contributions to the mppp from percent of each participant compensation to zero.cpc informed participants that it hoped to resume contributions to the mppp in the future if cpc became financially stable.cpc maintained balance sheets that tracked the amounts that it would have contributed to the mppp from to if not for the amendment.for the calendar year,cpc contributed to the psp an amount equal to what it would have contributed to the mppp if not for the amendment.cpc made no contributions to either plan for the calendar years,and.
in,cpc separately met with svc and avera mckenna hospital to explore financial options,including a sale or merger.cpc elected to pursue a merger with svc,and on december,the parties executed a letter of intent to merge.as part of the proposed merger,svc offered bonuses to cpc employees who transferred to svc in amounts equal to the amounts that would have been contributed to the mppp if not for the amendment.on march,cpc adopted a merger and agreement,subject to shareholder approval.this agreement provided that physicians who remained with svc for two years after the merger and other employees who remained with svc for thirty days after the merger qualified for the bonuses.the agreement did not provide for retroactive funding of either plan.
meanwhile,cpc largest lender had urged avera to make an alternative proposal to cpc.in a proposal made to cpc shareholders on march,avera stated that it would pay physicians a ll pension contributions not made during the past two years.at.svc then agreed to pay cpc debt to the lender,and the cpc board of directors approved and executed the agreement with svc on april.the cpc board conducted a evaluation of the svc and avera proposals on april,and reaffirmed its decision to proceed with the svc merger.on april,cpc shareholders approved the merger.because the plaintiffs employment with cpc ended prior to the merger approval,they were ineligible for the bonuses.
the plaintiffs commenced this action asserting various erisa theories,including breaches of the plans,see a b,and breaches of fiduciary duties,see and.the plaintiffs sought funding of the mppp and psp and funding of the participants accounts for unpaid contributions,a declaratory judgment,an equitable accounting,and disgorgement of improper benefits.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss a claim alleging that the amendment was a breach of fiduciary duty.the plaintiffs do not appeal from that portion of the final judgment.the district court later granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the order.plaintiffs appeal with respect to the entry of summary judgment.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo and may affirm the judgment on any grounds supported by the record.bass sbc commc ns,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the plaintiffs claim that the defendants made an unequivocal promise that once cpc became financially stable,it would fund the plans in the amount that would have been contributed to the mppp absent the amendment.appellants br.at.according to the plaintiffs,because cpc knew that this would not occur,the promise amounted to a misrepresentation.the district court held that cpc statements,when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,were not misrepresentations.the plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether these statements constitute misrepresentations.
in deposition testimony,the plaintiffs stated that cpc made several statements between and that support their misrepresentation claim,such as cpc said they were going to keep track of the amount of unpaid contributions,and potentially if we got we got healed we get it back,at o nce the financial stability of the clinic improved,the psp would be funded,id.at and t hey also told us the amount of unpaid mppp contributions was going on the books and when they became financially stable they would pay it,id.at.the plaintiffs contrast these statements with a memorandum summarizing a merger proposed on october,that included a reference to the payment of bonuses instead of profit sharing contributions,id.at,and the december,letter of intent to merge that stated svc would either make a contribution to the psp or provide employees compensation in lieu of a psp contribution,id.at.the plaintiffs therefore conclude that cpc knowingly promised psp or mppp when it knew that would not occur.

before proceeding with the merits of any claim,we must address the threshold issue of whether the defendants were acting in a fiduciary or an employer capacity when the acts in question took place.pegram herdrich,d.under erisa,a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan
