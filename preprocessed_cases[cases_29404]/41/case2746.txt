this is margaret russell appeal from a judgment in favor of the north broward hospital district,her former employer,in the lawsuit she brought against it.the hospital terminated russell employment because it concluded that she had been absent from work too much.russell does not deny being away from work when the hospital says she was,but she contends that her absences were for medical reasons and were protected under the family and medical leave act,and for that reason the hospital could not fire her for being out of work.
the hospital does not deny that russell was out for reasons,but contends that her absences nonetheless were not protected leave under the fmla.if that is correct,the hospital was free to fire russell without running afoul of the the irony of its doing so,given the business it is in.
the correctness of the hospital legal position,and of the judgment it obtained based upon that position,depends on whether the medical condition which caused russell absences from work is a serious health condition involving continuing treatment,as that term is used in the fmla.the answer to that question,in turn,depends upon the interpretation and validity of,a regulation that the department of labor adopted to provide an objective definition for the terms serious health condition and continuing treatment.the regulation does so,in relevant part,by specifying that in order to qualify as a serious health condition involving continuing treatment under the fmla,the health condition must result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days.
the issue the facts of this case present about the meaning of the regulatory definition is whether the only days of incapacity that count are those in which the employee is incapacitated all day long.if so,the leave that russell took fails to meet the requirements of a serious health condition involving continuing treatment,as defined in the regulation,because she was never incapacitated for any continuous period of more than hours.our answer to that issue requires us to decide as well whether the regulation is invalid insofar as it adopts a definition of serious health condition involving continuing treatment that imposes a incapacity requirement.
those two issues are pretty much what this case is about,although there are also some collateral and ancillary issues which we need to address along the way to explaining our conclusion that more than three consecutive calendar days of incapacity means a period of continuous incapacity extending more than hours and our conclusion that this regulatory definition is not invalid.given those two holdings and the facts of this case,the last word in this opinion is affirmed.
margaret russell began working at the hospital as a patient accounts adjustment representative in june of.she was employed through a temporary employment agency until april,when the hospital gave her a permanent position.russell duties included computer work,light typing,filing,and telephone work.by of,russell had been disciplined three times for unscheduled absences.she had received a verbal reprimand on june,a written corrective action report on july,and a written final corrective action report on january.under the hospital progressive disciplinary system russell was suspended for three days without pay after her third transgression and risked termination if her absenteeism continued.
on may,russell slipped and fell at work.the events of the ten days immediately following that accident are at the heart of this appeal,so we lay them out in some detail.the same day that russell fell,the hospital employee health department referred her to the medwork clinic,a hospital approved workers compensation health care provider,for examination.she was diagnosed with a fractured right elbow and a sprained ankle later she learned that her ankle was actually fractured.when russell fell,she also aggravated an existing wrist condition for which she had been receiving treatment before she fell.the treating physician gave russell a sling for her arm and prescribed darvocet for her pain.the physician told russell that she could return to work,but restricted the use of her right arm.after leaving the medwork clinic and filling her prescription,russell did return to work and finish out her shift.
the next day,june,russell reported to work at but left at to go back to the medwork clinic because she was experiencing what she described as severe pain.medwork told her that she needed to consult an orthopaedist about her injuries.russell,still in pain,called her supervisor,marsha miller,and told her that she would not be returning to work that day.she also asked for the following day off,but miller refused.russell was paid for two hours of work and six hours of sick leave that day.
on june russell again reported to work at,but soon began to feel ill and started vomiting she says it was because she had taken her pain medication on an empty stomach.russell informed a supervisor that she could not continue working that day and she went home at also on june,luane rutt,the hospital workers compensation agent,authorized russell to see an orthopaedist and scheduled her an appointment for june.
russell testified that she was in excruciating pain over the weekend of june and.the record reveals nothing else about that weekend.on the following monday,june,russell went to see an orthopaedist,boutin,who certified that she could return to work but indicated that she should have light duty because she can not use right arm.boutin also told russell to keep taking the darvocet for her pain.she scheduled a appointment with boutin for a week later.after her appointment on june,russell went to work for the remainder of her shift,from about to because she was having trouble performing her duties,she requested the use of a speaker phone.the hospital did not provide her with one that day or at any other time during her final week of employment.
on june russell reported to work at but,because the pain had yet to subside,she asked miller if she could leave early.miller allowed her to do so,and russell left work at 
on june russell was scheduled for another appointment with medwork,but rutt called her at home the evening before,and again that morning,and told her not to go to medwork,but instead to wait for rutt to schedule an appointment for russell to see boutin that day.russell did not go in to work,but instead waited at home for rutt call.when rutt finally called back at she told russell that boutin office would be calling her with an appointment time.boutin office did call and tell russell she had an appointment for that afternoon.russell said she did not have enough time to get to that appointment and would not be going.she did not go to the appointment or to work,but she did call miller and explain why she had failed to report to work.the next day,june,russell worked a full day.
on june russell returned to see boutin,and one of his assistants placed her arm in a cast.she left the doctor office at and went home to get her medicine and change clothes.she fell asleep at home,did not go to work that day,and did not call to inform miller that she was going to be out.
on monday,june,miller called russell into her office shortly after russell reported to work.miller told her to go home,that human resources would contact her.the next day,miller called russell and asked her to come in for a meeting at.at the meeting,the hospital terminated russell employment because of her excessive absenteeism.
thereafter,russell filed this lawsuit claiming that the hospital had retaliated against her for exercising a protected fmla right.the protected right she claims is the right to be absent from work during the period between may and june,for a serious health condition russell complaint also includes a claim that the hospital fired her in retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim,in violation of the florida workers compensation act.on may,russell filed an amended complaint which added a claim under,but the district court later dismissed that claim,and russell does not pursue it on appeal.
at trial,in connection with her fmla claim russell submitted a jury instruction relating to the requirements for a serious health condition.her proposed instruction tracked the statutory language,but it did not include the requirement of more than three consecutive calendar days of incapacity.the hospital submitted its own proposed jury instruction,which did include the requirement.the district court,over russell objection,instructed the jury that more than three consecutive calendar days of incapacity are required to constitute a serious health condition.
during its deliberations,the jury submitted several questions about the definition of a serious health condition,the last of which was whether three consecutive partial days of incapacity could constitute a serious health condition.the district court told the jury that what is required is three consecutive calendar days,hours or more.shortly thereafter,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the hospital.
the district court entered final judgment for the hospital,and russell filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial.the district court denied that motion.
before turning to the primary issues on appeal,we need to address three preliminary ones the parties raise in their briefs a what type of fmla claim did russell bring b given the hospital progressive discipline system,can russell base her claim on the absences for which she was disciplined absences that resulted from her depression and migraine headaches and,c can russell establish her claim by showing that her wrist injury was a chronic serious health condition 
the two types of claims available to employees under the fmla are interference and retaliation claims.see strickland water works sewer,cir.in an interference claim the employee must show only that he or she was entitled to the benefit denied.in contrast,with a retaliation claim the employee faces the increased burden of showing that his employer actions were motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.russell,wanting to take advantage of the lesser burden for interference claims,has briefed this case as though she had brought an interference claim.the hospital will have none of it,though,and protests that russell pleaded and tried a retaliation claim,not an interference claim.
we need not decide which of those two legal theories russell pursued in the district court,because it does not matter.interference and retaliation claims both require the employee to establish a serious health condition,and as we will explain,russell has failed to do that.as a result,she has not established her entitlement to a benefit even under the more interference theory.
russell also contends that the early disciplinary measures taken against verbal counseling,written counseling,and for exercising leave that was protected under the fmla because it was leave caused by her needing treatment for depression and migraine headaches.she contends that even if the direct cause of her absences after her not protected conduct under the fmla,the termination nevertheless violated the act because it was the last step in a series of progressive disciplinary measures,and the earlier steps leading up to it were disciplinary actions imposed for leave that is protected under the act.
whatever the merits of this theory,it is not one russell presented to the district court.the following colloquy between her trial counsel and the court makes that clear 
the court a s i understand it,and i want you to correct me if i am wrong,there is no claim in this case that has anything to do with the family medical leave act,there is any violation of the family medical leave act regarding that depression time is that right 
russell counsel not a claim for that,but ties to the progressive discipline.
the court absolutely.the jury has a right to know in presenting all the information to the jury,but the jury needs to understand the only claim being made here,there is a violation of the family medical leave act because of the june,matters her slip and fall injuries we have been discussing.
consistent with that exchange,the district court later instructed the jury to focus on whether the actions that took place in june of constituted violations of the fmla,and russell did not object to that instruction.russell slip and fall accident is the only basis of the fmla claim she presented in the district court,and for that reason it is the only basis for recovery preserved for appeal.see irving mazda motor,cir too often our colleagues on the district courts complain that the appellate cases about which they read were not the cases argued before them.we can not allow plaintiff to argue a different case from the case she presented to the district court.
russell also contends that her existing wrist injury,aggravated in her fall,was a chronic serious health condition.chronic serious health conditions,she argues,do not require more than three consecutive calendar days of incapacity to qualify for fmla leave.see a iii.but see price marathon cheese,cir it is uncertain whether the three day requirement applies to chronic serious health conditions.there is no mention of a chronic serious health condition in russell complaint,in the pretrial stipulation,or in her motion for judgment as a matter of law.the evidence of russell wrist condition that was introduced at trial was offered only as background evidence to give the jury the entire picture of her health problems and employment history,not for the purpose of establishing the existence of a chronic serious health condition.russell contention that her wrist injury qualifies as a chronic serious health condition under the fmla is not properly before us.irving,at.
turning to the heart of this appeal,russell contends that the district court should have granted her motion for judgment as a matter of law because no reasonable jury could have found that she did not meet the requirement of incapacity for more than three consecutive calendar days.she argues that she established seven consecutive partial days of incapacity and maintains that partial days of incapacity always,as a matter of law,meet the regulatory definition requirements.
alternatively,russell contends that if we determine that partial days of incapacity do not meet the regulatory requirements as a matter of law,then we should hold that partial days of incapacity may sometimes meet those requirements,and leave it up to the jury to decide if they do in any particular case.if we agree with that,she says,we will have to conclude that the district court instruction that the period of incapacity necessary to satisfy the regulation is three consecutive calendar days,hours or more misled the jury into believing that partial days of incapacity can never satisfy the regulatory requirement.this decisional path,she says,will lead us to the conclusion that she is entitled to a new trial.
if all else fails,russell argues that the department of labor regulation is invalid,and that she should be granted judgment as a matter of law because she satisfied the unexplicated statutory definition of a serious health condition.we believe that all else does fail for russell,and that so does her fallback argument that the regulation is invalid.
the fmla provides that an eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of workweeks of leave during any period b ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d emphasis added.employees who take leave to which they are entitled under that provision must be reinstated to the position they held before the leave they can not be fired for taking the leave.id.a.
the fmla defines a serious health condition as an illness,injury,impairment,or physical or mental condition that involves a inpatient care in a hospital,hospice,or residential medical care facility or b continuing treatment by a health care provider.id.the first part of that definition is not relevant to this case because russell absences did not involve inpatient care.the second part of the serious health condition defi
